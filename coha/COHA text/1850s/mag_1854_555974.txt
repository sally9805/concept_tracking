Eighth Edition , with Corrections and Additions . London : Seeleys. 1851. l2mo. pp. 384. // problems of political economy , which are now discussed with the greatest interest in England , because upon the proper solution of them depend in a great degree the future commercial prosperity and general welfare of the English people . They are of considerable , though secondary , interest in this country ; for , owing to the intimate relations which now bind the two nations to each other , we can not remain unaffected longer than a fortnight  --  the time which is required for a steamer to cross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall in the public funds , every strike among the workmen , every great wave of emigration which leaves the shores of our mother land . Paraphrasing the line of the Latin poet , we can say , that we too are English by descent and by community of fortune , and that *nothing can be uninteresting to us which closely concerns the well-being of Englishmen . The actual condition and the probable futurity of the working classes in Great Britain- " the great social problem which has exercised so many minds in the present age , and is likely to give occupation to those of more than one succeeding generation " - form the subject of Mr. Morrison 's work . He writes upon it temperately , with good feeling and good taste ,  --  not hopefully , and yet not despairingly . He has no new facts to offer , and no new advice to give . His chief object seems to be , to reconcile the workingmen to their hard lot , by convincing them that the hardships of that lot are inevitable . He retails to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English school of political economy , of Ricardo , Malthus , and MeCulloch . He repeats the counsels which they have so often heard before ; -. that they must not become impatient and insubordinate , must not contract early marriages , must not organize strikes or combinations against their employers , must not frequent ale-houses or ginpalaces , must not be deluded by the pestiferous doctrines of the Communists and the Socialists , but must be industrious and provident , and must put all their savings , when they can make any , into the savings ' banks . Such advice is easy to give , but somewhat difficult to act upon . We can not flatter Mr. Morrison with the belief that it will do much to avert the evil which has excited his apprehensions . It will not alter the // fact , that the working classes to whom it is addressed , and who have been to a great extent soured and demoralized by misery , form a large majority of the nation , and that the democratic tendencies of the age are every day placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is easy to sit in one 's study and calmly preach to them the theorems of a science which professes to show that neither their employers nor Parliament are responsible for what they suffer , or capable of alleviating it if they would . They will be slow to understand , and still slower to be convinced . In a lighter tone , with more vivacity of style and more novelty of doctrine , Mr. Lalor considers the probable results of the great influx of gold from California and Australia , and the consequent inevitable depreciation of money . This is his principal theme ; but the discursive habit of mind and the dashing and superficial manner , that are formed by long connection with the newspaper press , have led him to intermingle with the discussion of it some remarks upon the multitude of topics , both of a domestic and foreign character , on which a British editor is led to form or follow the opinions of his particular circle of readers . Accordingly , we find in his work chapters on rural life and employments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural loans , national defences , and- " England among the nations . " All the matter contained in them is not so irrelevant to the main subject in hand as might be inferred from their titles . They all have something to do with the depreciation of money ; but they also contain a great deal of general disquisition , which might more pertinently find place in an essay on town and country life , the balance of power , or the morality of the people , than in a treatise of political economy . Mr. Lalor has looked into a good many books on economical science ; but his acquaintance with them is about as thorough as his knowledge of the theories of Comte and Hegel , which he discusses in a very summary and edifying manner . We think he fails to understand the leading conditions of the problem that he undertakes to investigate . The title-page of Mr. Byles 's volume informs us that it is written by a lawyer ,  --  a fact that might have been adequately // learned from internal evidence alone ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reasons about it , often correctly indeed , but too much in the manner of a special pleader . The success of his book , attested by the fact that it passed through eight editions in less than three years , is probably attributable to its partisan character . It is written to serve the interests and defend the doctrines of the Protectionists , or the landed proprietors of England ,  --  the party who have been so deeply aggrieved by the repeal of the Corn Laws . Because it is thought necessary to assail the general theorem of Free Trade in order to defend the Corn Laws , and because the English economists , almost without exception , have been zealous opponents of the Protective system , Mr. Byles feels constrained to attack the whole system of popular political economy . " And he conducts the assault after the most approved manner of a legal advocate ,  --  by taking up successively , and by isolation , thirty or forty leading principles or maxims of his opponents , and endeavoring to show that not one of them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which most of them are based ; that extreme cases may be stated in which hardly one will hold good ; that nations have prospered while disregarding or acting in direct opposition to most of them ; and that some of the propositions may be so construed as to appear meaningless or absurd . Now we agree with Mr. Byles in his general conclusion ; and are firm believers in the merits of a Protective system when judiciously devised and applied , though we certainly do not admit the justice or the expediency of heavily taxing the bread of the people of England . But we must confess that the kind of reasoning which he employs appears to us wholly sophistical and unsound . Out of the range of the exact , demonstrative sciences , it would disprove anything . Take any one of the moral sciences , - ethics , the science of government , or the philosophy of mind ; chop it up into fifty isolated propositions , some theoretical and some practical ; and proceed to try each after the manner of a special pleader , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stating extreme cases , and other similar devices . The ignorant might thus be led to scoff at the whole science ; // but the convictions of the philosopher would remain unshaken . Mr. Byles 's method is the very opposite of Mr. Morrison 's . The latter reasons from a few prominent conclusions of the economists , as if they were absolute , unlimited truths , from which there was no appeal , and held good , not only in the abstract and in the long run , but in every particular instance to which they could be applied . The former finds that these conclusions are not thus universally and necessarily true , and do not admit of application in every case ; and he therefore jumps to the conclusion that they are universally false , and rejects them altogether . Perhaps a brief examination of the nature of the science , and of the logic which is appropriate to the cultivation of it , may serve to reconcile , to some extent , these extreme opinions , and may also afford some fruitful conclusions respecting each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our list . Political Economy , then , is a science of human nature , just as much so as morality , civil polity , jurisprudence , or psychology . It relates , not indeed to the individual man , as ethical science does to a considerable extent , but to men collected in society , and acting and competing with each other in the pursuit of wealth . It is not a science merely of the production of wealth ; for if there were but one man in the world , though by the labor of his hands he might surround himself with the comforts , and even the luxuries , of life , and might thus be properly accounted wealthy , no such science as Political Economy would be conceivable . He would estimate the things around him in proportion to their absolute utility , or their fitness to satisfy his wants and desires ,  --  not in proportion to their value , as that term is considered by the economists . Value consists in the estimation of men , and is therefore , in great part , arbitrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Pitt diamond ; but the diamond is more valuable than many bushels *f grain , as it may be exchanged for many . Value is founded on exehangeableness , and therefore requires the existence of two or more persons . Political Economy is a generalization of the motives , habits , and dispositions of men , so far as these are manifested in the pursuit of wealth . We may accept , for the moment , a provisional definition by // Mr. Mill , and say that it is " the science relating to the moral or psychological laws of the production and distribution of wealth . " The moral or psychological laws , we say ; not the material or mechanical . The process by which crude iron ore is manufactured into table-cutlery , for instance , though it is a production of wealth , does not concern us here ; this is the business of the metallurgist , the smith , the artisan . The economist looks only to the estimate which men form of the comparative value of iron ore and finished cutlery , as manifested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for each other . The definition is further limited by remarking , that not all moral or psychological laws here require to be noticed , but only such as concern the creation and exchange of values . It is a law of human nature , for instance , that men prefer freedom to constraint , even when the latter is exercised with a beneficent purpose , and tends to promote the well-being of those who are under its influence . This is a fact to be considered in the science of government , not in that of Political ' Economy , except indeed it could be shown to have some bearing upon the production of wealth . It does not in itself form an argument for the freedom of trade , unless it were manifest that , in consequence of restriction , the energies of commerce would be paralyzed or the arm of labor unnerved . Now there are two views of human nature , both of which are prejudicial to the successful cultivation of this science . The one is the hypothesis of the necessarian or the fatalist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the accomplishment of particular ends , no matter how the result may be obscured by the interference or consentaneous action of other purposes . The mode of reasoning here is geometrical and deductive . The law is not discovered from the phenomena , but is first established by a priori reasoning , and then the phenomena must be analyzed , and tortured , and explained away , so as to conform to the expected results of the principle . This was the error of Mr. Ricardo and his followers , who have endeavored to raise Political Economy almost to the rank of an exact science . No matter how discordant the facts might appear with the theory . Their // whole ingenuity is shown , not in qualifying the principle , or limiting the application of it , but in laboring to bring the phenomena into conformity with it ; that is , in explaining them away . Thus it is assumed that men compete with one another in the pursuit of wealth , and that the effect of such competition is to bring prices , wages , and profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true universally , because it is taken for granted that competition is universal . But in fact , as Mr. Mill has well observed , competition is not a general regulator , for its effects are often modified and controlled by custom ,  --  either the customs of the place or the customs of the particular trade . The relations of landlord and tenant , and of domestic servants and their employers , in most countries of the Old World , scarcely ever feel the influence of competition , but are regulated by habit that has become prescription . Booksellers and publishers have a mutual understanding as to the prices of their commodities , and easily enforce their trade-rules against an intruding or dissentient member of the craft . " All professional remunerathfn , " says Mr. Mill , " is regulated by custom . The fees of physicians , surgeons , and barristers , the charges of attorneys , are nearly invariable . " Yet unlimited competition is the primary and most general assumption of the whole science ; it is to Political Economy what both the main-spring and hair-spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regulator . Just the opposite error is committed by reasoners like Mr. Byles , who are so impressed with a view of the complex and infinitely diversified aspect of human nature , even when limited to one occupation , the pursuit of wealth , that they are led to deny that it has any groundwork of uniformity , or any unity of plan . They scoff at general principles , and pretend only to try results and analyze facts . Post hoc , ergo propter hoc , is their favorite logical maxim . They reason like those sceptics in morals , who , on the ground of certain diversities in men 's moral judgments ,  --  because the Spartans taught their children to steal , and Indians expose their aged parents to die , and Hindoo mothers throw their infants into the Ganges , - not only deny that there is any moral nature in man , but attempt to resolve common honesty , filial piety , // and maternal love into fear and selfishness . The parallel , indeed , is a very close one . In morals as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human nature often modify , and still oftener obscure the working of the great general laws which direct the actions of men in the aggregate . But more or less modified , partially obscured or entirely hidden in its effects , the general law is still there , and in the long run will betray itself to common observation . The fee of the lawyer for his professional services may be determined by prescription ; but the gradual effect of competition upon the average earnings of members of the bar is still visible , and wiQ have a decisive influence upon the willingness of young men to enter the profession . Another illustration may be taken , which brings us home again to our main subject . One of the most noted and general maxims of Political Economy , and one which specially excites the ire of Mr. Byles and other unscientific advocates of a protective policy , is the laissez faire , or let-alone principle . Mr. Byles actually construes it to mean " let everything alone " do not legislate , do not labor , do not govern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of itself . So understood , he finds it very easy to overthrow the maxim . He points to the wonders accomplished by human industry , in rescuing Holland from the ocean , and irrigating Egypt from the Nile ; and to the fact that , without governments , and laws , and penal sanctions , neither liberty , nor property , nor life would be secure ; and then asks , scornfully , " What triumphs has the let-alone system to show since the world began ? " The Political Economist may well answer , that the fundamental and initiative principle of his science , that " all wealth is created by labor , " is enough to prove that Mr. Byles grossly misunderstands the maxim that he controverts . The rule is expressly directed against the officious interference of government with the fiscal concerns and indusfrial habits of society . Like other prudential maxims , it has its exceptions and limitations ; but it is more extensive in its scope , and more beneficent in its operation , than most others , and when rightly understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as IATell as in political economy . This truth may be // expressed in a slight paraphrase of the language of Holy Writ , that " God has appointed the wickedness of man to praise him , and the remainder of wrath he will restrain . " What may be called the economical laws of human nature , in their general effects upon the well-being of society , manifest the contrivance , wisdom , and beneficence of the Deity just as clearly as do the marvellous arrangements of the material universe , or the natural means provided for the enforcement of the moral law and the punishment of crime . The lowest and most corrupting passions of mankind , cupidity , avarice , and selfishness , while they bring their own penalty upon the individual who indulges them , are still overruled for good in their operation upon the interests of society ; - nay , they are made the most efficient means of guarding it from harm and advancing its welfare . Consider the manner in which the inhabitants of a great metropolis are supplied with food and all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each family receiving every day just what it wants , and as much as it wants , and being admonished through the price to limit or economize its consumption of any one article , whenever a failure in the harvest or other mode of supply , or even the prospect of such failure , renders such economy essential , - all this being accomplished without any general organization of a commissariat department , but through the uncombined efforts of thousands of dealers , each one of them regarding only his own good , and not the general good of the community , and each one acting , not in intentional concert with his fellows , but in open and often hostile rivalry with them ; - consider this , we say , and point to any social machine contrived by man , or to any beneficent device of human government , which performs so difficult a task at once so faithfully , so accurately , and so incessantly as this is performed by an agency which even the most sceptical mind must pronounce divine . This is but one instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creator and Governor of the world , which everywhere compels the cupidity and selfishness of individuals to contribute to the general good . In the vast round of employments in civilized society , there is not one in which a person can profitably exert himself , without at the same time profiting the // 511 community in which he lives , and lending aid to thousands of human beings whom he never sees . We are all servants of one another without wishing it , and even without knowing it ; we are all co-operating with one another as busily and effectively as the bees in a hive , and most of us with as little perception as the bees have of the fact , that each individual effort is essential to the common defence and general prosperity . It is the business of the political economist to study the operation of this delicate and divinely constituted machine ; and he soon finds , by a large induction of cases , that human governments can not interfere with it without doing more harm than good . When they attempt to limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass sumptuary laws , to keep specie in the country , to sanction monopolies or grant privileges to guilds of trade , discouragement , impediments to industry , and paralysis of trade are sure to follow . Laissez faire ; let these things alone . Limit your endeavors , at any rate , to a removal of those impediments which accident , prescription , the rivalry of other governments , or peculiar physical disadvantages , have thrown in the way of that general freedom of commercial and industrial enterprise which seems to be a law of the moral universe . Political considerations or government necessities may create an interference in one quarter which needs to be balanced by some action in another . The necessary exceptions to the maxim will be found , when carefully examined , to confirm its spirit and principle . All duties on imports , and even all internal taxes , are a departure from the rule , but a necessary departure , for the sake of a greater good , - the support of the institutions of government . When the number and amount of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct some of them with a primary view , not to revenue , but to protection , in order to counterbalance a burden which the others have laid upon domestic industry . In such a case , the object would evidently be , not to destroy , but to restore , the equilibrium of the original system of nature and Providence . As Protectionists , then , we find no reason to controvert , as Mr. Byles does , the laissez:faire maxim ; and our interpreta // tion of it does not admit a larger measure of government inte*fereuce than is avowedly sanctioned by some of the most strenuous advocates of universal Free Trade . We have neither space nor inclination at present to enter at large into the argument in favor of nursing the infant manufactures of this country by a system of discriminating duties . The question , indeed , is gradually losing its importance , through the force of circumstances that we may notice hereafter . And were it otherwise , we should have little to add to the general reasoning upon this subject which has been stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening at home a sphere for the exercise of all kinds of talent and ingenuity , is at least as evident as the good policy of developing all the natural resources of the country . It is as wasteful , to say the least , to allow mechanical skill and inventive genius to remain unemployed , as it would be to permit water-power to run without turning mills , or mineral wealth to continue in the ore , or forests to wave where cotton and grain might grow luxuriously . If the rude tasks of agriculture are to form the principal employment of our people , the higher remuneration of skilled labor in the arts must be sacrificed ; and this would be as bad economy as to turn our richest soils into sheeppastures , or to feed cattle upon the finest wheat . If education and the arts , and all the higher means of refinement and civilization , can flourish and abound only in cities and large towns , which are at the same time the great agents and tokens of the increase of national opulence , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory in the isolated pursuits of agriculture , the great majority of them being doomed to work which would not tax the mental resources of a Russian serf or a Fejee-Islander , must be fatal not only to the growth of wealth , but to many of the higher interests of humanity . The hardships and privations of a life in the backwoods are a fearful drawback upon that bounty which confers as a free gift a homestead farm with a soil that reproduces the seed a hundred-fold . Turning to the more strictly commercial aspect of the question , it has been shown , by the admission of the leading English economists themselves , that every increase in our imports obliges us to sell our exports at // a lower price in the foreign market , so that it is for the interest of the agriculturists themselves to pay somewhat more for domestic goods , instead of purchasing similar goods abroad , as by so doing they receive more for the flour , cotton , and tobacco which are sent out of the country . As commodities must ultimately be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but cotton to England , and received nothing but linen in return , then , the fewer yards of linen we called for , the higher price we should obtain for the cotton which must be its equivalent . At present , we receive so much merchandise from Europe , that we are obliged to offer in exchange our own commodities at the lowest possible price , in order to enable and induce foreigners to take enough of them to balance our enormous imports . This is but a brief summary of the arguments which we have offered on former occasions to justify a Protective system ; and so far as can be seen , they are in perfect accordance with the strictest principles of Political Economy , even a that science is expounded by English writers . We will make but one addition to them at present , and this chiefly for the purpose of illustrating the general remark with which we began , that the data of this science are principles of human nature , which are of various degrees of generality ; and in reasoning even from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be made whether their application be not modified in any particular case by some other principle , less obvious indeed , but still a fact in human nature , and one which must be taken into view if the results are to be correctly anticipated . Certainly it is a general truth , as safe to reason from as any other , that " men fear death , as children fear to go in the dark " ; and yet it is so far from being universally true , as Lord Bacon remarks , " that there is no passion in the mind of man so weak , but it sometimes mates and masters the fear of death . " Jliori velle , non tanti*m fortis , ctut miser , sed etianm fastidiosus potest . It is safe to assume generally , that low prices , so far as they arise from lessening the cost of production , are an advantage both to consumers and producers ; to the former , as it enables them to obtain commodities at less expense and in greater 44* // abundance ; to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diminished price of each article . The general effect of cheapening commodities is to bring them within the reach of a larger circle of consumers , and thus to satisfy the wants and contribute to the comfort of a greater number of families . Buy in the cheapest markets , then , say the Free-Traders ; and whatever saving is in this way effected will be a positive addition to the wealth of the community . No one can doubt that this reasoning , in general , is correct ; but a very important exception must be considered , depending on the fact that , through the rivalry of individuals in the display of wealth , some articles are prized only on account of their high cost . Cheapen them , and no advantage will follow ; for the consumption of them will then be abandoned by this class of persons , who will immediately seek out other and more costly articles , with which to gratify their love of ostentation . If equally serviceable articles , of intrinsically higher cost , can not easily be found , the aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , to create a factitious enhanceinent of the price of certain commodities . When cheap , these commodities were neglected ; when they have become scarce and high in price , so that the possession of them is a token at once of taste and of wealth , they are eagerly sought after , and persons even of moderate means will submit to considerable sacrifices in order to obtain them . But such conduct evinces weakness and folly , it will be said . No matter ; as nearly all who are not steeped in poverty to the lips are silly enough to act in this manner , we must accept the facts as depending on an ineradicable principle in human nature , and frame our theories accordingly . The rage for old-fashioned furniture which prevailed a few years ago , and caused enormous prices to be given for straight-backed chairs , claw-footed tables , and quaint old sets of drawers , which had been condemned as useless lumber a century ago , is but one instance out of a thousand that illustrate this folly . We are old enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing example of the strength and universality of this feeling . More than a quarter of a century ago , a new kind of material was introduced for ladies ' bonnets . In fact it was // only stamped pasteboard , but it bore the appearance of braided straw of exquisite fineness and whiteness . A shape or model for the bonnet being selected , which was as novel and becoming as the material was light and tasteful , and , to crown all , a name being chosen which was then as popular as that of Kossuth has been since , the new style became all the rage , as the Lafayette hat . Enormous prices were paid for them by some who had pretty faces to put under them , and by some who had not . The fashion was thus confined to a very few , and only here and there a growling economist was heard to lament that the bonnets were not so cheap as they were convenient and tasteful . But the cost of the material being in fact very small , the competition of sellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , one for which thirty dollars had been demanded could be had for two or three dollars . The next year , the price fell to fifty cents , and none were worn except by Irish servants , all of whom abandoned the fashion , however , before the end of the season , as being too cheap and vulgar ; and we have not seen a Lafayette hat since . Obviously , then , there is no advantage in cheapening luxuries , or diminishing the cost of articles which are used only for purposes of ostentation and display . They are sought after only because they are expensive . Render them very cheap , and they will go out of use altogether . If pearls were as common as oysters , pearl bracelets and brooches would never be manufaQtured . If the fall in price be less considerable than this , the only effect will be to extend the consumption of articles of luxury , and consequently to cause a greater amount of labor to be devoted to the production of them , and a less amount of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high in price that fine cottons content the love of display , the additional amount of labor required for the production of silks is saved . A higher-priced cotton gratifies the spirit of ostentation , - of rivalry , - of showing one 's self as well off as one 's neighbors , - just as effectually as a cheap silk . In fact , then , taxes upon this class of luxuries cost the community nothing ' ; they form an absolute saving . Even if the finest American cottons were fifty per cent . dearer than // English goods of the same quality , a duty of fifty per cent . on the imported commodity would be no tax upon the consumer . With the duty , he would buy the American or the English article at * 1.50 a yard , and it would answer all his purposes , - would fully gratify his love of ostentation . Without the duty , despising the cheaper article , he would purchase an English or French silk at $ 1.50 a yard , and would be no better off than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole proceeds of the duty , the American manufacturer would be bankrupted , and American workmen thrown out of employment , and compelled to turn agriculturists , so as , by their competition , to reduce the price ( already too low ) of the grain and butchers ' meat which we send abroad . Here , then , is an exception to a rule presumed to be universal by most economists , that in making purchases of goods , other things being equal , consumers have regard only to lowness of price , and will always buy what they can buy cheapest . If the pursuit of wealth , or , what is the same thing , the desire to make savings , were always the ruling motive , the principle would hold . But it is not so ; in many instances , the ruling motive is , notoriously , not the love of gain , but the love of display ; and whenever this is the case , the only strong argument against a protective tariff , that it temporarily enhances the prices of commodities , ceases to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few nor unimportant in which the rule is thus inverted . Most of the finer manufactures of cotton , wool , and silk , nearly all the fancy articles which become objects of desire because they are fashionable , fine cutlery , and expensive pieces of furniture , belong to this class ; and these are the very commodities which , in our country , most iieed the aid of a protective tariff . We are no advocates of sumptuary laws ; but , taxation itself being essential to the support of government , such an apportionment of the indirect taxes among various commodities as will discourage idle , wasteful , and luxurious consumption , is clearly expedient and just . The aggregate amount expended all over the country for any article of luxury is increased by diminution of its price , and lessened by augmentation of that price . Double the number of diamonds , the // price would fall one half , and people would purchase more than twice as many of them . There would then be no real saving to the community , but a positive loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be increased by the whole amount bought by those who should be more than enough to make up twice the former number of purchasers . On the other hand , double the price , and there would be less than half the former iiumber of purchasers , and consequently a real saving to the community . If , then , we make the more costly manufactures for ourselves , instead of obtaining them from abroad , their price will be somewhat enhanced , there will be a smaller aggregate expenditure upon them , the purposes of luxury and ostentation will be equally well answered , and the prices SoJ ) tained in foreign markets for our exports will be increased by the diminution of our imports , and to the full extent of that diminution . Silks , very fine cottons and woollens , expensive cutlery , articles of virtu and b*jouterie , and the like , are necessarily consumed unproductively ; we gain nothing , we even lose , by cheapening them . If the wages of labor can be kept up by raising the prices of such articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far from controverting the scientific principles of Political Economy in order to find arguments for Protection , we are but carrying out to their legitimate consequences certain admissions which are made by the most distinguished advocates of Free Trade . Witness the following brief extracts from the elaborate work of Mr. J. S. Mill . " When a thing is bought , not for its use , but for its costliness , cheapness is no recommendation . As Sismondi remarks , the consequence of cheapening articles of vanity is , not that less is expended on such things , but that the buyers substitute for the cheapened article some other which is more costly , or a more elaborate quality of the same thing ; and as the inferior quality answered the purpose of vanity equally well when it was equally expensive , a tax on the article would really be paid by nobody ; it would be a creation of public revenue , by which nobody would lose . " - Mill 's PoUtical Economy , Vol . II . p. 442 . " In what manner the finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most advantageously be taxed , I must leave to be decided by those who have the requisite practical knowledge . The difficulty // would be , to effect it without an inadmissible degree of interference with production . In countries which , like the United States , import the principal part of the finer manufactures which they consume , there is little difficulty in the matter ; and even where nothing is imported but the raw material , that may be taxed , especially the qualities of it which are exclusively employed for the fabrics used by the richer class of consumers . Thus , in England , a high custom duty on raw silk would be consistent with principle ; and it might perhaps be practicable to tax the finer qualities of cotton or linen yarn , whether spun in the country itself or imported . " - Ibid. p. 446 . Abstract deductions from assumed principles , in the moral sciences , need to be verified by frequent reference to facts , or the conclusions will be wholly untrustworthy . It is the peculiar vice of the dogffiatic school of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the principles on which their reasoning is based , and in the correctness of the reaso*ning itself , that they have assumed the facts to be in accordance with the theory , and have thus spared themselves the labor of examination and analysis . Mr. MeCulloch 's theory of the effects of absenteeism is a sfriking instance of boldness in rejecting the results of experience , on the ground that they could not be reconciled with the results of reasoning , which he deemed to be demonstrative . The advocates of Free Trade as an abstract doctrine have invented facts to correspond with their principles ; and the most satisfactory portion of Mr. Byles 's work is that in which he exposes the unfounded character of their assumptions . But in relation at least to England and this country , the question between Protection and Free Trade , as we have intimated , is rapidly losing its interest . The problem is working out itself , in connection with the other and darker problem respecting the social condition of the English and Irish people , - working out itself under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when human wisdom is entirely at fault , so often unexpectedly educe good from evil , as if to confound the folly and short-sightedness of man . The discovery of immense deposits of gold in California and Australia , the consequent impulse given to emigration from the British isles , following so quickly upon the antece // dent impulse produced by the fish famine of 1847 , the great drain of the laboring classes from England and Ireland , the unparalleled accession to these classes in the United States , and the consequent equalization of wages between the two countries , which is , or must soon be , the result of these events , - these are causes which evidently tend to relieve the pressure of population upon the means of subsistence , in the one case , and to enable the manufacturers , through the diminution of wages , to do without Protection , in the other , in a manner and to an extent which the English economists have hardly dreamed of . There is something in the rapidity with which these events have taken place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove great social evils which had become irremediable by man , - something which evinces the direct agency of an infinitely wise and benevolent Governor of the universe so plainly as to force conviction even upon unthinking and sceptical minds . The laboring classes of the English and Irish people , whose pitiable condition has been the object of so much sterile theorizing , though most writers upon it had come to the sad conclusion that it was hopeless , now actually appear to be dictating their own terms to their employers . It matters little that , in some of their combinations and strikes for this purpose , they have for the moment been unsuccessfnl . Emigration has already produced so much effect in thinning the once crowded labormarket , that their wages are steadily rising without any concerted action on their part , and the strife may terminate in a nominal victory of the capitalists , while , before many months elapse , the object of the contest on the part of the operatives may be quietly conceded to them . If Mr. Morrison intended to speculate only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if he meant to dissuade the working classes from using all the means which Providence has placed in their hands for improving their own condition , its effect will be nugatory . During the last five years ( 1849- 1853 ) the emigration from the United Kingdom has exceeded 1,600,000 , or an average of 320,000 a year . The excess of births over deaths in England and Wales , in 1852 , was 216,233 ; adding // a large estimate for the corresponding excess in Scotland and Ireland , the total does not rise above 280,000 . It appears , then , that the population of Great Britain and Ireland is not merely stationary ; it has actually been retrograding for the last five years , at the rate of 40,000 a year . In the year of largest emigration , 1852 , the loss by death and emigration exceeded the births by more than 100,000 . And this is not the whole story ; the emigrating class is composed for the most part of the young and of those in the prime of life , - the healthiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the increase of numbers chiefly depends . Females , the old and infirm , and children , are most apt to stay at home . It might be supposed that the emigration would gradually be lessened , as the fever of excitement attending the discovery of the gold-bearing regions is diminished , and the condition of the people at home is ameliorated by the departure of their kindred and their competitors for employment . Some effect in this way will doubtless be produced ; but a strong counteracting cause is found to operate . So many of English and Irish birth are now established in the United States and the British Colonies , that the ties of kindred and affection , and the report of the success of the exiles in obtaining high wages and amassing property , induce many others to join them , who , without such additional motives , would be disposed to remain in the land of their birth . More than all , the large remittances made by the prosperous emigrants , amounting in one year to five millions of dollars , to assist the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose poverty would otherwise keep them at home . It seems hardly too much to anticipate , therefore , that the census of 1861 will show the population of the United Kingdom to be less than it was ten years before . We say nothing of temporary , and what may be deemed accidental causes ; though the present expensive , and thus far not remarkably successful war , through the loss of life by the hardships and diseases of the camp , if not on the battle-field , and through the stoppage of some branches of trade which it occasions , must be no inconsiderable check upon the increase of population . // Wages depend , as Mr. Morrison and his teachers are fond of remarking , upon the ratio of population to capital and employment . They must rise , then , as the numbers of the people diminish , though trade and manufactures should only , to use an expressive phrase , " hold their own " ; and they must rise still more rapidly , if , at the same time , trade and manufactures should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever . The influx of gold , together with the depreciation of money which it causes , operates in a twofold manner to improve the condition of the working classes in England . It lessens their number by the inducement to emigration which it holds out , and , by stimulating all forms of industry and enterprise , it quickens the demand for labor , and causes wages to rise even in a higher ratio than the prices of commodities . We remarked on a former occasion , that it was the depreciation of the currency , produced by the Bank of England suspending specie payments , which carried Great Britain triumphantly through the wars of the French Revolution , - " which enhanced rents and profits , gave unprecedented activity to manufactures and commerce , kept the laboring population employed , and therefore quiet , enabled the government to raise enormous loans without difficulty , and made the people bear , with ease and cheerfulness , an amount of taxation which they can now hardly contemplate without shuddering . " The depreciation of the currency caused by the discoveries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vastly larger scale . To take but one instance out of a thousand , look at the present state of the iron trade both in England and this country . The prices of crude and manufactured iron have more than doubled during the last two or three years , owing to the enlarged demand for the article and the increased wages of the workmen . In spite of many drawbacks , caused by the fever of speculation which such prosperity induces , commerce and manufactures , generally , and all the world over , were never more flourishing than at the present time . These marvellous changes have already modified to a considerable extent the opinions of the English doctors of Politi // cal Economy . In the first edition ( 1848 ) of his great work , Mr. J. S. Mill remarks : " To the case of Ireland , in her present crisis of transition , colonization , as the exclusive remedy , is , I conceive , unsuitable ; the Irish are nearly the worst adapted people in Europe for settlers in the wilderness . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanwhile emigrated to an extent unparalleled in history , and the miseries of their native land having been proportion ably diminished , this remark , with all the reasons adduced in its support , is quietly omitted . The disciples of Malthus , also , have had an opportunity to review their favorite doctrine , that the increase of the laboring population is the greatest evil which England has to dread . It is the decrease of that population which now excites their fears ; the apprehension was openly expressed two years ago , " that we shall soon feel the need - if the need is not felt already - of those artisans and laborers whom we are using unnecessary efforts to send from our shores . " The London Times comforts the capitalists , however , by the assurance , that , " in case of need for labor , whether agricultural or manufacturing , here , we may count on ready supplies from Denmark , Belgium , Germany , and Normandy . " Emigration from the Continent into England ! Even the Quarterly Review exclaims , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase of the wages of English operatives , and in the consequent enhancement of the prices of English commodities , American manufacturers have found that protection which they have so long asked in vain from their own government . Not only the iron trade , the ruinous depression of which , under the tariff of 1846 , we chronicled less than two years ago , is now more extensive and flourishing than ever . Other manufactures are recovering from a similar state of prostration , and are even competing with British goods in foreign markets , thus showing that the cost of production is at last finding a level between the two countries , owing to the equalization of wages in them . True , wages have not absolutely fallen with us , the depreciation of the currency and the great extension of commercial enterprise having caused them nominally to advance . But their rise has been by no // means so sudden or so marked as in England . Ship-loads of trained operatives are now imported every month from Liverpool and Glasgow , the agents of our manufacturers being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove to America. * A vague impression already exists among the working classes in this country , that their condition , if not absolutely deteriorating , is by no means so prosperous as it would be but for the prodigious influx of foreign laborers . Hence the attempts to resuscitate the " Native American party " by a secret organization , ostensibly directed towards a change of the naturalization laws and ag*dnst the influence of the Pope . We fear nothing from the political or sectarian machinations of these immigrants ; and did no other danger threaten us from this source , a great combination , now extending to every corner of the land , would never have been organized against them . But their coming directly tends to lessen the gains of our operatives , and must eventually establish the same standard of wages on both sides of the Atlantic . Those who would be injuriously affected by this result should seek to avert it , not by attempting to exclude foreigners from political office , or by raising an outcry against them as adherents of an idolatrous church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of fostering native industry by laying high duties on foreign importations . Mr. Lalor apprehends that the effect of the augmentation of gold and the depreciation of the currency will not be beneficial , as we have hitherto supposed , but that it presents " an interminable vista of confusion , uncertainty , and suffering , " which threaten the security of the whole social fabric . These evils he considers as the necessary consequence of a vast extension of the " money-capital " of England , which is already redundant in amount , and any large increase of which , he thinks , must lead to the wildest and most disas * We copy the following from the Boston Daily Advertiser of August 15 , 1854 , as an indication of the extent to which this business of importing trained operatives is now carried on : - " NOTICE TO MAN1JFACTTJIIERS. - The undersigned will contract to bring factory operatives from Glasgow and Manchester , by their Liverpool packets , to Boston . " ENodil TRAIN &amp; Co. , 37 and 38 Lewis Wharf . " // Oct. trous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that the error of the reasoning which leads to them can easily be exposed . What Mr. Lalor calls " money-capital " is not gold and silver coin and bullion exclusively , nor even the whole currency , specie and paper , of which such coin is only the basis ; but it is the vastly larger amount of floating capital which supplies the loan-market , seeking investment . It is the aggregate " purchasing power " of the community , which forms the basis of all commercial and industrial calculations , and immensely exceeds the aggregate of coin and bank-bills , because the same specific sum of coin , or bank-bills , or both , may be used to effect half a dozen payments in the same day ; and the purchases made on credit , in any one day , may as much exceed the aggregate of payments on that day , as the total payments exceed the specific coin or bills with which they are effected . The magic power of credit swells " the purchasing power " of any highly commercial community to an incalculable ex#ent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property in a material shape , parts with it for the purpose , not of consumption , but of investment , he receives in exchange " a purchasing power , " which he can reserve , and exercise at any future time at his own discretion . He deposits this sum for a time in a bank , where it will be available to him , at any time , as a bank credit . Many persons having such credits , payments may at any time be effected by a mere transfer of them on the bank-books . The bank , finding an average of such credits always remaining with it , can lend out the specie and bank-bills which were the original founda-. tion of them , and still pay any of its depositors who call for payment , from the fresh sums brought in by other depositors , or by an entry on its books . The bank can even go further ; it can lend a certain amount of its own bills to a merchant who has made no deposit with it , trusting that such loan will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back upon the bank for payment . The merchant receiving such a loan can employ a portion of it in making payments , and allow the remaining portion to lie on deposit in the bank ; and on the strength of these deposits - wholly // fictitious in character , be it observed - the bank may proceed to make fresh loans . Thus , on a very narrow basis , rises , story above story , a tall fabric of credit , till its top pierces the clouds . The security of the structure is in inverse proportion to its height . If public confidence be shaken , a general desire to realize property , as it is termed , or to convert mere evidences of debt into coin or other actual possessions , ensues , and then a failure of the architecture in any part causes the whole edifice to topple into ruin . In a highly prosperous commercial community , like the English , the savings from income which form yearly accessions to capital are already excessive . They are estimated by some writers as high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of such savings are made by persons not in active business , who , having no employment of their own for such additional capital , wish only to invest it , or to lend it to others . Thus the loan-market becomes overstocked , the rate of interest falls , and rather than accept as little as two per cent . in safe investments , lenders are tempted by the offer of higher rates to expose the4 capital to great risks . Thus comes on a period of expansion and of all sorts of wild speculation , sure to be followed by failures , loss of confidence , and general agitation and distress . The state of trade , says Lord Overstone ( formerly Mr. Jones Loyd ) , " revolves apparently in an established cycle . First we find it in a state of quiescence - next improvement - growing confidence - prosperity - excitement - over-trading - convulsion - pressure - stagnation-distress- ending again in quiescence . " Mr. Lalor augurs evil from the present immense influx of gold , because , he argues , " only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drawn into the currency , " and the remainder will be new money-capital , thus enlarging the stock of it , which is already too great , and augmenting tenfold the tendency to rash speculations , and the consequent liability to reaction , commercial convulsions , and distress . The remedy which he proposes is , that government should increase the weight of taxation , so as to lessen the power of making savings from income , and should employ the surplus thus brought into the public treasury in making permanent loans to 45* // encourage agriculture , colonization , and emigration , - such loans having an effect to convert capital into income , while the new gold tends only to augment capital . In other words , he would thus change floating into fixed capital , it being the augmentation of the former only which increases the fever of speculation and menaces commerce with a constant succession of convulsions and disasters . Even if we agreed with Mr. Lalor as to the nature of the evil to be apprehended , we should hesitate about adopting as remedies a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public funds into long loans to individuals . But the evil of a too rapid growth of capital , and the government coming in to dissipate it , by lending it to persons who will employ it in the drainage of land , or in ferrying away additional ship-loads of emigrants from the English shores , are alike chimerical . The new gold would form but an insignificant accession , at any rate , to the money-capital of England . The yearly savings from income in that country , as has been mentioned , have been estimated at fifty millions sterling ; the new gold amounts only to twenty or thirty millions a year , which is to be distributed over the whole world , England receiving only her proportional share of it . Moreover , as habits of luxury and expense increase with every accession to capital , it would be only the savings from this fractional part of tweAty-five millions a year which would form a permanent addition to capital . But further , we directly deny Mr. Lalor 's fundamental proposition , that only a small fractional part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except an insignificant portion retained for consumption in the form of trinkets , plate , and other manufactures of gold , the whole will go into the currency , not being available in any other way . Practically , we know that nine tenths either goes to the mint as soon as it is washed out of the earth , or is cast into stamped bars which perform all the purposes of coin . And this addition to the currency being only a nominal addition , - two millions of dollars , for instance , performing just the same functions that one million did before ,  --  the increase of the actual wealth , or capital , of the whole world must be very trifling . The addition being nominal , moreover , its great // extent forms no cause for apprehension . True , the increase of gold , affecting the specie basis on which all monetary systems rest , will affect successively , and in the same ratio , bank-bills , bank-credits , bills of exchange , and all other substitutes for money , which form the successive strata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented in larger denominations of money ; men will talk of millions , where they now talk of thousands ; and this change of phraseology , except for the holders of obligations to pay which have a long time to mature , will be the whole extent of the evil . Mr. Lalor seems to think that there may be such a thing as the depreciation of capital , apart from the depreciation of money , and proceeding from " a general glut " of production , and consequently of wealth . He thus evinces a general confusion of ideas upon the subject , which he can unravel only by analyzing his notion of wealth , and seeing whether it is possible that there should be too much of it in the community . But we must break off the discussion of a subject which would as easily transcend the limits of a volume as of an article . Though we have spoken freely of the errors of the three works under review , we can safely commend all of them , as written with ability and in a good spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great questions which , at the present day , much exceed in importance and interest all other problems in economical science .
