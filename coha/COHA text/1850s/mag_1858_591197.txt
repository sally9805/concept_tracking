txt DEMOCRACY CONSERVATIVE-THE CONSTITUTION OF NEW YORK . THE recent vote , adverse to a change in the Constitution of I the State of New York , is indicative of a growing conservatism among the people , well calculated to inspire hope in the minds of the true friends of republican institutions in the stability and permanence of this system of government , and affords additional evidence of its advantages , in every point of view , over every other system , either ancient or modern . Only twelve years have elapsed since the adoption of the present Constitution , which , if not the most perfect in detail , is the most democratic and liberal in principle of any other within the United States . The public discussion that led to the calling of the Convention of 1846 , which framed the present Constitution , exposed a degree of profligacy and extravagance in the management of financial affairs in this State , Which had brought it to the verge of bankruptcy , and so closely and strongly were the interests of corporate monopolies and individual speculation leagued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost beyond the reach of legislation . It is true that the reckless and extravagant policy of the opposition received a check in the democratic legislation of // 1842 , in what was popularly known as the " stop and pay policy " of ' that year . At this period the opposition had augmented the public debt in that degree , and reduced the State credit so low , that the State bonds , if negotiable at all , could only be disposed of at a ruinous depreciation . The few loans that were obtained were at the rate of ' about thirty per cent . below par . This condition of the public finances was attributable chiefly to an extravagant and inj udicious application of State funds in constructing canals , and to a corrupt practice of first loaning the credit of the State to railroad companies , and afterwards paying the debts of said companies , for which the State had become surety , either by funds from the public treasury , or by issuing State scrip , redeemable at a given period . Under this unwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Erie-defrauded the State of seven millions of dollars . Although the money from the State coffers was poured out as freely as the waters of Lake Erie flowed into the canal bearing its name , the interests of the industrial classes , and the public improvements of the State , especially the railroads and canals , languished , and in many instances were really in a state of retrogression and decay . Immense sums of money were annually collected from the people , under promise of improvement in its use , by applying it to the legitimate purposes of the State , and under the more attractive yet delusive assurance that the magnificent canal system of New York was to reap the benefit of these enorinous drafts upon the capital and labor of ' the people , whose expectations were not realized by a fulfilment of the repeated promises of those having the management of public affairs , that the credit of the State should be red7eerned and taxes diminished . Finding no advantages accruing to them at all commensurate with the vast sums of money collected , the citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who inaugurated a new financial policy that at once redeemed the credit of the State , and i navery brief period placed it** bonds above par . As the result of this policy , the enlargement of the Erie // Canal was recommenced with vigor , and the improvement and completion of the lateral canals prosecuted in a careful and economical manner . The railroad companies finding that no farther reliance could be placed upon the loan of State credit , or donations of money from the State treasury , discontinued the lobby system , the means employed to secure appropriations of money and credit , which had brought reproach to the Halls of Legislation , and turned their attention to private capital , which never fails to stimulate and carry forward successfully all judicious enterprises . No longer mendicants at the capital of the State , railroad officers occupied their time in the practical business incident to their ' position , as directors of this class of internal improvements , which , from the hour that all hope of support from the State ceased , revived and progressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American continent . The salutary and healthful influence of one legitimate and honest legislative session upon the various interests of the State , after the practice of a false policy for years , operated no less to the advantage than to the astonishment of all classes . Not only did the canal and railroad interests revive , but commerce , agriculture , and the mechanic arts received an impetus that placed all these departments of industry in the most prosperous condition . Apprehensive that this condition of affairs might be changed by the united efforts of parties interested in the use of State credit and State funds , at a time when the public mind was directed to matters of exciting political interest , the people demanded a Convention to form a new Constitution , that should perpetuate this policy . The Constitution it was proposed to supersede was adopted in 1821 , and amended by a popular vote in 1&amp;2G , and was more liberal in many of its features than the one adopted at Kingston on the 20th of April , 1777 , in the midst of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when the minds of the members of the Convention were in a great degree absorbed by other matters of // 479 momentous importance , and concentrated upon the common interests of all the American colonies . Although not quite in conformity with the present standard of State Constitutions in some respects , the organic law of 177T established a basis upon which all States might securely rest in the formation of their respective Constitutions . The announcement by that Colonial or Territorial Convention , " That no authority shall , on any pretence whatever , be exercised over the people or members of this State , but such as shall be derivedfrom and granted by them&lt; ' gave assurance , even at that early day , of the ultimate triumph and successful application of the principle of popular sovereignty which has lately been ingrafted on our fundamental law , and received by the people of the United States . Having said thus much in commendation of the first Constitution of New York , let us come directly to the consideration of that of 1846 , in our opinion more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any that preceded it . As already intimated , the leading object for convening the Convention that framed this Constitution is traceable to the determination of the people to check , by constitutional enactment , the persistent efforts of interested parties to augment the State debt and increase the taxes , which had become extremely burthensome to all classes ; and as the extent to which these burthens could be carried was , under the amended Constitution of 1821 , solely dependent on the caprice of a Legislature subject to change , in one of its branches , every year , and in the other every four years , it was deemed necessary to place a more permanent safeguard against unreasonable expenditures than could be expected from the preliminary enactments of the Democratic body of 1842 . It is proper here to remark , that other matters , scarcely secondary in importance to the financial question , presented themselves to public attention , as the discussion of the policy of a new Constitution progressed . The Democratic party inaugurated the muovement resulting in the call of the Constitutional Convention of 1846 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was sustained by many of the more liberal members of the opposition . The preliminary act , recommending a Convention , was passed May 13th , 1845 ; and in the November election of that year , the proposition of the Legislature was ratified by a very large popular majority of the votes of the state . The delegates to the Convention were elected on the last Tuesday of April , 1846 , and they assembled at the Capitol in Albany , on the first Monday of June following . The Convention , consisting of one hundred and twenty-eight members , was in session over four months concluding its deliberations on the 9th day of October , when the present Constitution , the product of that Convention , was ordered to be submitted to the people by a vote of one hundred and four Ayes to six Nays ; and it was ratified at the eusning November election by a large majority . No more able , patriotic , or disinterested body of men ever assembled for the tr.ansaction of public business . Although in a party sense the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention were free from all partisan considerations , and its members , with scarcely an exception , were governed by a sincere purpose to promote the best interests of the whole State . The diversified interests of every section , and of all classes , were presented and considered in a spirit of unimpassioned , comprehensive truthfulness becoming the deliberations of an assembly intrusted with the most solemn and important duties incident to the establishment of organic law , which is necessarily , in a great measure , to shape the future character of a large and powerful state . No personal considerations were permitted to weigh against the interests of the commonwealth . When an office , * however lucrative to the incnmbent , or an office of the greatest political influence , was regarded as standing in the way of reform , they were required to yield to the common good . While the canal and railroad improvements , the banking and commei'eial interests , with all other interests of * Many offices were abolished , and as a consequence officers removed or deposed , nearly all of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a disinterestedness of purpose and with an unflinehing determination to dispose of them on principles of liberality and fairness the individual rights of the people , and their corporate franchises were not forgotten or neglected , but on the contrary , watched with the most anxious solicitude , and designed to be securely protected against encroachment of every character and from every quarter . Perhaps no better exposition can be given of what the Convention did accomplish in behalf of the people , with whose interests it was intrusted , than by quoting a portion of its official address , published on submitting the Constitution to the citizens of New York . It says They have reorganized the Legislature ; established more limited districts for the election of the members of that body , and wholly separated it from the exercise of judicial power ; the most important State officers liave been made elective by the people of the State ; and most of the officers of cities , towns , and counties are made elective by the voters of the locality they serve ; they have abolished a host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red ace and decentralize the patronage of the executive government ; they have rendered inviolate the funds devoted to education . After repeated failures in the Legislature , they have provided a judicial system , adequate to the wants of a free people , rapidly increasing in arts , culture , commerce , and population . They have made provision for the payment of the whole State debt , and the completion of the public works begun . While that debt is in the progress of payment , they have provided a large contribution from the canal revennes towards , the current expenses of the State , and sufficient for that purpose when the State debt shall have been paid ; and have placed strong safeguards against the recurrence of debt and the improvident expenditure of the public money . They have agreed on important provisions in relation to the mode of creating incorporations , and the liability of their members , and have sought to render the business of banking more safe and responsible . They have incorporated many // useful provisions more effectually to secure the people in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . They have modified the power of the Legislature , with the direct consent of the people , to amend the Constitution from time to time , and have secured to the people of the State the right once in twenty years to pass directly on the question whether they will call a Convention for the revision of the Constitution . " How far the Convention succeeded in consummating the particular purposes of its creation could best be determined , under ordinary circumstances , by the influence and effects of its action upon the prosperity of the State , in the development of its internal resources , the contentment of the people , ' and in the protection of their individual rights and corporate franchises . This would have been a very just criterion by which to adjudge the wisdom of the Constitution of 1846 , had all the provisions of that Constitution been allowed to go into effect , but unfortunately they were not . The government was progressing tranquilly under it . The credit of the State was redeemed , the enlargement of the canals and the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were content and prosperous , when , taking advantage of the general political calm , partizan conspirators and insidious speculators excited such a popular clamor in favor of " a more speedy enlargement of the canals , " that party organizations yielded to the demand , and the people , by a small reluctant vote , consented to open the financial provisions of the Constitution before its salutary and beneficial effects had been fully realized . The IRepublican party , then in control of the State government , assumed the responsibility of making the nine million loan , authorized by this amendment to the Constitution , and which was to be applied to the enlargement and completion of the canals . Not more than one half of this large draft of nine millions of dollars upon the finances of the State , made ostensibly for the use of the canals , is found to have been appropriated to that end , or to any other purpose in which the State was interested or benefited . In this manner the primary and most important // feature of the Constitution of 1846 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by this means the state treasury wa* again brought to bankruptcy . Had any benefit at all commensurate with the value of the investment , or with the sacrifice of souud principles in the management of the public finances , accrued to the internal improvements , au apology , to some extent , would exist for the policy pursued by the Republican party ; but we maintaiu that had the Constitution been allowed to stand , the canal enlargement would have been further advanced to-day than it now is , and the increase of the State debt to the amount of nine millions of dollars avoided at the same time . Immediately on the adoption of the amendment to the Constitution conferring upon the Legislature additional power over the State finances , the spirit of encroachment and extravagance that had characterized the dominant party of this State previously while in existence , re-appeared at Albany under the auspices of the Republicans , taking full possession of the government , and evincing a still more embittered partizan intolerance . Although only one feature of the Constitution , that relating to finances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other measures were deemed necessary for the promotion of aims , if possible , still more hurtful and destructive to the public interest than the depletion of the State treasury . It will be seen by the quotations which we have made from their published address that one of the leading purposes of that Convention was to reduce and decentralize the patronage of the executive government , and to secure the election of officers of cities , villages , and towns , by the voters of the locality they serve . The provision of the Constitution conferring upon the people of the several localities in the State , this right , was at first regarded too clear to admit of controversy ; but as time progressed , the Republicans , having failed to secure the control of the national government , determined to hazard an obvious innovation upon the Constitution by legislative enactments , controverting not only its spirit , but , as we conceive , its express provisions , for // the sole purpose of increasing party patronage and power , regardless alike of the rights of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1857 accordingly passed a series of acts depriving New York and other cities of franchises supposed to be inalienable , and clearly guaranteed by the Constitution of 1846 , withdrawing from the citizens of the municipalities the election of their own officers , and by legislative and executive usurpation of authority , displaced other officers , elected by the people , by appointees of the central government . Thus was the second fundamental provision of the Constitution unrealized , if not entirely abrogated , as was the first , relative to the subject of finances . It must be evident to the mind of any candid person that the evils of which the people have just cause of complaint , and which have grown to such formidable proportions since the adoption of the Constitution of 1846 , are not only not traceable to any defect in that instrument , but are , in reality , the result of an abrogation of its provisions in one case , and a gross evasion of them in the other . Entertaining , as we believe a large majority of the people do , views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the IRepublican proposition to further tamper with the Constitution , conceiving that no good could accrue to the State by placing its organic law at the disposal of a party whose whole history proves it as unworthy of confidence as it is unscrupulous iii the exercise of power . It is a cause for congratulation that the proposition for a constitutional Convention , at this time , was repudiated by so decisive a majority . It is not pretended that the Constitution of 1846 is perfect in all its parts ; but it is just , liberal , and democratic in its provisions , and has been accepted as a model by many other States , and is regarded by enlightened , conservative statesmen as equal , in every respect , to the best State Constitution ever devised . Notwithstanding the emnphatic vote against calling a Convention , at the late election , it is believed that had the Democratic party possessed a safe majority in the State , the // vote would have been given in favor of a Convention ; not for the object had in view by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken on the question of a Convention , but for decidedly the opposite purpose-for the purpose of restoring the financial provision repealed in 1854 , and to make more plain and secure the right of the people to municipal self-government . No doubt exists , in our opinion , that this w9uld have been the result of the vote , could a guarantee have been given that the Convention would proceed at once to restore the Constitution to its original condition , and to make more clear , if that were possible , its provisions relative to municipal rights . If these views are correct , it will be seen that the objections lately raised against the Constitution , and the desire for a Convention , did not emanate , as was asserted in th' papers , from the people ; as , although the peopk have suffered the State government to pass into the hands of the Republican party temporarily , there is no proof that they would be trusted with supreme power in the State . It will scarcely be questioned that a fair interpretation of the causes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to form a new Constitution , demonstrates the j ustness of our conclusions . This majority against the Republican call for a Convention proves another fact no less worthy the reflection of the politicians of New York , namely , that the State government belongs to the Democratic party , and would be in its possession by a large majority , were it possible to conduct the canvass solely on the merits of the internal policy of the party , free from all external influence and foreign issues growing out of a misconception of the attitude of the National Democracy relative to the question of territorial government and the admission of new States . It was these foreign issues that placed the State government in the hands of the Republicans , while the domesti6 or State policy of the Democratic party was unequivocally and emphatically endorsed by the vote respecting the call of a constitutional Convention . This rule for determining the relative strength // of the Democratic and opposition party is applicable retrospectively to the politics of the State of New York . The opposition would have rarely carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the merits orpopularity of its domestic policy . When successful it has always had recourse to subterfuge and foreign issues , which , absorbing the attention of the people and attracting discussion from the Democratic side , overshadowed practical local issues , of paramount importance , and as a consequence resulted in preventing the Democratic party from controlling the State government . If by experience we shall learn wisdom , the government of the State of New York can not again fall into the hands of the opposition . The acknowledged interests of every class of her people forbid it , and every consideration of public policy and personal rights demands that the Democratic party shall , for the future , administer the government of this State , as it now administers the public policy of the nation .
