Grayson , William J. ( William John ) , 1788-1863 : The Country . from The Country ( 1858 ) TO Col. Wade Hampton , WHO HAS DEVOTED SO MANY YEARS TO THE OCCUPATIONS AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE COUNTRY ; GIVING TO ITS HORSES , FLOCKS AND HERDS , NEW BEAUTY AND VALUE , AND TO ITS LIFE THE GRACE AND CHARM OF A NOBLE HOSPITALITY , THIS ATTEMPT TO CELEBRATE WHAT HE HAS SO LONG LOVED AND ADORNED , IS DEDICATED WITH RESPECT AND ESTEEM , BY THE AUTHOR . The Argument . The Poet 's wish for country life ; few appreciate it ; the multitude prefer gold or power ; the Country the choice of Sage , Poet , Statesman , wronged by the world , or weary of it ; produces the best defenders of a nation ; the Ironsides of Cromwell , the Swiss , the clans of Scotland , the Arabs , the Romans ; their praises of country life ; their charm still appreciated in this far western world ; our people , like that of Rome , addicted to rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from small beginnings ; their progress ; the frontier hunter , the settled farmer , the early preacher ; the people , a noble one ; prompt to defend their country  --  Bennington , King 's Mountain , New-Orleans ; fortunate , if they adhere to their rural occupations and , in adorning and improving their home , follow noble examples . " HOC ERAT IN VOTIS. "  --  Horace . The Sabine farm amid continuous hills Remote from honours and their kindred ills , Its chrystal fountain , and inviting shade By groves of ancient oak and chesnut made , Where flocks and herds , in noonday heats repose , Or linger grazing , at the evening 's close ; Where bees abroad , on thyme or willow reap Their harvest sweets , and rivulets murmur sleep ; The sunny fields , the modest mansion there , The sober plenty of the rustic year , Friends , leisure , books  --  the Muses ' various art  --  That calm and banish from the Master 's heart , The thorns , the cares , prolific passions yield , As noxious weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet 's prayer  --  alas , how few Enjoy the bliss or deem the blessing true ! How few from gold 's alluring visions fly Or shun ambition with undazzled eye , Turn from the specious gifts their sorceries give , And taught by Time 's long lesson learn to live ; Law 's fairy fortune fled , a bankrupt scheme , End note A : 1Kb Napoleon 's boundless rule , a baseless dream ; Chained to his rock , from arms and power apart , With vulture memories feeding on his heart , In broken accents of imperial sway And stern command , he breathed his soul away , In vain  --  nor less in vain the lesson fraught With gentler lore , by nobler spirits taught , When , for the pomp and pride of war and state , Untainted by the pleasures of the great , They seek the happiness that never cloys Of homelier pleasures and serener joys ; In vain  --  new schemes bewilder and betray , New crowds pursue , where honours point the way ; Alike the dupes of vanity and lies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , From the drained cup , the insensate revellers crave A deeper draught , insatiate to the grave , Crushed the fond scheme ! yet haunted by its ghost They clutch the shadowy form , the substance lost , As storm tossed seamen seize the broken mast , Cling to the wreck , and struggle to the last , The foundered demagogue of party strife Cleaves to his purpose and intrigues for life ; Fallen from the topmost pinnacle of place , He rails and wrangles , at the miry base , And as the drunkard hugs his hapless doom , Raves and harangues , like Adams to the tomb . End note B : 1Kb In ancient Elis , to the Olympic game , From towns and states when joyous myriads came For fame , or gain , or idler crowds to see , With tranquil eye , defeat or victory , In calm spectator and exciting strife , The Sage of Samos viewed the scenes of life , Claimed , as his own , the cool observer 's part , Disdained the racer 's speed , the wrestler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy care , To dwell with nature , in a purer sphere , Her games , her strifes , her various tribes explore , In field or wood , by sea or river shore , With Holbrook 's eye , to watch their changeful mood And hoard the wisdom won from solitude . Such the calm shelter for his weary age End note C : 1Kb Of Milton 's prayer  --  the peaceful hermitage ; Such the pure life by Rydal 's grassy mead , Mountain and lake that Wordsworth loved to lead , That Shakspeare sought , contemptuous of the bays , The town 's poor pleasures , and uncertain praise ; That Cowper found a healing balm to cure , Or soothe the ills that stricken hearts endure ; That Shenstone dressed , with taste and love allied , That Scott adorned on Tweed 's romantic side , That Horace wished , that Mantua 's poet knew , That Cowley praised and Thomson 's pencil drew . Here Statesmen wronged or wearied seek repose , Relief from labour and retreat from foes , Zama 's great victor , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome , And Tully from the noisy Forum came , In lettered ease to find new fields of fame ; Waked from long slumber when the boundless rage Of license ruled the spirit of the age , On trampled altars , when the Tiger mood End note D : 1Kb Of France ran riot with the taste of blood , From Burke 's retreat , arose the voice of power That checked and quelled the phrenzy of the hour , Abashed the exorcis 'd demon slunk away , And Truth and Order reassumed their sway . But not for Poet , nor for sage alone , To calm and teach , is Nature 's influence known ; Her subtle spells and plastic powers controul The spirit 's power and form the heroic soul ; She bids the heart with patriot ardour glow , She hurls its vigour on the invading foe , Awakes its wrath for violated laws , And points its sword , in freedom 's sacred cause . Of such the iron bands that formed and taught By Cromwell 's skill , in Naseby 's battle fought , No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunts , but yeomen from the plough ; The sword of Gideon disciplined to wield They drove the Stuart 's gay pennon from the field , Made distant tyrants on their mad career Of carnage pause , and bigots pale with fear : From Piedmont 's caves , no more the dying cries End note E : 1Kb Of stifled multitudes for vengeance rise ; On Savoy 's hills , religious murders cease , And child and mother pray and sleep in peace . In Alpine valleys such the hardy host , And such the clans of Scotland 's rugged coast , Stern on their native hills as when afar Their Slogan 's voice , amid the din of war , Thrilled on the fevered matron 's slumbering ear , In Lucknow 's walls , and spoke of succour near : Resistless there , with fierce avenging wrath , Through rebel ranks , they clove their crimson path ; Maid , mother , children , hailed the tartaned brave , And blessed the hero sent of heaven to save . Such be our champions , children of the field , Strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of cities , of the gloom Of cellars , cripples from the mill or loom ; Gaunt in-door workmen , never trained to bear The summer 's heat or winter 's biting air , Whose faculties are cramped and cabined in To cut or point the wire that forms a pin , Or polish needles , or like spiders spread , In muslin webs , the attenuated thread ; Weak , toiling artists , fated to supply Wealth 's idle wants and labour till they die ; To swift extinction doomed , but nature 's hand Marches new levies from the teeming land , Recruits the decimated ranks , sustains And lends new vigour to their feeble veins . Mother of men ! Thy rustic vigour gives Alone , the heart by which a Nation lives ; Strong in thy strength , untamed the Arab roves His waste of sand , and guards his spicy groves , Unconquered by the Turk 's destroying horde , Assyria 's arrow , or the Roman sword , While all his holy cities sink the prey Of vice submissive to the stranger 's sway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dauntless spirit , the athletic frame , By labour nerved , on rustic plenty fed , To health and vigour by endurance bred , In warlike virtues trained by rustic cares , To scorn the toil of camp , the battle 's fears , Yet prompt , with crowns of triumph on his brow The sword renouncing , to resume the plough , He flew his eagles till the wasting blight Of city vices checked their onward flight . Nor versed in arms alone ! he learned to praise The fields he cherished in immortal lays ; To teach the art that guides the farmer 's hand , When with the plough to turn the fertile land , How wed to ash or elm the yielding vine , What cares attend the fleecy flock or kine , Or horse of nobler breed ; what signs betray The storm , or promise the serener day , What nice experience aids the roving bee To make and store his vernal luxury ; How guard the grassy mead with bank and drain , What seed the valley asks and what the plain Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The olive 's wealth , the orchard 's blushing fruit , Unfold the varied purpose of the year , Its simple pleasures and abundant cheer , Spring 's fragrant breezes , summer 's cool resorts , Autumn 's gay feasts , and winter 's bracing sports . So with unequalled dignity and grace The Mantuan bard instructs the rustic race , With stately ease and elegance describes The forest 's grandeur and its leafy tribes , The tall Narycian pine , Dodona 's oak , And sacred beech , where Jove in whispers spoke , Cedars of fragrant green , the flexile yew , That gave its vigour to the Parthian bow , The sea of box on green Cytorus ' sides , The Alder flourishing where Mincius glides , Caucasian woods , that winter storms delight To rend and scatter from the mountain height : Warm with the theme , his kindling verses glow , With growing beauty , brightening as they flow ; Oh , blest of Heaven ! the wrapt enthusiast cries , Too greatly blest ; whom nature 's hand supplies , Far from the selfish clamours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proud , With plenty , peace , security , content , A life in simple cares and pleasure spent , Safe slumbers in the shade of caverned rocks , The rural music of the lowing ox , Of bird , or breeze , or sound of rustling trees , Of pebbly brook at play , or murmuring bees , Where frugal wants and quiet toils engage Laborious youth and venerable age ; Where Justice left her parting footsteps driven From earth 's pollutions to her native Heaven ; Oh , who ! what God , what Muse 's present aid , Will lay their votary in the sacred shade Of Hoemus , and his joyous days prolong In Tempe , smitten with the love of song , From wealth afar and power 's delusive smile , The world 's vain cheats , its arrogance and guile . So sang the poet ; Latium 's echoes caught His strains , the rustic listened as he taught , Fresh joys in rural haunt and hamlet played And statesmen found new pleasure in the shade . Away from Tiber 's banks , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's note , Where nobler streams reflect a bluer sky , Where greener fields and broader valleys lie , Where deep in forest hid and mountain glen , Cradles of States , and nurseries of men , A sturdy brood , like Rome 's undaunted race , Trained to the plough and hardened to the chase , To empire rushing from the Atlantic shore , Climb the blue hills , the distant plains explore ; Their course , nor toil retards , nor foes restrain , Stream , mountain , desert , check their speed in vain ; Weak , too , at first  --  like Rome 's yet infant state , When Gaul 's barbarians thundered at her gate  --  They braved the tomahawk of savage strife , The midnight warwhoop , and the bloody knife , Till now resistless grown in manhood 's might , Swift and unswerving as the eagle 's flight Their onward march  --  they see and follow far In western skies , the light of Empire 's star , And stay the advancing standard only where The broad Pacific stops their bold career . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble rill Missouri flows , Now , loitering with the idle sedge at play , Now , murmuring at the pebble in his way , Beneath o'erhanging boughs a verdant arch Of hemlock , stealing now his quiet march ; Then , through the rocky cleft , the torrent toils , Along the roaring rapid foams and boils , Till , with the tribute of a thousand streams , Broad in the sun the boundless river gleams , Pours , in full flood , his deluge on the plain , And rolls resistless to the distant main . First in the march the hardy hunter dares Each untried peril , and the way prepares For feebler steps ; amid the stately pride Of oak and elm , the quiet brook beside , Where , far and wide , before his searching eyes , Savannahs blossom , and dark forests rise , His rifle , axe , and dauntless heart invade The unknown secrets of the woodland shade ; With logs to measure notched , and roughly cut , Course after course , he rears his homely hut , Of shingle forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trampled clay the floor ; One room supplies his wants , one chimney place , For all his household , spreads an ample space , Warms , through the day , his cabin home and lights , With knots of pine , his busy winter nights ; Beside the blaze  --  white-headed urchins near To watch or help  --  the hunter mends his gear ; His wife apart prepares the evening meal , Or plies the labour of the loom or wheel ; Rough hounds along the floor , at ease retrace , In sleep , the fortunes of the morning chase , With twitching limbs and dreamy yelps pursue The buck , and drag him to the ground anew . No costly forms of furniture provide , For idlers , ease , complacency for pride , No sofa 's length invites the lounger here , The bench or block supplies the easy chair , White beechen trenchers , spoons of polished horn , And cups of shining tin the shelf adorn , Or massive table , by the wall apart Secure from paint and innocent of art ; O'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustain the rifle 's idle weight , Or bristling on the oak as trophies stand , And tell the skill that guides the hunter 's hand . Now , on the forest , the long war begins , A bloodless field , the hunter ready wins ; To left , to right , with skillful arm he wields His conquering axe  --  the stately hickory yields , Majestic oaks , submissive meet their fate , The strong earth trembles with the falling weight ; Well dried by sun and wind , on spring 's return In crackling fires , the gathered branches burn , And leave a fertile space  --  the hoe subdues And turns the soil to mellowing showers and dews ; With bounteous harvest , every field is spread , Broad gourds for dishes , yellow maize for bread , The climbling bean , the pumpkin 's ample round , Spread their wide leaves and shade the cumbered ground Expectant children watch the coming cheer , Feast on the ripening pod and milky ear , And the glad matron to her standing store Of bear or venison , adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and summer 's sun , Nor yet grim winter 's sleety storms begun , When on the hills afar , in smoky haze , The Indian summer veils its mellow rays ; From northern hills , when chilling breezes strew The wood and glen with leaves of altered hue , Gold , crimson , purple , showers , that mingling fly , And swept by winds in rustling masses lie ; When in his hollow , with industrious care , The squirrel hoards his wonted winter fare Of shining nuts , and from their airy height The cry of passing geese is heard at night ; Impatient of repose the hunter eyes The rifle 's length and to the covert flies , Now , the bear 's glossy spoils reward his search , Or bearded goblers from the morning perch , Now stealing on , with cautious step and slow , He stalks the buck , or strikes the barren doe , Far to their haunts , pursues the flying game And thins their numbers with unerring aim . If long harassed to distant wilds they flew , The ready hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fairer fills Boone 's fancy , beckoning from the distant hills , Though rich his valley land , a richer lies Beyond the ridge  --  a hunter 's paradise  --  Away he roams to wood and waste unknown , Hand , eye and rifle , his defence alone , Skilled , savage wiles with subtler wiles to meet , He drove the Indian from his dark retreat , By mighty streams , in forests dim and drear , Bearded their chiefs and scorned the thought of fear ; A captive , tortured , with unflinching will , He bore and braved the torturer 's baffled skill , Fled from their toils , with vengeance fired by pain , Took the long rifle and the woods again , Unyielding kept his stern determined way , And held his conquests with a monarch 's sway . But not in thought alone of forest strife , Or woodland sport , was spent the hunter 's life ; From some steep mountain 's lingering crest of snow He gazed , transported , on the scene below , When spring 's light touch had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balmy breeze , When over prairie wide , and forest glade , Hill top , and valley , herds unnumbered strayed , Of shaggy buffalo , tall elk , and deer , At pleasure browsing , careless yet of fear  --  Unknown the rifle  --  to the hunter 's breast Stole gentle thoughts that whispered peace and rest , Old memories of boyhood 's home and friends By Yadkin 's banks , and with the vision blends A deeper feeling  --  shadowy thoughts arise Of awe , instinctive , pointing to the skies From nature 's aspects  --  but not long the charm That stops the step , or stays the hunter 's arm , Down , with swift foot , he takes the craggy pass And the buck 's blood imbrues the springing grass . Off with their game , the children of the chase Impatient pass , a more laborious race Subdue the forest ; from the mountain brow , Along the vale , obedient to the plough , Broad farms are seen ; the clouds drop fatness there , In fertilizing showers ; from earth and air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hills rejoice , Pouring , from maple founts , their sweets in spring , End note H : 1Kb And , filled with corn , the vallies laugh and sing . In quiet pastures , feed unnumbered flocks , The frisking colt , the slow , laborious ox ; Herds of fair form engage the farmer 's care , And droves of swine , the sylvan banquet share ; Fit emblem of the Epicurean sty , To-day that revel and to-morrow die , Their mast and maize , the greedy host consume , Feast to the knife , and fatten for their doom . In cottage yards , familiar sounds are heard , The sharp , shrill challenge of the martial bird , The noisy , restless hen from Guinea 's coast , And quacking ducks , and geese a cackling host : There struts the gobler 's state , with crest of pride , The radiant peacock marches at his side , Bright tints expand , like gems from monarch 's won , And spread their gorgeous circle to the sun : Alert and hungry , with inquiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the matron at her morning stand , The brimming basket , and the liberal hand , Rush to her call , with flapping pinions greet The scattered feast , and scramble at her feet .

Embanked and guided now the mountain rill , No longer idle , turns the exacting mill , The log-built cabin and rude fence are gone , Trim painted pales enclose the grassy lawn , And elm or oak beside  --  a leafy skreen  --  With lattice windows of contrasted green , White mansions gleam , and garners statelier still , Rise through the vale or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ample garden spreads With roses gay , a maze of walks and beds ; Orchards with minstrel music never mute In blossom blush , or glow with autumn 's fruit , And on the new-mown field the tedded hay , With grateful fragrance cheers the brightening day . Along the valley , spires , in calm repose , That forest trees half hide and half disclose , Arrest the eye , with wiser lessons fraught Than Grecian sage or Roman ever taught ; There , in the grave 's sad refuge slumberers lie And wait their joyous summons to the sky ; For savage yells and shrieks of earlier days , Swells the soft solemn voice of Sabbath praise ; While teachers toil with earnest zeal to find Each easier access to the rustic mind ; And where from Nature 's scenes the Indian drew Of Nature 's author all the love he knew , To purer faith , they bid her forms convey A clearer light , to guide the rustic 's way ; He sees , with pensive eye , the forest round Restore its faded foliage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower , More grateful thoughts , for genial dew and shower ; And when with heavier hand he turns the soil , Digs , breaks and harrows with redoubled toil And sees as deeper sinks the rugged share , That richer harvests fill the closing year ; So too he finds , when troubles harder grow , And the torn bosom 's ploughed with sharper woe , From seeming griefs , celestial pleasures rise , And the heart 's harvest blossoms for the skies ; He feels the heavenly husbandman 's controul , And learns how sorrows fertilize the soul . Such thoughts they gain from men in humble guise , Though rude in garb , in saintly wisdom wise , Trained by no college to their simple creed , And bold and hardy as the flocks they feed , The Bible furnishing their pulpit lore , The leathern saddle bags , their worldly store , The horse , their help , companion , friend , they go Through summer 's burning heat and winter 's snow , Climb the rough mountain , swim the icy stream , Dare the wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fallen leaves their bed , at evening 's close , Broad sheltering oaks invite them to repose , Their steps no danger , toil , nor want delays , The forest echoes to their song of praise , As , strong in faith , through pathless woods they ride , The sun or mossy trunk of trees their guide , And , steadfast like the sun to place and day , Hasten to teach the Borderer how to pray , Religion 's pioneers , to do , or bear What martyrs suffer , or what heroes dare , They preach with simple eloquence , reprove , Sow , in rough hearts , the seeds of Christian love , Rough hearts but honest , no devices there Clothe glib hypocricy in forms of prayer , Plain , as their homespun garb of household dyes , But pure , the faith that leads them to the skies .

By drooping boughs of fir , or gloomy pines , Where bound in chains of ice Penobscot shines , He wields his axe , and with a master hand Strikes the broad forest from the subject land ; On swelling streams , when snows dissolving lend Their aid , in spring , compacted rafts descend , Guided by skillful hands  --  the impetuous tide Sweeps the huge masses to the Ocean 's side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bends to the blast , and spreads the bellying sail .

With graver step , the plodding farmer goes Afield , in milder climes , where Lehigh flows , Or where , reflecting towns , on either side , And States , Ohio glides , in beauty 's pride , By fertile valleys , fields of waving maize , Long grassy slopes , where flocks unnumbered graze , Green meadows , orchards flushed , on every spray , Or white with fragrant promise of May ; Round hills that every gift and charm combine , The purple clusters of the distant Rhine , The mossy rock , dim glen and sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Where quiet farms in sheltered nooks appear , And health and plenty bless the circling year .

These make our country 's strength , the nerve , the bone ; The love of country dwells with these alone ; Or North , or South , their healthful vigour gives The crimson stream by which a nation lives ; Trained to the rifle 's use , they fear no foe , And war confront , though heroes strike the blow ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their strength , and vaunting of their fame , Twice back defeat has scourged the broken host , Their honour dimmed , and shamed their idle boast ; Though trained to arms , the bravest of her brave , They won and kept no conquest but a grave .
