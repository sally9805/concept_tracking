Before the reader decides that an apology is necessary for the introduction of another work on bees into the presence of those already before the public , it is hoped that he will have the patience to examine the contents of this . The writer of the following pages commenced beekeeping in 1828 , without any knowledge of the business to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking them with sulphur , &c.; Nearly all the information to be had was so mingled with erroneous whims and notions , that it required a long experience to separate essential and consistent points . It was impossible to procure a work that gave the information necessary for practice . From that time to the present , no sufficient guide for the inexperienced has appeared . European works , republished here , are of but little value . Weeks , Townley , Miner , and others , writers of this country , within a few years , have given us treatises , valuable to some extent , but have entirely neglected several chapters , very important and essential to the beginner . Keeping bees has been , and is now , by the majority , deemed a hazardous enterprise . The ravages of the moth had been so great , and loss so frequent , that but little attention was given to the subject for a long time . Mr. Weeks lost his entire stock three times in fifteen years . But soon after the discovery was promulgated , that honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an additional attention was manifest , increasing to a rage in many places . It seems to be easily understood , that profit must attend success , in this branch of the farmer 's stock ; inasmuch as the " bees work for nothing and find themselves . " This interest in bees should be encouraged to continue till enough are kept to collect all the honey now wasted ; which , compared with the present collections , would be more than a thousand pounds to one . But to succeed , that is the difficulty . Some eighteen years since , after a propitious season , an aged and esteemed friend said to me , " It is not to be expected that you will have such luck always ; you must expect they will run out after a time . I have always noticed , when people have first-rate luck for a time , that the bees generally take a turn , and are gone in a few years . " I am not sure but , to the above remarks , may be traced the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry . I soon found that good seasons were the " lucky " ones , and that many lost in an adverse season , all they had before gained . Also , that strong families were the only ones on which I could depend for protection against the moth . This induced the effort to ascertain causes tending to diminish the size of families , and the application of remedies . Whether success has attended my efforts or not , the reader can judge , after a perusal of the work . It is time that the word " luck , " as applied to beekeeping , was discarded . The prevailing opinion , that bees will prosper for one person more than another , under the same circumstances , is fallacious . As well might it be applied to the mechanic and farmer . The careless , ignorant farmer , might occasionally succeed in raising a crop with a poor fence ; but would be liable , at any time , to lose it by trespassing cattle . He might have suitable soil in the beginning , but without knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to produce ; unless a chance application happened to be right . But with the intelligent farmer the case is different : fences in order , manures judiciously applied , and with propitious seasons , he makes a sure thing of it . Call him " lucky " if you please ; it is his knowledge , and care , that render him so . So with bee-keeping , the careful man is the " lucky " one . There can be no effect without a preceding cause . If you lose a stock of bees , there is a cause or causes producing it , just as certain as the failure of a crop with the unthrifty farmer , can be traced to a poor fence , or unfruitful soil . You may rest assured , that a rail is off your fence of management somewhere , or the proper applications have not been made . In relation to bees , these things may not be quite so apparent , yet nevertheless true . Why is there so much more uncertainty in apiarian science than other farming operations ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thousands who are engaged in , and have studied agriculture , perhaps not more than one has given his energies to the nature and habits of bees . If knowledge is elicited in the same ratio , we ought to have a thousand times more light on one subject than the other , and still there are some things , even in agriculture , that may yet be learned . It is supposed , by many , that we already have all the knowledge that the subject of bees affords . This is not surprising ; a person that was never furnished with a full treatise , might arrive at such conclusions . Unless his own experience goes deeper , he can have no means of judging what is yet behind . In conversation relative to this work , with a person of considerable scientific attainments , he remarked , " You do not want to give the natural history of bees at all ; that is already sufficiently understood . " And how is it understood ; as Huber gives it , or in accordance with some of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we find many points recently contradicted . If we compare authors of our day , we find them contradicting each other . One recommends a peculiarly constructed hive , as just the thing adapted to their nature and instincts . If a single point is in accordance with their nature , he labors to twist all the others to his purpose , although it may involve a fundamental principle impossible to reconcile . Some one else succeeds in another point , and proceeds to recommend something altogether different . False and contradictory assertions are made either through ignorance , or interest . Interest may blind the judgment , and spurious history may deceive . It is folly to expect success in bee-keeping for any length of time , without a correct knowledge of their nature and instincts ; and this we shall never obtain by the course hitherto pursued . As much of their labor is performed in the dark , and difficult to be observed , it has given rise to conjecture and false reasoning , leading to false conclusions . When I say a thing is so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader that it is proved or demonstrated ? My mere assertions are not expected to be taken in preference to another 's ; of such proof , we have more than enough . Most people have not the time , patience , or ability , to set down quietly with close observation , and investigate the subject thoroughly . Hence it has been found easier to receive error for truth , than to make the exertion necessary to confute it ; the more so , because there is no guide to direct the investigation . I shall , therefore , pursue a different course ; and for every assertion endeavor to give a test , that the reader may apply and satisfy himself , and trust to no one . As for theories , I shall try to keep them separate from facts , and offer such evidence as I have , either for or against them . If the reader has further proof that presents the matter in another light , of course he will exercise the right to a difference of opinion . I could give a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this would be unsatisfactory . When we are told a thing must be done , most of us , like the " inquisitive Yankee , " have a desire to know why it is necessary ; and then like to know how to do it . This gives us confidence that we are right . Hence , I shall endeavor to give the practical part , in as close connection with the natural history , that dictates it , as possible . This work will contain several chapters entirely new to the public : the result of my own experience , that will be of the utmost value to all who desire to realize the greatest possible advantages from their bees . The additions to chapters already partially discussed by others , will contain much original matter not to be found elsewhere . When many stocks are kept , the chapter on " Loss of Queens , " alone , will , with attention , save to any one , not in the secret , enough in one season to be worth more in value than many times the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those on diseased brood , artificial swarms , wintering bees , and many others . If such a work could have been placed in my hands twenty years ago , I should have realized hundreds of dollars by the information . But instead of this , my course has been , first to suffer a loss , and then find out the remedy , or preventive ; from which the reader may be exempt , as I can confidently recommend these directions . Another new feature will be found in the duties of each season being kept by itself , commencing with the spring and ending with the winter management . In my anxiety to be understood by all classes of readers , I am aware that I have made the elegant construction and arrangement of sentences of secondary importance ; therefore justly liable to criticism . But to the reader , whose object is information on this subject , it can be of but little consequence . CHAPTER I. A BRIEF HISTORY . THREE KINDS OF BEES . Every prosperous swarm , or family of bees , must contain one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year , a few hundred drones . Illustration : QUEEN . Illustration : WORKER . Illustration : DRONE . QUEEN DESCRIBED . The queen is the mother of the entire family ; her duty appears to be only to deposit eggs in the cells . Her abdomen has its full size very abruptly where it joins the trunk or body , and then gradually tapers to a point . She is longer than either the drones or workers , but her size , in other respects , is a medium between the two . In shape she resembles the worker more than the drone ; and , like the worker , has a sting , but will not use it for anything below royalty . She is nearly destitute of down , or hairs ; a very little may be seen about her head and trunk . This gives her a dark , shining appearance , on the upper side  --  some are nearly black . Her legs are somewhat longer than those of a worker ; the two posterior ones , and the under surface , are often of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow stripe nearly encircles the abdomen at the joints , and meets on the back . Her wings are about the same as the workers , but as her abdomen is much longer , they only reach about two-thirds the length of it . For the first few days after leaving the cell , her size is much less than after she has assumed her maternal duties . She seldom , perhaps never , leaves the hive , except when leading a swarm , and when but a few days old , to meet the drones , in the air , for the purpose of fecundation . The manner of the queen 's impregnation is yet a disputed point , and probably never witnessed by any one . The majority of close observers , I believe , are of opinion that the drones are the males , and that sexual connection takes place in the air , 1 performing their amours while on the wing , like the humble-bee and some other insects . It appears that one impregnation is operative during her life , as old queens are not afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this hypothesis will be generally found among those who are unable to give a more plausible elucidation . Those who oppose the fact that one bee is the mother of the whole family , will probably be in the same class . DESCRIPTION AND DUTY OF WORKERS . As all labor devolves on the workers , they are provided with a sack , or bag , for honey . Basket-like cavities are on their legs , where they pack the pollen of flowers into little pellets , convenient to bring home . They are also provided with a sting , and a virulent poison , although they will not use it abroad when unmolested , but , if attacked , will generally defend themselves sufficient to escape . They range the fields for honey and pollen , secrete wax , construct combs , prepare food , nurse the young , bring water for the use of the community , obtain propolis to seal up all crevices about the hive , stand guard , and keep out intruders , robbers , &c.,; &c.; DESCRIPTION OF DRONES . When the family is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reared ; the number , probably , depends on the yield of honey , and size of the swarm , more than anything else . As honey becomes scarce , they are destroyed . Their bodies are large and rather clumsy , covered with short hairs or bristles . Their abdomen terminates very abruptly , without the symmetry of the queen or worker . Their buzzing , when on the wing , is louder , and altogether different from the others . They seem to be of the least value of any in the hive . Perhaps not more than one in a thousand is ever called upon to perform the duty for which they were designed . Yet they assist , on some occasions , to keep up the animal heat necessary in the old hive after a swarm has left . MOST BROOD IN SPRING . In spring and first of summer , when nearly all the combs are empty , and food abundant , they rear brood more extensively than at any other period , ( towards fall more combs are filled with honey , giving less room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bees , and royal cells are constructed , in which the queen deposits her eggs . When some of these young queens are advanced sufficiently to be sealed over , the old one , and the greater part of her subjects , leave for a new location , ( termed swarming . ) They soon collect in a cluster , and , if put into an empty hive , commence anew their labors ; constructing combs , rearing brood , and storing honey , to be abandoned on the succeeding year for another tenement . One in a hundred may do it the same season , if the hive is filled and crowded again in time to warrant it . Only large early swarms do this . THEIR INDUSTRY . Industry belongs to their nature . When the flowers yield honey , and the weather is fine , they need no impulse from man to perform their part . When their tenement is supplied with all things necessary to reach another spring , or their store-house full , and no necessity or room for an addition , and we supply them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Rather than to waste time in idleness , during a bounteous yield of honey , they have been known to deposit their surplus in combs outside the hive , or under the stand . This natural industrious habit lies at the foundation of all the advantages in bee-keeping ; consequently our hives must be constructed with this end in view ; and at the same time not interfere with other points of their nature ; but this subject will be discussed in the next chapter . Those peculiar traits in their nature , mentioned in this , will be more fully discussed in different parts of this work , as they appear to be called for , and where proof will be offered to sustain the positions here assumed , which as yet are nothing more than mere assertions . CHAPTER II . HIVES . HIVES TO BE THOROUGHLY MADE . Hives should be constructed of good materials , boards of good thickness , free from flaws and cracks , well fitted and thoroughly nailed . The time of making them is not very particular , providing it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off till the swarming period , to be made as wanted , because if they are to be painted ; it should be done as long as possible before , as the rank smell of oil and paint , just applied , might be offensive to the bees . But what kind of hive shall be made ? In answer , some less than a thousand forms have been given . The advantages of bee-keeping depend as much upon the construction of hives , as any one thing ; yet there is no subject pertaining to them on which there is such a variety of opinions , and I have but little hopes of reconciling all these conflicting views , opinions , prejudices , and interests . DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT THEM . One is in favor of the old box , and the cruel practice of killing the bees to obtain the honey , as the only means to obtain " luck ; " " they are sure to run out if they meddle with them . " Another will rush to the opposite extreme , and advocate all the extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra of all hives , when perhaps it would be worth more for fire-wood than the apiary . THE AUTHOR HAS NO PATENT TO RECOMMEND . To remove from the mind of the reader all apprehension that I am about condemning one patent to recommend another , I would say in the beginning , that I have no patent to praise , no interest in deceiving , and I hope no prejudices to influence me , in advocating or condemning any system . I wish to make bee-keeping plain , simple , economical , and profitable ; so that when we sum up the profit " it shall not be found in the other pocket . " It is a principle recognized by our statute , that no person is suitable as a Juror , who is biased either by interest or prejudice . Now whether I am the impartial Jurist , is not for me to say : but I wish to discuss the subject fairly . I hope some few will be enabled to see their own interest : at any rate , dismiss prejudice , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unprofitable to bee-keepers . SPECULATORS SUPPORTED LONG ENOUGH . We have faithfully supported a host of speculators on our business for a long time ; often not caring one straw about our success , after pocketing the fee of successful " humbuggery . " One is no sooner gone , than we are beset by another , with something altogether different , and of course the acme of perfection . PREFIX OF PATENT A BAD RECOMMENDATION . This has been done until the very prefix of patent , or premium , attached to a hive , renders it almost certain that there must be something deleterious to the apiarian ; either in expense of construction or intricate and perplexing in management , requiring an engineer to manage , and a skilful architect to construct . What does the American savage , who without difficulty can track the panther or wolf , know of the principles of chemistry ? What does the Chemist know of following a track in the forest , when nothing but withered leaves can guide him ? Each understands principles , the minutiae of which the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears to be with granting patents and premiums , if we take what has been patented and praised by our committees and officers as improvements in bee-culture . These men may be capable , intelligent , and well fitted for their sphere , but in bee matters , about as capable of judging , as the Hottentot would be of the merits of an intricate steam-engine . Knowledge and experience are the only qualifications competent to decide . OPPOSITION TO SIMPLICITY . I am aware that among the thousands whose direct interest is opposed to my simple , plain manner of getting along , many will be ready to contend with me for every departure from their patent , improved or premium hives , as the case may be . BY GAINING ONE POINT , PRODUCE ANOTHER EVIL . I think it will be an easy matter to show that every departure from simplicity to gain one point , is attended in another by a correspondent evil , that often exceeds the advantage gained . That we have made vast improvements in art and science , and in every department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is assumed we must correspondingly improve in a bee-hive ; forgetting that nature has fixed limits to the instinct of the bee , beyond which she will not go ! It will be necessary to point out the advantages and objections to these pretended improvements , and then we will see if we can not avoid the objections , and retain the advantages , without the expense , by a simple addition to the common hive ; because if we expect to encourage bee-keeping , they must have better success than a neighbor of mine , who expended fifty dollars for bees and a patent , and lost all in three years ! Most bee-keepers are farmers ; very few are engineers sufficient to work them successfully . I would say to all such as do not understand the nature of bees , adhere to simplicity until you do , and then I am quite sure you will have no desire for a change . FIRST DELUSION . Probably the first delusion in the patent line originated with the idea , that to obtain surplus honey , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of the depredations of mice , the suspended hive was contrived . The inclined bottom-board was then added to throw out the worms . To prevent the combs from sliding down , the lower end was contracted . The principle of bees rearing queens from worker-eggs when destitute , gave rise to the dividing hive in several forms . Comb , when used several years , becomes thickened and black , and needs changing ; hence the changeable hives , Non-swarmers have been introduced to save risk and trouble . Moth-proof hives to prevent the ravages of worms , &c.,; &c.; CHAMBER HIVE . The chamber hive is made with two apartments ; the lower and largest is for the permanent residence of the bees , the upper or chamber for the boxes . Its merits are these : the chamber affords all the protection necessary for glass boxes ; considered as a cover , it is never lost . Its demerits are inconvenience in handling ; it occupies more room if put in the house in the winter ; if glass boxes are used , only one end can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other may hold some pounds yet , and we can not possibly know until it is taken out . I know we are told to return such boxes when not full " and the bees will soon finish them , " but this will depend on the yield of honey at the time ; if abundant , it will be filled ; if not , they will be very likely to take a hint , and remove below what there is in the box ; whereas if the chamber was separate from the hive , and was not a chamber but a loose cap to cover the boxes , it could be raised at any time without disturbing a single bee , and the precise time of the boxes being filled ascertained , ( that is , when they are of glass . ) MRS . GRIFFITH 'S HIVE . Mrs. Griffith , of New Jersey , is said to have invented the suspended chamber hive with the inclined bottom-board . One would suppose this was sufficiently inconvenient to use , and difficult and expensive to construct . WEEKS ' IMPROVEMENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an improvement , the expense is but a trifle more ; it is sufficient to be sanctioned by a patent . From front to rear , the bottom is about three inches narrower than the top , somewhat wedge-shape ; it has the merit to prevent the combs from slipping down , when they happen to be made , to have the edges supported . The objections are , that filth from the bees will not fall as readily to the bottom as if every side was perpendicular , and the extra trouble in constructing . INCLINED BOTTOM-BOARDS DO NOT THROW OUT ALL THE WORMS . Inclined bottom-boards form the basis of one or two patents , said to be good to roll out the worms . I can imagine a pea rolling off such a board ; but a worm is not often found in a rolling condition . Most of us know , that when a worm drops from the combs , it is like the spider , with a thread attached above . The only way that I can imagine one to be thrown out by these boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or so cold that it can not spin a thread , and wind to shake the board , till it rolls off . The objections to these boards are coupled with the suspended hive , with which they are usually connected . OBJECTIONS TO SUSPENDED HIVES . All suspended hives must be objectionable to any one who wishes to know the true condition of his bees at all times . Only think of the trouble of unhooking the bottom-board , and getting down on your back , or twisting your neck till your head is dizzy , to look up among the combs , and then see nothing satisfactory for want of light ; or to lift the hive from its supporters , and turn it over . The operation is too formidable for an indolent man , or one that has much other business . The examination would very probably be put off till quite sure it would do no longer , and sometimes a few days after that , when you will very often find your bees past remedy . SEE BEES OFTEN . " See your bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth five hundred dollars at interest , even when you have but few stocks . How necessary then that we have every facility for a close and minute inspection . How much easier to turn up a hive that simply rests on a stand . Sometimes it is necessary to turn the hive , even bottom up , and let the rays of the sun directly among the combs , to see all the particulars . By this close inspection , I have often ascertained the cause of some difficulty , and provided a remedy , thus saving a good many that in a short time would have been lost ; yet , with a little help , were as valuable as any by another year . HALL 'S PATENT . Mr. Hall has added a lower section to his hive , about four inches deep , with two boards inside , like the roof of a house , to discharge the worms , &c.; but as these boards would interfere with close inspection , they are objectionable . Several other variations of inclined bottom-boards and suspended hives have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered will apply to most of them . I shall not weary the reader by noticing in detail every hive that has been patented ; I think if I notice the principles of each kind , it will test his patience sufficiently . JONES ' PATENT . Jones ' dividing hive was probably suggested by this instinctive principle of the bee , viz. : when a stock by any accident loses its queen , and the combs contain eggs or very young larvae , they will rear another . Now if a hive is constructed so as to divide the brood-combs , it would seem quite certain that the half without a queen , would raise one ; and we could multiply our stocks without swarms , the trouble of hiving , and risk of their going to the woods , &c.; AN EXPERIMENT . Several years ago , I thought I had obtained a principle that would revolutionize the whole system of bee management . In 1840 I constructed such hives , and put in the bees to test by actual experiment , the utility of what seemed so very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested the same idea to Mr. Jones ; perhaps with this difference : I think he did not wait to test the plan thoroughly , before obtaining his patent in ' 42 . One vender of rights asserted that 63 stocks were made from one in three years ; but somehow a great many that obtained the rights , failed in their expectations . From my experiments , I think I could guess at some of the reasons . Mr. A.  --  " Well , what are the reasons ? give us your experience , if you please , I am interested ; I had the right for such a hive , and had a lot made to order , that cost more money in the end than I shall ever pay again for anything about bees . " Do not be too hasty , friend , I think I can instruct you to keep bees on principles in accordance with their nature , which is very simple , so that if you can be induced to try again , we will have the hives cost but little , at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest difficulty with dividing hives , appeared to be here . It must be constructed with a partition or division to keep the combs in each apartment separate ; otherwise , we make tearing work in the division . When bees are first put into such hives , unless the swarm is very large , and honey abundant , one apartment will be filled to the bottom before a commencement is made in the other . Mr. A.  --  " What difference can that make ? It is necessary to have the hive full ; if it can not be all filled at once , why let them fill part . " The difference is this . The first combs built by a swarm are for brood , and store-combs afterwards , as needed ; one apartment will be nearly filled with all brood-combs , and the other with store-combs and honey . Now in the two kinds of cells there is a great difference ; those for breeding are near half an inch in length , while those for storing are sometimes two inches or more ; totally unfit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper length , which they will not do , unless compelled for want of room , consequently this side of store-combs is but little used for brood . When such hive is divided , the chances are not more than one in four , that this apartment will have any young bees of the proper age from which to raise a queen ; if not , and the old queen is in the part with the brood-comb , where she will be ninety-nine times in a hundred , one half of the hive is lost for want of a queen . Mr. A.  --  " Ah ! I think I now understand how I lost one-half of nearly every hive I divided . I also lost some of them in the winter ; there was plenty of bees as well as honey ; can you tell the cause of this ? " I will guess that they starved . Mr. A.  --  " Starved ! why , I said there was plenty of honey . " I understood it , but nevertheless feel quite sure . Mr. A.  --  " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand how they could starve when there was honey ! " CAUSE OF STARVING IN SUCH HIVES . I said one apartment would be filled with brood-combs ; this will be occupied , at least partially , with brood as long as the yield of honey lasts ; consequently , there will be but little room for storing here , but the other side may be full throughout . The bees will take up their winter quarters among the brood-combs . Now suppose the honey in this apartment is all exhausted during a severe turn of cold weather , what can the bees do ? If one should leave the mass and go among the frosty combs for a supply , its fate would be as certain as starvation . Without frequent intervals of warm weather to melt all frost on the combs , and allow the bees to go into the other apartment for honey , they must starve . The cost of construction is another objection to this hive , as the labor bestowed on one is more than would finish two , that would be much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of changeable hives is based upon the following principle :  --  Each young bee when it first hatches from the egg , is neither more nor less than a worm ; when it receives the necessary food , the bees seal it over ; it will then spin a cocoon , or line its cell with a coating of silk , less in thickness than the thinnest paper : this remains after the bee leaves it . It is evident , therefore , that after a few hundreds have been reared in a cell , and each one has left its cocoon , that such cell must be somewhat diminished , although the thickness of a dozen cocoons could not be measured ; and this old cell needs removing , that the bees may replace it with a new one . But how shall it be done ? This is a feat for the display of ingenuity . A common man might go about it in a very sensible , simple manner , might possibly turn the hive over , and cut out the old combs when necessary , without knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing scientifically , the benefit of which would be many times on the principle of a surgeon cutting off your head , to get a good chance to tie a small artery according to system ; or would show you a roundabout way of half a dozen miles to accomplish what the same number of rods would do . Had we not ocular demonstration of the fact , we could not suppose so many variations for the same end could be invented . But if we reward ingenuity , it will be stimulated to great exertions . Perhaps if we describe the merits of one or two of this class , the utility of this principle may be comprehended . VARIATION OF THESE HIVES . First , then , the sectional hive of various patterns has been patented ; it consists generally of about three boxes , one above another ; the top of each has one large hole , or several small ones , or cross-bars , about an inch wide , and half an inch apart ; these holes or spaces allowing the bees to pass from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper one is removed , and an empty one put under the bottom ; in this way all are changed , and the combs renewed in three years ; very easily and quietly done . This is as far as a patent-vender wishes the subject investigated ; and some of his customers have not gone beyond this point . As an offset for these advantages , we will first look at the cost of such hive . EXPENSE IN CONSTRUCTING CHANGEABLE HIVES . It is as much work to construct each separate section , as a common hive ; consequently , it is three times the expense to begin with . It is objectionable for wintering bees , on the same principle as the dividing hive . I object to it on another point : our surplus honey will never be pure , as each section must be used for breeding , and every cell so used , will contain cocoons corresponding to the number of bees raised . SURPLUS HONEY WILL CONTAIN BEE-BREAD . Also pollen , or bee-bread , is always stored in the vicinity of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey , to please the palate with its exquisite flavor . The majority will probably prefer all surplus honey stored in pure comb , where it will be with proper management . I will here give a full description of a hive on this principle , as I have the description from one of its advocates , in the Dollar Newspaper , Philadelphia : called Cutting 's Patent Changeable Hive . DESCRIPTION OF CUTTING 'S CHANGEABLE HIVE . " The size of the changeable hive most used in this section , has an outside shell , made of inch boards , about two feet high and sixteen and a half inches square , with a door hung in the rear . On the inside are three boxes or drawers , which will hold about one thousand cubic inches each , and when filled with honey , usually weigh about thirty-five pounds , which is a sufficient amount of honey to winter a large swarm . The sides of these drawers are made of boards , about half an inch thick ; the tops and bottoms of the lower drawers and ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the drawers should be fourteen inches high , fourteen inches from front to rear , and six and three-fourths inches wide . Two of these drawers stand side by side , with the third placed flatwise upon the two , with a free communication from one drawer to another , by means of thirty three-fourth inch holes on the side of each drawer , and twenty-four in the bottom of the upper drawer , and holes in the top and bottom of the lower drawers , to correspond , and slides to cut off the communication when occasion may require . Thus we see our hive may be one hive , with communication sufficiently free throughout , or we may have three hives combined . The drawers have tubes made in them , ( for the bees to pass and repass ) , which are made to go through the front side of the hive . The back-side of the drawers are doors , with glass set in them . These drawers set up from the bottom of the hive , and rest on pieces of wood , closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space under the drawers for the dirt , dead bees , and water , which collect in the bottom of hives in winter ; between the drawers and the outside is an air space of about one-third of an inch . These hives , when well made and painted , will last many years , and those doing much in the business will find it an advantage to have a few extra drawers . Having given you some idea of the construction of the changeable hive , I will proceed to notice some of the most important reasons why I prefer this hive to any I have yet seen . First because the hive , being constructed upon the changeable principle , so that by taking out a full drawer , and placing an empty one in its stead , our comb is always kept new , wherefore , the size of the bee is preserved , and kept in a more healthy , or prosperous state , or condition , than when obliged to remain and continue to breed , in the old comb , when the cells have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easily united . Thirdly , because large swarms may be easily divided . Fourthly , because however late a swarm may come off , it may be easily supplied with honey for the winter , by taking from a full hive a surplus drawer , and placing it in the hive of the late swarm . Fifthly , because a column of air between the drawers and the outside of the hive is a non-conductor of both heat and cold , preventing the melting of the comb , and securing the bees against frost and cold . " Now here is a full description of perhaps as good a hive as any of its class ; it is given for the benefit of those who wish to go miles instead of rods ; they may know the road , especially as they can have the privilege by paying for it : for myself , I had rather be excused ,  --  why , reading the description has nearly exhausted my patience ; what should I do if I attempted to make one ? FIRST OBJECTION , COST OF CONSTRUCTION . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obtained ) is the construction . Let 's see ; we want inch boards to make the shell , three-quarter inch boards for the tops and bottoms of drawers , half inch for sides , hinges to hang a door , glass for back of drawers , tubes for the egress of the bees , and slides to cut off communication . It will be necessary to get a mechanic , and a workman too . Those 108 holes that must be bored , must match , or it is of no use to make them . But few farmers would have the tools requisite , a still less number the skill and patience to do it . What the cost might be by the time a hive was ready to receive the bees , I could not say ; but guess it might be some three or four dollars . HIVES CAN BE MADE WITH LESS EXPENSE . The one I shall recommend , without paint , will not cost , or need not , over 37-1/2 cents , with cover , etc . Now , if we wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for the purpose ; but it is well not to refine too much , as there are limits which , if passed , will render it unfit for bees . Therefore , when profit is an object , the extra expense will or ought to be made up by the bees , in return for an expensive domicil . But will they do it ? The merits of the one under consideration are fully given . " First , by taking out a full drawer and putting in an empty one in its stead , the combs are always kept new , and cells of full size . " Now this fear of bees becoming dwarfs in consequence of being reared in cells too small , has done more mischief among the bees , and their owners ' pockets , than if the fact had never been thought , or heard of . OLD BREEDING CELLS WILL LAST A LONG TIME . These old cells do not need renewing half as often as has been represented . It is the interest of these patent-venders to sell rights ; this interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internal monitor of right , while acquisitiveness is gratified . The same cells can be used for breeding six or eight years , perhaps longer , and no one can tell the difference by the size of the bees ; I have two stocks now in their tenth year without renewal of comb . A neighbor of mine kept a stock twelve years in the same combs ; it proved as prosperous as any . I have heard of their lasting twenty , and am inclined to believe it . CELLS LARGER THAN NECESSARY AT FIRST . The bees seem to make a provision for this emergency , the sheets of comb are farther apart than actually necessary at first , the diameter of the cell is also a little larger than the size of the young bee requires . Of this we are certain  --  great many young bees can be raised in a cell , and not be diminished in size , sufficient to be detected . The bottom fills up faster than at the sides , and as they do so , the bees add a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on two parallel combs approximate too close to allow the bees to pass freely ; before which time it is unnecessary to remove comb for being old . EXPENSE OF RENEWING COMBS . One important item should be considered in this matter , by those who are so eager for new combs . It is doubtful whether one in 500 ever thought of the expense of renewing comb . I find it estimated by one writer , 2 that twenty-five lbs . of honey was consumed in elaborating about half lb. wax . This without doubt is an over estimate , but no one will deny that some is used . 2 See Appendix of Cottage Bee-keeper , page 118 . BEST TO USE OLD COMBS AS LONG AS THEY WILL ANSWER . I am satisfied of this much , from actual experience , that every time the bees have to renew their brood-combs in a hive , they would make from ten to twenty-five lbs . in boxes , hence I infer that their time can be more profitably employed than in constructing brood-combs every year . I would also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the best use they can be applied to , after that , as the cocoons render it unfit for much else than a little wax . METHOD FOR PRUNING WHEN NECESSARY . But when the combs do actually need removing , I prefer the following method of pruning , to driving the bees out entirely , as has been recommended . It can be done in about an hour . As we are comparing the merits of different methods of getting rid of old combs , I shall give mine here , notwithstanding it may seem a little out of place . The best time is a little before night . The first movement is to blow under the hive some tobacco smoke ( the best means of charming them I ever found ) ; the bees , deprived of all disposition to sting , retreat up among the combs to get away from the smoke ; now raise the hive from the stand and carefully turn it bottom upwards , avoiding any jar , as some of the bees that were in the top when the smoke was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now come to the bottom to ascertain the cause of the disturbance ; these should receive a share , and they will immediately return to the top , perfectly satisfied . When so many bees are in the hive , as to be in the way in pruning , ( which if there is not it is not worth it , ) get an empty hive the size of the old one , and set it over , stopping the holes ; now strike the lower hive with a hammer or stick , lightly and rapidly , five or ten minutes , when nearly all the bees will be in the upper hive , and set that on the stand . There being now nothing in the way , except a few scattering bees , that I will warrant not to sting , unless you pinch or get them fast . Illustration : TOOLS FOR CUTTING OUT COMB . The broad one is very readily made from a piece of an old scythe , about 18 inches long , by any blacksmith , by simply taking off the back , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The end should be ground all on one side , and square across like a carpenter 's chisel . This is for cutting down the sides of the hive ; the level will keep it close the whole length , when you wish to remove all the combs ; it being square instead of pointed or rounded , no difficulty will be found in guiding it ,  --  it being very thin ; no combs are mashed by crowding . The other tool is for cutting off combs at the top or any other place . It is merely a rod of steel three-eighths of an inch diameter , about two feet long , with a thin blade at right angles , one and a half inches long , and a quarter inch wide , both edges sharp , upper side bevelled , bottom flat , &c.; You will find these tools very convenient ; be sure and get them by all means , the cost can not be compared to the advantages . Now with the tools just described , proceed to remove the brood-combs from the centre of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used but little for breeding , and are generally filled with honey ; these should be left as a good start for refilling , but take out all that is necessary , while you are about it ; then reverse the hives , putting the one containing the bees under the other ; by the next morning all are up ; now put it on the stand , and this job is done without one cent extra expense for a patent to help you , and the bees are much better off for the honey left , which has to be taken away with all patent plans that I have seen , and this , as has been remarked , is not worth much , occupied as it is with a few cocoons and bee-bread . It is worth much more to the bees , and they will give us pure comb and honey for it . USE OF TOBACCO SMOKE . " I would not do it for fifty dollars , the bees would sting me to death . " Stop a moment , if you never tried the efficacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent ; this is the grand secret of success ; without it , I admit it would be somewhat hazardous ; but with it , I have done it time after time without receiving a single sting , and no protection whatever , for either hands or face . But is there no difficulty with our sectional or changeable hive , when this feat is to be performed ? The combs will be made in the two drawers similar to the dividing hive , brood-combs in one side , and store-combs in the other . We wish to remove the one with brood-combs of course , ( as that is the one where the combs are thick and bad , &c.); Where will the queen be ? With the brood-comb , where her duty is most likely to be ; well , this is the one we want , and we take it out . How is she to get back ? She must go back , or we have three chances in four of losing the stock ; but her majesty will remain perfectly easy , as well as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FURTHER OBJECTIONS TO A SECTIONAL HIVE . I can see no other way but to break the box , look her up , and help the helpless thing home , ( the chances of being stung may be here too . ) Now , for a time at least , they must use the other drawer for breeding , where most of the cells are unfit . There is altogether too great a proportion of drone-cells ; these , as well as the other size , will nearly all be much too long , and will have to be cut off to the proper length , a waste of wax as well as labor . Another thing might be set down per disadvantage of Mr. Cutting 's hive ; the job of getting a swarm into such hive , at first , I fancy would not be desirable to many . Now , when we strike the balance , putting expense , difficulties , and perplexities on one side , and simplicity and economy on the other , it appears like a " great cry for little wool . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its favor : second , third , and fourth are borrowed from the common hive , or are all available here when required . But fifthly , allows a " column of air between the drawers and outside of the hive , is a non-conductor of heat and cold , " &c.; This is an advantage not possessed by the common hive ; neither does the common hive offer such advantages to the moth , by affording such snug quarters for worms to spin their cocoons , when they can not be destroyed without considerable trouble . NON-SWARMERS . Here I will endeavor to be brief ; I feel anxious to get through with this disagreeable part , where every word I say will clash with somebody 's interest or prejudice . The merits of this hive are to obtain surplus honey with but little trouble , which often succeeds in satisfying people of its utility . The principal objection is found on the score of profit . Suppose we start with one , call it worth five dollars in the beginning , at the end of ten years it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the chances of its failing , short of that time , we will not take into the account ; ) we might get annually , say five dollars worth of surplus honey , amounting to fifty dollars . CONTRAST OF PROFIT . The swarming hive , we suppose , will throw off one swarm annually , and make us one dollar 's worth of surplus honey , ( we will not reckon that yielded by the first swarm , which is often more than that from the old stocks , ) about one third of the average in good seasons . The second year there will be two to do the same ; take this rate for ten years , we have 512 stocks , either of them worth as much as the non-swarmer , and about a thousand dollars worth of surplus honey . Call these stocks worth five dollars each , which makes $2,560 , all added together will make the snug little sum of about $3,500 , against $55 . It is not to be expected that any of us will realize profits to this extent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swarming hive over the non-swarmer . PRINCIPLE OF SWARMING NOT UNDERSTOOD . But many of these non-swarmers , ' t is said , can be changed to swarmers to suit the convenience of the apiarian  --  Colton 's is one . It is asserted that it can be made to swarm within two days at any time , merely by taking off the six boxes or drawers that are very ingeniously attached ; as this contracts the room , the bees are forced out . Now I will candidly confess that I could never get this thing to work at all . Of this I am quite positive , that he ( Mr. Colton ) is either ignorant of the necessary and regular preparations that bees make before swarming , or supposes others are . Mr. Weeks has advocated the same principle : he says , " There is no queen in any stage of existence , in the old stock , immediately after the first swarm leaves it . " I have examined this matter till I am satisfied I risk but little in the bold assertion , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a week after commencing preparations . This opinion will be adopted by whoever will take the trouble to investigate for themselves . ( The chapter on swarming will give the necessary instructions for examining this point , if you wish . ) NOT TO BE DEPENDED UPON . Further , these non-swarmers are not always to be depended upon as such . They will sometimes throw off swarms when there is abundant room in the hive as well as in the boxes . HIVES NOT ALWAYS FULL BEFORE SWARMING . I know Weeks , Colton , Miner and others , tell us the hive must be full before we need expect a swarm ; but experience is against them . Bees do sometimes cast a swarm before filling the hive . From close observation , I find when a hive is very large , say 4,000 cubic inches , and is filled with comb , the first season , that such seldom swarm except in very good years . SIZE OF HIVES NEEDED . But if such hive is only half full , or 2,000 inches , it is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; proving very conclusively that a hive that size , is sufficient for all their wants in the breeding season . When about 1,200 inches only had been filled the first year , I have known them to add combs until they had filled about 1,800 , and then cast a swarm , proving also that a little less than 2,000 will do for breeding . I have tested the principle of giving room to prevent swarming , a little further . AN EXPERIMENT . In the spring of ' 47 , I placed under five full hives , containing 2,000 solid or cubic inches , as many empty ones , the same size , without the top . I had a swarm from each ; but two had added any new comb , and these but little . If these hives had been filled to the bottom with comb in the spring , it is very doubtful whether either of them would have swarmed . The only place we can put a good stock and not expect it to swarm in good seasons , is inside a building , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been known to do it . If we could manage to get a very large hive filled with combs , it would perhaps be as good a preventive as any . All the bees that could be reared in one season , would have sufficient room in the combs ready made for their labors , and there would be no necessity for their emigration . " But what becomes of all the bees raised in the course of several years ? " To this question I shall not probably be able to give a satisfactory answer at present . BEES DO NOT INCREASE , IF FULL , AFTER THE FIRST YEAR , IN SAME HIVE . I only will notice the fact , that the bees somehow disappear , and there is no more at the end of five years than at the end of one . A stock of bees may contain 6,000 the first of May , and raise 20,000 in the course of the year ; by the first of the next May , as a general thing , not one more will be found , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now this fact is not known by a recent patentee from the State of Maine , ( else he supposes others do not , ) as he recommends placing bees in a house , and empty hives in connection with the one containing bees , and in a few years all will be full . He has discovered a mixture to feed bees , ( to be noticed hereafter ) ; this may account for an unusual quantity being stored by an ordinary sized family . He said another thing , that is , each of these added hives would contain a queen ! This would seem to explain away the first difficulty of the continued increase of bees , and so it would if it did not get into another equally erroneous ; one error never made another true . This idea of bees raising a queen , merely because they have a side box to the main hive , is contrary to all my experience , and to the experience of all writers ( except himself ) that I have consulted . If the principle is correct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top or side for us ? I never discovered a single instance , where two perfect queens were quietly about their duties in connection with one hive . The deadly hostility of queens is known to all observing apiarians . Not having the least faith in the principle , I will leave it . UTILITY OF MOTH-PROOF HIVES DOUBTED . As for moth-proof hives , I have but little to say , as I have not the least faith in one of them . When I come to speak of that insect , I will show , I think , conclusively , that no place where bees are allowed to enter is safe from them . Several other perfect hives might be mentioned ; yet I believe that I have noticed the principles of each . Have I not said enough ? Such as are not satisfied now would not be if I filled a volume . Our view of things is the result of a thousand various causes ; the most powerful is interest , or prejudice . It is said that in Europe , the same ingenuity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her natural instinct to unnatural tenements ; tenements invented not because the bee needs them , but because this is a means available for a little change . " Patent men " have found the people generally too ignorant of apiarian science . But let us hope that their days of prosperity in this line are about numbered . INSTINCTS OF THE BEE ALWAYS THE SAME . Let us fully understand that the nature of the bee , when viewed under any condition , climate , or circumstance , is the same . Instincts first implanted by the hand of the Creator , have passed through millions of generations , unimpaired , to the present day , and will continue unchanged through all future time , till the last bee passes from the earth . We may , we have , to gratify acquisitiveness , forced them to labor under every disadvantage ; yes , we have compelled them to sacrifice their industry , prosperity , and even their lives have been yielded , but never their instincts . We may destroy life , but can not improve or take from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immutable as the Universe . Spring returns to its annual task ; dissolves the frost , warms into life nature 's dormant powers . Flowers with a smile of joy , expand their delicate petals in grateful thanks , while the stamens sustain upon their tapering points the anthers covered with the fertilizing pollen , and the pistil springs from a cup of liquid nectar , imparting to each passing breeze delicious fragrance , inviting the bee as with a thousand tongues to the sumptuous banquet . She does not need an artificial stimulus from man , as an inducement to partake of the feast ; without his aid or assistance she visits each wasting cup of sweetness , and secures the tiny drop , while the superabundant farina , dislodged from the nodding anthers , covers her body , to be brushed together and kneaded into bread . All she requires at the hands of man , is a suitable storehouse for her treasures . In good seasons , her nature Will prompt the gathering for her own use an over supply . This surplus man may appropriate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing his management is in accordance with their nature . PROFIT THE OBJECT . To give the bees all necessary advantages , and obtain the greatest possible amount of profit , with the least possible expense , has been my study for years . I might keep a few stocks for amusement , even if it was attended with no dollar and cent profit , but the number would be very small ; I will honestly confess then , that profit is the actuating principle with me . I have a strong suspicion that the majority of readers have similar motives . I am sure , then , that all of us with these views , will consider it a pity , when a stock produces five dollars worth of surplus honey , to be obliged to pay three or four of it for patent and other useless fixings . COMMON HIVE RECOMMENDED . I would not exchange the hive I have used for the last ten years for any patent I ever saw , if furnished gratis . I will guarantee that it affords means to obtain surplus honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may dictate , whether in wood or glass , and what is more than all , it shall cost nothing for the privilege of using . SIZE IMPORTANT . After deciding what kind of hive we want , the next important point is the size . Dr. Bevan , an English author , recommends a size " eleven and three-eighths inches square , by nine deep in the clear , " making only about 1,200 inches , and so few pounds necessary to winter the bees , that when I read it , I found myself wondering if the English inch and pound were the same as ours . SMALL HIVES MORE LIABLE TO ACCIDENTS . At all events , I think it too small for our Yankee bees in any place . We must remember , that the queen needs room for all her eggs , and the bees need space to store their winter provisions ; for reasons before given , this should be in one apartment . When this is too small , the consequences will be , their winter supply of food is liable to run out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock much more liable to accidents , which soon finish them off . APT TO DECEIVE . Yet I can imagine how one can be deceived by such a small hive , and recommend it strongly ; especially if patented . Suppose you locate a large swarm in a hive near the size of Dr. Bevan 's ; the bees would occupy nearly all the room with brood-combs ; now if you put on boxes , and as soon as filled put on empty ones , the amount of surplus honey would be great ; very satisfactory for the first summer , but in a year or two your little hive is gone . This result will be in proportion as we enlarge our hives , until we arrive at the opposite extreme . UNPROFITABLE IF TOO LARGE . If too large , more honey will be stored than is required for their winter use . It is evident a portion might have been taken , if it had been stored in boxes . The swarms will not be proportionably large when they do issue , which is seldom  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are but little profit in surplus honey , or swarms . CORRECT SIZE BETWEEN TWO EXTREMES . Between the two extremes , like most other cases , is found the correct place . A hive twelve inches square , each way , inside , has been recommended as the correct size . Here are 1,728 cubic inches . This , I think , is sufficient for many places , as the queen probably has all the room necessary for depositing her eggs ; and as the swarms are more numerous , and nearly as large as from hives much larger ; also , there is room for honey sufficient to carry the bees through the winter , at least , in many sections south of 40 degrees latitude , where the winter is somewhat short . SIZE FOR WARM LATITUDES . This size will also do in this latitude ( 42 degrees , ) in some seasons , but not at all in others. 3 Not one swarm in fifty will consume twenty-five lbs . of honey through the winter , that is , from the last of September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The average loss in that time is about eighteen lbs. ; but the critical time is later ; about the last of May , or first of June , in many places . 3 When Mr. Miner wrote his manual recommending this size , 1,728 inches , for all situations , it should be remembered he lived on Long Island . Since removing to Oneida County in this State , either his own experience or some other cause has changed his views , as he now recommends my size , viz. , 2,000 inches . LARGER HIVE MORE SAFE FOR LONG WINTERS OR BACKWARD SPRING . About the first of April they commence collecting pollen and rearing their young ; by the middle of May all good stocks will occupy nearly , if not quite all , their brood-combs for that purpose , but little honey is obtained before fruit blossoms appear ; when these are gone , no more of any amount is obtained until clover appears , which is some ten days later . ( I am speaking now particularly of this section ; I am aware it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . ) Now if this season of fruit flowers should be accompanied by high winds , or cold rainy weather , but little honey is obtained ; and our bees have a numerous brood on hand that must be fed . In this emergency , if no honey is on hand of the previous year , a famine ensues ; they destroy their drones , perhaps some of their brood , and for aught I know put the old bees on short allowance . This I do know , that the whole family has actually starved at this season ; sometimes in small hives . This of course depends on the season ; when favorable , nothing of the kind occurs . Prudence therefore dictates the necessity of a provision for this emergency , by making the hive a little larger for northern latitudes , as a little more honey will be stored to take them through this critical period . From a series of experiments closely observed . 2,000 INCHES SAFE FOR THIS SECTION . I am satisfied that 2,000 inches in the clear , is the proper size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On an average , swarms from this size are as large as any . The dimensions should be uniform in all cases , whatever size is decided on . It is folly to accommodate each swarm with a hive corresponding in size ; a very small family this year , may be very large next , and a very large one , very small , &c.; A queen belonging to a small swarm will be capable of depositing as many eggs , as another belonging to a barrel full . A small family able to get through the winter and spring , may be expected by another year to be as numerous as any . KIND OF WOOD , WIDTH OF BOARD , ETC . Of the kinds of wood for hives , pine is preferable , still other kinds will do ; I have no faith in bees liking one kind better than another , and less likely to leave on that account . Hemlock is cheaper , and used to a great extent ; when perfectly sound is as good as anything , but is very liable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time . It should be used only when better wood can not be obtained . Bass wood when used for hives should always be painted , and then will be very liable to warp from the moisture arising from the bees inside . When not painted outside , and allowed to get wet , if only for a few hours , so much moisture is absorbed that it will bend outward , and cleave from the combs and crack them . A few days of dry weather will relieve the outside of water , and the inside kept moist by the bees , the bending will be reversed , and the combs pressed inward , keeping the bees fixing that which will not " stay fixed . " Perhaps there is wood as suitable or better than pine , but it is not as common . SHAPE OF NO CONSEQUENCE . Boards should be selected , if possible , that will be the proper width to make the hive about square , of the right size . Say twelve inches square , inside , by fourteen deep . I prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all important . I have had some ten inches square by twenty in length ; they were awkward looking , but that was all , I could discover no difference in their prosperity . Also , I have had them twelve inches deep by thirteen square , with the same result . Hence , if we avoid extremes , and give the required room , the shape can make but little difference . It has been recommended to plane the boards for hives , " inside and out ; " but bees , when first put into such hive , find much difficulty in holding fast until they get their combs started , hence this trouble is worse than useless . DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING HIVES . If hives are not desired of the cheapest possible construction , the outside may be planed and painted ; but it is doubtful whether strict economy would demand it . Yet a painted hive appears so much better , that it ought to be done , especially as the paint adds almost enough to its durability to pay the expense . The color may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted by one color more than another . White is affected the least by the sun in hot weather . Lime is put on as white-wash , annually , by many , as a protection against insects . When hives are not painted , the grain should never be crosswise , having the width of boards form the height ; not that the bees would have any dislike to such , but nails will not hold firmly , they draw out in a few years . The size , shape , materials , and manner of putting together , are now sufficiently understood , for what I want . Sticks half an inch in diameter , should cross each way through the centre , to help support the combs . A hole about an inch diameter in the front side , half way to the top , is a great convenience for the bees to enter when coming home heavy laden . It now remains to make the top , cover , and boxes , ( the bottom-board will be described in another chapter . ) The tops should be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size ; three-fourths of an inch is the best thickness , ( inch will do ; ) plane the upper side , rabbet out around the edge of the upper side one inch wide , and three-eighths deep ; this will leave the top inside the rabbeting , just thirteen inches . SIZE OF CAP AND BOXES . A box for a cover or cap , that size inside , will fit any hive . The height of this box should be seven inches . Of course other sizes will do , but it is best to commence with one that we can adhere to uniformly , and no vexations arise by covers not fitting exactly , &c.; I think this size is as near correct as we shall be likely to get ; we want all the room in the boxes that the majority of our stocks demand for storing in a yield of honey , 4 at the same time not be necessitated to give too much of the room in the height . They will commence work in a box five inches high , much sooner than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have the boxes less than five inches high , would require more than thirteen inches on the top , this would make the hive too much out of shape ; it would appear top-heavy . 4 I have added a side box occasionally , but it has seldom paid me for the trouble . MINER 'S HIVE . Miner 's Equilateral Hive has a cap somewhat smaller than this in diameter ; consequently , if we have the requisite room , it must be in its height . But by making the cap of his a little larger , and a few trifling alterations , it would do very well for a patent . And if any one must have a patent hive , my advice is to get that ; it costs but two dollars for the right of using , and is nearer what we want for bees , than any I ever saw . I prefer rabbeting around the edge of the top , instead of nailing on a thin board the size of the inside of the cover , with room for a slide under it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin their cocoons . Also , without the rabbeting water may get under the cap , and pass along the top till a hole lets it among the bees . As for slides , I do not approve of them at all ; in shutting off communication , it is almost certain to crush a few bees . This makes them irritable for a week ; they are unnecessary for me , at least . We will now finish the hive . DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING HOLES . After the top is got out as directed , strike a line through the centre , three and a quarter inches from this , make another on each side , now measure on one of the last lines , two and a half inches for the first hole , two inches for the next , and so on till five are marked on this , and the same number on the other side , ten in all ; these holes should be about an inch diameter , a pattern three and a quarter inches wide , and thirteen in length , with places for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made . When this top is nailed on , the hive is ready . A less number of holes is often used , and one is thought by some to be sufficient ; experience has satisfied me that the more room bees have to enter boxes , the less reluctance is manifested in commencing their work in them ; but here is another extreme to be avoided : when the holes are much larger , or more of them , or even one very large one , the queen is very apt to go into the boxes and deposit her eggs , which renders the comb tough , dark , &c.,; also bee-bread is stored near the brood . Dr. Bevan 's and Miner 's cross-bar hives are objectionable on this account , they offer too free access to the boxes ; we want all the room that will answer , and no more . A SUGGESTION . Mr. Miner 's cross-bar hive is intended to make the bees construct all straight combs , and probably will do it . But the disadvantage of bee-bread and brood in the boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of those who have been made to believe straight combs all important , and perhaps have purchased the right to make the hive , and had some constructed , and have found bee-bread in their surplus honey , I would suggest an improvement , ( that is , if it is thought the straight combs will pay . If you have not the right for the cross-bar hive , and you wish to use it , I would say , buy the right , and remove all grounds of complaint with him . ) Put in the bars and hive your bees as he directs . After all the combs are started , instead of setting the open bottom boxes ( which are also unsuitable for sending to market ) directly on the bars as he recommends , take off the cloth , and with screws fasten on a top with ten holes , that I have just described ; and then you will have the straight combs , and surplus honey in the boxes pure . GLASS BOXES PREFERRED . Having told how I make a hive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of boxes . I have taken great quantities of honey to market , put up in every style , such as tumblers , glass jars , glass boxes , wooden boxes with glass ends , and boxes all wood . I have found the square glass boxes the most profitable ; the honey in such appears to the best possible advantage , so much so , that the majority of purchasers prefer paying for the box at the same rate as the honey , than the wood box , and have the tare allowed . This rate of selling boxes always pays the cost , while we get nothing for the wood . Another advantage in this kind of boxes is , while being filled , the progress can be watched , and the time they are finished known precisely , when they should be taken off , as every day they remain after that , soils the purity of the combs . GLASS BOXES  --  HOW TO MAKE . Directions for making.  --  Select half-inch boards of pine or other soft light wood , cut the length twelve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the thickness to three-eighths or less , two pieces for a box , top and bottom , in the bottom bore five holes throughout the centre to match with those in the top of the hive , ( the pattern used in marking the top of hives is just the one to mark these ) . Next , get out the corner posts , five-eighths of an inch square , and five inches in length ; with a saw , thick enough to fit the glass , cut a channel length-wise on two sides , one-fourth of an inch deep , one-eighth from the corner , for the glass . A small lath nail through each corner of the bottom into the posts will hold them ; it is now ready for the glass  --  10x12 is the right size to get  --  have them cut through the centre the longest way for the sides , and they are right , and again the other way , five and five-eighths long for the ends . These can now be slipped into the channels of the posts , and the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready . GUIDE-COMBS NECESSARY . It will be found a great advantage , previous to nailing on the top , to stick fast to it some pieces of guide-combs in the direction you wish the bees to work . They are also an inducement for them to commence several days sooner , than if they had to start combs for themselves ; 5 a piece an inch square will do ; it is well to start every comb you want in the box ; two inches apart is about the right distance to look well . To make these pieces hold fast , melt one edge by the fire , or candle , or melt some bees-wax , and dip one edge in that , and apply it before cooling ; with a little practice you can make them stick without difficulty . For a supply of such combs , save all empty , clean , white pieces you can , when removing combs from a hive . 5 A line of bees-wax made with a guide-plate , or other means , is found to be of but little use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass boxes , so much the better , make them so by all means : " The best way is as good as any . " I give my method to be used only when better is not convenient . If you sell honey , I think you will find it an advantage to have glass boxes made in some way . Two of this size when full weigh 25 lbs . If preferred , four boxes six and three-eighths inches square , can be used for a hive instead of two ; the expense of making is a little more for the same number of lbs. , yet , when it is in market , a few customers will prefer this size . WOOD BOXES . For home consumption , the wood-box will answer equally well for all purposes of obtaining the honey , but will give no chance to watch the progress of the bees , unless a glass is inserted for the purpose , and then it will need a door to keep it dark , or a cover over the whole like the one for glass boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made with open bottom , and set on the top of the hive . A passage for the bees out of the box to the open air is unnecessary , and worse than useless . They like to store their honey as far from the entrance as possible . Unless crowded for room , they will not store much there when such entrances are made . Whether we intend to consume our surplus honey or not , it is as well to have the hives and covers made in a manner that we can use glass , when we are likely to have some to spare . I am not sure , but it would pay to make hives in this way , even if glass boxes were never used ; the rabbeting prevents light as well as water from passing under the cover ; imagine a box set on a plain board nailed on for a top , without the rabbeting ; the warping or bending admits the light and water , especially when hives are out in the weather , ( and I shall not recommend any other way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have termed the cap or box a cover ; but this should also be covered with a board laid on , if nothing else . A good roof for each hive can be made by fastening two boards together like the roof of a building ; let it be about 18 by 24 inches ; it being loose , can be changed in accordance with the season ; in spring , let the sun strike the hive ; but in hot weather let the longest end project over the south side , &c.; You can ornament this hive , if you choose , by mouldings or dentals , under the top , where it projects over the body of the hive , also the cap can have the top projected a little and receive the same addition . JARS AND TUMBLERS  --  HOW PREPARED . When jars , tumblers , or other vessels , that are all glass , are used , it is absolutely necessary to fasten as many pieces of combs as you wish made , in the top , for a beginning , or fasten a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without a start . Some of you may have seen paraded at our fairs , or in the public parts of some of our cities , hives containing tumblers , some of them neatly filled , others empty , and this meagre sentence written upon them , not to be filled ! Pretending to govern the bees , as the juggler sometimes does his tricks , by mysterious incantations ! I once encountered an agent of this humbug , and modestly suggested to him that I had a counter charm : that I could put a tumbler on his hive and it would be filled if the others were , however much he might forbid it by written charms ! He saw at a glance how the matter stood ; I was not the customer he wanted , and intimated that the show was only intended for the extreme verdancy of most visitors . It no doubt assisted in displaying his profound knowledge in bee management , which he wished to establish , as he had a little work on the subject to sell , also hives , and bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the reason that those tumblers were not filled , was because no combs were put in for a start . PERFECT OBSERVATORY HIVE DESCRIBED . There are many things pertaining to bees that can not be properly examined and understood , without a glass hive of some sort . Yet a perfect observatory hive containing but one comb , is not a perfect hive for the bees . We can see very well what the bees are doing , but it is not a tenement they would choose if left to themselves . It forces them to labor in an unnatural manner , is unsuitable for wintering bees , and otherwise but little profit . If the satisfaction of witnessing some of their operations more perfectly than in glass hives of another kind will not pay , it is doubtful if we get it . I will describe as briefly as possible . Two frames or sashes about two and a half feet square , containing glass , are so fastened together as to leave room for only one comb between them , about an inch and three-fourths apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top and edges ; hence , it is necessary to put in numerous cross-bars to assist in supporting it . Outside the glass are doors to keep the whole dark , to be opened when we wish to inspect proceedings . Under the bottom is a board or frame , to keep it in an upright position , &c.; Probably but few will be induced to make one . I will therefore describe another ; a hive that I think will pay better . ONE LIKE COMMON HIVE PREFERRED . If we expect to know what bees are doing in ordinary hives , we must have one similar in every respect , in size , shape , number of bees , &c.; The construction of royal cells will be watched by most observers with the greatest interest ; now these are generally on one edge of the combs . The bees leave a space half an inch or more between the edges of the combs and one side of the hive , near half the length of it , apparently for no other purpose but to have room for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are generally attached to the hive at the bottom . WHAT MAY BE SEEN . Now instead of having one piece or pane of glass in the side of several hives , I would recommend having one or more with glass on every side ; because we might have it on three sides , and not the fourth ; and this might contain all the queen cells , and we should miss an important sight . There are many other things to be witnessed in such a hive . The queen may be often seen depositing her eggs ! We may see the workers detach the scales of wax from their abdomen , and apply them to the combs during the process of construction , see them deposit pollen from their legs , store their honey , feed the queen , each other , their young brood , seal over cells containing brood , honey , &c.; It is further useful as a guide for putting boxes on other hives , ( that is , if it is a good one , which it should be ) ; we can easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR MAKING GLASS HIVE . My method of making them is as follows : The top is like those for other hives , fifteen inches square , adapted to boxes and cover . This hive we want to be as profitable as any , giving us surplus honey , and swarms like others . Four posts are then got out , two inches square , and thirteen in length ; care should be taken to have the ends perfectly square . A frame is then to be made , just fourteen inches square outside , for the bottom ; the pieces are one inch thick , by two in width , halved together at the corners . A guage-mark is then made around the under side of the top , half an inch from the edge , a post is then set inside of each corner of this mark , and thoroughly nailed , the bottom is nailed on with the posts even with the outside corners . Four pieces an inch thick , and an inch and a half wide , are fitted between the posts , even with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter by half an inch , are got out , eight to be ten , and eight twelve inches long . A gauge-mark one inch from posts , bottom , &c.,; is the place to nail these strips ; very small nails or tacks will hold them . The panes of glass are to rest against them , which are held in their places by small pieces of tin , or brads . The doors are the size of the glass , 10x12 , about three-fourths of an inch thick ; these doors are cut a little too short , and the pieces , to prevent warping , are nailed on the ends ; these are hung to a post on one side , and secured by a button on the other . On two opposite sides inside the posts , half way up , two strips , half an inch by three quarters , are nailed , with holes in them for the cross-sticks ; one way is enough if you have guide-combs for a start , like those recommended for boxes , so that the sheets will be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross both ways , about three each way will be needed , as the glass at the edges is not so good a support as wood . The cap can be made of half inch boards ; the top to project over like the hive , or let it be a little more than half an inch , it will admit a heavier moulding , which should surround it here , as well as at the top of the hive , or if it is prefered , dentals can be used , and look equally well  --  when no ornament is wanted , omit it . But painting seems necessary for such hives , to prevent warping , and the swelling of the doors in wet weather ; these want to open and shut without rubbing or sticking , otherwise we disturb the bees every time a door is stirred . Putty should not be used to hold the glass , as the bees in the course of a few years will cover it with propolis ; it is then necessary to take it out , and scrape , clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be difficult ; cold weather is the time for this operation . I am aware that a hive can be more substantially made than the one here described ; but I have endeavored to make one as cheap as possible , and if properly made , will answer . The cost will be much less than many patents , and the satisfaction much more , at least , with many . When our hive contains a swarm of bees , and they are thoroughly in operation , we must not let them pass out at the bottom on every side , as they are frequently allowed to do from other hives ; because , should one come out a little excited in consequence of a slight jar , accidentally given the hive , on opening the door or some other way , and should find our face within a foot of their house , peering in the window among their works , it would be very likely to give us a gentle hint that it was a mark of low breeding , that we were not wanted there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business what they were doing . To prevent this as far as possible , a bottom-board , somewhat different from the common one , is needed . Four posts of chestnut or other lasting wood , about two inches square , are driven into the earth in the form of a square , far enough apart to come under the corners of the bottom-board , ( fifteen inches , ) and high enough for convenience when looking into the hive . The ends of these posts are to be perfectly level , and to which the bottom is to be nailed fast . As the hive is to sit perfectly close to the board , a passage must be made through it , as well as means for ventilation in hot weather , without raising the hive for that purpose . It requires a board about fifteen inches square , planed smooth , the ends clamped to prevent warping or splitting ; a portion of the centre is taken out , say six inches by ten , and wire cloth nailed over , four-ounce tacks will hold it , fasten it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very likely it will want to be taken off occasionally and cleaned from the propolis that will be spread over it . It is easiest done in freezing weather . Take an edge in each hand , and rock the wires a few times out of square , and it will readily crumble and fall out . In warm weather it must be scalded or burnt off . To close this space , a moving slide is fixed in grooves under-side , fastened to the posts or board . The slide is to be moved in accordance with the weather , when cold , close it , when hot , withdraw it , and give the bees as much air as possible , without raising the hive , the whole of such space is as much ventilation as ordinary hives raised an inch . ( Wire cloth is needed for other purposes , it is best to procure some , even at considerable trouble and expense . ) On the side of the board intended for the front , two inches from the edge of the wire cloth , a passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , by eleven in length . " But how is the bees to get to this place , so inconvenient , something is needed to assist them ? " Certainly , Sir ; an alighting board , eleven inches wide , and about two feet long , ( not planed ) , is placed at an angle of forty-five degrees , between the two front posts of your stand , the upper end passing under the bottom , far enough back ; to be just even with the back-side of the passage for the bees . The bees alight on this board , and walk up into the hive without difficulty . When the bees are at work pretty freely , and a door of this hive is opened , those that are about departing will be very likely to get on the glass , instead of through the opening at the bottom ; seeing the light through the glass , they endeavor to escape by the nearest route . When so many gather here as to prevent a good view , and you wish to observe further , shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own passage , when you can open your door again , for a short time . After the hive is filled with combs , the number attracted to the glass on opening a door will be much less . The plate on the preceding page represents a glass hive , cover , and stand . The common hive can be made equally ornamental , if you choose ; this kind of stand is unnecessary for them . I use such as are recommended on page 138 . CHAPTER III . BREEDING . IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD . The time that bees commence raising their young brood is but imperfectly understood by most people . Many persons that have kept them for years , have bestowed so little attention on this point , that they are unable to tell at what time they commence , how they progress , or when they cease . A kind of an idea that one swarm , and occasionally two or three , are reared sometime in June , or fore part of summer , is about the extent of their reflections on the subject . Whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workers are females , and each raise a young one or two , or whether the " king bee " is the chap for laying eggs , is a matter beyond their ability to answer . It is but a few years since , that a correspondent of a Journal of Agriculture denied the existence of a queen bee , giving the best reasons he had , no doubt , that is , he had never seen one . But bee-keepers of this class are so few , it is unnecessary to waste time to convince them ; suffice it to say , that a queen exists with every prosperous swarm , and all apiarians with much pretensions to science , acknowledge the fact , also , that she is the mother of the whole family . The period at which they commence depositing eggs probably depends on the strength of the colony , amount of honey on hand , &c.,; and not the time they commence gathering food . GOOD STOCK SELDOM WITHOUT BROOD . I once removed the bees from a hive on the tenth of January , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , and others in every stage of growth down to the egg . This hive had been in the house , and kept warm ; it will doubtless be supposed that being kept warm was the cause ; but this is not a solitary instance . A neighbor lost a hive the fourteenth February , in weather cold enough to seal the entrance with ice , and smother the bees . I assisted to remove the combs , and found young brood in abundance , from the perfect bee , through all stages of growth . This stock had been in the cold all winter . I have further noticed , when sweeping out the litter under the hives early in spring , say the first of March , that young bees would often be found under the best stocks . Hence it appears there is but little time , and perhaps none , when our best stocks have no broods . Yet stocks , when very weak , do not commence till warm weather . It seems that a certain degree of warmth is necessary to perfect the brood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMALL STOCKS COMMENCE . The first eggs are deposited in the centre of the cluster of bees , in a small family ; it may not be in the centre of the hive in all cases ; but the middle of the cluster is the warmest place , wherever located . Here the queen will first commence ; a few cells , or a space not larger than a dollar , is first used , those exactly opposite on the same comb are next occupied . If the warmth of the hive will allow , whether mild weather produces it , or the family be large enough to generate that which is artificial , appears to make no difference ; she will then take the next combs exactly corresponding with the first commencement but not quite as large a place is used as in the first comb . The circle of eggs in the first is then enlarged , and more are added in the next , &c.,; continuing to spread to the next combs , keeping the distance to the outside of the circle of eggs , to the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until they occupy the outside comb . Long before the outside comb is occupied , the first eggs deposited are matured , and the queen will return to the centre , and use these cells again , but is not so particular this time to fill so many in such exact order as at first . This is the general process of small or medium sized families . I have removed the bees from such , in all stages of breeding , and always found their proceedings as described . DIFFERENT WITH LARGER ONES . But with very large families , their proceedings are different : as any part of the cluster of bees is warm enough for breeding , there is less necessity for economizing heat , and having all the eggs confined to one small spot , some unoccupied cells will be found among the brood ; a few will contain honey and bee-bread . HOW POLLEN IS STORED IN THE BREEDING SEASON . But in the height of the breeding season , a circle of cells nearly all bee-bread , an inch or two wide , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably the principal food of the young bee , it is thus very convenient . When pollen is abundant , and the swarm is in prosperous condition , they soon reach the outside sheets of comb with the brood . At this period , when the hive is about full , and the queen is forced to the outside combs to find a place for her eggs , it is interesting to witness operations in a glass hive . I have seen her several times during one day , on the same piece of comb ( next the glass ) . The light has no immediate effect on her " Highness , " as she will quietly continue about her duty , not the least embarrassed by curious eyes at the window . Before depositing an egg , she enters the cell head first , probably to ascertain if it is in proper condition to receive it ; as a cell part filled with bee-bread or honey is never used . If the area of combs is small , or the family is small , and can not protect a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit two , and sometimes three , in one cell ( the supernumeraries I suppose are removed by the workers ) . But under prosperous circumstances , with a hive of suitable size , &c.,; this emergency is avoided . OPERATION OF LAYING AND THE EGGS DESCRIBED . When a cell is in a condition to receive the egg , on withdrawing her head she immediately curves her abdomen , and inserts it a few seconds . After leaving it , an egg may be seen attached by one end to the bottom ; about the sixteenth of an inch in length , slightly curved , very small , nearly uniform the whole length , abruptly rounded at the ends , semi-transparent , and covered with a very thin and extremely delicate coat , often breaking with the slightest touch . After the egg has been about three days in the cell , a small white worm may be seen coiled in the bottom , surrounded with a milky-like substance , which is its food , without doubt . How this food is prepared , is merely guess-work . The hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no objection to ; as it is sufficiently proved by the quantities that accumulate in hives that lose their queen , and rear no brood ( that is , when a requisite number of workers are so left ) . The workers may be seen entering the cell every few minutes , probably , to supply this food. 6 6 When the comb in our glass hive is new , and white , these operations can be seen more distinctly than when very old and dark . TIME FROM THE EGG TO THE PERFECT BEE . In about six days it is sealed over with a convex waxen lid . It is now hidden from our sight for about twelve days , when it bites off the cover , and comes forth a perfect bee . The period from the egg to the perfect bee varies from twenty to twenty-four days ; average about twenty-two for workers , twenty-four for drones . The temperature of the hive will vary some with the atmosphere ; it is also governed by the number of bees . A low temperature probably retards the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen accounts of the assiduous attentions given to the young bee when it first emerges from the cell : ' t is said they " lick it all over , feed it with honey , " &c.,; desperately pleased with their new acquisition . ROUGH TREATMENT OF THE YOUNG BEE . Now , if you expect to see anything of this , you must watch a little closer than I have . I have seen hundreds when biting their way out . Instead of care or notice , they often receive rather rough treatment : the workers , intent on other matters , will sometimes come in contact with one part way out the cell , with force sufficient to almost dislocate its neck ; yet they do not stop to see if any harm is done , or beg pardon . The little sufferer , after this rude lesson , scrambles back as soon as possible out of the way ; enlarges the prison door a little , and attempts again , with perhaps the same success : a dozen trials are often made before they succeed . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a multitude , with no friend to counsel , or mother to direct . It wanders about uncared for and unheeded , and rarely finds one sufficiently benevolent to bestow even the necessaries of life ; but does sometimes . It is generally forced to learn the important lesson of looking out for itself , the day it leaves the cradle . A cell containing honey is sought for , where its immediate wants are all supplied . GUESS WORK . The time before it is ready to leave the hive for honey , I might guess would be two or three days . Others have said " it would leave the day it left the cell ; " but I guess they guess at this point . They tell us , too , that after the bees seal over the cells containing the larvae , " they immediately commence spinning their cocoons , which takes just about thirty-six hours . " I think it very likely ; but when I admit it , I can not imagine how it was ascertained ;  --  the faculty of looking through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same optical penetration to look into one of these cells after it is sealed over , as it is all perfect darkness . Suppose we drive away the bees and open the cell , to give us a look at the interior : the little insect stops its labor in a moment , probably from the effect of air and light . I never could detect one in its labor . Suppose we open these cells every hour after sealing ; can we tell anything about their progress by the appearance of these cocoons , or even tell when they are finished ? The thickness of a dozen would not exceed common writing paper . When a subject is obscure , or difficult to ascertain , like this , why not tell us how they found out the particulars ; and if they were guessed at , be honest , and say so ? When the bee leaves the cell , a cocoon remains , and that is about all we know about it . TERMS APPLIED TO YOUNG BEES . The young bee , when it first leaves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or larva ; from this state it changes to the shape of the perfect bee , which is said to be three days after finishing the cocoon ; from the time of this change , till it is ready to leave the cell , the terms nymph , pupa , and chrysalis , are applied . The lid of the drone 's cell is rather more convex than that of the worker 's , and when removed by the young bee to work its way out , is left nearly perfect ; being cut off around the edges , a good coat or lining of silk keeps it whole ; while the covering of the worker 's cell is mostly wax , and is pretty well cut to pieces by the time the bee gets out . The covering to the queen 's cell is like the drone 's , but larger in diameter , and thicker , being lined with a little more silk . DISCREPANCY IN TIME IN REARING BROOD AS GIVEN BY HUBER . We are told by most writers , the period of time necessary to perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Huber leads the way , and the rest , supposing him to be right , repeat in substance his account as follows : That the whole time necessary to perfect a queen from the egg is sixteen days , the worker twenty , and the drone twenty-four days ; Huber ( as quoted by Harpers ) gives the time of each stage of development belonging to each kind of bee ; but is rather unfortunate in arithmetic ; the items , or stages , when added together , " do not prove , " as the school-boys say ; that is , he gains time by making his bee by degrees . He says , first , of the worker , " It remains three days in the egg , five in the grub state , it is thirty-six hours in spinning its cocoon ; in three days it changes to a nymph , passes six in that form , and then comes forth a perfect bee . " How do the items add ? The egg , 3 days . Grub , 5 " Spinning cocoon , 1-1/2 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6 "  --   --   --  - 18-1/2 days . One and a half days short . We will next see how the figures with the royal insect match ; recollect sixteen days are all she has allowed ; then , of the different stages , " three days in the egg , is five a worm , when the bees close its cell , and it immediately begins its cocoon , which is finished in twenty-four hours . During eleven days , and even sixteen hours of the twelfth , it remains in a state of complete repose . Its transformation into a nymph then takes place , in which state four days and part of the fifth are passed . " Now let us add the items : The egg , 3 days . A worm , 5 " Spinning a cocoon , ( 24 hours ) , 1 " Reposes eleven days and 16 hours , 11-2/3 " A nymph four days , and part of the fifth , 4-1/3 "  --   --   --  - 25 days . Now , reader , what do you make of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merest school-boy ought to know better ! Can we rely on such history ? Does it not prove the necessity of going over the whole ground , applying a test to every assertion , and a revision of the whole matter throughout ? My object is not to find fault , but to get at facts . When I see such guess-work as the above published to the world , in this enlightened age , gravely told to the rising generation , as a portion of natural history , I feel it a duty not to resist the inclination to expose the absurdity . THE NUMBER OF EGGS DEPOSITED BY THE QUEEN GUESSED AT . The number of eggs that a queen will deposit is often another point of guess-work . When the estimate does not exceed 200 per diem , I have no reason to dispute it ; the number will probably fall short in some cases , and exceed it in others . Some writers suppose that this number " would never produce a swarm , as the bees that are lost daily amount to , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight hundred to four thousand eggs in a day , from one queen . The only way to test the matter accurately , is by actually counting , in an observatory hive , or in one with sufficient empty combs to hold all the eggs she will deposit for a few days , when , by removing the bees , and counting carefully , we might ascertain , and yet several would have to be examined , before we could get at the average . The nearest I ever came to knowing anything about it happened as follows : A swarm left , and the queen from some cause was unable to cluster with it , and was found , after some trouble , in the grass a few rods off . She was put in the hive with the swarm about 11 o'clock , A.M. ; the next morning , at sunrise , I found on the bottom-board , among the scales of wax , 118 eggs that had been discharged in that time . Probably a few escaped notice , as the color is the same as wax scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some . I have several times found a few the next morning , under swarms hived the day previous , but never over thirty , except in this one instance . The reason of this queen not being able to fly well might have been an unusual burden of eggs . Perhaps it would be as well to mention here , that in all cases where eggs are found in the eggs a single female will lay , from 70,000 to 100,000 in a season . " Reaumer and Huber do not estimate so high . Another writer estimates 90,000 , in three months . Let the number be as it may , probably thousands are never perfected . During the spring months , in medium and small families , where the bees can protect with animal heat but a few combs , I have often found cells containing a plurality of eggs , two , three , and occasionally four , in a single cell . These supernumeraries must be removed , and frequently may be found amongst the dust on the bottom-board . A TEST FOR THE PRESENCE OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect has lost a queen at this season , her presence can be ascertained nine times in ten by this method . Sweep off the board clean , and look the next day or two after for these eggs . Take care that ants , or mice , have no chance to get them ; they might deceive you , being as fond of eggs for breakfast as anyone. 7 When one or more is found , or any immature bees , it is sufficient , no further proof of the presence of a queen is needed . 7 It is said that the bees will devour these eggs also . Another portion of eggs is wasted whenever a supply of their food fails ; if we remove the bees from a stock during a scarcity , when the hive is light , we will be very likely to find hundreds of eggs in the cells , and but very few advancing from that stage towards maturity . I have thus found it in the fall , in July , and sometimes the first of June , or at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores , to endanger the family 's supply . Now , instead of the fertility of the queen being greater in spring and first of summer than at other times , ( as we are often told ) , I would suggest the probability that a greater abundance of food at this season , and a greater number of empty cells , may be the reason of the greater number of bees matured . WHEN DRONES ARE REARED . Whenever the hive is well supplied with honey , and plenty of bees , a portion of eggs are deposited in the drone-cells , which three or four days more are necessary to mature than the worker . WHEN QUEENS ARE REARED . Also , when the combs become crowded with bees , and honey plenty , the preparations for young queens commence : as the first step towards swarming , from one to twenty royal cells are begun ; when about half completed , the queen ( if all continues favorable ) will deposit eggs in them , these will be glued fast by one end like those for the workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same kind of eggs that produce other bees . When hatched , the little worm will be supplied with a superabundance of food ; at least , it appears so from the fact , that a few times I have found a quantity remaining in the cell after the queen had left . The consistence of this food is about like cream , the color some lighter , or just tinged with yellow . If it was thin like water , or even honey , I can not imagine how it could be made to stay in the upper end of an inverted cell of that size in such quantities as are put in , as the bees often fill it near half full . Sometimes a cell of this kind will contain this food , and no worm to feed upon it . I guessed the bees had compounded more than their present necessities required , and that they stored it there to have it ready , also , that being there all might know it was for royalty . Illustration : PLATE OF THE THREE KINDS OF CELLS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than food given to the worker , and the difference in food changes the bee from a worker to a queen . I have nothing to say against this hypothesis ; it may be so , or the young bee being obliged to stand on its head may effect it , or both causes combined may effect the change . I never tasted this food , or found any test to apply . The preceding plate represents a piece of comb containing all the different cells  --  those at the left hand the size for drones . In the centre are few that appear sealed over , others nearly covered , others the larva in different stages of growth , as well as the eggs . Fig. 1 represents a queen 's cell just commenced . They are usually started thus far the first season , very frequently when the hive is only half or two-thirds full . Fig. 2 is a cell sufficiently advanced to receive the egg . Fig. 3 one finished , the stage when the first swarm leaves . Fig. 4 when a queen has been perfected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupant has been destroyed by a rival , and removed by the workers . It will be perceived that each finished queen 's cell contains as much wax as fifty made for the workers . LIABILITY OF BEING DESTROYED . In any stage from the egg to maturity these royal insects are liable to be destroyed ;  --  if honey fails from any cause sufficient to make the existence of a swarm any way hazardous , the preparations are abandoned , and these young queens destroyed ; ( I would here request the reader not to condemn me for telling more than I can prove , until he has had the whole story ; in the swarming season , I will give further particulars . ) DRONES DESTROYED WHEN HONEY IS SCARCE . When an occurrence like the above happens , the drones next fall victims to the failure of honey . A brief existence only is theirs ; such as are perfect , are destroyed without mercy ; those in the chrysalis state are often dragged out , and sacrificed to the necessities of the family . Such as are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they would be if honey was abundant , are allowed , while yet weak from the effects of hunger , to wander from the hive , and fall to the earth by hundreds . These effects attend only a scarcity in the early part of the season . The massacre of July and September is quite different . The drones then have age and strength  --  an effort is apparently first made by the workers to drive them out without proceeding to extremes ; they are harassed sometimes for several days ; the workers feigning only to sting , or else they can not , as I never succeeded in seeing but very few dispatched in that way ; yet there is evidence proving beyond doubt that the sting is used . Hundreds will often be collected together in a compact body at the bottom of the hive ; this mutual protection affording a few hours ' respite from their tormentors , who do not cease to worry them . In a few days they are gone , and it is a hard matter to tell what has become of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in September is well supplied with honey , a portion of the drones have a longer lease of life given them ; I have seen them as late as December . In some seasons , when the best hives are poorly supplied with stores , the ensuing spring the bees will rear no drones , until the flowers yield a good supply . I have known one or two years in which no drones appeared before the last of June ; at other times , thousands are matured by the first of May . OLD QUEEN LEAVES WITH THE FIRST SWARM . The old queen leaves with the first swarm ; as soon as cells are ready in the new hive she will deposit her eggs in them , at first for workers ; the number perfected will correspond with the supply of honey and size of the swarm . When the supply fails before leaving the old stock , she remains there , and continues laying throughout the season ; but the bees matured after the 20th of July ( in this section ) are not more than sufficient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lost during their excursions , as the young ones will replace ; in fact , they often lose rather than gain ; so that by the next spring , a hive that has cast no swarm , is no better for a stock than one from which a swarm has issued . We are apt to be deceived by bees clustering outside , towards the latter end of the season , and suppose it hardly possible for them all to get in , when it may be caused by hot weather , full stores , &c.; A YOUNG QUEEN TAKES THE PLACE OF HER MOTHER IN THE OLD STOCK . In ordinary circumstances , when a swarm has left a stock , the oldest of the young queens is ready to emerge from her cell in about eight or nine days ; if no second swarm is sent out , she will take her mother 's place , and begin to lay eggs in about ten days , or a little less . Two or three weeks is the only time throughout the whole season , but what eggs can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield of honey occurs , drones are reared ; as it becomes scarce , they are destroyed . The relative number of drones and workers that exist when they are most numerous , doubtless depends on the size of the hive , whether one in ten , or one in thirty . When a swarm is first hived , the first cells are the size for working ; if the hive be very small , and bees numerous , it may be filled before they are fully aware of it , and but few drone-cells constructed ; consequently , but few can be raised ; whereas if the hive be large , long before it is full , considerable honey will be stored . Cells for storing honey are usually the size for drones ; these will be made as soon as the requisite number for workers is provided . An abundant yield of honey during the process of filling a large hive , would therefore cause a great proportion of these cells to be built  --  the amount of drone-brood being governed by the same cause , is a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of these cells , where an unnecessary number of drones will be reared , causing a useless expenditure of honey , &c.; OTHER THEORIES . Theories differing materially from the foregoing , are advanced by nearly all writers . One says , " In spring the queen lays about 2,000 eggs of males , resumes it again in August , but during the rest of the intervals she exclusively lays worker eggs . The queen must be at least eleven months old before she begins to lay the eggs of males . " Mr. Townley makes the same assertion . Dr. Bevan says , " the great laying of drone eggs usually commences about the end of April . " Another author repeats about the same , and appears to have investigated farther , as he has found out that the eggs for the two kinds of bees are germinated separately , and the queen knows when each kind is ready , as well as the workers , &c.; Now , I beg leave to differ a little from these authors . Either there exists no difference in the eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or workers , just as they happen to be deposited and fed ; or else the periods of laying drone eggs are much more frequent than any writer with which I am acquainted has been willing to allow . SUBJECT NOT UNDERSTOOD . I am not anxious to establish a new theory , but to get at facts . If we pretend to understand natural history , it is important that we have it correct ; and if we do not understand it , say so , and leave it open for further investigation . It is my opinion that we know but very little about this point . I wish to induce closer observation , and would recommend no positive decision , until all the facts that will apply have been examined . Whether these drone-egg theories have been too hastily adopted , the reader can decide ; I shall offer a few more facts , somewhat difficult to reconcile with them . First , in relation to the queen being " eleven months old " before laying drone eggs . We all agree , I believe , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young one remains in the old stock . Now suppose the first swarm leaves in June , and the old stock yet contains a numerous family . The flowers of buckwheat in August yield a bountiful harvest of honey . This old stock rears a large brood of drones . Is it not proved in this case that the queen was but two months old , instead of eleven ? We further agree that young queens accompany second or after-swarms . When these happen to be large and prosperous , they never fail to rear a brood of drones at this season . What is the age of these ? I apprehend that this eleven months theory originated in sections where there are no crops of buckwheat raised , or in small quantities . Clover generally fails in August , and May , or June , of another year comes round , before there is a sufficient yield to produce the brood . With these observations only , how very rational to conclude that it must be a law of their nature , instead of being governed by the yield of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods of drone egg laying are limited to only two or three , it would seem that all queens ought to be ready with this kind of egg , about the same period of the season , but how are the facts ? I would like to inquire what becomes of the first series of drone eggs , the last of April , or the first of May , when the stocks are poorly supplied with honey , or when a family is small and but little honey through the summer ? No drone brood is matured in these cases . It is not pretended that the queen has any control over the germination of these eggs , yet somehow she has them ready whenever the situation of the hive will warrant it . Two stocks may have an equal number of bees the first of May ; one may have forty pounds of honey , the other four pounds ; the latter can not afford to rear a drone , while the other will have hundreds . Let two stocks have but four pounds each at any time in summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plentifully , and a brood of drones is sure to appear , while the other will not produce one . Whenever stocks are well stored with honey , and full of bees , the first of May will find drone-cells containing brood . If the flowers continue to yield a full supply , these cells may be examined every week from that period till the first swarm leaves , and I will engage that drone brood may be found in all stages from the egg to maturity ; and the worker brood the same . In twenty-four days after the first swarm leaves , the last drone eggs left by the old queen will be just about matured . When transferring bees from old to new hives , I generally do it about twenty-one or twenty-two days after the first swarm , ( this is the time to avoid destroying the worker-brood ; the particulars will be given in another place . ) I have transferred a great many , and never failed to find a few drones about ready to leave the combs . Whether the swarm had left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no difference , they were on hand . A very early swarm in good seasons , will often fill the hive , and send out an issue in from four to six weeks : the usual amount of drone-brood may be found in these cases . The following circumstance would appear to indicate that all the eggs are alike , and if they are laid in drone-cells , the bees give the proper food and make drones ; if in worker-cells , workers , just as they make a queen from a worker-egg , when put in a royal cell . In a glass hive , one sheet of comb next the glass , and parallel with it , was full size ; about three-quarters of this sheet was worker-cells , the remainder drone-cells . The family had been rather small , but now had increased to a full swarm ; a few drones had matured in the middle of the hive . It was about the middle of June , 1850 , when I discovered the bees on this outside sheet , preparing it , as I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper length . They had been used for storing honey , and were much too long , being about an inch and a half deep . In a day or two after I saw a few eggs in both worker and drone-cells ; four or five days afterwards , on opening the door , I found her " majesty " engaged in depositing eggs in the drone cells . Nearly every one already contained an egg ; most of these she examined , but did not use them ; six or eight , it appeared , were all that were unoccupied ; in each of these she immediately deposited an egg . She continued to search for more empty cells , and in doing so , she got on the part of the comb containing worker-cells , where she found a dozen or more empty , in each of which , she laid one . The whole time perhaps thirty minutes . Query ? Was her series of drone eggs exhausted just at this time ? If so , it would appear that she was not aware of it , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before leaving that part of the comb , and acted exactly as if she would have used them had they not been pre-occupied . Did the worker-cells receive some eggs that would have produced drones , but for the circumstance of being deposited in worker-cells ? I know we are told that an egg may be transferred from a worker-cell to one for drones , or an egg taken from a drone-cell and deposited in a worker-cell ; that the exchange will make no difference , the bee will be just what the first deposit would have made it . How the knowledge for this assertion was obtained , we are not informed , at least of the practical part . That an egg was ever detached from the bottom of one cell safely and successfully deposited in another , without breaking or injuring it in some manner , to make the bees refuse it , permit me at present to doubt . NECESSITY FOR FURTHER OBSERVATION . Can not some experiments , practicable to all , be instituted that will throw more light on this subject ? The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is evidently at fault . TWO SIDES OF THE QUESTION . If we suppose that the eggs are all alike , and the subsequent treatment makes either workers , drones , or queens , and look to analogy for support , we shall find much against , as well as for it . For instance , we find in almost every department of animated nature , that the sex of the germ of a future being is decided before being separated from the parent , as the eggs of fowls , &c.; Another fact , some queens ( averaging one in sixty or eighty ) deposit eggs that produce only drones , 8 whether in worker or drone-cells , proving that sex is decided in this case beyond controversy . Hence it would appear reasonable , if sex was decided by the ovaries of the queen , in one case , it would be in another . 8 I have had several such . It made no difference whether the eggs were in the worker-cells or drone-cells , the brood was all drones . When in the worker-cells , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lengthened about one-third . In an occurrence of this kind , the colony of workers will rapidly diminish in number , until too few are left to protect the combs from the moth . It occurs most frequently in spring , but I once had a case the last of summer . The first indications are an unusual number of caps , or covers of cells , being under and about the hive ; the workers , instead of increasing , grow less in number . When you fear this state of things , make a thorough examination , blow under the hive some tobacco smoke , as directed in pruning , invert the hive , part the combs till you can see the brood ; if the worker-cells contain drones , they are readily perceived , as they project beyond the usual even surface , being very irregular , here and there a few , or perhaps but one sticking out . The worker-brood , when in their own cells , form nearly an even surface ; so of the drones . The only remedy that I have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be obtained in the swarming season , or in the fall , better than at other times . To find the queen , paralyze with puff-ball , &c.; For directions see fall management . To allow the bees the power of making three kinds of bees from one kind of eggs , which would be virtually constituting a third sex , an anomaly not often found . The drones being males , and workers imperfect females with generative organs undeveloped , renders the anomaly of the third sex unnecessary . On the other side it might be said in reply : That if food and treatment would create or produce organs of generation in the female , by making an egg destined for a worker into a queen , ( a fact which all apiarians admit , ) why not food and treatment make the drone ? Is the difficulty of developing one kind of sexual organs greater than another ? Respecting the anomaly of the eggs of some queens producing only drones , the question might be asked , Is this more of an anomaly than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series ? It is all out of the usual line . Other animals or insects usually produce the sexes promiscuously . As we are ignorant of causes deciding sex in any case , we must acknowledge mystery to belong to both sides of the question here . The stumbling-block of more than two sexes , which seems so necessary to make plain , is no greater here than with some species of ants , that have , as we are told , king , queen , soldier and laborer . Four distinct and differently formed bodies , all belonging to one nest , and descended from one mother . Whether there are four distinct kinds of eggs producing them , or the power is given to the workers to develop such as are wanted , from one kind , we can not say . If we make two kinds of eggs , it helps the matter but very little . There is still an anomaly . There is but one perfect female in a nest to germinate eggs , and the myriads produced ( being over 80,000 in twenty-four hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our queen-bee is not a parallel case by any means . And yet they are similar , by having their offspring provided for without an effort of their own . I shall leave this matter for the present , hoping that something conclusive may occur in the course of my experiments , or those of others . At present I am inclined to think that the eggs are all alike , but am not fully satisfied . I am aware that this matter is of but little value or interest to many , but myself and a few others have " Yankee inquisitiveness " pretty well developed , and would like to know how it was managed . As for workers proving occasionally fertile , I have but little to say . After years of close observation directed to this point , I have been unable to discover anything to establish this opinion . Neither have I found the black bees described by some authors . It is true that in the middle or latter part of summer a portion will be much darker than others , and perhaps rather smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably the result of continued labor , peculiar food , or some incidental circumstance . I have a few times found a humble-bee under the hive , that had entered , and not finding his way out readily , was speedily shorn of his beautiful " locks , " and consequently his strength  --  that is , every particle of hair , down , feathers , bristles , or whatever he had been covered with , was completely removed by the bees , who had no regard for his beautiful alternating stripes of yellow and brown ; which left him the very picture of darkness . CHAPTER IV . BEE PASTURAGE . In some seasons the earth is covered with snow much later than others . When this occurs , a greater number of warm days are necessary to melt it , and start the flowers , than otherwise . SUBSTITUTE FOR POLLEN . During these warm days , while waiting for the flowers , the bees are anxious to do something . It is then interesting to watch them , and see what will be used as substitutes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen hundreds engaged on a heap of sawdust , gathering the minute particles into little pellets on their legs , seeming quite pleased with the acquisition . Rotten wood , when crumbled into powder , and dry , is also collected . Flour , when scattered near the hive , I have known to be taken up in considerable quantities . Some apiarians have fed it to their bees at this season , and consider it a great advantage ; I have not tested it sufficient to give an opinion . A substitute for honey is sap from a few kinds of trees , yet it all amounts to but very little . All these unnatural sources are abandoned when the flowers appear . MANNER OF PACKING IT . The particular manner of obtaining pollen has been witnessed by but very few persons , as it is generally brushed from their bodies and packed on their legs , while on the wing , thereby preventing a fair chance to inspect operations . When collecting only pollen they alight on the flowers , passing rapidly over the stamens , detaching a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , to be brushed together and packed into pellets when again on the wing . Thus they keep alternately flying and alighting until a load is obtained , when they immediately return to the hive ; each bee bringing several loads in a day . Honey , as it is collected , is deposited in the abdomen , and kept out of sight till stored in the hive . ALDER YIELDS THE FIRST . The first material gathered from flowers is pollen . Candle-alder ( Alnus Rubra ) 9 yields the first supply . The time of flowering varies from the 10th of March to the 20th of April . The amount afforded is also variable . Cold , freezing weather frequently destroys a great portion of these flowers after they are out . These staminate flowers are nearly perfected the season previous , and a few warm days in spring will bring them out , even before any leaves appear . When the weather continues fine , great quantities of farina are secured . 9 The botanical names are from Wood 's Class-Book . The time that bees commence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any means ; this matter depends on the weather through April and May . These remarks apply particularly to this section , Green County , New York , in latitude about 42 degrees . In other places many different trees , shrubs , and herbs , may be found yielding honey and pollen that scarcely exist here , producing far different results . Our swamps produce several varieties of willow , ( salix , ) that put out their blossoms very irregularly . Some of these bushes are a month earlier than others , and some of the buds on the same bush are a week or two later than the rest . These also afford only pollen , but are much more dependence than alder , as a turn of cold weather can not at any time destroy more than a small part . Next comes the aspen , ( Populus Tremuloides ) ; of this we have more than is necessary for any purpose . It is not a particular favorite with the bees , as but few , comparatively , visit it . It is followed very soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , that suits them better , but this , like the others , is often lost by freezing . The first honey obtained of any account is from the golden willow ( Salix Vitellina ) ; it yields no pollen , and is seldom injured by frost . Gooseberries , currants , cherries , pear and peach trees , add a share of both honey and pollen . Sugar maple ( Acer Saccharinum ) now throws out its ten thousand silken tassels , beautiful as gold . Strawberries modestly open their petals in invitation , but , like " obscure virtues , " are often neglected for the more conspicuous Dandelion , and the showy appearance and flagrant blossoms of the apple-trees , which now open their stores , offering to their acceptance a real harvest . FRUIT FLOWERS IMPORTANT IN GOOD WEATHER . In good weather , sometimes a gain of twenty lbs . is added to their stores , during this period of apple-tree blossoms . But we are seldom fortunate enough to have good weather all through this period , it being rainy , cloudy , cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frost at this time destroys all , and the gain of our bees is reversed , that is , they are lighter at the end than at the beginning of these flowers . Yet this is the season that decides their prosperity for the summer , whether they do first rate or otherwise . If good weather now , we expect our first swarms about the first of June ; if not , no subsequent yield of honey will make up for this deficiency . We now have a time of several days , from ten to fourteen , in which but few flowers exist . If our hives are poorly supplied when this scarcity occurs , it will so disarrange their plans for swarming , that no preparations are again made much before July , and sometimes not at all . In sections where the wild cherry ( Cerasus Seratina ) abounds , the flowers of this will appear and fill this time of scarcity , which this section annually presents . RED RASPBERRY A FAVORITE . The red raspberry ( Rubus Strigosus ) next presents the stamens as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace of the bee , by pouring out bounteous libations more prized by our industrious insect than wine . For several weeks they are allowed to partake of this exquisite beverage ; it is secreted at all hours and in all kinds of weather . When the morning is warm we often hear their cheerful humming among the leaves and flowers of this shrub , ere the sun appears above the horizon . The gentle shower , sufficient to induce man to seek a shelter , is often unheeded by the bee when luxuriating among these flowers ; even white clover , important as it is in furnishing the greatest part of their stores , at this season , would be neglected if there was only a full supply of this . Clover begins to blossom with the raspberry , and continues longer . We have an insufficient supply ( in this section ) in most seasons . Red clover probably secretes as much honey as the white , but the tube of the corolla being longer , the bee appears to be unable to reach it . Yet I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like slow business . Sorrel , ( Rumex Acetosella ) the pest of many farmers , is brought under contribution , and furnishes the precious dust in any quantity . Morning is the only part of the day appropriated to its collection . CATNIP , MOTHER-WORT , AND HOARHOUND ARE SOUGHT AFTER . Catnip , ( Nepeta Cataria , ) Mother-wort , ( Leonurus Cardiaca , ) and Hoarhound , ( Marrubium Vulgare , ) about the middle of June , put forth their flowers , rich in sweetness , and like the Raspberry , the bees visit them at all hours and in nearly all kinds of weather . They last from four to six weeks ; the catnip I have known to last twelve in a few instances , yielding honey during the whole time . Ox-eye daisy , ( Leucanthemum Vulgare , ) that beautiful and splendid flower , in pasture and meadow , and worth but little in either , also contains some honey . The flower is compound , and each little floret contains particles so minute , that the task of obtaining a load is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copious honey-yielding flowers are scarce . Snap-dragon , ( Linaria Vulgaris , ) with its nauseous and sickening odor , troubling the farmer with its vile presence , is made to bestow the only good thing about it , except its beauty , upon our insect . The flower is large and tubular , and the bee to reach the honey must enter it ; to see the bee almost disappear within the folds of the corolla , one would think that it was about being swallowed , when the hideous mouth was gaping to receive it ; but unharmed , soon it emerges from the yellow prison , covered with dust ; this is not brushed into pellets on its legs , like the pollen from some other flowers , but a part adheres to its back between the wings , which it is apparently unable to remove , as it remains there sometimes for months , making a cluster outside the hive , appear quite speckled . Bush honey-suckle ( Diervilla Trifida ) is another particular favorite . SINGULAR FATALITY ATTENDANT ON SILKWEED . Silkweed ( Asclepias Cornuti ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attends many bees while gathering it , that I never yet saw noticed . I had observed during the period this plant was in bloom , that a number of the bees belonging to swarms , before the hive was full , were unable to ascend the sides to the comb ; there would be sometimes thirty or more at the bottom in the morning . On searching for the cause , I found from one to ten thin yellow scales , attached to their feet , triangular , or somewhat wedge shape , in size about the twentieth part of an inch . On the longest point or angle , was a black thread-like point , from a sixteenth to an eighth of an inch in length ; on this stem was either hooks , barbs , or a glutinous matter , that firmly adhered to each foot or claw of the bee , rendering it useless as far as climbing the sides of the hive was concerned . I found also among bees clustered outside of full hives , this ornament attached , but to them it appeared no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that accumulates about the swarms to the amount of a handful , I found a great many of these scales , which the bees had worked from their feet . The question then arose , were these scales a foreign substance , accidentally entangled in their claws , or was it something formed there by nature , or rather an unnatural appendage ? It was soon decided . From the number of bees carrying it , I was satisfied that if it was the product of any flower , it belonged to a species somewhat abundant . I set about a close examination of all such as were then in bloom . I found the flowers of the Silkweed , ( or Milkweed , as some call it , ) sometimes holding a dead bee by the foot , secured by this appendage . Both sepals and petals of this flower are re-curved , that is , turned backward towards the stem , forming five acute angles , or notches , just the thing for a trap for a bee with strings of beads on its toes ; when at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these notches ; the flower being thick and firm , holds it fast ; pulling only draws it deeper into the wedge-like cavity . The bee must either perish or break loose ; their instincts fail them in this emergency ; they know nothing about getting it out by a gentle pull the other way . I never saw one do it except by accident . By examining the buds of this plant just before opening , I found this fatal appendage , by which great numbers of our bees are lost. 10 When I point out a loss among our bees , I would like to give a remedy ; but here I am at a loss , unless all these plants are destroyed , and this is impracticable in many places . After all I am not sure but honey enough is obtained by such bees as do escape , to counterbalance what we lose . This would depend on the amount of honey yielded by other flowers at the same time . 10 In Wood 's Class-book of Botany , " Order CII. , " in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus described : " Fig. 11 , a pair of pollen masses suspended from the glands at an angle of the antheridium , " &c.; One , when reading this simple botanical description , and seeing the plate , or the Botanist with his glasses , when he minutely inspects the parts , would not suspect anything fatal to bees about it . Whitewood ( Liriodendron Tulipifera ) yields something eagerly sought for by the bees , but whether honey , or pollen , or both , I have never been able to ascertain . All the flowers of this kind , with us , are too high . It is very scarce , as well as Basswood , ( Tilia Americana , )  --  that in some places is abundant , and yields honey clear and transparent as water , superior in appearance , but inferior in flavor to clover ; it also appears much thinner when first collected . LARGE YIELD FROM BASSWOOD . During the time this tree is in bloom , a period of two or three weeks in many sections , astonishing quantities are obtained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten pounds collected by one swarm in a day , by weighing the hive in the morning and again at evening . " I have some doubt of the statement , and think half the amount would be a good day 's work ; but I had but a small chance to know , as only a few trees , as a specimen , grow in this section . I have weighed hives during seasons of apple-tree blossoms and buckwheat , the two best yields of honey we have , and three and a half pounds was the best for one day that I ever had . Sumach , ( Rhus Glabra , ) in some sections , affords considerable honey . Mustard ( Sinapis Nigra ) is also a great favorite . I have now mentioned most of the honey-producing trees and plants that come on before the middle of July . The course of these flowers is termed the first yield . In sections where there are no crops of buckwheat , it constitutes the only full one . Other flowers continue to bloom till cold weather . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasture , it will continue to throw out fresh flowers , sometimes , throughout the summer ; yet the bees consume about all they collect in rearing their brood , &c.; Thus it appears in some sections six or eight weeks is about all the time they have to provide for winter . GARDEN FLOWERS UNIMPORTANT . In passing along I have not mentioned garden flowers , because the amount obtained here is a small item , compared to the forest and fields  --  especially ornamental flowers . It is true that the Hollyhock , ( Altha Rosea , ) Mallows , ( Malva Rotundifolia ) and many others yield honey , but what does it amount to ? A person expecting his hives to be filled from such a source would very likely be disappointed , especially when many are kept together . HONEY-DEW . Honey-dew is said to be a source from whence large collections are made in some places . When or where it appears or disappears is more than I can tell . I have seen the accounts of it , but accounts I have learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I find too many errors copied merely because they happen to be in company with several truths . Huber discovered many important truths , and has given them to the world ; too many writers take it for granted when two points of his are true , the third must be also . It is no proof that there is no such article merely because I never discovered it . In the many fruitless endeavors that I have made to get a view of this substance , it may be I have lacked close observation ; or possibly there is none showered upon this region ; or I may have failed to bring my imagination to assist me to convert common dew into the real article . SINGULAR SECRETION . I once discovered bees collecting a secretion unconnected with flowers ; but was not honey-dew , as it has been described . I was passing a bush of Witch-hazel , ( Hamamelis Virginiana , ) and was arrested by an unusual humming of bees . At first I supposed that a swarm was about me , yet it was late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July . ) On close inspection , I found the bush contained numerous warty excrescences , the size and shape of a hickory-nut . These proved to be only a shell  --  the inside lined with thousands of minute insects , a species of aphis . These appeared to be engaged sucking the juices , and discharging a clear , transparent fluid . Near the stem was an orifice about an eighth of an inch in diameter , out of which this liquid would gradually exude . So eager were the bees for this secretion , that several would crowd around one orifice at a time , each endeavoring to thrust the other away . This occurred several years ago , and I never have been able to find anything like it since ; neither have I learned whether it is common in other sections . SECRETIONS OF THE APHIS . The liquid ejected by the aphis , ( plant louse , ) when feeding or sucking the juices of tender leaves , and received by the ants that are always in attendance , is something like it ; but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This mode of elaborating honey , although not generally collected by bees , perhaps may not be too much out of place here . Also , it may furnish a clue to the cause or substantiate some theory of honey-dew . These insects ( Aphis ) have been very appropriately termed " ants ' cows , " as they are regarded by them with the most tender care and solicitude . In July or August , when the majority of the leaves of our apple trees are matured , there is often a few sprouts or suckers about the bottom or trunk , that continue growing and putting out fresh leaves . On the under side of these , you will find the aphis by hundreds , of all sizes , from those just hatched to the perfect insect with wings . All appear to be engaged in sucking the bitter juice from the tender leaf and stalk . The ants are among them by scores . ( They are often accused by the careless observer of the injury , instead of the aphis . ) Occasionally there will issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ant is ever ready to receive . When a load is obtained it descends to the nest ; others may be seen going and returning continually . Many other kinds of trees , shrubs and plants are used by the ants as " cow pasture , " and most kinds of ants are engaged in this dairy business. 11 Would the bees attend on the aphis for this secretion , ( for it appears to be honey , ) if the ant was not there first ? Or if there were no ants or bees , would this secretion be discharged , and falling on the leaves below them , be honey-dew ? If they were situated on some lofty trees , and it lodged on the leaves of small bushes near the earth , it would , with some authors . 11 The history of insects , as published by Harpers , gives more particulars on this interesting subject . These questions I shall not answer , at present . As for theory , I shall probably have enough before I get through , where I hope the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written , I have made some further observations on this subject . In August , 1852 , I noticed , on passing under some willow trees , ( Salix Vitellina , ) that leaves , grass , and stones , were covered with a wet or shining substance . On looking among the branches , I found nearly all the smallest were covered with a species of large black aphis , apparently engaged in sucking the juices , and occasionally discharging a minute drop of a transparent liquid . I guessed this might be the honey-dew . As this was early in the morning , I resolved to visit this place again , as soon as the sun got up far enough to start out the bees , and see if they collected any of it . On my return I found not only bees in hundreds , but ants , hornets , and wasps . Some were on the branches with the aphis , others on the leaves and larger branches . Some of them were even on the stones and grass under the trees , collecting it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few there are yet to appear , after the middle of July . The button-ball bush ( Cephalanthus Occidentalis ) is now much frequented for honey . Also , our vines , melons , cucumbers , squashes , and pumpkins . The latter are visited only in the morning , and honey is the only thing obtained ; notwithstanding the bee is covered with farina , it is not kneaded into pellets on its legs . I have seen it stated that bees never get honey early in the morning , but pollen instead . Now it is not best always to take our word , who pretend to know all about it , but look for yourselves into some of these matters . Take a look some warm morning , when the pumpkins are in bloom , and see whether it is honey or pollen they are in quest of . Also please make an observation when they are at work on the red raspberry , motherwort , or catnip ; you will thus ascertain a fact so easily , that you will wonder any one with the least pretension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention this , not because it is of much importance in itself , but to show the fallibility of us all , as we sometimes copy the mistaken assertions of others . ADVANTAGES OF BUCKWHEAT . Under some circumstances , clover will continue to bloom through this part of the season ; also , a few other flowers ; but I find by weighing , a loss from one to six pounds , between the 20th July and the 10th of August , when the flowers of buckwheat begin to yield honey , which generally proves a second harvest . In many places it is their main dependence for surplus honey . It is considered by many an inferior quality . The color , when separated from comb , resembles molasses of medium shade . The taste is more pungent than clover honey ; it is particularly prized on that account by some , and disliked by others for the same reason . In the same temperature it is a little thicker than other honey , and is sooner candied . AMOUNT OF HONEY COLLECTED FROM IT . Swarms issuing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckwheat , sometimes contain not over five pounds of stores , and yet make good stocks for winter , whereas , without this yield , they might not live through October . It fails about once in ten years . I have known a swarm to gain in one week sixteen pounds , and construct comb to store it at the same time . At another time I had a swarm issue the 18th August , that obtained thirty pounds in about eighteen days . But such buckwheat swarms , in ordinary seasons , seldom get over fifteen pounds . The flowers last from three to five weeks . The time of sowing the grain varies in different sections , from the 10th of June to the 20th July . Farmers wish to give it just time to ripen before frost , as the yield of grain is considered better , but as the time of frost is a matter of guess-work , some will sow several days earlier than others . Whenever an abundant crop of this grain is realized , a proportionate quantity of honey is obtained . DO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are an injury to this crop , by taking away the substance that would be formed into grain . The best reasons for this opinion that I have obtained are these : " I believe it , and have thought so a long time . " " It is reasonable if a portion of this plant is taken away by the bees , there must be a less quantity of material left for the formation of seed , &c."; Most of us have learned that a person 's opinion is not the strongest kind of proof , unless he can exhibit substantial reasons for it . Are the above reasons satisfactory ? How are the facts ? The flowers expand , and a set of vessels pour into the cup or nectary a minute portion of honey . I am not aware that any one contends that the plant has another set of vessels prepared to again absorb this honey and convert it into grain . But strong testimony proves very plainly that it never again enters the stalk or flower , but evaporates like water . We all know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to float in the atmosphere , too minute for the naked eye . When passing off in this way this real flesh and blood would escape notice perhaps altogether , and never be detected , were it not for the olfactories , which on some occasions notify us of its presence very forcibly . In passing a field of buckwheat in bloom , by the same means we are assured of the presence of honey in the air . Now what is the difference whether this honey passes off in the air , or is collected by the bees ? If any difference , the advantage appears to be in favor of the bees getting it , for the reason that it thus answers another important end in the economy of nature , consistent with her provisions in ten thousand different ways of adapting means to ends . Most breeders of domestic animals are aware of the deteriorating qualities induced by in-and-in breeding ; a change of breed is found necessary for perfection , &c.; ARE NOT BEES AN ADVANTAGE TO VEGETATION ? Vegetable physiology seems to indicate a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers answer the different organs of the two sexes in animals . The pistil is connected with the ovaries , the stamens furnish the pollen that must come in contact with the pistil ; in other words , it must be impregnated by this dust from the stamens , or no fruit will be produced . Now if it be necessary to change the breed , or essential that the pollen produced by the stamens of one flower shall fertilize the pistil of another , to prevent barrenness , what should we contrive better than the arrangement already made by Him who knew the necessity and planned it accordingly ? And it works so admirably , that we can hardly avoid the conclusion that bees were intended for this important purpose ! It is thus planned ! Their wants and their food shall consist of honey and pollen ; each flower secretes but little , just enough to attract the bee ; nothing like a full load is obtained from one ; were it thus , the end in view would not be answered ; but a hundred or more flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the first may fertilize many , previous to the bees ' returning to the hive ; thus a field of buckwheat may be kept in health and vigor in its future productions . A field of wheat produces long slender stalks that yield to the influence of the breeze , and one ear is made to bestow its pollen on a neighboring ear several feet distant , thereby effecting just what bees do for buckwheat . Corn , from its manner of growth , the upright stalk bearing the stamens some feet above the pistils , on the ears below , seems to need no agency of bees ; the superabundant pollen from the tassel is wafted by the winds rods from the producing stalk , and there does its office of fertilizing a distant ear , as is proved by different varieties mixing at some distance . But how is it with our vines trailing on the earth , a part of these flowers producing stamens , the other only pistils ? Now it is absolutely essential that pollen from the staminate flowers shall be introduced into the pistillate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this matter the germ will wither and die . Here we have the agent ready for our purpose ; these flowers are visited by the bee promiscuously ; no pollen ( as was said ) is kneaded into pellets , ( particularly that from pumpkins , ) but it adheres to every part of their body , rendering it next to impossible for a bee thus covered with dust to enter the pistillated flower without fulfilling the important duty designed , and leave a portion of the fertilizing dust in its proper place . Hence it is reasonably inferred by many , that if it was not for this agent among our vines , the uncertainty of a crop from non-fertilization would render the cultivation of them a useless task . When the aphis is located on the stalk or leaf of a plant it is furnished with means to pierce the surface and extract the juices essential to the formation of the plant , thereby preventing vigorous growth and a full development . This idea is too apt to be associated with the bee when she visits the flower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierce bark or stem and rob it of its nourishment . Her real structure is lost sight of , or perhaps never known ; her slender brush-like tongue folded closely under her neck , and seldom seen except when in use , is not fitted to pierce the most delicate substance ; all that it can be used for is to sweep or lick up the nectar as it exudes from the pores of the flower , secreted , it would seem , for no other purpose but to attract her  --  while there she obtains nothing but what nature has provided for her and given her the means of obtaining , and the most delicate petal receives no injury . During an excursion the bee seldom visits more than a single species of flower ; were it otherwise , and all kinds of flowers were visited promiscuously , by fertilizing one species with the pollen from another , the vegetable kingdom would be very likely to get into confusion . Writers , when noticing the peculiarity of instinct governing the bee here , can not be content always , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hive , and make her store every kind by itself there . Relative to honey it is not an easy matter to be positive ; but pollen is of a variety of colors , generally yellow , yet sometimes pale-green , and reddish or dark-brown . Now I think a little patient inspection would have satisfied any one that two kinds are sometimes packed in one cell , and prevented the assertion to the contrary . I will admit that two colors are seldom found packed together , but sometimes will be . I have thus found it , and it has entirely ruined that theory for me . A TEST FOR THE PRESENCE OF QUEEN DOUBTED . It is further asserted that if a hive loses its queen " no pollen is collected . " Also , " that such quantities are sometimes collected , and fill so many cells , that too little room is left for brood , and the stock rapidly dwindles away in consequence . " The first of these assertions has been given as a test to decide whether the hive contains a queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing things wrong that the above is no test whatever . It is made to appear very well in theory , but wants the truth in practice . I will say what I have known on this point , and perhaps clear up the difficulty of a stock containing an unusual quantity of bee-bread with the honey , and instead of being the cause of its having but few bees , it is the effect . Stocks and sometimes swarms lose their queen in the swarming season , ( the particulars will be given in another place , ) when , instead of remaining idle , the usual quantity of both pollen and honey is collected ( unless the family is very small ) . There being no larvae to consume the bread , the consequence is , more than half the breeding cells will contain it ; they will be packed about two-thirds full , and finished out with honey . I have known a large family left under such circumstances , and about all the cells in the hive would be occupied . Whereas , in a stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combs will be used for this purpose until the flowers fail , and then such comb will be found empty . AN EXTRA QUANTITY OF POLLEN NOT ALWAYS DETRIMENTAL . To test whether this extra quantity of bee-bread was so very detrimental , I have introduced into such hive in the fall a family with a queen and wintered them in it , and watched their prosperity another year , and never found them less profitable on that account . I am so well satisfied of this , that whenever I now have a hive in such a situation , it is a rule to introduce a swarm . It is calculated , I believe , generally , that when medium-sized hives are full , about seven-eighths of the cells are made the proper diameter for raising the workers , the remainder for drones , except a few for queens . Here is one circumstance I do not remember to have seen mentioned , and that is , bee-bread is generally packed exclusively in the worker cells . I would say always ; but I would do better to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so differently from some others . I might as well remark here , that when taking combs from a hive filled with honey , if such pieces were selected as contained only the large or drone cells , but little risk of bee-bread would occur ; of the other combs , the outside sheets and the corners of the others near the top are the next best . The sheets of comb used principally for raising workers , and the cells next those so used , for an inch or two in width , are nearly all packed with pollen , and much of it will remain , when the breeding season is past . Smaller portions are found in the worker cells in nearly all parts of the hive ; even the boxes will sometimes contain a little . MANNER OF PACKING STORES . In a glass hive , the bees may be seen depositing their load of pollen ; the legs holding the pellets are thrust into the cell , ( not their heads ) , and a motion like rubbing them together is made for a half minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaves of bread may be seen at the bottom . This bee appears to take no farther care about them , but another will soon come along , and enter the cell head first , and pack it close ; this cell is filled about two-thirds of its length in this way , and when sealed over a little honey is used to fill it out . PHILOSOPHY IN FILLING A CELL WITH HONEY . To witness the operation of depositing honey , a glass hive or box is requisite ; the edges of the combs will be attached to the glass  --  when honey is abundant , most of these cells next the glass will contain some . Now is the time to see the operation , glass forming one side of such as are in contact , &c.; The bee may be seen to enter the cell till it reaches the bottom ; with its tongue , the first particle is deposited , and brushed into the corners or angles , carefully excluding all the air from behind it  --  as it is filled , that next the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bee does not put its tongue in the centre and pour out its load there , but carefully brushes the sides as it fills , excluding every particle of air , and keeps the surface concave instead of convex . This is just as a philosopher would say it should be . If it was filled at once and no care taken to attach it to the sides , why , the external air would never keep it there , which it does effectually when of ordinary length . When the cell is about one-fourth of an inch deep they often commence filling it , and as it is lengthened they add to it , keeping it within an eighth of an inch of the end ; it is never quite full till nearly sealed over , and often not then . In cells of the worker size , the sealing seldom touches the honey . But in the size for drones the case is different ; the honey on the end touches the sealing , about half the diameter on the lower side ; it is kept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger , the atmospheric pressure is less effectual in keeping the honey in its place ; consequently , when they commence sealing these cells they begin on the lower side and finish at the top . LONG CELLS SOMETIMES TURNED UPWARD . When storing honey in boxes , cells of this size are usually much longer , in which case they are crooked , the ends turning upward , sometimes half an inch or more ; this , of course , will prevent the honey from running , but if the box is taken off and turned over before such cells are sealed , they are very sure to spill most of their contents . The cells in the breeding apartment , of ordinary length , will hold the honey well enough as long as horizontal ; but turn the hive on its side , and bring the open end downward , in hot weather , or break out a piece and hold it in that position , the air will not sustain it in them , but will , in the size suitable for workers . When the hive is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a queen , ) I never examined one , winter or summer , but it had a number of unsealed cells containing honey , as well as pollen ; it is so when they have stored fifty pounds in boxes , even when so crowded for room as to store honey outside or under the bottom-board ; ever having some cells open for a ready supply . Young swarms seem unwilling to construct combs faster than needed for use ; it would appear , at first thought , to be a lack of economy . When no honey is to be obtained and nothing to do , then it would seem to be a fine chance for getting ready for a yield ; but this is not their way of doing business ; whether they can not spare the honey already collected to elaborate the wax , or whether they find it more difficult to keep the worms from a large quantity of comb , I shall not decide . Of this I am satisfied , that it is better arranged by their instincts , than we could do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is abundant , will extend their combs from top to bottom in a little more than two weeks ; but such hive is not yet full ; some sheets of comb may contain honey throughout their whole length , and not a cell be sealed over ; but , however , they generally find time to finish up within a few inches of the lower end as they proceed . Whenever unfinished cells contain honey , it will generally be removed soon after the flowers fail , and used before that which is sealed ; and the cells will remain empty till another year . IS A DRY OR WET SEASON BEST FOR HONEY ? The inquiry is often made , " What kind of season is best for bees , wet or dry ? " This point I have watched very closely , and have found that a medium between the two extremes produces most honey . When farmers begin to express fears of a drought , then is the time ( if in the season of flowers ) that most honey is obtained ; but if dry weather passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two extremes , perhaps very wet is the worst . HOW MANY STOCKS SHOULD BE KEPT . " What number of stocks can there be kept in one place ? " is another question often asked . This is like Mr. A. asking farmer B. how many cattle could be pastured in a lot of ten acres . Farmer B. would first wish to know how much pasture said lot would produce , before he could begin to answer ; since one lot of that size might produce ten times as much as the other . So with bees , one apiary of two hundred stocks might find honey in abundance for all , and another of forty might almost starve . Like the cattle , it depends on pasture . THREE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF HONEY . There are three principal sources of honey , viz. :  --  clover , basswood , and buckwheat . But clover is the only universal dependance ; as that is almost everywhere , to some extent , in the country . Buckwheat in some places is the main source ; in others , basswood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are abundant , there is the true El Dorado of the apiarian ! With plenty of clover and buckwheat , it is nearly as well . Even with clover alone , enormous quantities of honey are obtained . I have said what was our dependence in this section . I will further say that within a circle of three or four miles , there are kept about three hundred stocks . I have had for several years , three apiaries about two miles apart , averaging in spring a little more than fifty in each . When a good season for clover occurs , as many more would probably do equally well , but in some other seasons I have had too many ; on an average nearly right . When clover furnishes too little honey for the number , buckwheat usually supplies more than is collected . Of surplus honey , the proportion is about fifteen pounds of buckwheat to one of clover . I have now been speaking of large apiaries . There can hardly be a section of country found , that man can procure his living , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no dependence on the sources just mentioned . There will be some honey-yielding flowers in nearly all places . The evil of over-stocking is of short duration , and will work its own cure speedily . Some judgment is required here as well as in other matters . Another question of some interest , is the distance that a bee will travel in search of honey in flowers  --  it is evident that it will be farther than they will go to plunder a stock . I have heard of their being found seven miles from home . It was said they ascertained , by sprinkling flour on them as they left the hive in the morning , and then saw the same bees that distance away . When we consider the chances of finding a bee even one mile from the hive thus marked , it appears like a " poor look ; " and then pollen the color of flour might deceive us . It is difficult to prove that bees go even two miles . Let us say we guess at it , for the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when seeing the bees enter the hive with a pellet of pollen on each of their posterior legs , is very apt to conclude that it must be material for comb , as it appears unlike honey . So little regard is paid to the matter by many people , that they are unable to imagine any other use for it . Others suppose that it will change from that to honey , after being stored a time in the hive , and wonder at the curious phenomenon ; but when asked how long a time must elapse before it takes place , they can not tell exactly , but they " have found cells where it began to change , as a portion near the outer end of the cell had become honey , and no doubt the remainder would in time . " It has been remarked that cells were only filled about two-thirds full of this , and finished with honey ; now when any one finds a cell filled to the brim with pollen , and no honey , such reasoning will apply better . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the summer , we certainly should find some cells before the change had commenced , instead of their always being in just this stage of transition . IS POLLEN CONVERTED INTO WAX ? As for pollen being converted into wax or comb , a simple question will show its fallacy . Do not the bees belonging to a hive that is full of combs , and no more wax for that purpose needed , bring home as much and often more pollen than one half full ? Any person who has watched two such hives five minutes when busily engaged at work , can answer . It is evident , then , that pollen is for something else besides wax . HOW IS IT OBTAINED ? The inquiry is now made , " Where do they get it from , if not from pollen ? " I might with propriety answer , they do n't get it at all . " Stop , there , if you please ; if you expect us to credit you , you must not give us too much absurdity . " Well , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain flesh , bone , &c.,; or only the materials from which these parts are secreted ? As to the production of wax , I believe all close observers ( that I have found ) agree that it is a secretion natural only to the bee . With the ox , fruit , grain , or grass may be converted into tallow ; with the bee , honey and syrup made of sugar may be converted into wax . These are probably the only two substances yet discovered from which they extract it . Some writers have pretended that pollen is also used , but they have failed to prove that the old bees consume it at any time ; which they must in this case if it is converted into wax . From experiments related by Huber , either of these substances , mixed with a little water , is all sufficient for its production . From experiments of my own , I am satisfied that he is correct . The experiment is tried by shutting up a swarm when first hived ; feeding them with honey  --  a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough to make a comb three inches square , yet it is something  --  and to be certain , time must be given them to exhaust it . In three or four days take out the bees and remove the combs ; inclose them again , and feed with honey as before . Repeat the process , until satisfied that no pollen is needed in the composition of wax . Huber removed the combs " five times , " with the same result at every trial . Whenever bees are confined in hot weather , air and water are absolutely necessary . We will now describe the first appearance of wax , and how it is produced . When a swarm of bees is about leaving the parent stock , three-fourths or more of them will fill their sacks with honey . When located in their new home , of course no cells exist to hold it ; it must remain in the stomach or sack for several hours . The consequence is , that thin white scales of wax the sixteenth of an inch in diameter , somewhat circular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under side . With the claws of one of their hind legs one of these is detached and conveyed to the mouth , and there pinched with their forceps or teeth , until one edge is worked somewhat rough ; it is then applied to the comb being constructed , or to the roof of the hive . The first rudiments of comb are often applied within the first half hour after the swarm is hived . In the history of insects before noticed , is a minute account of the first foundation of combs , somewhat amusing , if not instructive . HUBER 'S ACCOUNT OF A COMMENCEMENT OF COMB . Huber , it is said , " having provided a hive with honey and water , it was resorted to in crowds by bees , who , having satisfied their appetite , returned to the hive . They formed festoons , remained motionless for twenty-four hours , and after a time scales of wax appeared . An adequate supply of wax for the construction of a comb having been elaborated , one of them disengaged itself from the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch in diameter , at the top of the hive , applied the pincers of one of its legs to its side , detached a scale of wax , and immediately began to mince it with the tongue . During the operation , this organ was made to assume every variety of shape ; sometimes it appeared like a trowel , then flattened like a spatula , and at other times like a pencil , ending in a point . The scale , moistened with a frothy liquid , became glutinous , and was drawn out like a riband . This bee then attached all the wax it could concoct to the vault of the hive , and went its way . A second now succeeded , and did the like ; a third followed , but owing to some blunder did not put the wax in the same line with its predecessor ; upon which another bee , apparently sensible of the defect , removed the displaced wax , and carrying it to the former heap , deposited it there , exactly in the order and direction pointed out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . First , in the usual course of swarming , it is unnecessary to provide the honey and water , as they come laden with honey from the parent stock . Next , to form festoons and remain motionless twenty-four hours to concoct the wax , is not the way they generally manage affairs . They either swallow the honey before leaving home long enough to have the wax ready , or less time than twenty-four hours is needed to produce it . I have frequently found lumps , half the size of a pin 's head , attached to the branch of a tree where they had clustered , when they had not been there over twenty-five minutes . I have had occasion a few times to change the swarm to another tenement , an hour or two after being hived , and found places on the top nearly covered with wax . How it was managed to see a bee quit the " group , " is more than I can comprehend ; and then the tongue to be the only instrument used to mould the scale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process minutely in this stage of comb-making has never been my good fortune , and I am sometimes inclined to doubt the success of others . I have had glass hives , and put swarms in them , and always found the first rudiments of comb so entirely covered with bees as to prevent my seeing anything . BEST TIME TO WITNESS COMB-MAKING . The only time when I have witnessed the process with any degree of satisfaction is when the combs approach the glass , and but few bees in the way ; then , by watching patiently a few minutes , some part of the process may be seen . MANNER OF WORKING WAX . Transferring the swarms to different hives from one to forty-eight hours after being hived , will show their progress . I have found that wax is attached to the top of the hive at first promiscuously , that is , without the least order , until some of the blocks or lumps are sufficiently advanced for them to begin cells . The scales of wax are welded on the edge quite thick , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excavation is made on one side for the bottom of a cell , and two others on the opposite side ; the division between them exactly opposite the centre of the first . When this piece is an inch or two in length , two other pieces at equal distances on each side are commenced . If the swarm is large , and honey abundant , it is common for two pieces of comb to be started at one time on different parts of the top ; the sheets in the two places are often at right angles , or any other way , just as chance happens to give direction . The little lumps that are placed at random at first are all removed as they advance . While the combs are in progress , the edges are always kept much the thickest , and the base of the cell is worked down to the proper thickness with their teeth , and polished smooth as glass . The ends of the cell also , as they lengthen them , will always be found much thicker than any other part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the hive at nearly right angles , an edge of comb is left there ; but when an obtuse angle , the edges are generally joined , making a sheet of crooked comb . It is evident where the two combs join , there must be some irregular cells unfit for rearing brood . CROOKED COMBS A DISADVANTAGE . These few irregular cells have been considered a great disadvantage . It is thought , or pretended , that there is a vast difference between the prosperity of a stock with straight combs and one with crooked ones . To avoid them , or cause the bees to make them all straight , has given rise to much contrivance , as if a few such cells could effect much . Suppose there were a dozen sheets of comb in a hive , and each one had a row or more of such irregular cells from top to bottom , what proportion would they hold to those that were perfect ? Perhaps not one in a thousand . Hence we infer that in a hive of the proper size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived . This is the only difference it can make , because such cells can be used for storing honey as well as others . But sometimes there will be corners and spaces not wide enough for two combs , and too wide for one of the proper thickness for breeding . As bees use all their room economically , and generally at the best advantage , a thick comb will be the result . It is said they never use such thick combs for breeding . How are the facts ? I have just such a space in a glass hive ; one comb two inches thick . How is it managed ? Towards fall this sheet is filled with honey ; the cells outside are lengthened until there is just room for a bee to pass between them and the glass , when they are sealed over . In spring these long cells are all cut down ( except at the top and upper corners ) to the proper length for breeding , and used for this purpose . This has been done for five years in succession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such spaces , for part of the year . It amounts to but little , as it is only outside . They are necessitated to make such combs , because the inside combs , if built in a breeding apartment , however crooked one may be , the next one will generally match it , the right distance from it . But when they are built expressly for storing honey , in such as are made in boxes , the right distance is not so well preserved ; hence it is not recommended to compel bees to use such storing apartment for breeding . But suppose we should compel a swarm to labor under these disadvantages , I should not apprehend such disastrous results , ( providing they have a proper proportion of worker cells , ) as no swarms , or even no surplus honey , as has been represented . Imagine a hive filled with combs that are all too thick , and room wasted when cut down , to the amount of one-fourth of all that is in the hive . Now here are combs enough left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hive , where all are right . We can now suppose a good swarm will bring home the same amount of honey as though it belonged to other hives ; only three-fourths as much can be fed to the brood , and stored in the hive ; and the result ought to be , that we get a quarter more surplus honey in boxes . Even if we get no swarm , I can not see how our surplus honey can be less , as in this case there would be more bees at all times than in a hive that had been reduced by swarming . Does experience substantiate the theory that stocks with crooked combs are as profitable as when they are straight ? When combs are built expressly for breeding , I could never discover any difference . Any person can easily test it by a little observation ; not by taking a solitary instance of only one hive , because some other cause might produce the result . Take a half-dozen at least with straight combs , and as many with them crooked ; have them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think you will have but little interest which way the combs are made , providing they are made , as far as profit is concerned . It is true , it would gratify order to have them all straight , and if it was not attended with more trouble than the result would pay for , it would be well to have them so . In ordinary circumstances , when a swarm is first hived , they set about comb-making immediately ; yet sometimes they will remain two days , and not make a particle . I have known them to swarm out and cluster in the usual way , and when rehived , commence at once . This seems to prove that they can retain the wax , or prevent secreting it , till wanted . This seldom occurs . UNCERTAINTY IN WEIGHT OF BEES . A large swarm will probably carry with them some five or six pounds of honey from the parent stock . I only guess at this , because I am uncertain what the bees weigh exactly . " I can tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  so many weigh just eight ounces . " Are you sure there was nothing but bees weighed ? Was there no honey , bee-bread , faeces , or other substance , that might deceive you ? " Ca n't say ; I never thought of that ! " Now it is important , if we weigh bees to know their weight , to be sure we weigh nothing else . It is evident , that if five thousand weigh three pounds , when nothing is in their sacks , they would weigh , when filled with honey , several pounds more . Hence , the fallacy of judging of the size of a swarm by weight , as one swarm might issue with half the honey of another . Perhaps eight pounds , for large swarms , might be an average for bees and honey . This honey , whatever it amounts to , can not be stored till combs are constructed to hold it . This principle holds good till the hive is full . That is , whenever they have more honey than the combs will hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct more . But they seem to go no farther than this in comb-making . However large the swarm may be , this compulsion appears necessary to fill the hive . Drone-cells are seldom made in the top of the hive , but a part are generally joined on the worker-cells , a little distance from the top ; others near the bottom . There seems to be no rule about the number of such cells . Some hives will contain twice the number of others . It may depend on the yield of honey at the time ; when very plenty , more drone-cells , &c.; If the hive be very large , no doubt an unprofitable number would be constructed . Where the large and small cells join , there will be some cells of irregular shape ; some with four or five angles ; the distance from one angle to the other is also varied . Even where two combs of cells the same size join , making a straight comb , they are not always perfect . SOME WAX WASTED . When constructing comb , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning after a swarm is located , the scales may be found , and will continue to increase as long as they are working it ; the quantity often amounts to a handful or more . It is the best test of comb-making that I can give . Clean off the board and look the next morning , you will find the scales in proportion to their progress . Some will be nearly round as at first ; others more or less worked up , and a part will be like fine saw-dust . Huber and some others have divided the working bees into different classes , denominating some wax-workers , others nurses , and pollen gatherers , &c.; It may be partially true , but how it was found out is the mystery . The angles in the cells used for brood , are gradually filled , and after a time become round , both at the ends and sides . WATER NECESSARY TO COMB-MAKING . Whenever bees are engaged making comb , a supply of water is absolutely necessary . Some think it requisite in rearing brood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required for both purposes ; but yet I have doubts if a particle is given to the young bee , besides what the honey contains . June , and first part of July , and most part of August ( the season of buckwheat , ) are periods of extensive comb-making ; they then use most water ; breeding is carried on from March till October , and as extensively in May , perhaps more so , than in August , yet not a tenth part of the water is used in May . I have known stocks repeatedly to mature brood from the egg to the perfect bee , when shut in a dark room for months , when it was impossible to obtain a drop ; also stocks that stand in the cold , ( if good , ) will mature some brood whether the bees can leave the hive or not . These facts prove that some are reared without water . As they get sufficient honey to require more comb to store it , they will at the same time have a brood ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comb , without a little investigation . This much is certain , that they use water at such times for some purpose , and when no pond , brook , spring , or other source is within convenient distance , the apiarian would find it economy to place some within their reach , as it would save much valuable time , if they would otherwise have to go a great distance , when they might be more profitably employed ; it always happens in a season of honey . It should be so situated that the bees may obtain it without jeopardizing their lives ;  --  a barrel or pail has sides so steep that a great many will slip off and drown . A trough made very shallow , with a good broad strip around the edge to afford an alighting place , should be provided . The middle should contain a float , or a handful of shavings spread in the water with a few small stones laid on them to prevent their being blown away when the water is out , is very convenient . A tin dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . The quantity needed may be ascertained by what is used  --  only give them enough , and change it daily . I have no trouble of this kind , as there is a stream of water within a few rods of the hives ; but I have an opportunity to witness something of the number engaged in carrying it . Thousands may be seen ( in June and August ) filling their sacks , while a continual stream is on the wing , going and returning . REMARKS . The exact and uniform size of their cells is perhaps as great a mystery as anything pertaining to them ; yet , we find the second wonder before we are done with the first . In building comb , they have no square or compass as a guide ; no master mechanic takes the lead , measuring and marking for the workmen ; each individual among them is a finished mechanic ! No time is lost as an apprentice , no service given in return for instruction ! Each is accomplished from birth ! All are alike ; what one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimen of their work shows itself to be from the hands of master workmen , and may be taken as a model of perfection ! He , who arranged the universe , was their instructor . Yes , a profound geometrician planned the first cell , and knowing what would be their wants , implanted in the sensorium of the first bee , all things pertaining to their welfare ; the impress then given , is yet retained unimpaired ! They need no lectures on domestic economy to tell them , by using the base of one set of cells on one side of their combs , for the base of those on the opposite , will save both labor and wax ; no mathematician that a pyramidal base , just three angles , with just such an inclination , will be the exact shape needed , and consume much less wax than round or square  --  that the base of one cell of three angles , would form a part of the base of three other cells on the opposite side of the comb  --  that each of the six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it  --  that these angles and these only would answer their ends . " The bees appear , " says Reaumer , " to have a problem to solve , which would puzzle many a mathematician . A quantity of matter being given , it is required to form out of it cells , which shall be equal , and similar , and of a determinate size , but the largest possible with relation to the quantity of matter employed , while they shall occupy the least possible space ! " How little does the epicure heed , when feasting on the fruits of their industry , that each morsel tasted must destroy the most perfect specimens of workmanship ! that in a moment he can demolish what it has taken hours , yes days , perhaps weeks , of assiduous toil and labor , for the bees to accomplish ! CHAPTER VI . PROPOLIS . WHAT USED FOR . This substance is first used to solder up all the cracks , flaws , and irregularities about the hive . A coat is then spread over the inside throughout ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , the latter part of summer , a coat of it is also spread there . An additional coat it seems is annually applied , as old hives will be coated with a thickness proportionate to its age , providing it has been occupied with a strong family . Huber has said it was also used to strengthen the cells when first made , by mixing it with the wax . If it was their practice at that time , the practice has been abandoned by our bees to a great extent . I have made examinations when comb was first made , when it contained eggs , and when it contained larvae , and have never been able to find anything other than pure wax composing it . After a young bee has matured in a cell , the coating or cocoon that it leaves is of a dark color , somewhat resembling it , and may have given rise to the supposition . How the article is obtained , appears to be the mystery . This is a subject about which apiarians have failed to agree . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others assert it to be a resinous gum , exuding from certain trees , and collected by the bees like pollen . It differs materially from wax , being more tenacious , and when it gets a little age , much harder . IS IT AN ELABORATE OR NATURAL SUBSTANCE ? No modern observer has ever been able to detect the bees in the act of gathering it . HUBER 'S OPINION . Huber tells us , that " near the outlet of one of his hives , he placed some of the branches of the poplar , which exuded a transparent juice , the color of garnet . Several workers were soon seen perched upon these branches ,  --  having detached some of this resinous gum , they formed it into pellets , and deposited them in the baskets of their thighs ; thus loaded , they flew to the hive , where some of their fellow-laborers instantly came to assist them in detaching this viscid substance from their baskets . " Some of our modern apiarians have doubted this account of Huber 's . Now , in the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt this theory ; that it is a resin or gum produced by trees . ( I can not say that I am exactly satisfied with the story of bringing the " branches and laying them by the hive , " &c.); That bees gather it in its natural state , is in accordance with my own observation . FURTHER PROOF . Our first swarms that issue in May , or first of June , seldom use much of the article pure for soldering and plastering ; but instead , a composition , the most of which is wax . I have noticed at this season , when old pieces of boards that had been used for hives , were left in the sun , that this old propolis would become soft in the middle of the day . Here I have frequently seen the bees at work , packing it upon their legs ; it was detached in small particles , and the process of packing was seen distinctly , as the bee did not fly during the operation , as in the case of packing pollen . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , indicating that they can elaborate it like wax . I can see no reason why they do not need it in June as much as August ; yet , in the latter month , they use more than a hundred times the quantity . At this time , they manifest no disposition to gather any from the old boards , &c.; It would seem they prefer the article new , which they now have in abundance . Boxes filled in June contain but very little , sometimes none . Why not , if they have enough of it ? but when filled in August , they always have the corners , and sometimes the top and sides , lined with a good coat . Cracks , large enough for bees to pass through , are sometimes completely filled with it . In this season , a little before sunset of some fair day , I have frequently seen the bees enter the hive with what I supposed to be the pure article on their legs , like pollen , except the surface , which would be smooth and glossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have also seen them through the glass inside , when they seemed unable to dislodge it themselves , like pollen , and were continually running around among those engaged in soldering and plastering ; when one required a little , it seized hold of the pellet with its teeth or forceps , and detached a portion . The whole lump will not cleave off at once ; but firmly adheres to the leg ; from its tenacity , perhaps a string an inch long will be formed in separating , the piece obtained is immediately applied to their work , and the bee is ready to supply another with a portion ; it doubtless gets rid of its load in this way ; it is difficult to watch it till it is freed from the whole , as it is soon lost among its fellows . Now if this substance is not found in its natural state , how does it happen that they pack it on their legs just as they do when getting it from a board of an old hive , or pollen , when collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , when elaborated . Do not these circumstances strongly favor the idea of its being a vegetable substance ? Perhaps the reason of its being collected at this season in greater abundance , may be found in the fact , that the buds of trees and shrubs are now generally formed . Many kinds are protected from rain and frost , by a kind of gum or resinous coating . It may be found in many species of Populus , particularly the balsam poplar , ( Populus Balsamifera ) and the Balm of Gilead , ( Populus Candicans ) . By boiling the buds of these trees , an aromatic resin or gum may be obtained , ( used sometimes for making salve ; ) the odor is very similar to that emitted by propolis , when first gathered by the bees , or by heating it afterwards . In the absence of facts , we are apt to substitute theory . This appears to me to be very plausible . Yet I am ready to yield it as soon as facts decide differently . Perhaps not one bee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being so few may be one reason why they are not often detected , yet few as they are , a few of us should set about close observation ; something certain might decide . Apiarian science is sadly neglected ; a large amount of error is mixed up with truth , that patient , scrutinizing investigation must separate . REMARKS . I feel anxious to get to the practical part of this work , which I hope will interest some readers who care but little about the natural history . I shall begin with spring , and will now endeavor to mix more of the practical with it , as we proceed to the end of the year . In order to illustrate some points of practice , I may have occasion to repeat some things already mentioned . CHAPTER VII . THE APIARY . ITS LOCATION . In the location of the apiary , one important consideration is , that it is convenient to watch in the swarming season ; that the bees may be seen at any time from a door or window , when a swarm rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; because if much trouble is to be taken , it is too often neglected . Also , if possible , the hives should stand where the wind will have but little effect , especially from the northwest . If no hills or building offer a protection , a close , high board fence should be put up for the purpose . It is economy to do it  --  bees enough may be saved to pay the expense . During the first spring months , the stocks contain fewer bees than at any other season . It is then that a numerous family is important , for the purpose of creating animal heat to rear the brood , if for nothing else . One bee is of more consequence now than a half dozen in midsummer . When the hive stands in a bleak place , the bees returning with heavy loads , in a high wind , are frequently unable to strike the hive , and are blown to the ground ; become chilled , and die . A chilly south wind is equally fatal , but not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front any point you choose ; east or south is generally preferred . A location near ponds , lakes , large rivers , &c.,; will be attended with some loss . Hard winds will fatigue the bees when on the wing , often causing them to alight in the water ; where it is impossible to rise again until wafted ashore , and then , unless in very warm weather , they are so chilled as to be past the effort . I do not mention this to discourage any one from keeping them , when so situated , because some few must keep them thus or not at all . I am so situated myself . There is a pond of four acres , some twelve rods off . In spring , during high winds , a great many may be found drowned , and driven on shore . Although we can not miss so few from a stock , it is nevertheless a loss as far as it goes . DECIDE EARLY . Whatever location is chosen , it should be decided upon as early in the spring as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ceased for a day , and the sun , unobstructed , is sending his first warm rays to a frozen earth , the bees that have been inactive for months , feel the cheering influence , and come forth to enjoy the balmy air . As they come from their door , they pause a moment to rub their eyes , which have long been obscured in darkness . BEES MARK THEIR LOCATION ON LEAVING THE HIVE . They rise on the wing , but do not leave in a direct line , but immediately turn their heads towards the entrance of their tenement , describing a circle of only a few inches at first , but enlarge as they recede , until an area of several rods have been viewed and marked . CHANGING STAND ATTENDED WITH LOSS . After a few excursions , when surrounding objects have become familiar , this precaution is not taken , and they leave in a direct line for their destination , and return by their way-marks without difficulty . Man with his reason is guided on the same principles . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hive by a kind of instinct , or is attracted towards it , like the steel to the magnet . At least , they act as if they did ; as they often move their bees a few rods , or feet , after the location is thus marked , and what is the consequence ? The stocks are materially injured by loss of bees , and sometimes entirely ruined . Let us trace the cause . As I remarked , the bees have marked the location . They leave the hive without any precaution , as surrounding objects are familiar . They return to their old stand and find no home . If there is more than one stock , and the removal has been from four to twenty feet , some of the bees may find a hive , but just as liable to enter the wrong one as the right . Probably they would not go over twenty feet , and very likely not that , unless the new situation was very conspicuous . If a person had but one stock , very likely the loss would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure to be home , and none killed , as is generally the case when a few enter a strange hive . CAN BE TAKEN SOME DISTANCE . When bees are taken beyond their knowledge of country , some two miles or more , the case seems to be somewhat different , but not always without loss , especially if many hives are set too close . They leave the hive of course without knowing that the situation has been changed ; perhaps get a few feet before strange objects warn them of the fact . When they return , the immediate vicinity is strange , and they often enter their neighbors ' domicil . DANGER OF SETTING STOCKS TOO CLOSE . A case in point occurred in the spring of ' 49 . I sold over twenty stocks to one person . He had constructed a bee-house , and his arrangement brought the hives within four inches of each other . The result was , he entirely lost several stocks ; some of them were the best ; others were materially injured , yet he had a few made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sometimes a stock will allow strange bees to unite with them , but it is seldom , unless a large number enters  --  it is safest to keep each family by itself , under ordinary circumstances ) . These stocks , before they were moved , had been collecting pollen , and had their location well marked . Had they been placed six feet apart , instead of four inches , he probably would not have lost any , or even two feet might have saved them . I have often moved them at this season , and placed them at three feet distance , and had no bad results . Facts like the foregoing , satisfied me long since that stocks should occupy their situation for the summer , as early as possible in the spring , at least before they mark the location ; or if they must be moved after that , let it be nothing short of a mile and a half , and plenty of room between the hives . SPACE BETWEEN HIVES . As regards the distance between hives generally , I would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Want of room makes it necessary sometimes to set them close ; where such necessity exists , if the hives were dissimilar in color , some dark , others light , alternately , it would greatly assist the bees in knowing their own hive . But it should be borne in mind , that whenever economy of space dictates less than two feet , there are often bees enough lost by entering the wrong hive , which , if saved , would pay the rent of a small addition to a garden , or bee-yard . I have several other reasons to offer for giving plenty of room between hives , which will be mentioned hereafter . SMALL MATTERS . The reader who is accustomed to doing things on gigantic principles , will consider this long " yarn " about saving a few bees in spring , a rather small affair , and so it is ; yet small matters must be attended to if we succeed ; " a small leak will sink a ship . " A grain of wheat is a small matter ; ' t is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bee is small , the load of honey brought home by it is still less , and the quantity secreted in the nectary of each flower , yet more minute . The patient bee visits each , and obtains but a tiny morsel ; by perseverance a load is obtained , and deposited in the hive ; it is only by the accumulation of such loads that we find an object worthy our notice : here is a lesson ; look to little things , and the manner in which they are multiplied , and preserved . It is much better to save our bees than waste them , and wait for others to be raised ; " a penny saved is worth two-pence earned . " If a stock is lost by small means , a corresponding effort is only necessary to save it . This trifling care is sometimes neglected through indolence . But I hope for better things generally ; I am willing to believe it is thorough ignorance , not knowing what kind of care is necessary  --  how , when , and where to bestow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell . You will now sufficiently understand the cause of loss on this point ; therefore , let it be a rule to have all ready in spring , before the bees leave their hives  --  the stands , bee-house , etc. , and not change them . ECONOMY . If we keep bees for ornament , it would be well to build a bee-house , paint the hives , &c.; but as I expect the majority of readers will be interested in the profit of the thing , I will say that the bees will not pay a cent towards extra expenses ; they will not do a whit more labor in a painted house , than if it was thatched with straw . When profit is the only object , economy would dictate that labor shall be bestowed only where there will be a remuneration . CHEAP ARRANGEMENT OF STANDS . So many kinds of bee-houses and stands have been recommended  --  all so different from what I prefer , that I perhaps ought to feel some hesitancy in offering one so cheap and simple ; but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apology . I have fifteen years ' experience to prove its efficacy , and have no fears on this score in recommending it . I make stands in this way : a board about fifteen inches wide is cut off two feet long ; a piece of chestnut or other wood , two inches square , is nailed on each end ; this raises the board just two inches from the earth , and will project in front of the hive some ten inches , making it admirably convenient for the bees to alight before entering the hive , ( when the grass and weeds are kept down , which is but little trouble ) . A separate piece for each hive is better than to have several on a bench together , as there can then be no communication by bees running to and fro . Also we are apt to give more room between them ; and a board or plank will make a stand for as many stocks when cut in pieces , as if left whole ; ( and it ought to make more ) . CANAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom-board , until I found out it did not pay expense , and have now discarded it , and succeed just as well . It is generally recommended as a preventive of robberies , and keeping out the moth . It may prevent one hive in fifty from being robbed ; but as for keeping out the moth , it is about as good an assistant for it as can be contrived . It is a place of great convenience for the worms to spin their cocoons , and some ingenuity of the apiarian is requisite to get at them . SOME ADVANTAGE IN BEING NEAR THE EARTH . I am aware that I go counter to most apiarians , in recommending the stands so near the earth ; less than two or three feet between the bees and the earth , it is said , will not answer any way . Mr. Miner is very positive on this point , in his Manual . I ventured to suggest to him , that there was more against it in theory , than in practice , and gave him my experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and found his bees close to the earth . Experience is worth a dozen theories ; in fact , it is the only test to be depended upon . I shall not urge the adoption of any rule , that I have not proved by my own practice . The objection raised , is dampness from the earth , when too near ; I am unable to perceive the least bad effect . Now let us compare advantages and disadvantages a little farther . One hive or a row of hives suspended , or standing on a bench , two or three feet from the earth , when approached by the bees on a chilly afternoon , ( and we have many such in spring , ) towards evening , even if there is not much wind , they are very apt to miss the hive and bottom , and fall to the ground , so benumbed with cold , as to be unable to rise again , and by the next morning are " no use " whatever . On the other hand , if they are near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no possibility of their alighting under the hive , and if they should come short , and get on the ground , they can always creep , long after they are too cold to fly , and are able , and often do enter the hive without the necessity of using their wings . Enough may be saved in one spring , from a few hives , in this way , to make a good swarm , which taken from several is not perceived ; yet , as much profit from them might be realized , as if they were a swarm by themselves . A little contrivance is all that is needed to save them . To such as must and will have them up away from the earth , I would say , do suggest some plan to save this portion of your best and most willing servants ; have an alighting board project in front of the hive at least one foot , or a board long enough to reach from the bottom of the hive to the ground , that they may get on that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inducement ? Examine minutely the earth about your hives , towards sunset , some day in April , when the day has been fair , with some wind , and chilly towards night , and you will be astonished at the numbers that perish . Most of them will be loaded with pollen , proving them martyrs to their own industry and your negligence . When I see a bench three feet high and no wider than the bottom of the hive , perhaps a little less , and no place for the bees to enter but at the bottom , and as many hives crowded on as it will hold , I no longer wonder that " bee-keeping is all in luck ; " the wonder is how they keep them at all . Yet it proves that , with proper management , it is not so very precarious after all . The necessary protection from the weather , for stocks , is a subject that I have taken some pains to ascertain ; the result has been , that the cheapest covering is just as good as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun from the top , is all sufficient . Covers for each hive , like the bottom-board , should be separate , and some larger than the top . UTILITY OF BEE-HOUSES DOUBTED . I have used bee-houses , but they will not pay , and are also discarded . They are objectionable on account of preventing a free circulation of air ; also , it is difficult to construct them , so that the sun may strike the hives both in the morning and afternoon ; which in spring is very essential . If they front the south , the middle of the day is the only time when the sun can reach all the hives at once ; this is just when they need it least ; and in hot weather , sometimes injurious by melting the combs . But when the hives stand far enough apart , on my plan , it is very easily arranged to have the sun strike the hive in the morning and afternoon , and shaded from ten o'clock , till two or three , in hot weather . Notwithstanding our prodigality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we come to put our hives in , and get them too close . " Ca n't afford to build a house , and give them so much room , no how . " CHAPTER VIII . ROBBERIES . Robbing is another source of occasional loss to the apiarian . It is frequent in spring , and at any time in warm weather when honey is scarce . It is very annoying , and sometimes gets neighbors in contention , when perhaps neither is to blame , farther than ignorance of the matter . NOT PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD . A person keeping many hives must expect to be accountable for all losses in his neighborhood , whether they are lost by mismanagement or want of management . Many people suppose , if one person has but one stock , and another has ten , that the ten will combine for plundering the one . There are no facts , showing any communication between different families of the same apiary , that I can discover . It is true , when one family finds another weak and defenceless , possessing treasure , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hurry and bustle attending it seldom escape the notice of the other families ; and when one hive has been robbed in an apiary , perhaps two-thirds of the other families , sometimes all , have participated in the plunder . One family , if it be large , is just as likely , and more so , to find a weak one among the ten , and commence plundering , as the other way . IMPROPER REMEDIES . Notwithstanding it is common to hear remarks like this , " I had a first-rate hive of bees , " ( when the fact was he had not looked particularly at his bees for a month , to know whether it was so or not , and if he had , very likely would not know , ) " and Mr. A. 's bees began to rob them . I tried every thing to stop it ; I moved them around in several places to prevent their finding the hive . It did no good ; the first I knew they were all gone  --  bees , honey , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the fact is , that not one good stock of bees in fifty , will ever be robbed , if let alone ; that is , if the entrance is properly protected . This moving the hive was enough to ruin any stock ; bees were lost at every change , until nothing was left but honey to tempt the robbers ; whereas , if left on its stand , it might have escaped . A great many remedies have been given me gratis , which , had one-half been followed , would have ruined them . The fact is , with many people , the remedies are often the cause of the disease . The most fatal is , to move them a few rods ; another , to close the hive entirely , ( very liable to smother them ) ; or , break out some comb and set the honey to running . There are some charms that affect them but little any way . Probably there are but few bee-keepers able to tell at once , when bees are being robbed . It requires the closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing about the apiary more difficult to determine , nothing more likely than to be deceived . It is generally supposed , when a number are outside fighting , that it is conclusive that they are also robbing , which is seldom the case . On the contrary , a show of resistance indicates a strong colony , and that they are disposed to defend their treasures . I no longer have any fears for a stock that has courage to repel an attack . WEAK FAMILIES IN MOST DANGER . It is weak families , that show no resistance , where we find the most danger . In seasons of scarcity , all good stocks maintain or keep sentinels about the entrance , whose duty it appears to be to examine every bee that attempts to enter . If it is a member of the community , it is allowed to pass ; if not , it is examined on the spot . It would seem that a password was requisite for admittance , for no sooner does a stranger-bee endeavor to get in , than it is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it . Each bee is a qualified jurist , judge , and executioner . There is no delay ; no waiting for witnesses for defence . The more a bee attempts to escape , the more likely it will be to receive a sting , unless it succeeds . How strange bees are known , would be nothing but theory , if I should attempt to explain . Let it suffice that they are known . THEIR BATTLES . I will here describe some of their battles . I have in the spring frequently seen the whole front side of the hive covered with the combatants , ( but for such hives I have no fears ; they are able to defend themselves . ) Several will surround one stranger ; one or two will bite its legs , another the wings ; another will make a feint of stinging , while another is ready to take what honey it has , when worried sufficient to make it willing . It is sometimes allowed to go after yielding all its honey , but at others , is dispatched with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is killed sooner by a sting , than by any other means , except crushing . Sometimes a leg will tremble , for a minute ; the legs are drawn close to the body ; the abdomen contracts to half its usual size , unless filled with honey . I have known a pint accidentally to enter a neighboring stock , and be killed in five minutes . The only places the sting will penetrate a bee are the joints of the abdomen , legs , the neck , &c.; I have occasionally seen one bee drag about the dead body of its victim , being unable to withdraw its sting from a joint in the leg . During the fight , if it be to keep off those in search of plunder , a few bees may be seen buzzing around in search of a place unguarded to enter the hive . If such is found , it alights and enters in a moment . At other times , when about to enter , it meets a soldier on duty , and is on the wing again in an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be nabbed by a policeman , when it must either break away , or suffer the penalty of insect justice , which is generally of the utmost severity . BAD POLICY TO RAISE THE HIVES . A great many apiarians raise their hives an inch from the board early in spring . They seem to disregard the chance it gives robbers to enter on every side . It is like setting the door of your own house open , to tempt the thief , and then complain of depravity . Let it be understood , then , that all good stocks , under ordinary circumstances , will take care of themselves . Nature has provided means of defence , with instinct to direct its use . Non-resistance may do for highly cultivated intellect in man , but not here . INDICATIONS OF ROBBERS . We will now notice the appearance about a weak hive that makes no resistance , and show the result to be a total loss of the stock , without timely interference . Each robber , when leaving the hive , instead of flying in a direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hive to mark the spot , that it may know where to return for another load , in the same manner that they do when leaving their hive in the spring . The first time the young bees leave home , they mark their location , by the same process . A few of these begin to hatch from the cells very early ; in all good stocks , often before the weather is warm enough for any to leave the hive . Consequently , it can not be too early for them at any time in spring . These young bees , about the middle of each fair day , or a little later , take a turn of flying out very thickly for a short time . The inexperienced observer would be very likely to suppose such stock very prosperous , from the number of inhabitants in motion . This unusual bustle is the first indication of foul play , and should be regarded with suspicion ; yet it is not conclusive . A DUTY . It is the duty of every bee-keeper , who expects to succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination some cool morning , can be made by turning the hive bottom up , and letting the sun among the combs . The number of inhabitants in them is easily seen . When weak , close the entrance , till there is just room for one bee to pass at once . The first real pleasant days , at any time before honey is obtained plentifully , a little after noon , look out for them to commence robbing . Whenever a weak stock is taken with what appears to be a fit of unusual industry , it is quite certain they are either robbers or young bees ; the difficulty is to decide which . Their motions are alike , but there is a little difference in color  --  the young bees are a shade lighter ; the abdomen of the robbers , when filled with honey , is a little larger . It requires close , patient observation , to decide this point , and when you have watched close enough to detect this difference , you can decide without trouble . A TEST . But while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined . We will , therefore , give some other means of protection . Bees , when they have been stealing a sack of honey from a neighboring hive , will generally run several inches from the entrance before flying : kill some of these ; if filled with honey , they are robbers ; because it is very suspicious , to be filled with honey when leaving the hive ; or sprinkle some flour on them as they come out , and have some one watch by the others to see if they enter . Another way is less trouble , but will take longer , before they are checked , if robbing . Visit them again in the course of half an hour or more , after the young bees have had time to get back , ( if it should happen to be them ) ; but if the bustle continues or increases , it is time to interfere . When the entrance has been contracted as directed , close it entirely till near sunset . When it has been left without , it should now be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ) . This will allow all that belong to the hive to get in , and others to get out , and materially retard the progress of the robbers . ROBBING USUALLY COMMENCES ON A WARM DAY . Unless it should be cool , they will continue their operations till evening . Very often some are unable to get home in the dark , and are lost . This , by the way , is another good test of robbing . Visit the hives every warm evening . They commence depredations on the warmest days ; seldom otherwise . If any are at work when honest laborers should be at home , they need attention . REMEDIES . As for remedies , I have tried several . The least trouble is to remove the weak hive in the morning to the cellar , or some dark , cool place , for a few days , until at least two or three warm days have passed , that they may abandon the search . The robbers will then probably attack the stock on the next stand . Contract the entrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass . If strong , no danger need be apprehended ; they may fight , and even kill some ; perhaps a little chastisement is necessary , to a sense of their duty . COMMON OPINION . There is an opinion prevalent that robbers often go to a neighboring stock , kill off the bees first , and then take possession of the treasures . To corroborate this matter , I have never yet discovered one fact , although I have watched very closely . Whenever bees have had all their stores taken , at a period when nothing was to be had in the flowers , it is evident they must starve , and last but a day or two before they are gone . This would naturally give rise to the supposition that they were either killed , or gone with the robbers . A CASE IN POINT . I have a case in point . Having been from home a couple of days , I found , on my return , a swarm of medium strength , that had been carelessly exposed , had been plundered of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 About the usual number of bees were among the combs , to all appearance , very disconsolate . I at once removed them to the cellar , and fed them for a few days . The other bees gave over looking for more plunder , in the meantime . It was then returned to the stand , entrance nearly closed , as directed , &c.; In a short time it made a valuable stock ; but had I left it twenty-four hours longer , it probably would not have been worth a straw . 13 It occurred the last of July . FURTHER DIRECTIONS . When a stock has been removed , if the next stand contains a weak , instead of a strong one , it is best to take that in also ; to be returned to the stand as soon as the robbers will allow it . If a second attack is made , put them in again , or if practicable , remove them a mile or two out of their knowledge of country ; they would then lose no time from labor . Where but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two stocks are engaged , sprinkle a little flour on them as they leave , to ascertain which the robbers are ; then reverse the hives , putting the weak one in the place of the strong , and the strong one in the place of the weak one . The weak stock will generally become the strongest , and put a stop to their operations ; but this method is often impracticable in a large apiary ; because several stocks are usually engaged , very soon after one commences , and a dozen may be robbing one . Another method is , when you are sure a stock is being robbed , take a time when there are as many plunderers inside as you can get , and close the hive at once , ( wire-cloth , or something to admit air , and at the same time confine the bees , is necessary ; ) carry in , as before directed , for two or three days , when they may be set out . The strange bees thus enclosed will join the weak family , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they were before to carry it off . This principle of forgetting home and uniting with others , after a lapse of a few days , ( writers say , twenty-four hours is sufficient for them to forget home ) can be recommended in this case . It succeeds about four times in five , when a proper number is enclosed . Weak stocks are strengthened in this way very easily ; and the bees being taken from a number of hives , are hardly missed . The difficulty is , to know when there are enough to be about equal , to what belongs to the weak stock ; if too few are enclosed , they are surely destroyed . COMMON CAUSE OF COMMENCING . After all , bees being robbed is like being destroyed by worms ; a kind of secondary matter ; that is , not one strong stock in a hundred will ever be attacked and plundered on the first onset . Bees must be first tempted , and rendered furious by a weak hive ; a dish of refuse honey set near them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been fed and not had a full supply . After they have once commenced , it takes an astonishing quantity to satiate their appetite . They seem to be perfectly intoxicated , and regardless of danger ; they venture on to certain destruction ! I have known a few instances where good stocks by this means were reduced , until they in turn fell a prey to others . I have for several years kept about one hundred stocks away from home , where I could not see them much , to prevent robbing . Yet I never lost a stock by this cause . I simply keep the entrance closed , except a passage for the bees at work during spring . It is true I have lost a few stocks , when the other bees took the honey , but they would have been lost any way . SPRING THE WORST TIME . As I before remarked in the commencement of this chapter , bees will plunder and fight at any time through the summer , when honey can not be collected ; but spring is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain it . It is the only time the apiarian can be excused for having his hives plundered , or letting them stand in a situation for it . We then often have families reduced in winter and spring , from various causes , and when protected through this season , generally make good stocks . It is then we wish them to form steady , industrious habits , and not live by plunder . Prevention is better than cure ; evil propensities should be checked in the beginning . The bee , like man , when this disposition has been indulged for a time , it is hard breaking the habit ; a severe chastisement is the only cure ; they too go on the principle of much wanting more . NO NECESSITY TO HAVE THE BEES PLUNDERED IN THE FALL . The apiarian having his bees plundered in the fall , is not fit to have charge of them ; their efforts are seldom as strong as in spring , ( unless there is a general scarcity , ) the weak hives are usually better supplied with bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , when there are some very weak families , these should be taken away as soon as the flowers fail , or strengthened with bees from another hive . Particulars in fall management . I have sometimes made my swarms equal , early in spring , by the following method , and I have also failed . Bees , when wintered together in a room , will seldom quarrel when first set out . When one stock has an over supply of bees , and another a very few , the next day or two after being out , I change the weak one to the stand of the strong one , ( as mentioned a page or two back , ) and all bees that have marked the location return to that place . The failure is , when too many leave the strong stock , making that the weak one , when nothing is gained . If it could be done when they had been out of the house just long enough for the proper number to have marked the location , success would be quite certain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be well , if possible ; to ascertain what is the cause of a stock being weak ; if it is from the loss of a queen , ( which is sometimes the case , ) we only make the matter worse by the operation . To ascertain whether the queen be present , do not depend on the bees carrying in pollen ; as most writers assert they will not , when the queen is gone ; because I have known them do it so many times without , that I can assure the reader again , it is no test whatever . The test given in chapter III . page 73 , is always certain . CHAPTER IX . FEEDING . SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT . Feeding bees in spring is sometimes absolutely necessary ; but in ordinary seasons and circumstances , it is somewhat doubtful if it is the surest road to success , for the apiarian to attempt wintering any stock so poorly supplied with honey , that he feels satisfied will need feeding in the spring or before . I will recommend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better disposition of such light families . But as some stocks are either robbed , or from some other cause , consume more honey than we expect , a little trouble and care may save a loss . Also bees are often fed at this season to promote early swarming , and filling boxes with surplus honey . CARE NEEDED . Considerable care is requisite , and but few know how to manage it properly . Honey fed to bees , is almost certain to get up quarrels among them . Sometimes strong stocks scent the honey given to weak ones , and carry it off as fast as supplied . APPARENT CONTRADICTION WHEN FEEDING CAUSING STARVATION . It is possible that feeding a stock of bees in spring , may cause them to starve ! whereas , if let alone , they might escape . Notwithstanding this looks like a contradiction , I think it appears reasonable . Whenever the supply of honey is short , probably not more than one egg in twenty which the queen deposits , will be matured  --  their means not allowing the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that several eggs may be found in one cell . I transferred over twenty stocks in March , 1852  --  most of the cells occupied with eggs contained a plurality ; two , three , and even four , were found in one cell ; it is evident that all could not be perfected . Also , the fact of these eggs being at this season on the bottom-board . Now suppose you give such a stock two or three pounds of honey , and they are encouraged to feed a large brood , and your supply fails before they are half grown . What are they to do ? destroy the brood and lose all they have fed , or draw on their old stores for a small quantity to help them in this emergency , and trust to chance for themselves ? The latter alternative will probably be adopted , and then , without a timely intervention of favorable weather , the bees starve . The same effect is sometimes produced by the changes of the weather ; a week or two may be very fine and bring out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frost , may destroy all for a few days . This makes it necessary to use considerable vigilance , as these turns of cold weather ( when they occur ) make it unsafe , till white clover appears ; but if the spring is favorable , there is but little danger , unless they are robbed . If you take the necessary care about worms , you will know which are light , and which heavy , unless your hives are suspended ; even then , it is a duty to know their true condition , in this respect . This is another advantage of the simple hive ; merely raising one edge to destroy worms , tells you something about the honey on hand . To be very exact , the hive should be weighed when ready for the bees , and the weight marked on it ; by weighing at any time after , tells at once within a few pounds of what honey there is on hand . Some allowance must be made for the age of the combs , the quantity of brood , &c.; It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so , as the supply must be kept up till honey is abundant . HOW LONG IT WILL DO TO WAIT BEFORE FEEDING . If it is wished to wait as long as possible , and not lose the bees , a test will be necessary to decide how long it will do to delay feeding . In this case , strict attention will be necessary ; they will need examination every morning . If a light tap on the hive is answered b ; a brisk , lively buzzing , they are not suffering yet ; but if no answer is returned to your inquiry , it indicates a want of strength . Extreme destitution destroys all disposition to repel an attack . Sometimes a part of the bees will be too weak to remain among the combs , and will be lying on the bottom , and some few outside . If the weather is cool , they appear to be lifeless ; yet they can be revived , and now must he fed . DIRECTIONS FOR FEEDING . Those among the combs may be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , invert the hive , gather up all the scattered bees , and put them in . Get some honey ; if candied , heat it till it dissolves ; comb honey is not so good without mashing ; if no honey is to be had , brown sugar may be taken instead ; add a little water , and boil it till about the consistence of honey , and skim it ; when cool enough , pour a quantity among the combs , directly on the bees ; cover the bottom of the hive with a cloth , securing it firmly , and bring to the fire to warm up . In two or three hours they will be revived , and may be returned to the stand , providing the honey given is all taken up ; on no account let any honey run out around the bottom . The necessity of a daily visit to the hives is apparent from the fact , that if left over for one day , in the situation just described , it will be too late to revive them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as I have recommended , you may open the holes in the top of the hive ; fill a small baking dish with honey or syrup , and set it on the top ; put in some shavings to keep the bees from drowning , or a float may be used if you choose ; it should be made of some very light wood , very thin , and full of holes or narrow channels , made with a saw . At the commencement of feeding , a few drops should be scattered on the top of the hive and trailed to the side of the dish , to teach them the way ; after feeding a few times , they will know the road . When the weather is warm enough for them to take it during the night , it is best to feed at evening ,  --  from four to eight ounces daily , is sufficient . If the family is very small , what honey is left in the morning may attract other bees ; it is then best to take it out , or carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently warm , and feed them enough to last several days , and then return them to the stand ; keeping a good lookout that they are not plundered , and again in a starving condition , until flowers produce honey sufficient . WHOLE FAMILIES MAY DESERT THE HIVE . When you have the means to keep up a supply of food , and time requisite to make feeding secure , perhaps it would not be advisable to wait till the last extremity before feeding , as a small family will sometimes entirely desert the hive , when destitute , if it occurs before they have much brood . In these cases , they issue precisely as a swarm ; after flying a long time , they either return , or unite with some other stock . If they return , they need attention immediately . You may be certain there is something wrong , let the desertion take place when it may ; in spring it may be destitution , or mouldy combs ; at other times the presence of worms , diseased brood , &c.; By whatever cause it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . OBJECTIONS TO GENERAL FEEDING . I have known it recommended , and practised by some apiarians , to feed bees all at once in the open air , in a large trough ; but whoever realizes much profit by this method , will be very fortunate , as every stock in the neighborhood will soon scent it out , and carry off a good share , and nearly every stock at home will be in contention , and great numbers killed ; the moment the honey is out , their attention is directed to other stocks . Another objection to this general feeding is , that some stocks are not necessitated at all , while others need it ; but the strongest stock is pretty sure to get the most . NOW , as I can not afford to divide with my neighbors in this way of feeding , and I suppose but few will be found who are willing to do it , I will give my method , which , when once arranged , is but little trouble . ARRANGEMENT FOR FEEDING . I got a tinman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square , and perpendicular sides . A board was then got out , fifteen inches wide , and two feet long ; two inches from one end , a hole is cut out the longest way , just the size of the dish , so that it will set in just even with the upper side of the board ; a good fit should be made , so that no bees can get in around it ; cleats should be nailed on the under side of the board , some over an inch thick , to prevent crowding the dish out . This is to go directly under the hive , but it is not ready yet , because if such dish is filled with honey under a hive , the bees would drown ; if a float is put on to keep them out , it will settle to the bottom when the honey is out , and the bees can not creep up the sides of tin very easily . Another thing , there is nothing to prevent the bees from making their combs to the bottom of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; these things are to be prevented . Get out two pieces of half-inch board , ten inches long , one to be two inches wide , the other one and a half inches . With a coarse or thick saw , cut channels in the side of the strips , one-fourth inch deep , three-eighths or half an inch apart , crosswise the whole length . You will then want a number corresponding to the places sawed , of very thin shingles , or strips , say one-eighth of an inch thick , and one and three-fourths wide , and nine and a half long ; these are to stand edgewise in the dish ; the first two are to hold them in the channels at the ends . The narrow one needs a block one-half inch square , nailed on each end ; on the edge , a strip of wire cloth is then nailed on , making the whole width just two inches . This is now put in the dish , wire cloth at the bottom , two inches from one end ; two pins to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is placed against the other end , and pressed down even with the top of the dish . The thin pieces are now slipped into the channels even with the top ; it is now ready to go under the hive to be fed . Let the two-inch space project out on the back side of the hive . A narrow board should be provided , some more than two inches wide , to cover it . Let the hive stand close on this board ; the hole in the side is sufficient for the passage of bees at work , till very hot weather . Thus you see that the hive covers all but the space behind , which the board covers , and not a strange bee can get at the honey , without entering the hole at the side , and passing through among the bees belonging to the hive , which they will not often do ; if the family is numerous , it makes it as safe as feeding on the top ; with this advantage , there are no bees in the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be fed , raise the board at the back and pour in the honey ; the wire-cloth in the bottom prevents all bees from entering this space , at the same time will let the honey pass through directly under the bees , which will take it up quicker than from any other place that I can put it ; they will work all night even when the weather is quite cool . This board and feeder can be taken out when done feeding , and put away till wanted again ; if left under through the summer , it affords the worms a place rather too convenient to spin their cocoons , where they are not easily destroyed . FEEDING TO INDUCE EARLY SWARMS . If the object in feeding is to induce early swarms , of course the best stocks should be chosen for the purpose ; but some care is necessary not to give too much , and fill the combs with honey , that ought to be filled with brood , and thereby defeat your object ; one pound per day is enough , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial guide ; when plenty , feed less ; when scarce , more . Begin as soon as you can make them take it up in spring , and continue in accordance with the weather , till white clover blossoms , or swarms issue . Another object in feeding bees at this period , is to have the store combs all filled with inferior honey , so that when clover appears , ( which yields our best honey , ) there is no room except in the boxes to store it , which are now put on , and rapidly filled . When this last object is alone wished for , it is not much matter how much is given at a time , providing it is all taken up through the night ; it will then take no time in day-light , when they might work on flowers ; also , the bees would have no trouble in repelling any attempt of others to get at it . WHAT MAY BE FED . Inferior honey may be used for this purpose ; Southern or West India is good , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do ; but they do not relish it so well when fed without the honey . I have usually taken about equal quantities of each , adding a pint of water to ten pounds of this mixture , and making it as hot as it will bear without boiling over , and skimming it . IS CANDIED HONEY INJURIOUS ? There has an idea been advanced , that candied honey is injurious to bees , even said to be fatal . I never could discover any thing further , than it was a perfect waste , while in this state . When boiled , and a little water added , it appears to be just as good as any . Nearly every stock will have more or less of it on hand at this season ; but as warm weather approaches , and the bees increase to warm the hive , it seems to get liquified , from this cause alone . The bees , when compelled to use honey from these cells , thus candied , waste a large portion ; a part is liquid , and the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom-board , as the bees work it out very often . Another object in feeding bees , is to give inferior honey , mixed with sugar and flavored to suit the taste , to the bees , and let them store it in boxes for market . Now , I have no faith in honey undergoing any chemical change in the stomach of the bee , 14 and can not recommend this as the honest course . Neither do I think it would be very profitable , feeding to this extent , under any circumstances . I have a few times had some boxes nearly finished and fit for market at the end of the honey season ; a little more added would make them answer . I have then fed a few pounds of good honey , but always found that several pounds had to be given the bees to get one in the boxes . 14 Mr. Gillman 's patent for feeding bees , is based on the principle of a chemical change . It is said that the food he gives to the bees , when poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This appears extremely mysterious ; for it is well understood that when a bee has filled its sack it will go to the hive , deposit its load , and return immediately for more ; and will continue its labor throughout the day , or until the supply fails ; each load occupying but few minutes . The time in going from the feeder to the hive is so short that a change so important is not at all probable . The nature of bees seems to be to collect honey , not make it ; hence we find , when bees are gathering from clover , they store quite a different article than when from buckwheat ,  --  or when we feed West India honey , in quantities sufficient to have it stored pure in the boxes , we find that it has lost none of its bad taste in passing through the sacks of our northern bees . It appears most probable that , if Southern honey and cheap sugar form the basis of his food , ( which it is said to , ) that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound . Should this be the secret , it would seem like a waste to feed it to bees  --  a portion would be given to the brood , and possibly the old bees might not always refrain from sipping a little of the tempting nectar . Why not , when the compound was ready ,  --  instead of wasting it by this process ,  --  put it directly in market ? Or , is it necessary to have it in the combs to help psychologize the consumer into the belief that it is honey of a pure quality ? CHAPTER X. DESTRUCTION OF WORMS . I shall not give a full history of the moth in this chapter , as spring is not the time they are most destructive . It will be further noticed under the head of Enemies of Bees . But as this is a duty belonging to spring , a partial history seems necessary . As soon as the bees commence their labors , the worms are generally ready to begin theirs . SOME IN THE BEST STOCKS . You will probably find some in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the season when they often destroy your stocks , yet they injure them some . HOW FOUND . In the morning , when cool , raise the hive , and you will find them on the board . You must not suppose that these chaps are bred outside the hive , got their growth , and are now on their way among the bees , but the reverse . They are bred in the hive , and most of them are on the way out , and this is the precise time to arrest them and bring them to justice for their crimes . A TOOL FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION . I have used a simple tool , made in a few minutes , and very convenient in this business . Any one can make it . Get a piece of narrow hoop-iron , ( steel would be better , ) three-fourth inch wide , five inches long ; taper from one side three inches from the end to a point ; then grind each edge sharp ; make three or four holes through the wide end , to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be about two feet long and about half an inch square . Armed with this weapon , you can proceed . Raise the hive on one edge , and with the point of your sword you may pick a worm out of the closest corner , and easily scrape all from under the hive with it . Now , be sure and dispatch every one ; not that the " little victim " will itself , personally , do much mischief ; but through its descendants the mischief is to be apprehended . Very likely half of all you find will have finished their course of destruction , among the combs , and have voluntarily left them for a place to spin their cocoons . They are worried by the bees , if they are numerous , until satisfied that it is no safe place among them to make a shroud and remain helpless two or three weeks . Accordingly , when they get their growth they leave , get on the board on the bottom , become chilled and helpless in the morning , but again active by the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown on the earth , a place there will be selected , if no better is found , for transformation ; and a moth perfected ten feet from the hive is just as capable of depositing five hundred eggs in your hive , as if she had never left it . Several generations are matured in the course of one summer : consequently , one destroyed at this season , may prevent the existence of thousands before the summer is over . This is another subject of theoretical reasoning , and imposition , ( at least in my opinion . ) I wish the reader to judge for himself ; get rid of whims and prejudice , and look at the subject candidly and fair ; and if there is no corroborative testimony comes up to confirm any position that I assume , I shall not complain if my assertions fare no better than some others . Only defer judgment till you know for yourself . Bees have ever received my especial regard and attention ; and my enthusiasm may blind my judgment . I may be prejudiced , but will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories utterly false , when carried out in practice , that I can depend on no one 's hypothesis , however plausible , without facts in practice to support it . No one should be fully credited without a test . To return to our subject . MISTAKEN CONCLUSIONS . It is supposed by many , when these worms are found on the board , they get there by accident , having dropped from the combs above . They seem not to understand that the worm generally travels on safe principles ; that is , he attaches a thread to whatever he travels over . To be satisfied on this point , I have many times carefully detached his foot-hold , when on the side of the hive or other place , where he would fall a few inches , and always found him with a thread fast at the place he left , to enable him to regain his position if he chose . Is it not probable , then , that whenever he leaves the combs for the bottom-board , he can readily ascend again ? No doubt he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bees . Now , what I wish to get at by all this preamble , is simply this : that all our trouble and worrying to prevent the worms from again ascending to the combs  --  by wire hooks , wire pins , screws , nails , turned pins , clam-shells , blocks of wood , &c.,; is perfect nonsense , when half or more of them would not harm the bees any more if they did , and might as well go there as any where else . Besides , these useless " fixins " are very often a positive injury to the bees . OBJECTIONS TO SUSPENDED BOTTOM-BOARD . Suppose , if you please , that the worm has no thread attached above , and your board is far enough from the bottom of the hive to prevent his reaching it . Of course , he ca n't get up ; but how are your bees to do any better ? The worm can reach as high as they can . The bee can fly up , you think ; so it will , sometimes ; but will try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it does , it is a very bad position to start from , being a smooth board . In hot weather it does better . Did you ever watch by a hive thus raised , in April or May , towards night , when it was a little cool , and see the industrious little insects arrive with a load as heavy as they could possibly carry , all chilly , and nearly out of breath , scarcely able to reach home , and there witness their vain attempts to get among their fellows above them ? If you never witnessed this , I wish you would take some pains for it , and when you find them giving up in despair , when too chilly to fly , and perishing after many fruitless attempts for life , I think , if you possess sympathy , benevolence , or even selfishness , you will be induced to do as I did  --  discard at once wire hooks and all else from under the hive in the spring , and give the bees , when they do get home with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that is , protection . ADVANTAGE OF THE HIVE CLOSE TO THE BOARD . An inch hole in the side of the hive , a few inches from the bottom , as a passage for the bees , is needed , as I shall recommend letting the hive close to the board ; it is essential on account of robbing ; also , it is necessary to confine as much as possible the animal heat , in most hives , during the season the bees are engaged in rearing young brood ; and warmth is necessary to hatch the eggs , and develop the larvae ; we all know that when the hive is close , less heat will pass off than if raised an inch . OBJECTION ANSWERED . You object to this , and tell me , " the worms will get between the bottom of the hive and the board . " Well , I think they will , and what then ? Why I expect if you intend to succeed , that you will get them out , and crush their heads ; if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not keep them , or let some one have the care of them that will . I am as willing to find a worm under the edge of the hive , and dispatch it , as to have it creep into some place out of sight , and change to the moth . I once trimmed off the bottom of my hives to a thin edge , so they did not have this place for their cocoons , but now prefer to have them square . All profit is seldom obtained with anything . If you plant a field with corn , you do not expect that the whole work for the crop is finished . Neither should you expect when you set up a stock of bees , that a full yield will be realized without something more . If you are remunerated by keeping the weeds from your corn , be assured it is equally profitable to weed out your bees . INSUFFICIENCY OF INCLINED BOTTOM-BOARD . Now do not be deceived in this matter , and through indolence be induced to get those hives with descending bottom-boards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope by that means to get rid of the trouble ; ( I have already , in another chapter , expressed doubts of this ) . But we will now suppose such descending bottom-boards capable of throwing every worm that touches it " heels over head " to the ground ; what have we gained ? His neck is not broken , nor any other bone of his body ! As if nothing extraordinary had happened , he quietly gathers himself up , and looks about for snug quarters ; he cares not a fig for the hive now ; he gormandized on the combs until satisfied , before he left them , and is glad to get away from the bees any how . A place large enough for a cocoon is easily found , and when he again becomes desirous of visiting the hives , it is not to satisfy his own wants , but to accommodate his progeny ; he is then furnished with wings ample to carry him to any height that you choose to put your bees . A MOTH CAN GO WHERE BEES CAN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to be constructed . We frequently hear of them , but when they come to be tested , somehow these worms get where the bees are . When your hives become so full of bees , that they cover the board in a cool morning , the worms will be seldom found there , except under the edge of the hive . TRAP TO CATCH WORMS . You may now raise it , but you may still catch the worms by laying under the bees a narrow shingle , a stick of elder split in two lengthwise , and the pith scraped out , or anything else that will afford them protection from the bees , and where they may spin their cocoons . These should be removed every few days , and the worms destroyed , and the trap put back . Do not neglect it till they change to the moth , and you have nothing but to remove the empty cocoon . BOX FOR WREN . If you would take the trouble to put up a cage or two for the wren to nest in , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . He would be on the lookout when you were away , and many worms , while looking up a hiding-place in some corner , would be relieved from all further trouble by being deposited in his crop . The cage for him need not be more than four inches square ; it may be fastened near as possible to the bees ; to a post , tree , or side of some building a few feet high . I have seen the skull of some animal ( horse or ox ) used , and is very convenient for them , the cavity for the brains being used for the nest . A person once told me the wren would not build in one that he had put up . On examination , the stake to support it was found driven into the only entrance . I mention this to show how little some people understand what they do . It is sometimes well enough to know why a thing is to be done , as to know it must be done . I could tell you to do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why , then how to do it . Now if this prolixity is unnecessary for you , another may need it . You must remember I am endeavoring to teach some few to keep bees , who are not over supplied with ingenuity . CHAPTER XI . PUTTING ON AND TAKING OFF BOXES . Putting on boxes may be considered a duty intermediate between spring and summer management . I can not recommend putting them on as early as the last of April , or first of May , in ordinary circumstances . It is possible to find a case that it would be best . But before the hive is full of bees it is generally useless , very likely a disadvantage , by allowing a portion of animal heat to escape that is needed in the hive to mature the brood . Also , moisture may accumulate until the inside moulds , &c.; Some experience and judgment is necessary to know about what time boxes are needed . That boxes are needed at the proper season , I think I shall not need an argument to convince any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discarded the barbarous practice of killing the bees to obtain the honey . Many of them have learned that a good swarm will store sufficient honey for winter , besides several dollars worth as profit in boxes . ADVANTAGE OF THE PATENT VENDER . Here is where the patent vender has taken the advantage of our ignorance , by pretending that no other hive but his ever obtained such quantities , or so pure in quality . TIME OF PUTTING ON  --  RULE . It is probable a great many readers will need the necessary observation to tell precisely when the hive is full of honey ; it may be full of bees , and not of honey . And yet the only rule that I can give to be generally applied , is , when the bees begin to be crowded out , but a day or two before would be just the right time , that is , when they are obtaining honey  --  ( for it should be remembered that they do not always get honey when beginning to cluster out ) . This guide will do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience only can give . By observing a glass hive attentively , in those cells that touch the glass on the edge of the combs , whenever honey is being deposited here abundantly , it is quite evident that the flowers are yielding it just then , and other stocks are obtaining it also . Now is the time , if any cluster out , to put on the boxes . When boxes are made as I have recommended , that is , the size containing 360 solid inches , it is advisable to put on only one at first ; when this is full either of bees or honey , and yet bees are crowded outside , the other can be added . This is before swarming ; too much room might retard the swarming a few days , but if crowded outside , it indicates want of room , and the boxes can make but little difference . It is better to have one box well filled than two half full , which might be the case if the bees were not numerous . The object of putting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bees , that otherwise would remain idly clustering outside two or three weeks , as they often do , while preparing the young queens for swarming . But when all the bees can be profitably engaged in the body of the hive , more room is unnecessary . MAKING HOLES AFTER THE HIVE IS FULL . Whenever it is required to put boxes on a hive that has no holes through the top , it need not prevent your getting a few pounds of the purest honey that may be had , just as well as to have a portion of the bees idle . I always endeavor to ascertain in what direction the sheets of comb are made , and then mark off the row of holes on the top , at right angles with them . ADVANTAGE OF PROPER ARRANGEMENT . Two inches being nearly the right distance , each one will be so made that a bee arriving at the top of the hive between any two sheets will be able to find a passage into the box , without the task of a long search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when only one hole for a passage is made , or when the row of holes is parallel with the combs . A hive might contain eight or ten sheets of comb , and a bee desirous of entering the box might go up between any two , many times , before it found the passage . It has been urged that every bee soon learns all passages and places about the hive , and consequently will know the direct road to the box . This may be true , but when we recollect that all within the hive is perfect darkness  --  that this path must be found by the sense of feeling alone  --  that this sense must be its guide in all its future travels  --  that perhaps a thousand or two young workers are added every week , and these have to learn by the same means  --  it would seem , if we studied our own interest , we would give them all the facility possible for entering the boxes . What way so easy for them as to have a passage , when they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know all roads about the hive , can be partially proved by opening the door of a glass hive . Most of the bees about leaving , instead of going to the bottom for their exit , where they have departed many times , seem to know nothing of the way , but vainly try to get out through the glass , whenever light is admitted . I am so well convinced of this , that I take some pains to accommodate them with a passage between each comb ; they will then at least lose no time by mistakes between the wrong combs , crowding and elbowing their way back through a dense mass of bees which impede every step , until again at the top perhaps between the same combs , perhaps right , perhaps farther off than at first ; when I suppose they try it again ; as boxes are filled sometimes under just such circumstances . To assist them as much as possible , when new hives are used for swarms , I wait till the hive is nearly filled before making the holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it is uncertain which way the combs will be built , when the swarm is put in , unless guide-combs are used. 15 When holes are made before the bees are put in , guide-combs as directed for boxes should be put in ; ( of course they should cross at right angles the row of holes ) . 15 Perhaps Miner 's cross-bar hive would do it . DIRECTIONS FOR BORING HOLES IN FULL STOCKS . To make holes in the top after the combs are made ,  --  Mark out the top as directed for making hives and boxes . A centre bit or an auger bit with a lip or barb is best , as that cuts down a little faster than the chip is taken out , leaving it smooth ; when nearly through , a pointed knife can cut the remainder of the chip loose , and it can be taken out ; if it is between the combs , it is well ; if directly over the centre of one , it is a little better ; with the knife take out a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , no harm will be done . The bees will then have a passage through from either side of the comb . After you have opened one hole , very likely the bees will want to see what is going on over head , and walk out to reconnoitre . To prevent their interference , use some tobacco-smoke , and send them down out of your way , till your hole is finished . Now lay over this a small stone or block of wood , and make the others in the same way . When all are done , blow in some smoke as you uncover them , and put on your box . This process is not half so formidable as it appears ; I have in this way bored hundreds . You will remember my hives are not as high as many others keep them , they are in about as convenient a position as I can get them . This method saves me the trouble of sticking the guide-combs in my hives ; also , the necessity of covering or stopping the holes . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of nailing on a top in the usual way ; a half-inch board of the right length is cut into strips , some over an inch wide , and half an inch apart , across the top . It is plain that in such a hive a bee can pass into the box whenever it arrives at the top , without difficulty . I will here repeat the objection to allowing too much room , to pass into the boxes , that you may see the disadvantages of the extremes of too little and too much room . In these cross-bar hives , the animal heat rises into the box from the main hive , making it as warm as below ; the queen goes up with the bees , and finding it warm and convenient for breeding , deposits her eggs ; and young brood as well as honey is found there . When we think it full , it is then indispensable to return it , if taken off , till they hatch , ( otherwise they spoil it by moulding ) , which makes the combs dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that open bottom boxes must be used , which are not half as neat for market . TO BE TAKEN OFF WHEN FILLED . This advantage attends glass boxes : while being filled , the progress can be watched till finished , when they should be taken off to preserve the purity of the combs . Every day the bees are allowed to run over them , renders them darker . Consequently , when our bees are a long time filling a box , it is not as purely white as when filled expeditiously . TIME TAKEN TO FILL A BOX . Two weeks is the shortest time I ever had any filled and finished . This , of course , depends on the yield of honey , and size of the swarm ; three or four weeks are usually taken for the purpose . I have before said that the first yield of honey nearly fails in this section , usually about the 20th of July ; there are some variations , later or earlier , according to the season . In other places it may be much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can be ascertained by occasionally raising the cover to your glass boxes . When no more is being added , all boxes that are worth the trouble should be taken off ; if left longer the comb gets darker , and such cells of honey as are not sealed over , ( and sometimes the majority are such , ) the bees generally remove down into the hive . TOBACCO SMOKE PREFERRED TO SLIDES . When boxes are to be taken off , if a slide of tin , zinc , &c.,; is used to close the holes , some of the bees are apt to be crushed , others will find themselves minus a head , leg , or abdomen , and all of them be irritable for several days . A little tobacco smoke is preferable , as it keeps all quiet . Just raise the box to be taken off sufficient to puff under it some smoke , and the bees will leave the vicinity of the holes in an instant ; the box can then be removed , and another put on if necessary , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE BEES IN THE BOXES . Arouse the bees by striking the box lightly four or five times . If all the cells are finished , and honey is still obtained , turn the box bottom up , near the hive from which it was taken , so that the bees can enter it without flying ; by this means you can save several young bees , that have never left the hive and marked the location , and a few others too weak to fly , but will follow the others into the hive ; ( such are lost when we are obliged to carry them at a distance . ) Boxes can be taken off either in the morning or evening ; if in the morning , it may stand several hours when the sun is not too hot , but on no account let it stand in the sun in the middle of the day , as the combs will melt . The bees will all leave , sometimes in an hour ; at others they will not be out in three . They may be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather ; if not too cool , they are generally all out ; but here is some risk of the moth finding it and depositing her eggs ; perhaps one in fifty may be thus found . BEES DISPOSED TO CARRY AWAY HONEY . When boxes are taken off at the end of the honey season , a different method of getting rid of the bees must be adopted , or we lose our honey . Unless the combs are all finished , we lose some then any way , as most of the bees fill themselves before leaving ; they carry it home and return for more immediately , and take it all , if not prevented . It has been recommended to take it to some dark room with a small opening to let the bees out ; in the course of the day they will sometimes all leave ; but this method I have found unsafe , as they sometimes find the way back . When a large number of boxes are to be managed , a more expeditious mode is , to have a large box with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few barrels with one head out , set in some convenient place ; put the boxes in , one above another , but not in a manner to stop the holes ; over the top throw a sheet of one thickness , a thin one is best , as it will let through more light . The bees will leave the boxes , creep to the top , and get on the sheet ; take this off and turn it over a few times ; in this way all may be got rid of without the possibility of carrying off much honey . All that know the way will return to the hive , but a few young ones are lost . NOT DISPOSED TO STING . They seldom offer to sting during this part of the operation , even when the box is taken off without tobacco smoke , and carried away from the hive ; after a little time , the bees finding themselves away from home , lose all animosity . As honey becomes scarce , less brood is reared ; a great many cells that they occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey have been drained , and used to mature the portion of brood just started at the time of the failure . We can now understand , or think we do , why our best stocks that are very heavy , that but a few days before were crowded for room and storing in boxes , are now eager for honey to store in the hive ; as there is abundant room for several pounds . They will quickly remove to the hive the contents of any box left exposed ; or even risk their lives by entering a neighboring hive for it ; after being allowed to make a beginning , under such circumstances . RULE . During a yield of honey , take off boxes as fast as they are filled , and put on empty ones . At the end of the season take all off . Not one stock in a hundred will starve that has worked in boxes , that is , when the hive is the proper size , and full before adding the boxes , unless robbed or other casualty . CHAPTER XII . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PREVENTED . When the boxes are free from the bees , two things are to be prevented , if we wish to save our honey till cold weather . One is to keep out the worms , the other to prevent souring . The last may be new to many , but some few of us have had it caused by dampness in warm weather . The combs become covered with moisture , a portion of the honey becomes thin like water , and instead of the saccharine qualities we have the acid . Remedy : keep perfectly dry and cool , if you can , but dry at any rate . APT TO BE DECEIVED ABOUT THE WORMS . But the worms , you can surely keep them out , you think , since you can seal up the boxes perfectly close , preventing the moth or even the smallest ant from entering ! Yes , you may do this effectually , but the worms will often be there somehow , unless in a very low temperature , such as a very cool cellar , or in house , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little experience in this matter that spoils your theory entirely . I have taken off glass jars , and watched them till the bees were all out , and was certain the moth did not come near them , then immediately sealed them up ; absolutely preventing access afterwards , ( I could do this with a jar more effectually than a box which is made of several pieces , ) I then felt quite sure that I was ahead , and should have no trouble with the worms , as had often been the case before . I was sadly mistaken . THEIR PROGRESS DESCRIBED . In a few days , I could see at first a little white dust , like flour , on the side of the combs , and on the bottom of the jar . As the worms grew larger , this dust was coarser . By looking closely at the combs , a small white thread-like line was first perceptible , enlarging as the worm progressed . When combs are filled with honey , they go only on the surface , eating nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre , without an empty cell to give the chance . Disgusting as they seem to be , they dislike being daubed with honey . Wax , and not honey , is their food . The reader would like to know how these worms came in the jars , when , to all appearance , it was a physical impossibility . I would like to tell positively , but can not . But I will guess , if you will allow it . I will first premise , that I do not suppose they are generated spontaneously ! Their being found there , then , would indicate some agent or means not readily perceived . A SOLUTION OFFERED . The hypothesis that I offer is original and new , and therefore open for criticism ; if there is a better way to account for the mystery , I would be glad to know it . From the first of June till late in the fall , the moth may be found around our hives , active at night , but still in the day . The only object probably is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young may have food ; if no proper and convenient place is found , why , I suppose it will take up with such as it can find ; their eggs must be deposited somewhere , it may be in the cracks in the hive , in the dust at the bottom , or outside , as near the entrance as they dare approach . The bees running over them may get one or more of these eggs attached to their feet or bodies , and carry it among the combs , where it may be left to hatch . It is not at all probable that the moth ever passed through the hive among the bees , to deposit her eggs in the jars before mentioned . Had these jars been left on the hive , not a worm would have ever defaced a comb ; because , when the bees are numerous , each worm as soon as it commences its work of destruction will be removed , that is , when it works on the surface , as in the boxes of honey  --  in breeding combs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove . By taking off these jars and removing the bees , it gave all the eggs that happened to be there a fair chance . Many writers finding the combs undisturbed when left on the hive till cold weather , recommend that as the only safe way , preferring to have the combs a little darker , than the risk of being destroyed by the worms . But I object to dark combs , and leaving the boxes will effectually prevent empty ones taking their places , which are necessary to get all the profits . I will offer a few more remarks in favor of my theory , and then give my remedy for the worms . I have found in all hives where the bees have been removed in warm weather , say between the middle of June and September , ( and it has been a great many , ) moth eggs enough among the combs to destroy them in a very short time , unless kept in a very cool place ; this result has been uniform . Any person doubting this , may remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July or August ; and close it to prevent the possibility of a moth entering , set it away in a temperature ranging from sixty to ninety , and if there are not worms enough to satisfy him that this is correct , he will have better success than I ever did . Yet , no such result will follow , when the bees are left among the combs , unless the swarm be very small ; then the injury done will be in proportion . A strong stock may have as many moth eggs among the combs as a weak one , yet one will be scarcely injured , while the other may be nearly or quite destroyed . Now , if this theory be correct , and the bees do actually carry these eggs among the combs , is there not a great deal of lost labor in trying to construct a moth-proof hive ? The moth , or rather the worms , are ever present to devour the combs , whenever the bees have left them in this season . METHOD OF KILLING WORMS IN BOXES . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregoing , we will proceed with the remedy . Perhaps you may find one box in ten that will have no worms about it , others may contain from one to twenty when they have been off a week or more . All the eggs should have a chance to hatch , which in cool weather may be three weeks . They should be watched , that no worms get large enough to injure the combs much , before they are destroyed . Get a close barrel or box that will exclude the air as much as possible ; in this put the boxes , with the holes or bottom open . In one corner leave a place for a cup or dish of some kind , to hold some sulphur matches while burning . ( They are made by dipping paper or rags in melted sulphur . ) When all is ready , ignite the matches , and cover close for several hours . A little care is required to have it just right : if too little is used , the worms are not killed ; if too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little experience will soon enable you to judge . If the worms are not killed on the first trial , another dose must be administered . Much less sulphur will adhere to paper or rags , if it is very hot , when dipped , than when just above the temperature necessary to melt it ; this should be considered , as well as the number of boxes to be smoked , size of the vessel used in smoking them , &c.; Whether this gas from burning sulphur will destroy the eggs of the moth before the worm appears , I have not tested sufficiently to decide ; but I do know that it is an effectual quietus for the larvae ! FREEZING DESTROYS THEM . Boxes taken off at the end of warm weather , and exposed in a freezing situation through the winter , appear to have all the worms as well as eggs for them destroyed by the cold ; consequently , all boxes so exposed , may be kept any length of time ; the only care being necessary , to shut out the moth effectually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which the bees have been removed in warm weather . I prefer taking off all boxes at the end of the first yield of honey , even when I expect to put them on again for buckwheat honey . The bees at this season collect a great abundance of propolis , which they spread over the inside of the boxes as well as hive ; in some instances it is spread on the glass so thick as to prevent the quality of honey being seen . There is no necessity for boxes on a hive at any season when there is no yield of honey to fill them . Sometimes even in a yield of buckwheat honey , a stock may contain too few bees to fill boxes , but just a few may go into them and put on the propolis ; this should not be allowed , as it makes it look bad when used another year . At this season , ( August ) some old stocks may be full of combs , and but few bees , but swarms when they have got the hive full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into the boxes to work . I have known them to do so in three weeks after being hived . OBJECTION TO USING BOXES BEFORE THE HIVE IS FULL . Some put on boxes at the time of hiving the bees . In such cases the box is often filled first , and nearly as often will contain brood . I consider it no advantage , and often a damage to do so ; as I want the hive full any way  --  and then if they have time let them into boxes , although it may be buckwheat , instead of clover honey that we get . CHAPTER XIII . SWARMING . TIME TO EXPECT THEM . The season for regular swarms in this section , I have known to commence the 15th of May , and in some seasons the 1st of July . The end is about the 15th of the latter month , with some exceptions . I have had one as late as the 21st ; also a few buckwheat swarms between the 12th and 25th of August . The subject now before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of an increase of stocks is sufficient to create some interest , even when the phenomenon of swarming would fail to awaken it . But to the naturalist this season has charms that the indifferent beholder can never realize . ALL BEE-KEEPERS SHOULD UNDERSTAND IT AS IT IS . As a guide in many cases , it is important that the practical apiarian should understand this matter as it is , and not as said to be by many authors . I shall be under the necessity of differing from nearly all in many points . MEANS OF UNDERSTANDING IT . This is another case of " when doctors disagree , who shall decide ? " You , reader , are just the person . There is no need of a doctor at all in this matter . I will endeavor to give a test for most of my assertions . To make this subject as plain as possible in this place , I may repeat some things said before . The facts related have come under my own observation . I have probably taken more pains than most bee-keepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning , ( I mean the bottom of the cells ) . But few apiarians have made the number of examinations that I have to get at the modus operandi of swarming . Perhaps I ought not to expect full credit for veracity , when I assure the reader that I have inverted more than one hundred stocks to get a peep at the royal cells , some of them near a dozen times in one summer . I have inverted them frequently for the purpose of obtaining cells . But generally to see when such cells are being made , when they contain eggs , when these eggs are sufficiently matured for swarming , or abandoned and destroyed , &c.; By these signs I predict with certainty ( almost ) when to expect swarms , and when to cease looking for them . INVERTING A STOCK RATHER FORMIDABLE AT FIRST . To a person that has never inverted a hive full of bees , even to overflowing , or never has seen it done , it appears like a great undertaking , as well as the probability of ruining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the performance is greatly diminished , and will grow less with every repetition of the feat , until there is not the least dread attending it . Without tobacco smoke I hardly think it practicable , but with it , there is not the least difficulty . It would be very unsatisfactory to turn over a hive and nothing to drive the bees away from the very places on the combs that you wish particularly to inspect . The smoke is just the thing to do it ! As for the bad effects of such overturning and smoking , I never discovered any . REQUISITES BEFORE PREPARATION OF QUEEN 'S CELLS . I have found the process for all regular swarms something like this : before they commence , two or three things are requisite . The combs must be crowded with bees ; they must contain a numerous brood advancing from the egg to maturity ; the bees must be obtaining honey either by being fed or from flowers . Being crowded with bees in a scarce time of honey is insufficient to bring out the swarm , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brood . The period that all these requisites happen together , and remain long enough , will vary with different stocks , and many times do not happen at all through the season , with some . These causes then appear to produce a few queen-cells , generally begun before the hive is filled , ( sometimes when only half full , but usually remain as rudiments till the next year , when the foregoing conditions of the stock may require their use ) . STATE OF QUEEN 'S CELL WHEN USED . They are about half finished , when they receive the eggs ; as these eggs hatch into larvae , others are begun , and receive eggs at different periods for several days later . The number of such cells seem to be governed by the prosperity of the bees : when the family is numerous , and the yield of honey abundant , they may amount to twenty , at other times perhaps not more than two or three ; although several such cells may remain empty . I have already said that a failure , ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey at any time from the depositing of royal eggs till the sealing of the cells , ( which is about ten days ) , would be likely to bring about their destruction . Even after being sealed , I have found a few instances where they were destroyed . STATE WHEN SWARMS ISSUE . But when there is nothing precarious about the honey , the sealing of these cells is the time to expect the first swarm , which will generally issue the first fair day after one or more are finished . I never missed a prediction for a swarm 48 hours , when I have judged from these signs , in a prosperous season . When there is a partial failure of honey , the swarm sometimes will wait several days after finishing them . CLUSTERING OUTSIDE NOT ALWAYS TO BE DEPENDED UPON . The clustering out of the bees I find but a poor criterion to judge from , further than full hives do swarm  --  many such do not . EXAMINATIONS  --  THE RESULT . I will detail a few circumstances , that have led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail , when only about one third of my good stocks had cast swarms ; and all at once , the issues began to " be few and far between . " I had previously examined , and found they had gone into preparations pretty extensively ; by having not only constructed cells , but occupied them with royal eggs and larvae . Now I examined again , and found five out of six had destroyed them , ( at the same time the bees clustered out extensively ) . This put an end to all hopes of swarms here . Some few had finished their cells , and these , I had some hopes , would send out the swarms ; but the dry weather caused some misgivings . After waiting three or four days and none coming , I found these sealed cells destroyed also , and had no more swarms that season . Subsequent observations have fully confirmed these things . One season some of the hives commenced preparations at two different periods , and then abandoned them without swarming at all , through the summer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next in July . REMARKS . The failure of honey was the cause , without any doubt . And who shall say , these bees were not wise in their conduct ? What prudent man would emigrate with a family , if the prospect of a famine was plainly indicated , when , by remaining at home , there was enough , at least for the present ? Who can help but admire this wise and beautiful arrangement ? The combs must contain brood ; the bees must find honey during the rearing of the queens . If a swarm were to issue the moment of obtaining honey , the consequence might be fatal , as there would not be a numerous brood to hatch out , and replenish the old stock with bees sufficient to keep out the worms . Were they to issue at any time , as soon as the bees had increased enough in numbers to spare a swarm , without regard to the yield of honey , they might starve . CONFLICTING THEORIES . I find many theories conflicting with these views , which appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young queen must be matured to issue with the swarms , and the old one with the old bees are permanent residents of the old hive . BOTH OLD AND YOUNG LEAVE WITH SWARMS . It is probable that no rule governs the issue of workers . Old and young come out promiscuously . That old bees come out may be known sometimes , by so many leaving , that not a quarter as many will be left , as commenced work in the spring . That young bees leave , any one may be satisfied on seeing a swarm issue ; a great many too young and weak to fly will drop down in front of the hive , having come out now for the first time , and perhaps some of them had not been out of the cell an hour ; these very young bees are known by the color . CAUSE OF THE QUEEN 'S INABILITY TO FLY SUGGESTED . The old queen often gets down in the same way ; but I would assign another cause for her inability to fly ; that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EVIDENCE OF THE OLD QUEEN 'S LEAVING . That the old queen does leave with the first swarm is indicated by several things : one is , eggs may often be found on the board the next morning ; another , when the first swarm has left , and before any of these royal cells hatch , the bees may be driven out and no queen will be found , or you may drive out the bees at the end of three weeks , and the brood of workers will be about all hatched , the drone brood not quite as near . The combs may also contain some eggs , and perhaps some very young larvae , that have been deposited by the young queen , which begins to lay usually sixteen or eighteen days after the first swarm . This shows a cessation of laying eggs for about two weeks . First swarms will have eggs in the cells as soon as they are made to hold them , which is often within 24 hours after being hived ; occasionally a new piece of comb will fall down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are almost certain to contain eggs . I could add other proof , but the attentive observer will discover it himself . MR . WEEKS ' THEORY NOT SATISFACTORY . Mr. J. M. Weeks , in his work on bees , says , " Two causes and two only can be assigned why bees ever swarm : the first , the crowded state of the hive ; the second , to avoid the battle of the queens . " The first cause producing first swarms , the other second , third , &c.; Mr. Colton 's patent hive , it is said , can be made to swarm " at any time within two days , " merely for want of room . By removing the six boxes attached to it , the bees are compelled to crowd into the main body of the hive , and swarm out in consequence . Now , if merely crowding the hive with bees is the only cause of first swarms , how is it that half or more of mine refused to swarm , when a great many , for want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers maturing every day to crowd them still more ? To me the reason is plain , that some of the before-mentioned requisites were wanting . Mr. Weeks further says , when the first swarm has left , " not a single queen , in any stage of minority , is left in the old hive ; the bees , destitute of a queen , set about constructing several royal cells , take larvae or eggs and put in them , and feed with royal jelly , and in a few days have a queen . " Although I had not had much experience at the time of getting his work , I had some doubts , because I found that all hives that became full and began to run over , did not swarm , and some others swarmed before being quite full ; it seemed as if something like a preparation beforehand was requisite . I knew of no means , for a long time , that would decide positively ; when it occurred to me , if I examined the old stock immediately after the first swarm had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any ; a thing so simple and easy that I felt somewhat mortified not to have thought of it before . The first stock I looked at revealed the secret . I examined it the evening of the day that a swarm had left ; I was gratified by finding two finished cells on the lower edges of the combs ; other cells were in different stages of progression , from those containing an egg to the full developed larva . Several more hives showed the same result . I now got bold enough to examine some previous to swarming , as I have already explained . MR . MINER NOT CORRECT . Mr. T. B. Miner , in his work , has allowed the preparation of queen cells previous to swarming , but he has put off the time of the swarm issuing eight or nine days too long . That is , he has the young queen matured so that she commences piping first , which does not occur more than one time in fifty . Now I think it more than probable that many readers will have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet I think I can give directions sufficiently particular that they may remove them themselves . They should bear in mind that they have no right to be positive on any subject without an investigation . PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS FOR TESTING THE MATTER . I will now give more minute directions for an examination . Full hives require a little more care than those containing fewer bees . Do n't let the crowded state of the hive , even if some are outside , deter you from gratifying a laudable curiosity , ( such hives are most likely to possess these cells . ) Let the satisfaction of ascertaining a few facts for yourselves stimulate you to this exertion , the risk is not much ; what I have done you may do . This is better than to rely on any man 's " ipse dixit . " I do it without any protection whatever for face or hands ; but , if you have too much fear of stings , a veil to protect the face may be put on , but do without it , if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . The best time is , when most of the bees are out at work near the middle of the day ; but then the bees from the other hives are sometimes cross , and interfere . On that account I prefer morning or evening , although there are more bees to be smoked out of the way . If you are accustomed to smoking tobacco , you will find a pipe just the thing for making a smoke here ; if not , vide a description of an apparatus in chap . 18th , p. 281 . When you are ready to proceed , some smoke must be blown under the hive before you touch it ; then raise the front side a few inches , and blow in some more ; now carefully lift the hive from the stand , avoiding any jar , as this would arouse their anger ; turn it bottom upwards ; also , be careful all the time not to breathe among them . More smoke will now make them crowd among the combs out of your way while you examine . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzing , and rush up the sides of the hive , but a little smoke will drive them back ; get them out of the way as much as possible , and look on the edges of the combs for the queens ' cells , where most of them are . If the hive is fully supplied with honey , they will be near the bottom , if not , farther up among the combs ; in some hives they can not be seen even where they exist . Yet they may be found in four out of five , by a thorough search . I have found nine within two inches of the bottom , some on the extreme ends of the comb . I would here give a caution about turning over hives with very new combs , before they are attached to the sides of the hive , as they are apt to bend over . EMPTY HIVES TO BE READY . We will now suppose that some of your stocks are ready to cast their swarms : we will also presume that your empty hives for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare a hive after the swarm has issued is bad management ; negligence here argues negligence elsewhere ; it is one of the premonitions of " bad luck . " BOTTOM-BOARDS FOR HIVING . You will want also a number of bottom-boards , expressly for hiving ; get a board a little larger than the bottom of the hive , nail strips across the ends on the under side to prevent warping ; in the middle cut out a space five or six inches square , and cover with wire cloth . These are for your large swarms in very hot weather , to be used for four or five days . They are much safer than to raise the hive an inch or more for ventilation . They are also essential for many other occasions . I would not do without them , even if the expense was ten times what it is . DESCRIPTION OF SWARM ISSUING . When the day is fair and not too much wind , first swarms generally issue from ten o'clock till three ; if you are on the lookout , the first outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bees around the entrance , from one to sixty minutes before they start . The utmost confusion seems to prevail , bees running about in every direction ; the entrance apparently closed with the mass of bees , ( perhaps one exception in twenty , ) presently a column from the interior forces a passage to the open air ; they come rushing out by hundreds , all vibrating their wings as they march out ; and when a few inches from the entrance , rise in the air ; some run up the side of the hive , others to the edge of the bottom-board . If you have seen the old queen come rushing out the first one , and the rest following her , as we are often told she does , you have seen what I never did in a first swarm ! Second and third swarms conduct themselves quite differently . I have seen the old queen issue a few times , but not till half the swarm was out . The bees when first rising from the hive , describe circles of but few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area of several rods . Their movement are much slower than usual , in a few minutes thousands may be seen revolving in every possible direction ! A swarm may be seen and heard , at a distance , where fifty hives , ordinarily at work , would not be noticed ! When about out of the hive , or soon after , some branch of a tree or bush is usually selected on which to cluster . In less than half a minute after the spot is indicated , even when the bees are spread over an acre , they are gathered in the immediate vicinity , and all cluster in a body from five to ten minutes after leaving the hive . They should now be hived immediately , as they show impatience if left long , especially in the sun ; also , if another stock should send out a swarm while they were hanging there , they would be quite sure to mix together . MANNER OF HIVING CAN BE VARIED . It makes but little difference what way they are put in the hive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is most convenient ; an old table or bench is very good to keep them out of the grass if there should happen to be any ; if there is not much in the way , lay your bottom-board on the ground , make it level , set your hive on it , and raise one edge an inch or more to give the bees a chance to enter . USUAL METHOD . Cut off the branch with the bees , if it can be done as well as not , and shake it in front of the hive , a portion will discover it , and will at once commence a vibration of their wings ; this , I suppose , is a call for the others . A knowledge of a new home being found seems to be communicated in this way , as it is kept up until all are in . A great many are apt to stop about the entrance , thereby nearly or quite closing it , and preventing others going in , when they will gather on the outside . You can expedite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing them away ; and another portion will enter . When gentle means will not induce them to go in , in a reasonable time , and they appear obstinate , a little water sprinkled on them will facilitate operations greatly , when nothing else will . ( Be careful and not over-do the matter , by using too much water , they can be so wet as not to move at all . ) When they cluster on a branch that you do not wish to cut off , place your bottom-board as near as convenient ; on it lay two sticks about an inch in diameter , of the same length : try the hive , and see that all is right ; then turn it bottom up , directly under the main part of the cluster ; if you have an assistant , let him jar the branch sufficiently to detach the bees ; most of them will fall directly into the hive . If no assistant is at hand it is unnecessary to wait , ( I have done it a hundred times without help ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the branch hard enough to dislodge them , then turn it on the board ; the sticks will prevent the bottom crushing many bees . WHEN OUT OF REACH . I have gone up a ladder fifteen feet , got the bees in the hive in this way , and backed down without difficulty . After putting the hive in its place , sometimes a part will go back ; in that case , a small branch full of leaves should be held directly under and close to them , and as many jarred on it as possible . Hold this still , and shake the other to prevent their clustering there ; you will soon have them all collected , ready to bring down , and put by the hive . A handle basket or large tin pan may be taken up the ladder instead of the hive , when they can be readily emptied before it . But very few will fly out in coming down . If you succeed in getting nearly all the bees in the first effort , and but few are left , merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , and will turn their attention to those below , where those which have already found a hive will be doing their best to call them . When the hive is first turned over , most of the bees fall on the board and rush out , but as soon as it is realized that a home is found , a buzzing commences inside ; this quickly communicates the fact to those outside , which immediately turn about , facing the hive and hum in concert , while marching in . Another plan may be adopted , even if fifteen feet high ; when the branch is not too large , and there is not too much in the way below it . Have ready two or three light poles of suitable length ; select such as have a branch at the upper end , large enough to hold a two-bushel basket . This is raised directly under the swarm ; with another pole , the bees are all dislodged , and fall into the basket , and are quickly let down . Now , if you have got about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to prevent their escape . They soon become quiet , and may be hived without many going back to the branch , as they do , when attempting to hive them immediately . I often have them begin to cluster near the ground , very conveniently for hiving . In such a case , I do not wait for all to collect , but as soon as such place is indicated , I get the board and hive ready . When a quart or so are gathered , shake them in a hive , and set it up ; the swarm will now go to that , instead of the branch , especially if the latter is shaken a little . Where many stocks are kept , it is advisable to be as expeditious as possible . A swarm will thus hive itself much sooner than when it is allowed to cluster . WHEN THEY CAN NOT BE SHAKEN OFF . Swarms will sometimes get in places where it is impossible to jar them off , or cut off a branch , such as the trunk of a tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place the hive near , as first directed ; take a large tin dipper , a vessel most convenient for the purpose , and dip it full of bees ; with one hand turn back the hive ; with the other throw the bees into it ; some of them will discover that a home is provided , and set up the call for the rest , ( by the vibration of their wings ) , and the remainder may be emptied in front of the hive as you dip them off . I have known a few instances when the first dipper full all ran out , and joined the others without making the discovery that they were in a hive , but this is seldom the case . When you get the queen in , there is no trouble with the remainder , even if there are many left ; as soon as they ascertain that the queen is no longer among them , it may be known by their uneasy movements , and they will soon leave , and join those in the hive ; but if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen with her , they will leave the hive and cluster again . ALL SHOULD BE MADE TO ENTER . In all cases be sure to get them all to enter ; a cluster outside of it may contain the queen , unconscious of a home so near ; and the probable consequence might be , she would leave for a miserable one in the woods . SHOULD BE TAKEN TO THE STAND IMMEDIATELY . When all are in , except a few that will be flying , let the hive down close to the board ; take hold of this and carry it at once to the stand they are to occupy , and raise the front edge half an inch ; let the back rest on the board ; this will give them means to re-ascend , if they chance to drop , which large swarms often do in hot weather . If the bottom is an inch or more from the board when the bees fall , there is nothing to prevent their rushing out on every side  --  their means of getting up again are bad  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some chances for their leaving . PROTECTION FROM THE SUN NECESSARY . Another thing is very important ; swarms should be protected from the sun for several days , in hot weather , from nine o'clock till three or four ; and then if the heat is very oppressive , and the bees cluster outside , sprinkle them with water and drive them in ; and by wetting the hive occasionally , it will carry off a large portion of the heat , and make it much more comfortable . CLUSTERING BUSHES . If there are no large trees in the vicinity of your apiary , all the better , as there will then be no danger of your swarms lighting on them ; but all bee-keepers are not so fortunate , myself being one of the number . In such a place it is necessary to provide something for them to cluster on ; get some bushes six or eight feet high ( hemlock is preferable ) ; cut off the ends of the branches , except a few near the top : secure the whole with strings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth deep enough to hold them , and large enough to be lifted out easily . The bees will be likely to cluster on some of these ; they can then be raised out , and the bees hived without difficulty . A bunch of dry mullein tops tied together on the end of a pole , makes a very good place for clustering ; it so nearly resembles a swarm that the bees themselves appear to be sometimes deceived . I have frequently known them leave a branch where they had begun to cluster , and settle on this when held near . The motives for immediately removing the swarm to the stand are , that they are generally more convenient to watch in case they are disposed to leave ; also many bees can be saved . All that leave the hive , mark the location the same as in spring ; several hundreds will probably leave the first day ; a few may leave several times ; when removed at night , such will return to the stand of the previous day , and generally are lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent stand , this loss is avoided . Those that are left flying at the time , return to the old stock , which those that return from the swarm the next day will not always do . The time for moving them now is no more than at another . It is unnecessary to object , and say , that " it will take too long to wait for the bees to get in ; " this will not do . I shall insist on your getting all the bees to enter before leaving any way . I consider this an essential feature in the management . I will not say that my directions will always prevent their going to the woods , but this I do say , that out of the hundreds that I have hived , not one has ever left . It is possible proper management has had no influence in my success , yet something like an opinion of this kind has been indulged for a long time . HOW SWARMS ARE GENERALLY MANAGED THAT LEAVE FOR THE WOODS . Some of my neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight , and how do they manage ? When the word is given out , " Bees swarming , " a tin-horn , tin-pan , bells , or anything to make a " horrible din , " is seized upon in the hurry of the moment , and as much noise made as possible , to make them cluster ; ( which they naturally would do without the music , at least all mine have . This probably gave rise to the opinion of one old lady , who knew " drumming on a pan did good , for she had tried it . " ) Very often a hive is to be constructed , or an old one unfit to use any way , needs some sticks across , or something to take time . When the hive is obtained , it must be washed with something nice to make the bees like it ; a little honey must be daubed on the inside ; sugar and water , molasses and water , salt and water , or salt and water rubbed on with hickory leaves , " is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just as good , and some are better . Even whisky , that bane of man , has been offered them as a bribe to stay , and sometimes they are persuaded and go to work . NOTHING BUT BEES NEEDED IN A HIVE . Now I can not say positively that these things do harm , yet I am quite sure they do no good , as nothing but bees is needed in a hive . Is it reasonable to suppose they are fond of all the " knick-knacks " given them ? I have never used any , and could not possibly have done better . I am careful to have the hive sweet and clean , and not too smooth inside ; an old hive that has been used before is scalded and scraped . But to the manner they get the bees in , after the hive is ready . A table is set out , and a cloth spread on it ; sticks are put on to raise the hive an inch or more : if they succeed in getting the swarm even on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in , it is well ; if they go off , why hope for " better luck next time . " The hive is left unsheltered in the hot sun and when there is no wind , the heat is soon insupportable , or at least very oppressive ; the bees hang in loose strings , instead of a compact body , as when kept cool ; they are very apt to fall , and when they do , will rush out from every side : if the queen chances to drop with them , they may " step out . " Two thirds of all the bees that go to the woods are managed in this , or a similar manner , and may it not be said , they are fairly driven off ? SELDOM GO OFF WITHOUT CLUSTERING . Perhaps one swarm in three hundred will depart for the woods without first clustering . I have had three times that number , not one of which has ever left me thus . Yet I have evidence not to be disputed that some will do it . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . Two were lost , the other was followed to a tree , half a mile off ; I assisted in cutting the tree , and hiving them . The cavity where they entered was very small , and contained old comb , made by a swarm a year or two previous , which had probably starved , as there was too little room for storing sufficient honey for winter . This swarm , when hived and carried home , remained perfectly contented . DO SWARMS CHOOSE A LOCATION BEFORE SWARMING ? The inquiry is often made , Do all swarms have a place looked out before leaving the parent stock ? The answer to this must ever be guess-work . I could offer some circumstances indicating the affirmative very strongly , and as much for the negative ; and will let it pass at that . Yet I think if bees are properly cared for , that ninety-nine swarms in a hundred will prefer a good clean hive to a rotten tree in the woods . MEANS OF ARRESTING A SWARM . I have had three swarms that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarming out after being hived ; the third and fourth time they left , I threw water among them , causing quite a shower ; when my pail-full was out , I used earth ; they went but a short distance , and clustered in the usual way . Now were these bees intending to leave , and had their designs frustrated by the water and earth ? I am not quite as sure as the old lady , who knew that " drumming on a tin-pan did good , " but I am inclined to think it had some effect . I have heard of several instances where swarms were apparently stopped , by having earth thrown among them , while passing over a field where men were at work . We know they dislike being wet , as we see them hastening home on the approach of a shower ; or we can at any time drive them in the hive by sprinkling them with water . Throwing water in the swarm is a kind of imitation shower , and earth is something like it . Whether useful or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I should try it again under similar circumstances . SOME COMPULSION . After getting them in the hive for the fourth time , I resolved not to be baffled or have much more such trouble , and perhaps go to the woods at last , thereby setting a bad example . I put under the hive the wire-cloth bottom-board , opened two or three holes on the top , and covered these also with wire-cloth , ( this was to let the air circulate ) ; a quantity of honey and water was given them and they were then carried to the cellar , and kept prisoners four days , except half an hour before sunset ; when too late to leave for a journey , I set them out to provide a few necessaries , and then returned them to the cellar . In four days , when honey enough is given them , a good swarm will half fill an ordinary hive with combs . Some of the first eggs deposited will be about hatching into larvae , all of which would seem like too much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them liberty ; shading the hive , &c.,; as before directed . They all proved faithful and industrious , prospering like others . If their design was for a distant location , they put a good face on the matter in the end . HOW FAR WILL THEY GO IN SEARCH OF A HOME ? How far they will travel in search of a home , is also uncertain . I have heard of their going seven miles , but could not learn how the fact was proved . I have no experience of my own in this matter , but will relate a circumstance that happened near me a few years since . A neighbor was ploughing , when a swarm passed over him ; being near the earth , he " pelted them heartily " with the loose dirt he had ploughed up , which seemed to bring them up , or rather down , as they clustered on a very low bush ; they were hived , and gave no further trouble . A man living some three miles from this neighbor , on that day hived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the sun as described a page or two back ; about three o'clock their stock of patience was probably exhausted , when they resolved to seek a better shelter . They put off in a great hurry , not even waiting to thank their owner for the spread on his table , and the sweet-scented " yarbs " and good things with which he had rubbed their hive . They gave him no notice whatever of their intention to " quit , " until they were moving ! With all their goods ready packed , they were soon under way , accompanied by their owner with music ; but whether they marched with martial precision , keeping time , is uncertain . In this case the bees took the lead ; the man with his tin-pan music kept the rear , and was soon at a respectful distance . They were either not in a mood , just then , to be charmed by melodious sounds , or their business was too urgent to allow them to stop and listen ! Their means of locomotion being superior to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after following about a mile . Another person , about the same time in the day , saw a swarm moving in the same direction of the first ; he also followed them till compelled to yield to their greater travelling facilities . A third discovered their flight and attempted a race , but like the others soon came out behind . The before-mentioned neighbor saw them , and thought of the fresh earth that he had ploughed up , which he threw among them till they stopped . How much farther they would have gone , if any , would be guessing . That it was the same swarm that started three miles away , appears almost certain ; the direction was the same as seen by all , until they were stopped ; the time in the day also exactly corresponded . We will now return to the issuing of the swarms . There will be some emergencies to provide for , and some exceptions to notice . TWO OR MORE SWARMS LIABLE TO UNITE . If we expect to keep many stocks , the chances are that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they do , they nearly always cluster together ( I once knew an instance where only three stocks were kept ; they all swarmed and clustered together ) . It is plain that the greater the number of stocks , the more such chances are multiplied . DISADVANTAGE . One first swarm , if of the usual size , will contain bees enough for profit , yet two such will work together without quarrelling , and will store about one-third more than either would alone ; that is , if each single swarm would get 50 lbs. , the two together would not get over 70 lbs. , perhaps less . Here , then , is a loss of 30 lbs. , besides one of the swarms is about lost for another year ; because such double swarms are not generally any better the next spring as a stock , and often not as good as a single one . You will therefore see the advantage of keeping the first swarms separate . CAN OFTEN BE PREVENTED . " Prevention is better than cure . " We can , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one issuing at a time . This depends on our knowledge of indications , in a great measure . I have said that before starting to fly off , they were about the entrance in great numbers ; there may be one exception in twenty , where the first indications will be a column of bees rushing from the hive . To take this matter a little farther from the surface , we will take a peep at the interior ; that is , if our hives contain glass boxes , such as have been recommended . It is an advantage to know which are about to cast their swarms , as long beforehand as possible . INDICATIONS OF SWARMING INSIDE THE HIVE . These glass boxes are usually filled with bees ; before leaving they may be seen in commotion , long before any unusual stir is visible outside , sometimes for near an hour . The same may be noticed in a glass hive . Now , in good weather , when we have reason to expect many swarms , it is our duty to watch closely , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A number of stocks may have finished their queen-cells during the bad weather , and be ready to come out within the first hour of sunshine that occurs in the middle of the day . We must expect some such occurrences , and in large apiaries there is apt to be trouble , unless you take some precautions . If you have taken no care ( which but few will ) , by previous examinations , to know which are ready , as soon as one has started or commenced flying , look at all the rest that are in condition to swarm ; or , what is much better , look before any have started . Even if nothing unusual is seen about the entrance , raise the cover to the boxes . If the bees in them are all quiet as usual , no swarm need be immediately apprehended , and you will probably have time to hive one or two first . PREVENTING A SWARM ISSUING FOR A TIME . But should you discover the bees running to and fro in great commotion , although there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time in sprinkling those outside with water from a watering-pot , or other means . They will immediately enter the hive to avoid the supposed shower . In half an hour they will be ready to start again , in which time the others may be secured . I have had , in one apiary , twelve hives all ready in one day , and did actually swarm ; several of which would have started at once , had they not been kept back with water , allowing only one at a time , thus keeping them separate . They had been kept back by the clouds , which broke away about noon . TO PREVENT SWARMS UNITING WITH THOSE ALREADY HIVED . When any of the subsequent swarms were disposed to unite with those already hived , a sheet was thrown over to keep them out . I had four so covered at once . An assistant , in such cases , is very important ; one can watch symptoms and keep them back , while the other hives the swarms . Occasionally , when ready for a swarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so at once . Whenever a part have got on the wing , I never succeeded in stopping the issue : consequently I have found it useless trying to drive or coax them back in such cases . To succeed , the means must be used in season , before any of the swarm leaves . WHEN TWO HAVE UNITED , THE METHOD OF SEPARATING . Two or more swarms will cluster together , and not quarrel , if put in one hive ; I have already told you the disadvantages . Unless business is very urgent , your time can not be better employed than in dividing them . First , it is necessary to provide a good stock of patience , as it may be a short job , or it may be a long one . Get two empty hives , and divide the bees as nearly equal as possible . It is generally the best way to spread a sheet on the ground , and shake the bees in the centre , and set the hives each side of the mass , their edges raised to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter one hive , set it farther off . If they cluster in a situation where they can not be got to the earth in a body , they must be dipped off as before directed , but , in this case , putting a dipper full in each hive alternately , until all are in . They should be made to hurry some in going in ; keep the entrance clear , and stir them up often ; or sprinkle a very little water on them , as they should not be allowed to stop their humming until all are in . We have one chance in two of getting a queen in each . The two hives should now be placed twenty feet apart ; if there is a queen in each , the bees in both will remain quiet , and the work is done ; but if not , the bees in the one destitute will soon manifest it by running about in all directions , and , when the queen can not be found , will leave for the other hive , where there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now there are two or three methods of separating these queens ; one is , to empty the bees out and proceed as before , a kind of chance game , that may succeed at the next trial , and may have to be repeated . Another way is , that , as soon as it is ascertained which is without a queen , before many bees leave , spread down a sheet ; set this hive on it , and tie the corners over the top to secure the bees for the present , turn the hive on its side for the present to give them air ; or it may be let down on a wire cloth bottom-board and the hole in the side stopped , and this would be less likely to smother the bees , if it could be secured to the bottom , and have the hive lie on its side ; when this division is secured , get another hive , and jar out those with the queens ; let them enter as before , and then set them apart , &c.,; watching the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be known by the same appearances . The process must be continued till separate , or the number with the queens may be easily looked over , and one of them found ; indeed , a sharp lookout should be kept up from the beginning , and the queens caught , if possible . NO DANGER OF A STING BY THE QUEEN . No danger of her sting need be apprehended , as she will not demean herself to use that for a common foe ; she must have a royal antagonist . When successful in obtaining one , it is sufficient ; put her in a tumbler or some safe place ; then put your bees in two hives , place them as directed , and you will soon learn where your queen is needed . After all is done , the two hives should not be nearer than twenty feet , at least the first day ; perhaps forty would be still better . When two swarms are mixed , and then separated , it is evident that a portion of each swarm must be in both hives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger to at least a part of the bees ; these might , if their own mother was too near , discover her , and leave the stranger for an old acquaintance , and , in the act of going , call or attract the whole with them , including the queen . I have known a few instances of the kind . SOME PRECAUTIONS IN HIVING TWO SWARMS TOGETHER . If you are disposed to separate them , but are afraid to work among them to this extent in the middle of the day , or if there is danger of more issuing , to mix with them , and add to your perplexity , of which you already have enough , then you can hive them as a single swarm ; but , instead of a bottom-board , invert an empty hive and set the one with the swarm on this , and insert a wedge between them , for ventilation . As many bees are liable to drop down , in this case the lower hive will catch them , and there is less danger of leaving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be taken to find a queen , though by that time one is sometimes killed ; yet it is well to know the fact . Take them to some place out of the sun , as a less number will fly during the operation . HOW TO FIND QUEEN , WHEN TWO STRANGERS ARE TOGETHER . First , look into the lower hive for a dead queen , and , if none is found there , look thoroughly , as far as possible , for a little compact cluster of bees , the size of a hen 's egg , that may be rolled about without separating . Secure this cluster in a tumbler ; it is quite sure one of the queens is a prisoner in the middle ; 16 should two be seen , get both . Then divide the bees , and give the one destitute , a queen ; or , if you have two , one to each , as the case may be . It would be well first to see if the queen was alive , by removing the bees from about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread a sheet on the ground , shake the bees on one end of it , and set the hive on the other ; they will immediately begin a march for the hive . You may now see the cluster , and may not ; but they will spread out in marching , and give a good chance to see her majesty , when a tumbler is the most convenient thing to set over her . No matter if a few bees are shut up with her , there is no risk , then , in your eagerness to get the queen , of taking hold of a worker or two . A piece of window-glass can be slipped under , and you have her safe , and by this time you will know what is to be done next . This operation could not well be done in the middle of the day , or in the sun , as too many bees would be flying , and greatly interfere . 16 All stranger queens , introduced into a stock or swarm , are secured and detained in this manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or this is a means adopted to incite them to a deadly conflict , writers do not agree , and I shall not attempt a decision , as I never saw the bees voluntarily release a queen thus confined . But I have seen queens , when no bees interfered , rush together in a fatal rencounter , and one of them was soon left a fallen victim of the contest . ' T is said it never happens that both are killed in these battles ,  --  perhaps not . As I never saw quite all of these royal combats , of course I can not decide . Should you fail in finding a queen , and can not succeed in making a division in consequence , or should you resolve , from want of time , patience or energy , to let them remain together in the beginning , it is unnecessary to get a hive any larger than usual for two swarms ; they will certainly find room by cold weather : if more than two , they should be divided by all means ; it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , when two large swarms are together , it is necessary to keep an inverted hive under them , but much longer it would not do , as they might extend their combs into the lower hive . BOXES FOR DOUBLE SWARMS IMMEDIATELY . It should then be taken out , and boxes immediately put on , which should be changed for empty ones , as fast as they are filled . Yet , this extra honey is not quite as much advantage as increase of stocks ; when that is an object , I will recommend another disposition . RETURNING A PART TO THE OLD STOCK . Separate one-third or more of the two swarms , being sure there is no queen with this part , ( by the test given of setting them at a distance ) and then return them to one of the old stocks ; they will immediately enter without contention , and issue again in about nine days , or as soon as a young queen is matured to go with them . There may be an exception to this , of one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases of the kind , but there will be a loss of time for the bees in the old stock ; because they are apt to be rather idle , even when they might labor in the boxes ; and here there is a loss of some eight or ten days . The collections of a good swarm may be estimated at least one pound a day , ( often two or three . ) A swarm that just fills the hive , would make at least ten pounds box-honey , if it could have been located ten days earlier . Still another method may be adopted when you have a very small swarm , one that is not likely to fill the hive , and has not been hived more than two or three days . A third of your two swarms may be put in with that ; taking care , as before , not to let your only queen go with them . METHOD OF UNITING . The manner of doing it is very simple ; get them in a hive as before directed , and jar them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter , or invert it , setting the other over , and let them run up . WHEN CARE IS NECESSARY . Except on the day of swarming , care is necessary not to introduce a small number with a large swarm ; they are liable to be destroyed . The danger is much greater than to put together about an equal number , or a large number put in with a few . The day that swarms issue , they will generally mix peaceably , but in proportion as time intervenes between the issues , so will be the liability to quarrel . Yet , I have united two families of about equal numbers in the fall and spring , and , with a few exceptions , have had no difficulty . SWARM-CATCHER . There is another method of keeping swarms separate , contrived and used by a Mr. Loucks , of Herkimer Co. , N.Y . He calls it a swarm-catcher ; he has a half dozen of them , and says he would not do without for one season , for fifty dollars , as he has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could from seeing his , without taking the exact measure . I got out four light posts four and half feet long , one inch square ; then twelve pieces of one-quarter inch stuff , four inches wide ; the four for the top twelve inches long , for the bottom two were fourteen inches long , and two were twenty . These were thoroughly nailed on the ends of the posts , making it into an upright frame , the other four pieces were nailed around the middle , which made the frame firmer . I made a frame for the top , of four pieces , each an inch and a half in width , and half inch thick , halved at the ends and nailed together , and fastened by hinges to one side of the top , and a catch to hold it shut . The whole was now covered with very thin cloth to admit the light , but not so open as to let the bees through , ( Mr. Loucks used cloth made for cheese-strainers . ) I now had a covered frame four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , at the bottom 14 by 20 , with a door or lid at the top , to let out the bees . On each side of the bottom I tacked a piece of common muslin , near a yard in length . When a swarm is ready to issue , the bottom of this frame is set up before the hive , one edge of the bottom rests on the bottom-board , the other against the side of the hive ; the top sets off from the hive at an angle of about 45 degrees , under which a brace is set to hold it . The muslin at the bottom is to wrap around the hive at the side to prevent the escape of the bees . The swarm rushes into this without any hesitation . When done coming out , the muslin at the bottom is drawn over it , and the frame is set in an upright position , and allowed to stand a few minutes for the bees to get quiet in the top . It is now to be laid on its side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few trials that I have given it , I succeeded without difficulty . But I would remark , that stocks from which swarms are caught in this way , must not be raised at the back side , as a part of the swarm would issue there , and not get into the net . Mr. Loucks had his hive directly on the board ; and he told me he kept them so through the season : the only places of entrance was a sprout out of the bottom of the front side , about three inches wide by half inch deep , and a hole in the side a few inches up . You will thus perceive that stocks from which swarms are hived in this way must be prepared for it previously . Also , it will be no use to such bee-keepers as depend on seeing their swarms in the air . It will be beneficial only in large apiaries , where several swarms are liable to issue at once ; the swarming indications well understood , and the apiarian on the lookout . SWARMS SOMETIMES RETURN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes return to the old stock . Mr. Miner gives a cause for this , very ingenious , and romantic , but unfortunately there are but few facts to sustain this hypothesis , ( at least I have not discovered them . ) There are other causes that appear to me more reasonable ; the most common is the inability of the old queen to fly , on account of her burden of eggs , old age , or something else . I have sometimes , after the swarm had returned found the queen near the stock , and put her back , and the next day she would come out again , and fly without difficulty , ( perhaps she had discharged some of her eggs . ) Their returning is more frequent in windy weather , or when the sun is partially obscured by clouds . About three-fourths of them will not re-issue until a young queen is matured , eight or ten days afterwards ; and a few , not at all . But when the queen returns with the swarm , they usually come out again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not till the third or fourth . I have known two instances where they issued again the same day . REPETITION PREVENTED . Sometimes a swarm will issue and return three or four days in succession , but this I generally remedy , as it is often owing to some inability of the queen , and she may be frequently found while the swarm is leaving outside the hive , unable to fly . In such cases it is only necessary to have a tumbler ready , and watch for her ; and as soon as she appears , secure her , get the empty hive for the swarm , a sheet , and put down a bottom-board a few feet from the stock . The swarm is sure to come back ; the first bees that alight on the hive will set up the call ; as soon as this is perceived , lose no time in setting the old stock on the board , and throwing the sheet over it to keep out the bees . Put the new one in its place on the stand , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be in the new hive , when it can be removed , and the old one replaced . This I have done many times . But should the swarm begin to cluster in a convenient place , when you have so caught the queen , by being expeditious she may be put with the swarm , before they have missed her and may be hived in the usual way . LIABILITY TO ENTER WRONG STOCKS . In all cases , whether you set a new hive in place of the old one or not , whenever a swarm returns , if other stocks stand close on each side , they are quite sure to receive a portion of the bees  --  probably a few hundreds ; these are certain to be massacred . To prevent which , it is necessary to throw sheets over them until the swarm has gathered on their own hive . This is another reason for plenty of room between stocks . Should no queen be discovered during their issue , or return , she should be sought for in the vicinity of the hive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be likely to issue several days earlier , than to wait for a young queen . When the old queen is actually lost , and the bees have returned to wait for a young one , it is often ready to leave one or two days short of the time required for second swarms . Whether a greater number of bees in the old stock creating more animal heat , matures the chrysalis in less time than a stock thinned by casting a swarm , or some other cause , I can not say . I mention it because I have known it to occur frequently , but not invariably . A swarm flying , unaccompanied by a queen , is scattered more than usual . FIRST ISSUES GENERALLY CHOOSE FAIR WEATHER . First swarms are commonly more particular as to weather than after swarms . They have several days from which to choose , after these royal cells are ready , and before the queens are matured ; and they usually take a fair one . But here again are exceptions . I once had two first swarms issue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in agitation to such a degree that it was impossible to find any such place to cluster . I expected their return to the old hive ; but here were more exceptions . After repeating a fruitless attempt at the branches , they gave it up , and came down amongst the grass on " terra firma . " This occurred after several days of rainy weather . The next day being pleasant , twelve issued ; almost proving that the wind the preceding day kept back a part . I also knew one to issue in a shower , that beat many of them to the ground before they could cluster . In this case the shower was sudden , the sun shone almost up to the time it began to rain . About this time the swarm started when it seemed they were unwilling to turn about . AFTER SWARMS . After swarms are second and third issues ( or all after the first ) from a stock ; and quite a different affair from the first , as also are some first swarms , when the old queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THEIR SIZE . Second swarms are usually half as large as the first , the third half as large as the second , the fourth still less ; with some variations . I give general features , noticing only the exceptions that occur most frequently ; others sometimes happen , but so seldom that mentioning them is deemed unnecessary . TIME AFTER THE FIRST . Whenever the first swarm in a prosperous season was not kept back by foul weather , the first of the young queens in the old stock is ready to emerge in about eight days . We will suppose the first swarm issued on Sunday ; a week from the next Tuesday will be usually as soon as the second one need be expected . PIPING OF THE QUEEN . On the Monday evening previous , or on Tuesday morning , by putting your ear close to the hive , and listening attentively five minutes , you will hear a distinct piping noise , like the word peep , peep , uttered several times in succession , and then an interval of silence ; two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of one will be shrill and fine , of another hoarse , short and quick . This piping is easily heard by any one not actually deaf , and not the least danger of its being taken for any humming ; in fact , it is not to be mistaken for anything else but piping , even when you hear it for the first time . These notes can probably never be heard except when the hive contains a plurality of queens . MAY ALWAYS BE HEARD BEFORE AND AFTER SWARM . I never failed to hear it , previous to a second swarm , or any after the first , whenever I listened ; and whenever I have listened and not heard it at the proper time , I never knew a second swarm to issue ! TIME OF CONTINUANCE VARIES . The time of commencing will be later than this rule in some stocks , if the weather is cool , or not many bees left ; it may be ten or twelve days . I once found it fourteen before I heard it . Also the swarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it . The longer the swarm delays , the louder will be the piping ; I have heard it distinctly twenty feet , by listening attentively when I knew one was thus engaged ; but at first it is rather faint . By putting your ear against the hive it may be heard even in the middle of the day , or at any time before issuing . The length of time it may be heard beforehand seems to be governed again by the yield of honey ; when abundant it is common for them to issue the next day ; but when somewhat scarce , they will be much longer  --  very often three or four days . In these cases third swarms seldom occur . TIME BETWEEN SECOND AND THIRD ISSUES . Piping for third swarms ( when they issue ) may usually be heard the evening after the second has left , though one day commonly intervenes between their issues . Here my experience is at variance with many writers , who give several days between the second and third . I do not recollect an instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , several the next , and one the same day of the second ! I had an instance of a swarm losing its queen ( the old one ) on its first sally , and returned to wait for the young ones ; when they were ready , an uncommon number of bees were present ; three swarms issued in three days ! On the fourth , another came out and returned ; the fifth day it left ; making four regular swarms in five days . On the eighth , the fifth swarm left ! Although I never had five swarms from a stock before , yet I expected this , from the fact of hearing the piping on the next evening after the fourth one had left . The piping had continued in this hive from the evening previous to the first swarm till the last one had left . NOT ALWAYS TO BE DEPENDED UPON . One stock in fifteen may commence piping , yet send out no swarm . The bees will change their minds about coming out , and kill their queens , or allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some other way , as they do not always swarm in such circumstances . But when the piping continues over twenty-four hours , I never knew but one failure ! I have known a few ( two or three ) to commence this piping , while I supposed the old queen was yet present , and had not left the hive , on account of bad weather , but a swarm issued soon after . Also , three instances where I supposed the old queen lost , from some other cause than leading out a swarm , and the stock reared some young ones to supply her place . It occurred in or near the swarming season , and one or two issues was the consequence . One case was three weeks in advance of the season , and the swarm was about half the usual size . When a swarm has been out , and returned at the last of the swarming season , it is much more probable to re-issue , than if it depended on an old queen for a leader , that had not been out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later than others . Once I had the first swarm kept back by wet weather , and the second came out on the fifth day after ; several other instances on the seventh and eighth ; and one as late as the sixteenth , after the first . A RULE FOR THE TIME OF THESE ISSUES . This may be put down as a rule , that all after swarms must be out by the eighteenth day from the first . I never found an exception , unless the following may be considered so : When a swarm left the middle of May , and another the first of July , seven weeks after , but two cases of this kind have come up , and these I consider rather in the light of first swarms , as they leave under the same circumstances , leaving the combs in the old stock filled with brood , queen-cells finished , &c.; A stock may cast swarms in June , and a buckwheat swarm in August , on the same principle . WHEN IT IS USELESS TO EXPECT MORE SWARMS . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch their bees when the last of the first swarms came out sixteen or eighteen days before . Much trouble may be thus saved by understanding this matter . During my early days in beekeeping , I wished for the greatest possible increase of stocks . I had some that had cast the first swarm , and soon after clustered out again . I vainly watched them for weeks and months , expecting another swarm . But had I understood the modus operandi , as the reader may now understand it , I should have been through with all my anxiety , as well as watching , in a fortnight . As it was , it lasted two months . I found no one to give me any light on this subject , or even tell me when the swarming season was over , and I came very near watching all summer ! PLURALITY OF QUEENS DESTROYED . When the bees , queens , or all together , decide that no more swarms are to issue , the plurality of queens is destroyed , and but one is left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others , generally while in the cells . I once had some artificial queens reared , as an experiment , from common eggs , on the top of a hive , in a small glass box , where there was room for but one comb , which allowed me to see all particulars . THE MANNER . After the first queen was matured , and had left her cell , I caught her within six hours , taking advantage of her younger sisters , which were yet sealed up , and of course could offer no resistance . She first made an opening that would allow her to reach the abdomen of her competitor ( probably this is the most vulnerable ) . As soon as this was sufficiently large to admit her body , she thrust it in , inflicting the fatal sting . This was then left for another , that soon shared the same fate . If quick and spiteful movements are any indications of hatred , it was manifested here very plainly . The bees enlarged the orifice and dragged out the now dead queens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatched in this way , merely because I witnessed it in this case , it would be carrying out the principle I am endeavoring to avoid : that is , judging all cases from one or two solitary facts . As it is , it is somewhat confirmatory of what some others have said . I will suppose , then , until further evidence contradicts it , that the first perfect queen leaving her cell , makes it her business to destroy all rivals in their cradle , as soon as it is decided that no more swarms shall issue . By keeping grass , weeds , &c.,; away from about the stock , these dead queens , as they are brought out , may be frequently found . Such as are removed during the night may be often found on the floor-board in the morning . I have found a dozen by one stock . Should the stock send out but one swarm , they may be found about the time , or a little before you would listen for the piping . But should after swarms come out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it is decided that no more are to issue . It is very seldom that all the queens reared are needed . They make it a rule , as far as they have control , to go on safe principles , by having a little more than just enough . When several such bodies are thrown out , and no piping is heard , no further swarming need be expected . But should you hear the piping a day or two after finding a dead queen , you may yet look for the swarm . THEORY DOUBTED . It is stated that when the bees decide an after swarm shall issue , the first queen matured is not allowed to leave her cell , but kept a prisoner there , and fed until wanted to go forth with the swarm . This may be true in some cases ( though not satisfactorily proved ) , but I am quite sure it is not in all . When she is confined to her cell , how does she ascertain the presence of others ? By leaving the cell , this knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " enraged at the existence of others , and endeavors to destroy them while yet in the cell , which the workers will not allow ; this is so irritating to her majesty that she utters this peculiar sound . " Also second and third swarms may contain several queens , frequently two , three , and four ; even six at one time come out . If these had to bite their way out , after the workers had decided it was time to start ( for it must be they decide it when the queens are shut up ) , they would hardly be in season . AFTER SWARMS DIFFERENT IN APPEARANCE FROM THE FIRST WHEN ABOUT TO ISSUE . Another thing , when after swarms start , the appearance about the entrance is altogether different from first ones , unless there is an unusual number of bees . I have said that for a little time beforehand , that such were in an apparent tumult , &c.; But after swarms seldom give any such notice . One or more of the young queens may sometimes be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes , in a perfect frenzy ; sometimes fly a short distance , and return before the swarm will get started ( which she could not do if confined ) . The workers seem more reluctant about leaving than in first swarms , when a mother instead of a sister is leader . Even after the swarm is in motion , she may return and enter the hive a moment . No doubt she finds it necessary to animate or induce as many as possible to leave with her . A person watching the issue of a second swarm under these circumstances , for the first time , and finding the queen leaving first , would very likely guess all must be alike . Perhaps the next one would be different ; the first thing seen might be the swarm leaving , and no queen discovered at all . But to return to the imprisonment of the queens . I have one other fact in objection . I once saw a queen running about in a glass hive , while they were piping for a second swarm . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vibrate her wings , which was simultaneous with the piping , and seemed to make it . The workers appeared to take but little notice of her . The next day the swarm left . Here was one instance , at least , of her not being confined till the time of leaving , making an exception , if not a rule . Let this matter be as it may , I admit it makes but little difference to the practical apiarian , either way ; but to the reader whose interest is the natural history of the bee , the truth is important . TIME OF DAY , WEATHER , ETC . These after swarms are not very particular about the weather ; heavy winds , a few clouds , and sometimes a slight sprinkling of rain , will not always deter them . Neither are they very precise about the time of day . I have known them in a warm morning to issue before seven o'clock , and after five P.M. These things should be understood ; because , when after swarms are expected ( of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch them in weather , and at times when first ones would not venture to leave . SWARMS NECESSARY TO BE SEEN . It is essential that you see them , that you may know where they cluster , otherwise it might be difficult to find them . They are apt to go farther from the parent stock than others ; sometimes fifty rods , and then settle in two places , perhaps that distance apart , in some high or inconvenient place to get at . ( Let me not be misunderstood : I do not say they all do so , or even the majority ; but I wish to say that a greater portion of these swarms do so than of the first . ) If they cluster in two places , a queen may be in each , and they will remain , and when you have hived one part you may think you have all . If one cluster is without a queen , they will join the other if near ; but when distant , will be very likely to return to the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarm light in two places , in exactly opposite directions from the stock . In one , a good swarm had clustered ; in the other , some less than a pint . The small part had one or more queens , the other none . It was perceived at once by their movements . Now , if we provide a hive for a swarm , and get a few to set up the call or buzzing , they will not leave till that is stopped . There is generally no difficulty to start it . The surest way is to jar a portion or all directly into the hive . It takes a few minutes to get composed , and miss the queen . In my case I got them in the hive , and before they missed the queen , carried them to the small cluster , which I got in a dipper and emptied in front of the hive ; they entered , and all were peaceable . You will therefore see the necessity of watching such swarms , to see if there is no separation , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much has been said about returning all after swarms to the old stock ; the advantages of which will depend on the time of issuing ; whether late or early , the yield of honey , etc . It would be unusual to have many after swarms without a liberal yield of honey , for the time being ; but to tell of its continuance is the question to be answered . Second , and even third swarms , if early in the season , and the honey continues plentiful , may be hived , and these , together with the old stock , will prosper . Here the apiarian needs a little judgment and experience to guide him . WHEN THEY SHOULD BE RETURNED . It is always best , if possible , to have good strong families . When after swarms are late it is safest to return them , as the old stock will need them to replenish the hive , and prepare for winter . Also a less number of worms will infest it , when well provided with bees ; and the chances of box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of returning such requires some little patience and perseverance . I have said there may be a dozen young queens in the old stock . Now suppose one , two , or more leave with the swarm , and you return the whole together , there is nothing to prevent their leading out the swarm again the next day . Therefore it is policy to keep the queens back . The least trouble is to hive in the usual way , and let them stand till the next morning . It will save you the trouble of looking for more than one , if there should be more , for all but that are destroyed by that time . There is a chance , also , for the old stock to decide that no more should issue , and allow all but one to be slain there . When this is the case , and you find the one with the swarm , you will have no further trouble by their re-issuing . They should be returned as soon as the next morning , otherwise they might not agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return them , and find a queen easily , get a wide board a few feet long ; let one end rest on the ground , the other near the entrance , that they may enter the hive without flying ; then shake out the swarm on the lower end of the board ; but few will fly , but soon commence running up towards the hive ; the first one that discovers the entrance will set up the call for the others . If they do not discover it , which is the case sometimes , scatter some of them near it , and they will soon commence marching up , when you should look out for , and secure the queen , as they spread and give a good chance . By applying your ear to the hive , the piping will tell you if they are to issue again . It is evident , if you follow these directions , that the swarm can not issue many times before their stock of royalty will be exhausted ; and when but one queen remains the piping will cease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these after swarms , some writers recommend turning over the hive and cutting out all the royal cells but one . This I have found impracticable with a great many stocks . Some of the cells are too near the top to be seen , consequently this can not always be depended upon . As for a rule about returning , it is somewhat difficult to give one . If I should say , return all such as issue after the 20th of June , the variation in the season might be two or three weeks , even in the same latitude ; i.e. , the course of flowers that had bloomed by that date in one season might , another year , require two weeks more to bring out . Also , the 20th of June , in latitude of New York City , is as late as the 4th of July in many places further north . I once had a second swarm on the 11th of July , that wintered well , having nearly filled the hive . Yet , in some seasons , the first swarms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . In sections where much buckwheat is raised , late swarms do more towards filling their hives than where there is none . MORE CARE NEEDED BY AFTER SWARMS WHEN HIVED . Should it be thought best to hive after swarms , and risk the chances , they should receive a little extra attention after the first week or two , to destroy the worms ; a little timely care may prevent considerable injury . They are apt to construct more combs in proportion to the number of bees , than others ; consequently , such combs can not be properly covered and protected . The moth has an opportunity to deposit her eggs on them , and , sometimes , entirely destroy them . TWO MAY BE UNITED . Whenever these swarms issue near enough together , it is best to unite them . I have said second swarms were generally half as large as the first . By this rule , two second swarms would contain as many bees as a first one , and four of the third , or one of the second issue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second are of the ordinary size , I think it advisable always to return the third . But in large apiaries it is common for them to issue without any previous warning , just when a first one is leaving , and crowd themselves into their company , and seeming to be as much at home as though they were equally respectable . Whenever the hives containing our swarms are full or very near it , the boxes should be put on without delay , unless the season of honey is so nearly gone as to make it unnecessary . I have found it an advantage to hive a few of these very small swarms , on purpose to preserve queens , to supply some old stocks that sometimes lose their own at the extreme end of the swarming season . The cases to be mentioned at the last of the next chapter . I try and save one for about every twenty stocks that have swarmed . CHAPTER XIV . LOSS OF QUEENS . OF SWARMS THAT LOSE THEIR QUEEN . Swarms that lose their queen the first few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; with the exception that they sometimes unite with some other . If much time has elapsed before the loss , they remain , unless standing on the same bench with another . On a separate stand they continue their labor , but a large swarm diminishes rapidly , and seldom fills an ordinary-sized hive . One singular circumstance attends a swarm that is constructing combs without a queen . I have never seen it noticed by any one , and may not always be the case , but every instance that has come under my notice , I have so found it . That is , four-fifths of the combs are drone-cells ; why they thus construct them is another subject for speculation , from which I will endeavor in this instance to refrain . A SUGGESTION AND AN ANSWER . It has been suggested as a profitable speculation , " to hive a large swarm without a queen , and give them a piece of brood-comb containing eggs , to rear one , and then as soon as it is matured , deprive them of it , giving them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , putting on boxes for surplus honey . The bees having no young brood to consume any honey , no time will be lost , or taken to nurse them , and as a consequence they will be enabled to store large quantities of surplus honey . " This appears very plausible , and to a person without experience somewhat conclusive . If success depended on some animal whose lease of life was a little longer , it would answer better to calculate in this way . But as a bee seldom sees the anniversary of its birthday , and most of them perish the first few months of their existence , it is bad economy . It will be found that the largest amount of our surplus honey is obtained from our prolific stocks . Therefore it is all-important that every swarm and stock has a queen to repair this constant loss . A DISPUTED QUESTION . We now approach another disputed point in natural history , relative to the queen leaving at any time except when leading out a swarm . Most writers say that the young queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drone , on the wing . Others deny this positively , having watched a whole summer without seeing her highness leave . Consequently they have arrived at the very plausible and apparently consistent conclusion , that nature never intended it to be so , since it must happen at a time when the existence of the whole family depends entirely on the life of the queen . The stock at such times contains no eggs or larvae , from which to rear another , if she should be lost . " The chances at such times of being devoured by birds , blown away by the winds , and other casualties , are too many , and it is not probable the Creator would have so arranged it . " But facts are stubborn things ; they will not yield one jot to favor the most " finely-spun hypothesis ; " they are most provokingly obstinate , many times . When man , without the necessary observation , takes a survey through animated nature , and finds with scarcely an exception that male and female are about equal in number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bee among thousands can not be the only one capable of reproduction or depositing eggs . Why , the idea is preposterous ! And yet only a little observation will upset this very consistent and analogous reasoning . So it appears to be with the excursions of the young queens . I was compelled , though reluctantly , to admit that they leave the hive . That their purpose is to meet the drones , I can not at present contradict . Also , that , when the queen is once impregnated , it is operative for life , ( yet it is another anomaly ) , as I never detected her coming out again for that purpose . What then is the use of the ten thousand drones that never fulfil this important duty ? It seems , indeed , like a useless waste of labor and honey , for each stock to rear some twelve or fifteen hundred , when perhaps but one , sometimes not any of the whole number is of any use . If the risk is great in the queen 's leaving , we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A MULTITUDE OF DRONES NEEDED . Instinct teaches the bee to make the matters left to them as nearly sure as possible . When they want one queen , they raise half a dozen . If one drone or only half a dozen were reared , the chances of the queen meeting one in the air would be very much reduced . But when a thousand are in the air instead of one , the chances are a thousand times multiplied . If a stock casts a swarm , there is a young queen to be impregnated , and be got safely back , or the stock is lost . Every time she leaves , there is a chance of her being lost , ( one in fifteen ) . If the number of drones was any less than it is , the queen would have to repeat her excursions in proportion , before successful . As it is , some have to leave several times . The chances and consequences are so great , that on the whole no doubt but it is better to rear a thousand unnecessarily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore let us endeavor to be content with the present arrangement , inasmuch as we could not better it , and probably had we been consulted , would have so fixed " the thing , that it would not go at all . " But what is the use of the drones in hives that do not swarm , and do not intend it , situated in a large room or very large hives ? Such circumstances seldom produce swarms , yet as regular as the return of summer , a brood of drones appear . What are they for ? Suppose the old queen in such hive dies , leaving eggs or young larvae , and a young queen is reared to supply her place . How is she to be impregnated without the drones ? Perhaps they are taught that whenever they can afford it , they should have some on hand to be ready for an emergency . I have already said when bees are numerous , and honey abundant , they never fail to provide them . I once put a swarm in a glass hive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her posterior legs ; in two months after she was replaced by one young and perfect . Here was an instance of drones being needed , when no intention of swarming was indicated ; the hive was but little more than half full . THE QUEEN LIABLE TO BE LOST IN HER EXCURSIONS . This excursion of the queen , whenever I have witnessed it , always took place a little after the middle of the day , when the drones were out in the greatest numbers . At such times I have seen them leave amid rather more commotion than usual among the workers . I have watched their return , which varied from three minutes to half an hour , and seen them hover around their own hive , apparently in doubt whether they belonged in that , or the next ; in a few instances they have actually settled on the neighboring hive , and would have there perished , but for my assistance in putting them right . THE TIME WHEN IT OCCURS . Thus we see that queens are lost on these occasions from some cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps most of them ; if so , it is another good reason for not packing stocks too close . The hives are very often nearly alike in color and appearance . The queen coming out for the first time in her life , is no doubt confused by this similarity . The number of such losses in a season has varied : one year the average was one in nine , another it was one in thirteen , and another one in twenty . The time from the first swarm also varies from twelve to twenty days . The inexperienced reader should not forget that it is the old stocks which have cast swarms , where these accidents happen ; the old queen having left with the first swarm . Also all after swarms are liable to the same loss . I would suggest that these have abundant room given between the hives ; if it is necessary to pack close , let it be the first swarms , where the old queen has no occasion to leave . Having never seen this matter fully discussed , I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be able to direct the careful apiarian how to save a few stocks and swarms annually , that is , if he keeps many . A few years ago , I wrote an article for the Albany Cultivator . A subscriber of that paper told me a year afterwards that he saved two stocks the next summer by the information ; they were worth at least five dollars each , enough to pay for his paper ten years or more . When a stock casts but one swarm , the queen having no competitors to interfere with her movements , will leave in about fourteen days , if the weather is fair ; but should an after swarm leave , the oldest of the young queens will probably go with that , of course : then , it must be later before the next is ready : it may be twenty days , or even more ; those with after swarms will vary from one to six . It always must occur when no eggs or larvae exist , and no means left to repair this loss ; a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in as much trouble as their owner , and a great deal more , they seeming to understand the consequences , and he , if he knows nothing of the matter , has no trouble . Should he now , for the first time , learn the nature of it , he will at the same time understand the remedy . INDICATIONS OF THE LOSS . The next morning after a loss of this kind has occurred , and occasionally at evening , the bees may be seen running about in the greatest consternation , outside , to and fro on the sides . Some will fly off a short distance and return ; one will run to another , and then to another , still in hopes , no doubt , of finding their lost sovereign ! A neighboring hive close by , on the same bench , will probably receive a portion , which will seldom resist an accession under such circumstances . All this will be going on while other hives are quiet . Towards the middle of the day , this confusion will be less marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though not so plainly , and cease after the third , when they become apparently reconciled to their fate . They will continue their labors as usual , bringing in pollen and honey . Here I am obliged to differ with writers who tell us that all labor will now cease . I hope the reader will not be deceived by supposing that because the bees are bringing in pollen , that they must have a queen ; I can assure you it is not always the case . THE RESULT . The number of bees will gradually decrease , and be all gone by the early part of winter , leaving a good supply of honey , and an extra quantity of bee-bread , as before mentioned , because there has been no young brood to consume it . This is the case when a large family was left at the time of the loss . When but few bees are left , it is very different ; the combs are unprotected by a covering of bees ; the moth deposits her eggs on them , and the worms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other stocks will generally first remove the honey . AGE OF BEES INDICATED . Hundreds of bee-keepers lose some of their stocks in this way , and can assign no reasonable cause . " Why , " say they , " there was n't twenty bees in the hive ; it was all full of honey , " or worms , as the case may be . " Only a short time before , it was full of bees ; I got three good swarms from it , and it always had been first rate , but all at once the bees were gone . I do n't understand it ! " Such bee-keepers can not understand how rapidly a family of bees diminish , when there is no queen to replenish with young this mortality of the old ones . I doubt whether the largest and best family possibly could be made to exist six months , without a queen for their renewal , except , perhaps , through the winter . When standing close on one bench , they are gone sooner than if on separate stands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk to it . NECESSITY OF CARE . As this tumult can not be seen but a few days at most , it is well  --  yes , it is necessary  --  to make it a duty to glance at the hives at this period after swarming , every morning ; a glance is sufficient to tell you of the fact . Remember to reckon from the date of the first issue ; this occurs when the first royal cells are sealed over , and is the best criterion as to when the queen will leave . If the first swarm issue and return , it can make no difference ; reckon from their first issuing . REMEDY . When you discover a loss , first ascertain if there is any after swarm to be expected from another stock , ( by listening for the piping ) ; if so , wait till it issues , and obtain a queen from that for your stock ; even if there is but one , take it , and let the bees return ; they would be likely to come out again the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no great loss . Should no such swarm be indicated , go to a stock that has cast a first swarm within a week ; smoke it and turn it over , as before directed , find a royal cell , and with a broad knife cut it out , being careful not to injure it . This must now be secured in the other hive in its natural position , the lower end free from any obstacle , that would interfere with the queen leaving it . It will make but little difference whether at the top or bottom , providing it is secure from falling . I generally introduce it through a hole in the top , taking care to find one that will allow the cell to pass down between two combs . It being largest at the upper end , the combs each side will sustain it , and leave the lower end free . In a few hours the bees will secure it permanently to the combs with wax . This operation can not be performed in a chamber hive , as it is impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To put it in at the bottom is some more trouble ; the difficulty is , to fasten it , and prevent it resting on the end . I have done it as follows : Get an old thick piece of dry comb some three inches square ; cut out an inch of the middle . At right angles with this , in one edge in the centre , make another to intersect it , just the size of the cell , and have the lower end reach into the opening . This comb will keep it in the right position , and may rest on the floor-board . It can now be put in the hive , cutting out a piece of comb to make room for it if necessary . Soon after such cell is introduced , the bees are quiet . In a few days it hatches , and they have a queen as perfect as if it had been one of their own rearing . This queen of course will be necessitated to leave the hive , and will be just as liable to be lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the same . It is unnecessary to look for a cell in a stock that has cast its first swarm more than a week before , as they are generally destroyed by that time , ( sometimes short of it , ) unless they intend to send out an after swarm . MARK THE DATE OF SWARMS ON THE HIVE . Should you have so many stocks that you can not remember the date of each swarm without difficulty , it is a good plan to mark the date on one side or corner of the hive , as it issues . You can then tell at once where to look for a cell when wanted . It will sometimes happen that a queen may be lost at the extreme end of the swarming season , when no other stock contains such cells . I then look around for the poorest stock or swarm that I have on hand , one that I can afford to sacrifice , if it possesses a queen , to save the one that has sustained this loss ; this is not often the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put just bees enough with the queen to keep her in a box , and kept them for this purpose , as was mentioned in the last chapter . When introduced , the bees are generally killed , but the queen is preserved . OBTAINING A QUEEN FROM WORKER BROOD . There is yet another method to be adopted , and that is , to obtain a piece of brood-comb containing workers ' eggs , or larvae very young . You will generally find it without much trouble , in a young swarm that is making combs ; the lower ends usually contain eggs ; take a piece from one of the middle sheets , two or three inches long , ( you will probably use smoke by this time without telling ) . Invert the hive that is to receive it , put the piece edgewise between the combs , if you can spread them apart enough for the purpose ; they will hold it there , and then there will be ample room to make the cells . They will nearly always rear several queens . I have counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . But yet I have very little confidence in such queens , they are almost certain to be lost . THEY ARE POOR DEPENDENCE . Therefore I would recommend getting a royal cell whenever it is practical . There is yet another advantage ; you will have a queen ready to lay eggs two or three weeks earlier , than when they are compelled to commence with the egg . I have put such piece of brood-comb in a small glass box on the top of the hive instead of the bottom , because it was less trouble , but in this case the eggs were all removed in a short time ; whether a queen was reared in the hive or not I can not say ; but this I know , I never obtained a prolific queen , after repeated experiments in this way . It would appear that I have been more unfortunate with queens reared in this way , than most experimenters . I have no difficulty to get them formed to all appearance perfect , but lose them afterwards . Now whether this arose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far advanced to make a perfect change , or whether they were reared so late in the season , that most of the drones were destroyed , and the queen to meet one had to repeat her excursions till lost , I am yet unable to fully determine . To test the first of these questions , I have a few times removed all the larvae from the comb ; leaving nothing but eggs , that all the food given them might be " royal pap , " from the commencement , and had no better success so far . Yet occasionally prolific queens have been reared when I could account for their origin in no other way but from worker eggs . But you will find they are not to be depended upon generally . Sometimes , after all our endeavors , a stock or two will remain destitute of a queen . These , if they escape the worms , will generally store honey enough in this section to winter a good family . This will have to be introduced , of course , from another hive , containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As respects the time that elapses from the impregnation of the queen till the commencement of egg laying , I can not tell , but guess it might be about two or three days . I have driven out the bees twenty-one days after the first swarm , when no second swarm had issued  --  the young queen came out on the fourteenth day . I found eggs and some very young larvae . When it is remembered that eggs remain three days before they hatch , it shows that the first of these must have been deposited some four or five days . When writers tell us the exact time to an hour ( 46 or 48 ) from impregnation to laying , I am willing to admit the thing in this case , but feel just as if I would like to ask how they managed to find out the fact ; by what sign they knew when a queen returned from an excursion , whether she had been successful or not , in her amours ; or , whether another effort would have to be made ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first egg was laid . Occasionally a queen is lost at other than the swarming season , averaging about one in forty . It is most frequent in spring ; at least it is generally discovered then . The queen may die in the winter , and the bees not give us any indications till they come out in spring . ( Occasionally they may all desert the hive , and join another . ) If we expect to ascertain when a queen is lost at this season , we must notice them just before dark on the first warm days  --  because the mornings are apt to be too cool for any bees to be outside  --  any unusual stir , or commotion , similar to what has been described , shows the loss . This is the worst time in the year to provide the remedy , unless there should happen to be some very poor stock containing a queen , that we might lose any way  --  then it might be advisable to sacrifice it to save the other , especially if the last contained all the requisites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ten , that I have managed in this way , have given me full satisfaction . I have at other times let them go till the swarming season , and then procured a queen , or introduced a small swarm ; at which time they are so reduced as to be worth but little , even when not affected by the worms . To obviate this loss in this way , it might be an advantage to transfer the bees to the next stock , if it was not too full already ; or the bees of the next stock to this . Let the age and condition of the combs , quantity of stores , &c.,; decide . CHAPTER XV . ARTIFICIAL SWARMS . PRINCIPLES SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD . Artificial swarms can be made with safety at the proper season . To the bee-keeper who wishes to increase his stocks , it will be an advantage to understand some of the principles . I have had some little experience that has led to different conclusions from those of some others . I have seen it stated , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever bees were deprived of their queen , if they only possessed eggs or young larvae , they would not fail to rear another , " &c.; There are numerous instances of their doing this , but it is not to be depended upon , especially when left in a hive full of combs , as the following experiments tend to prove . SOME EXPERIMENTS . Several years since I had a few stocks well supplied with bees , and every indication of swarming present , such as clustering out , &c.,; but they pertinaciously adhered to the old stock , through the whole swarming season ! Others apparently not as well supplied with bees threw off swarms . I had but few stocks , and was very anxious to increase the number ; but these were provokingly indifferent to my wishes . Taking the assertions of these authors for facts , I reasoned thus : In all probability there are eggs enough in each of those stocks . Why not drive out a portion of the bees , with the old queen , and leave about as many as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a queen , and continue the old stock , and I shall have six instead of the three , that have been so obstinate . Accordingly , I divided each , examined and found eggs and larvae . Of course all must be right . Now , thought I , my stocks can be doubled at least annually . If they do not swarm , I can drive them . THE RESULT UNSATISFACTORY . My swarms prospered , the old stocks seemed industrious , bringing in pollen in abundance , which to me at that time , was conclusive that they had a queen , or soon would have . I continued to watch them with much interest , but somehow , after a few weeks , there did not seem to be quite as many bees ; a few days later , I was quite sure there was not . I examined the combs , and behold there was not a cell containing a young bee of any age , not even an egg in any one of these old stocks . My visionary anticipations of future success speedily retrograded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my new swarms in condition to winter , although not quite full ; but the old ones were not , and nothing was gained . I had some honey , a great deal of bee-bread and old black comb . Had I let them alone , and put on boxes , I should have probably obtained twenty-five or thirty pounds of pure honey from each , worth five times as much as what I did get ; besides , the old stocks , even with the old comb , would have been better supplied with both honey and bees ; altogether much better , as stocks for wintering . Here was a considerable loss , merely by not understanding the matter . I carefully looked the bees over , and ascertained to a certainty that neither of them had a queen . I smothered what few there was left in the fall . I then knew of no better way . I had been told that the barbarous use of fire and brimstone was part of the " luck ; " that a more benevolent system would cause the bees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subsequent to these experiments , I thought perhaps the jarring of the hives in driving might have some effect on the bees , and prevent their rearing a queen . This idea suggested the dividing hive , when the division could be made quietly ; but success was yet uncertain . I was told to confine the bees in the old stock twenty-four hours or more , after driving out a swarm ; this I tried , with no better results . Again , I drove out the swarm , looked out the queen , and returned her to the old stock , compelling the new swarm to raise one . To be certain they did so , I constructed a small box about four inches square , by two in thickness ; the sides glass . In this I put the piece of brood-comb containing eggs and larvae , and then put it on the hive containing the swarm , having holes for communication , a cover to keep it dark , &c.; They were very sure to rear queens , but from some cause were lost after they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these experiments than myself , it indicates that some favorable circumstances attended them that did not me . I have not the least doubt but the result will be favorable sometimes . Yet from the foregoing , I became satisfied that not one of these methods could be relied upon . Instead of constructing a queen 's cell , and then removing the egg or larva to it from another cell , I always found that the cell containing such egg or larva was changed from the horizontal to the perpendicular ; such cells as were in the way below were cut off , probably using the material in forming one for royalty , which , when finished , contains as much material as fifty or a hundred others . My experiments did not end here . I can now make artificial swarms , and succeed nine times in ten with the first effort , and the reader can as easily do the same . It must be in the swarming season , or as soon as the first regular swarm issues . You want some finished royal cells that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless in rare instances , where they are too far up among the combs to be seen . ) A SUCCESSFUL METHOD . When you are all ready , take a stock that can spare a swarm ; if bees are on the outside , raise the hive on wedges , and drive them in with a little water , and disturb them gently with a stick . Now smoke and invert it , setting the empty hive over . If the two hives are of one size , and have been made by a workman , there will be no chance for the bees to escape , except the holes in the side ; these you will stop ; ( no matter about a sheet tied around it . ) With a light hammer or stick , strike the hive a few times lightly , and then let it remain five minutes . This is very essential , because most of the bees , if allowed the opportunity , will fill themselves with honey after such disturbance . All regular swarms go forth so laden . A supply is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in forming wax , a very necessary article in a new hive . The amount of honey carried out of a stock by a good swarm , together with the weight of the bees ( which is not much ) , will vary from five to eight pounds . This , allowing time for the bees to fill their sacks , and supplying the old stock with a royal cell , I believe is entirely original : the importance of which the reader can judge . ADVANTAGES OF THIS METHOD . It is very plain that a queen from such finished cell must be ready to deposit eggs several days sooner than by any other method that we can adopt . It is also clear that if we have a dozen queens depositing eggs by the 10th of June , that our bees are increasing faster , on the whole , than if but half that number are engaged in it for a month later . There is yet another advantage . The sooner a young queen can take the place of the old one in maternal duties , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bees there will be to defend the combs from the moth , and the surest guaranty for surplus honey . When the bees have filled their sacks , proceed to drive them into the upper hive by striking the lower one rapidly from five to ten minutes . A loud humming will mark their first movement . When you think half or two-thirds are out , raise the hive and inspect progress . They are not at all disposed to sting in this stage of proceeding , even when they escape outside . If full of honey , they are seldom provoked to resentment . The only care will be not to crush too many that get between the edges of the hives . The loud buzzing is no sign of anger . If your swarm is not large enough , continue to drive till it is . When done , the new hive should be set on the stand of the old one . A few minutes will decide whether you have the queen with the swarm , as they remain quiet : otherwise uneasy , and run about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both hives are one color , set the old one two feet in front ; but if of different colors , a little more . I prefer this position to setting the old stock on one side , even when there is room ; yet it can make but little difference . Should you set it on one side , let the distance be less . When the old stock is taken much farther than this rule , all the bees that have marked the location ( and all the old ones will have done so ) will go back to the old stand , and none but young bees that have never left home will remain . The same will be the case with the new swarm if moved off . It will not do to depend on the old queen keeping them , as she does when they swarm out naturally . This has been my experience . Try it , reader , and be satisfied , by putting either of the hives fifteen or twenty feet distant . Before you turn over the old stock , look among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if any contain eggs or larvae , you may safely risk their rearing a queen ; but otherwise wait till next morning , or at least twenty-four hours , then go to a stock that has cast a swarm , and obtain a finished royal cell , as before directed , and introduce it . You will have a queen here as soon as if it had been left in the original hive , and no risk of an after swarm , because there is but one . But when there are young queens in the cells at the time of driving , after swarms may issue . Should a queen-cell be introduced immediately , it is more liable to be destroyed than after waiting twenty-four hours ; and then is not always safe . After it has had time to hatch , ( which is about eight days after being sealed ) , cut it out , and examine it : if the lower end is open , it indicates that a perfect queen has left it , and all is safe ; but if it is mutilated or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen was destroyed before maturity , in which case , another cell will have to be given them . ARTIFICIAL SWARMS ONLY SAFE NEAR THE SWARMING SEASON . By what I have said about artificial swarms , it would appear that it is unsafe at any time but the swarming season ; that is my opinion . It may do a little in advance or a little after , providing royal cells can be had . By feeding as directed , ( in Chapter IX. ) you may induce a stock to send out a swarm some days in advance of the regular season , thereby giving you a chance for these cells somewhat early . SOMETIMES HAZARDOUS . To make such swarms at any time when the bees are destroying drones , would be extremely hazardous , not only on account of the young queen being impregnated , but their massacre denotes a scarcity of honey . Therefore I would advise never to make swarms , or drive out bees at such periods , when it can be avoided , without spare honey is on hand to feed them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with much reason , that " nature is the best guide , and it is better to let the bees have their own way about swarming  --  if honey is abundant , and the stock is in condition to spare a swarm , their own instincts will teach them to construct royal cells ; if it fails before they are ready , and the royal brood is destroyed , it is because the existence of the swarm would be precarious , and it is best not to issue . " I will grant that in many instances it is better . The chance is better for surplus honey ; the stock is quite sure to be in condition to winter ; and some judgment is required to tell when a stock can spare a swarm . But yet , we are sometimes anxious to increase our stocks to the utmost that safety will allow , and often have some that can spare a swarm as well as not , but refuse to leave ; perhaps commence preparations , and in a few days abandon them . Now it is evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey is sufficiently abundant to put the safety of the swarm beyond hazard ; some stocks will swarm while these others just as good , ( that had abandoned it before ) and have not now begun again , to be in time before a partial failure of honey , and some may not have commenced in season . NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL SWARMS EQUALLY PROSPEROUS . I can see no difference in artificial or natural swarms of equal size , at the same time . By taking the matter in time into our own hands , with the rules given , we make a sure thing of it , that is , we are sure to get the swarms , when if left to the bees it would be uncertain , and no greater risk afterwards than with natural issues . THIS MATTER TOO OFTEN DELAYED . I am aware that this matter will be apt to be put off too long ; " wait and see if they do n't swarm , " will be the motto of too many , and when the season is over , drive them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all through the best of the honey season , and done nothing , while they could have half filled a hive ; but this is all lost now , as well as the best chances for getting cells . Let me impress the necessity of doing it in season , when it will pay . If you intend to have a swarm from every stock that can spare one , begin when nature points out the proper time , which is , when the regular ones begin to issue . It must , indeed , be a poor season when there are none . IS THE AGE OF THE QUEEN IMPORTANT ? There is another object effected in this way , considered by some apiarians as very important . It is the change of the queens in the old stock . A young queen is thought to be " much more prolific than an old one . " They even recommend keeping none " over two or three years old , " and give directions how they may be renewed . But as I have been unable to discover any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall not at present take much time to discuss it . It is well enough , when we can take our choice without trouble , to preserve a young queen . When we consider that there are but few queens but what will deposit three times as many eggs in a season as are matured , it looks as if it would hardly pay to take much trouble to change them . At what time the queen becomes barren from old age , I presume has never yet been fully determined . A friend of mine has had a stock in a large room eight years , that has never swarmed , and is still prosperous ! I think it very probable that this queen will gradually decay , and possibly become barren , some weeks before she dies ; if so , this stock will soon die off . A few such cases will probably occur in swarming hives , perhaps one in fifty , but generally such old and feeble queens are lost when they leave with the swarm , especially in windy weather . As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes when they are not , I have found them sufficiently prolific for all purposes . I would rather risk their fecundity , and hive the swarm , than to allow the bees to return to the parent stock , and wait eight or nine days for a young queen to mature . A great many will remain idle , even if there is room to work in the boxes . CHAPTER XVI . PRUNING . Notwithstanding I have given the method of pruning in the chapter on hives , ( page 23 , Chapter II. ) it will be necessary to give the tyro in bee-culture a few more particulars . The season for doing it is of importance . DIFFERENT OPINIONS AS TO TIME . The month of March has been recommended by several ; others prefer April , August , or September . Here , as usual , I shall have to differ from them all , preferring still another period , for which I offer my reasons , supposing , of course , that the reader is conscious of a freeman 's privilege , that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as on any other point . ANOTHER TIME PREFERRED . There is but one period from February till October , when prosperous stocks are free from young brood in the combs . If combs are taken out when occupied , there must be a loss of all the young bees they contain ; which may be avoided . The old queen leaves with the first swarm ; all the eggs she leaves in the worker-cells will be matured in about twenty-one days , consequently this is the time to clear out the old combs with the least waste . A few drones will be found in the cells , that would require a few days more to hatch , but these are of no account . Also a few very young larvae and some eggs may be sometimes found , the product of the young queen ; these few must be wasted , but as the bees have expended no labor upon them as yet , it is better to sacrifice these than the greater number left by her mother , which have consumed their portion of food ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary time to mature , to make a valuable addition to the stock . SHOULD NOT BE DELAYED . Should this operation be put off for a time much longer than three weeks , the young queen will so fill the combs again as to make it a serious loss . Therefore , I wish to urge strongly attention to this point at the proper season . If you think it unimportant to mark the date of your first swarms for the purposes mentioned in another place , it will be found very convenient here , for those that need pruning . It is also recommended by some , to take only a part , say one-third or half , in a season ; thereby taking two or three years to renew the combs . This is advisable only when the family is very small . As this space made by pruning can not be filled without wax and labor , our surplus honey will be proportionate to its extent . Now suppose we take out half the old combs , and get half a yield of box honey this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full operation of it and get none this year , and a full one next . What//
