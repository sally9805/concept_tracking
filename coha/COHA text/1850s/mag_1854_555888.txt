ART . VII . - Memoirs and Correspondence of FRANCIS bRNER* M.P . Edited by his Brother , LEONARD HORNER , ESQ. , F.R.S . Boston : Little , Brown , &amp; Co. 18*3. 2 vols. 8vo . Tnis work is something more than a reprint of the Memoirs of Francis Homer , which was first published in London about ten years ago . It embraces a further selection from Mr. brner ' s correspondence , about forty or fifty of his letters being now first given to the world ; and many of these , we may add , are equal or superior in interest to those included in the former edition . One of them contains a curious memorandum , drawn from the unpublished papers of John Locke , relative to the student Aikenhead , who was tried and executed in Edin .. burgh , as late as 1697 , for denying , perhaps for ridiculing , the doctrine of the Trinity . Certainly , there is little reason for sharply censuring the founders of a small colony here in New England , because they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang mad Quakers in 16*9 , if those principles were so little known in the mother country forty years afterwards , that , under the mild government of William of Orange , a man could be legally put to death for no other alleged crime than his speculative belief concerning the nature of the Godhead . Such a " judicial murder , " as Mr. Homer calls it , occurring in the lifetime of John Locke , could not fail to attract his notice , and he seems to have made a collection of the documents relating to it , including a copy of the indictment , notes of the evidence , and some private letters , in order either to bring the matter to ' the notice of the government in England , or to use it as an illustration in his writings upon toleration . It is not easy to see why Lord King , into whose possession these documents came among the other papers of Locke , made no allusion to the case in his biography of that sound philosopher and excellent man . As a descendant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he ought also to have inherited his principles , which would have inclined him to give to so abominable a transaction all the notoriety which he who first collected the documents intended it should ac // quire . Mr. Homer , while yet a very young man , had an opportunity allowed him , while in London , to examine Locke 's manuscripts , and was so much struck with the papers relating to this case , that he wrote to Malcolm Laing , the historian of Scotland , urging him to give an account of it in one of his forthcoming volumes . He quotes a letter of Lord Anstruther , who visited Aikenhead in prison , and describes him as " eighteen years of age , not vicious , and extremely studious . " Lord Anstruther pleaded in the Council for a remission of the sentence , but " was told it could not be granted unless the ministers would intercede . " Whereupon he remarks - " I am not for consulting the Church in state affairs . I do not think he would have proven an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a pious , though I think ignorant zeal , spoke and preached for cutting him off . I find capital punishment inflicted most against crimes that disturb the society and government , and not against the heinousness of the sin against God , for lawyers say in that case , Satis est Deum kabere ultorem . ' And so stealing a sheep , when one is hungry , or speaking against the king , are punished by death ; whereas cursing , lying , slandering , drunkenness , &amp;c. are scarcely taken notice of by our law ; but our ministers generally are of a narrow set of thoughts , and confined principles , and not able to bear things of this nature . I have sent you inclosed his speech . " - Vol . I. pp. 201 , 202 . It was characteristic of Francis Homer to be deeply interested in such a case , not so much from his fondness for historical research , as from the liberality of his principles and the vehemence of his indignation against wrong . The purity and excellence of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his understanding and the largeness of his attainments to give him the eminence which he acquired at a very early age among English statesmen . There was something in Homer which the most vehement of his political opponents felt compelled to respect , and before which any thing like duplicity , meanness , or profligacy stood ashamed . He was not a wit , he did not excel in oratory , and his talents were rather solid than brilliant . He had not the advantages of hereditary rank or ample fortune , and he first appeared in Parliament under the character , there peculiarly exposed to suspicion and dislike , of a young Scotch lawyer , who had // abandoned the bar at Edinburgh in order to seek his fortune on the broader theatre of London . A prejudice of the English people , especially of those connected with the government , against a person coming into political life under such circumstances , may be traced as far back , perhaps , as the times of James I. ; and it had certainly been strengthened of late years by a recollection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl of Bute , and even the great Lord Mansfield . Yet even Brougham , who was of English parentage , with all the variety of his talents , the ardor of his temperament , and the splendid irregularity of his genius , did not acquire political distinction so soon , and never gained so much weight and authority of opinion , as Homer , who was his contemporary and intimate friend . The latter died of consurnption , at the early age of thirty-nine , before he had held any public office , or had appeared before the public in any character but that of a diligent , but not obtrusive , memberof the House of Commons , and a stanch adherent of that Whig party which , throughout his career , was in a hopeless minority . Yet his premature death was regarded as a public calamity . All parties in the House of Commons united in paying a respectful and affectionate tribute to his memory ; and with the concurrence of the whole nation , a noble statue of him , by Chantrey , was erected in Westminster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the numerous memorials of the other illustrious dead whose fame is a portion of the national inheritance . When his decease was annonnced in Parliament , one of his political opponents , Mr. Manners Sutton , afterwards Speaker of the House , remarked , with much feeling , " Jn my conscience I believe there never lived the man of whom it could more truly be said , that , whenever he was found in public life , he was respected and admired ; whenever he was known in private life , he was most affectionately beloved . " Before the publication of his Memoirs and Correspondence , it was difficult to account for this warmth and unanimity of public and private eulogy . There were no striking incidents in Mr. Homer 's life ; he had not accomplished any one great work ; and though his career had evidently been active and // laborious , there were few or no permanent tokens of it in the history or the fortunes of the country . His name was identified with only one memorable passage in the political history of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House of Commons in 1810 . Even in that remarkable discussion , though it originated with him and he performed most of the labor , Canning eclipsed him in the rhetorical , and Ricardo in the scientific , treatment of the question , and he was perhaps equalled by Huskisson , Thornton , and Baring . Besides , the debate , important as it was for the evolution of scientific principles , and for its effect on public opinion , had no immediate result in legislation . Homer and his brilliant associates - the theorists , as their opponents sneeringly called them - were steadily voted down by a strong Parliamentary majority , who did not hesitate to declare that black was white , or to pass a formal resolution that the notes of the Bank of England had not undergone any depreciation whatever , though specie was then at a premium of about fourteen per cent . Not till 1819 did Mr. Peel succeed in inducing Parliament to order the restoration of cash payments by the Bank , thus reaping the harvest of which Mr. Homer had sown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as on most other occasions in which he directly came before the public , Mr. Homer appeared as a scientific Political Economist , - a character by no means as popular then as it has since become , through the success of Mr. Cobden and the Corn Law League . Every tyro in the House of Commons , and every contributor to the Times or the Morning Chronicle , can now cite Ricardo and Adam Smith , and prate about the laws of wages and the theory of rent ; in fact , he must do so , or John Bull will not listen to him . The Economists now govern the commercial legislation of England , and sway the destinies of her colonies . They can point to the New Poor Law , to Peel 's Bank Act of 1844 , to the repeal of the Corn Law and the Navigation Laws , and to the general establishment of Free Trade , as exclusively their work . The most general qualifications of an English statesman , at the present day , are a moderate knowledge of Adam Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any other training is ornamental or merely auxiliary ; these are necessary preparations for the course . It was far otherwise at the beginning of the present century , when Ricardo and Malthus , Homer and Huskisson , were just entering upon their labors . A Political Economist was then regarded pretty nearly in the same light in which men now look upon an Owenite , a Fourierite , or any other rabid theorist . He was thought to be hopelessly infected with the spirit of system . His arguments were not answered , but his conclusions were brought to the test of common sense and old prejudices , and found wanting . Though Mr. Homer does not rank , like Malthus and Ricardo , among the improvers of the science , he did more than any of his contemporaries to apply it to practice . Most of his articles in the Edinburgh Review , and most of his speeches in Parliament , were devoted to an application of its principles to the mooted questions of the day . But he did not become eminent because he was a Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered more to the science than he received from it . He obtained assent to its doctrines more because they were his doctrines , than because they were principles of science . He avoided the two common errors of political theorists ; he did not dogmatize , and he did not bend his doctrines to suit the occasions of his party . His candor and fairness preserved him from the one fault , and his scrupulous integrity from the other . His understanding was naturally vigorous , but it would not have had half so much influence , if it had not been interpenetrated and warmed by the glow of his moral principles and by the amiability of his character . Perfectly free from cant and from the desire of display , he enlisted the sympathies of men because he did not shock their taste or needlessly alarm their prejudices . His modesty equalled his earnestness , and his candor never yielded to the fond desire of triumphing in debate . He thus preserved the moral elevation that he obtained at the outset , both in Parliament and before the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he could not enforce assent to his opinions . The influence and distinction acquired by such a character were as honorable to those who gave or acknowledged them // as to himself . His talents were not showy and brilliant enough , his manners were too quiet and modest , and his principles too inflexible , to enable him soon to acquire favor with the multitude . He did not come into Parliament as the representative of a great constituency , but the high estimation in which he was held by his friends procured him a seat as a member for a close borough . Mr. Canning , as an opponent of Parliamentary reform , very fairly alluded to this circumstance when he came to add his testimonial of respect for the virtues of the departed . Mr. Windham , who was also a member by nomination , as it may be termed , having died not long before Mr. Homer , Canning remarked , - " When , for the second time within a short course of years , the name of an obscure borough is brought before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be permitted to me , with my avowed and notorious opinions on the subject of our Parliamentary constitution , to state , without offence , that it is at least some consolation for the imputed theoretical defects of that constitution , that in practice it works so well . A system of representation can not be wholly vicious and altogether inadequate to its purposes , which sends to this house a succession of such men as those whom we have now in our remembrance , here to develop the talents with which God has endowed them , and to attain that eminence in the view of their country , from which they may be one day called to aid her counsels and to sustain her great ness and her glory . " Thus much , we fear , must be admitted by the most strenuous advocates of democratic institutions , that , in the United States , a man like Mr. Homer , whatever eminence he might have acquired through the press , could not have gained political distinction and influence so soon , or held them so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his early success seemed remarkable , and , before the publication of his correspondence , almost inexplicable . Sir James Mackintosh surpassed him in reputation for learning and philosophy , in wit and brilliancy of composition and agreeableness of manners , and was certainly not inferior to him in political integrity and private virtue . But he did not even obtain a seat in Parliament till he was nearly fifty , and though he remained there over twenty years , he seems to have had hardly a tithe of the influence // MEMOIRS OF FRANCIS HORNER . over the House , or of the weight of opinion , which Homer had long enjoyed , who died at the early age of thirty-nine . But these letters and extracts from the other writings of Homer explain the problem of the great difference between the two men in point of success . Homer possessed in an eminent degree the steadiness of purpose and systematic diligence in which Mackintosh was wofully deficient . He had none of the little weaknesses or petty defects which so often abridge the influence , though to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great talents and commanding virtues . Constancy in his aims , system in his employments , and indefatigable industry , were characteristic of him from early boyhood . Before he attained the age of manhood , he marked out for himself both the goal of his future endeavors and the precise path along which he was to proceed . From that path he never deviated a hair 's breadth , and only a premature death prevented him from reaching the goal . Mackintosh was successively a physician , a political essayist , a lawyer , an Indian judge , a member of Parliament , a professor in college , and a historian . He coquetted all his life with philosophy , politics , and history , sharing his attentions so equally among them , that he never became a highly favored suitor of either . In reviewing his life and works , we do not think so much of what he actually accomplished , as of what he might have performed if he had been faithful to himself and persevering in his designs . His brilliant conversational powers were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphs of social intercourse his best opportunities of affording delight and instruction to future generations . The first volume of Homer 's Memoirs and Correspondence derives most of its interest from the very full view that is given in it of the studies , and the carefully elaborated habits of thought and conduct , by which he prepared himself for active life , and insured as well as merited the success that attended all his future undertakings . It is an instructive commentary on the truth , which young men are far more willing to acknowledge in words than to act upon , that moderate natural endowments , controlled by a strong sense of duty , // laboriously and systematically cultivated , and directed with unflinching perseverance to a single object , though that object be both distant and lofty , are far more likely to be rewarded with success , than the untrained and spasmodic efforts of the most brilliant genius . Mr. Homer had not , it is true , to contend with the formidable external obstacles which sometimes frustrate the best attempts at systematic self-culture . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with books , instructors , and the other means and appliances of learning . But the work which he performed for himself was one in reference to which books and instructors are not so often a help as a hinderance ; they are but crutches , which sloth and cowardice so often tempt us to lean upon , and the use of which may consequently even postpone the period at which we shall be able to walk alone . Mr. Homer fairly met and vanquished the insidious and dangerous foes to self-educa* tion which every man finds in his own love of ease and amusement , in his occasional fits of despondency and frequent vacillations of purpose . His plan of life was no better or higher than that which is formed by hundreds of students some time during their university career . But he had firmness and resolution enough to pursue it to the end , without halt or wavering ; and thus his few years were crowned with some of the best fruits of a long life . The leading incidents in Mr. Homer 's life may be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 12th of August , 1778 . His father , a respectable and successful merchant , had good natural abilities and respectable attainments , so that he was well qualified to superintend the earlier portion of his son 's education , and to sympathize with him in his later studies and pursuits . From his mother he inherited a gentle disposition , a delicate taste , and the purity and firmness of moral principle which was his prominent characteristic through life . He was educated at the High School and in the University of Edinburgh , then in the zenith of their fame and influence , the former being under the charge of Dr. Adam , and the latter ranking among its professors such men as IDugald Stewart , Playfair , Robison , Black , and IDr . Hugh Blair . The reputation of these men , united // with the disturbances on the Continent of Europe , which induced many persons to send their sons to a distance for an education , attracted a throng of students from other lands to Edinburgh , thus giving variety and animation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its intellectual action . It was , indeed , an exciting period . The French Revolution was agitating every part of the civilized world , not only with its diplomacy , its wars , and the intestine disturbances that it occasioned , but with a general fermentation of opinion and the shock of conflicting theories . Society was kept in a state of feverish excitement by the news of startling events and the mingled dread and hope of what was to come . Nothing appeared stable ; old kingdoms were subverted , old institutions were crumbling , and doctrines were vehemently advocated that went far beyond the old landmarks of opinion , and threatened to upheave the moral basis of every thing which had escaped external violence . All departments of thought received a new and strong impulse ; poetry and philosophy were nearly as much affected as politics . Men speculated about every thing , - about science , morals , and religion , as much as government and laws . Lecturers harangued , public and secret associations were formed for the propagation of peculiar opinions , debating societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government acted with unwonted vigor and sternness , being cheered on by one faction , and execrated by the other which felt its blows . Men were transported or hanged for seditious practices , though their actions would not , in ordinary times , have subjected them even to a fine . Professors in the universities adapted their lectures to the occasion , and spoke with unusual warmth the language of animation , warning , or reproof . Students hurried from the lecture to their clubrooms , where they debated about the rights of man and the organization of society . The effect was not all evil ; amid much bluster , error , and noise , were felt the light and heat of true intellectual activity and life . Genius is born and nursed amid political throes and convulsions , as the central fires of our globe make themselves known and felt through earthquakes and volcanoes . The youth who were receiving their // education at this exciting epoch showed afterwards far more energy and power than the generations which immediately preceded or followed them . Ambition was roused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was relaxed , and the benumbing effect of old customs and fixed institutions was passing away . If a quiet and thoughtful boy like Homer had not entered into this stir and tumult of his own accord , he would soon have imbibed a liking for it from his associates . Henry Brougham was his playmate and schoolfellow almost from infancy . " in May , 1780 , " says his mother , " they used to run together on the pavement before our house . " Jeffrey , Murray , John Allen , and Sydney Smith were among his earliest friends ; and he was associated with them in the memorable undertaking , half a frolic at its commencement , of the Edinburgh Review . It was one striking proof , among many , of the intellectual activity of the period , that a journal , which exercised from the first a commanding influence on the literature and politics of Great Britain , should have been started , partly as a joke , by half a dozen briefless lawyers and unbeneficed clergymen in Edinburgh , not one of whom had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were homer 's associates and rivals in the " Speculative Society , " the debates in which probably did more to widen the range of his ideas , and develop his powers of thought and expression , than all his studies in the University , or his practice at the bar . He was a careful , though not a brilliant scholar , and when he left IDr . Adam 's tuition to enter college , he was Dux of the rector 's class , or the acknowledged head of the school . With all its advantages as a place of education and residence , Edinburgh is still only a provincial city ; and its inhabitants show their consciousness of the fact in nothing so strongly as their nervous anxiety to get rid of provincial peculiarities . Hume and Robertson were haunted by the fear of Gallicisms in their style ; and Lord Loughborough , in the opening of his career , made a violent attempt to correct his Scotch accent by taking lessons of the elder Sheridan , who , in a rich Irish brogue , undertook to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Homer , who was destined first for // the Scotch and afterwards for the English bar , was sent by his father to prosecute his studies for a year in England , in order to perfect his pronunciation . He was placed under the care of the Rev. John Hewlett , at Shacklewell , a small village in Middlesex . After he had been there a short time , he writes to his father , " With respect to one great object for which you were at the expense and trouble of placing me here , I think I am beginning to pronounce some words as Englishmen do , and just to feel the difference between the rhythm of their conversation and mine . " At Shacklewell , he was allowed a degree of liberty in the disposition of his time which would have been hazardous to any boy of seventeen except one who had already been denominated by his schoolfellows " the sage , " and " the ancient Homer . " He occupied lodgings in the village , where his instructor visited him only one hour in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth might select . He read Greek and Latin every morning , and devoted the afternoon to mathematics and the formation of an Eng .. lish style by translating from the French and reading Bolingbroke and Junius . He kept up a full correspondence , also , with his former associates at Edinburgh , writing at great length on metaphysical questions and other academical sub .. jects . It is amusing to find a youth , who yet lacked several years of his majority , gravely discussing in his familiar letters the freedom of the will , and passing sentence with much gravity " against the absurd and trifling metaphysics of the schoolmen , and the dangerous refinements of modern materialists . " His anxious and persevering attempts to master the niceties of English idiom had an injurious effect for a while upon his style , which became insufferably formal and stiff . These qualities wore off in time , but he never became a master of easy and graceful English prose . Never was a course of self-discipline more thorough and painstaking than that to which Homer subjected himself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much , but very thoroughly , keeping the pen constantly in his hand , starting doubts and difficulties , or hunting up illustrations , for every page , and anxiously questioning himself every little while as to the amount and value of the accessions which he had // made to his stock of ideas . In this way , he read the principal works of Lord Bacon , Adam Smith , and the leading Economists of France . Sometimes he was lucky enough to find an associate , of similar tastes , and equal ardor and diligence ; and then they read together , entering into a discussion of every question or criticism which the text suggested to either . The only relaxation which he permitted himself was the study of chemistry , the experiments in which offered an agreeable diversion from the painful processes of abstract thought . In the choice of his studies , as well as in the general character of his opinions , may be traced the influence of Dugald Stewart , whom he revered as an instructor while he was strongly attached to him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous letters while this process of self-culture was going on , we are enabled to trace the progress of his studies and the formation of his mind with greater particularity than is usual . Modest as he was by nature , the accuracy of his judgment and his careful habit of self-examination disclosed to him the extent of his powers , and the aims which he cherished were so lofty , that in any other person they *Tould have savored of conceit . " Political virtue , political sagacity , political science , are three great branches of habit to be cultivated ; and so , that by being blended together in the mind , they may strengthen ns well as purify each other . " " It is to give myself a chance for acting in public life , that I shall laboriously devote myself to the law ; if I succeed in which , I have two chances for a public scene ; either as a judge , which , if in a supreme situation , I should consider as the most dignified , and in which a beneficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon the foundation of an independence acquired professionally , place myself in a public situation , where the results of political philosophy may be applied to the exercise of the great duties of legislation . " - Vol . I. p. 362 . If it seems strange that a man under thirty , and favored by no adventitious aids , should cherish so lofty purposes as these , it is stranger still , that , before ten years had elapsed , he should have fulfilled a large portion of them . He never attained eminence at the bar ; he had not the keen and quick intellect , the fluency of speech and ardor of temperament , which are the 16 // requisites of marked success in that profession . He would have made a better judge than lawyer , and he was too rigid a moralist to become a thorough-paced politician . In almost every respect , he was the opposite of his friend Brougham ; and notwithstanding their early and long-continued intimacy , this essential diversity of character led to events which caused a suspension of intercourse between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fault must have been entirely Brougham 's ; for Homer was amiable as well as rigidly just , and was peculiarly happy in making friends and attaching them to himself with the cords of a strong and lasting affection . Among these friends was one , nearly of the same age as Homer , and cut off prematurely , like him , by pulmonary complaints , when he had hardly reached the middle period of life , whose character , as it is not generally known , deserves more than a passing notice . Lord Webb Seymour , a brother of the present Duke of Somerset , after passing the usual period at Christ Church , Oxford , went to Edinburgh in 1797 , at the age of twenty , to pursue his studies at the University there , being attracted by its high reputation as a school for moral and physical philosophy . From a brief *nd affectionate memoir of him , written by his friend Hallam , the historian , and appended to this work , we take the following sketch of his life at Oxford . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an unshaken determination to cultivate his mind according to a preconceived scheme of improvement , rare in a young man of his rank , and much more so at that time than in the present age . The habits of his natural associates , those in college language called gold tufts and silk gowns , were any thing rather than studious , estimable as many of those young men were in private life , and have since shown themselves in the world . Lord Webb Seymour soon adopted a plan , which even the reading men at Oxford seldom thought it necessary to pursue . He resolutely declined all invitations , and during the whole remainder of his stay at Christ Church was never seen at a wine party . Such a course , whatever in this more studious age may be thought , brought down at that time on his head the imputation of great singularity ; but his remarkable urbanity of manners , and the entire absence of affectation , // preserved to him the respect and regard of those from whose society he thus seemed to withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all convivial intercourse was characteristic of his modesty . He felt , he said , that his parts were slow ; that he acquired knowledge with less facility than many of his contemporaries ; and that he could not hope to compass the objects which he had in view , if he gave up the evening hours , as was then customary , to the pleasures of conversation . The dignity of his mind , always intent on future and even distant schemes of improvement , and hence superior to all momentary emulation , which it is perhaps too much the habit of those who guide our academical studies to encourage , can only be appreciated by those who remember him at this period , and who remember also the frivolous and superficial tone of conversation from which , relatively at least to him , few of his fellow-students , even though not deficient in mental quickness or school learning , were exempt . " Lord Webb Seymour was neither a very good scholar , in the common sense of the word , nor by any means the contrary . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , and his character rendered him averse to spread his reading over a large surface . He read slowly and carefully , possibly too much so ; but as on this account he forgot little , he was by this means uninformed on many subjects of general literature . But his peculiar quality was the love of truth , and , as is perhaps the case with all true lovers , he loved that mistress the more in proportion as she was slow in favoring his suit . It was said of him that he would rather get at any thing by the longest process ; and , in fact , not having a quick intuition , and well knowing that those who decide instantly are apt not to understand what they decide , he felt a reluctance to acquiesce in what the world call a common-sense view of any philosophical question . " - Vol . I. pp. 533 , 534 . Attracted by similarity of pursuits and character , he soon became Homer 's intimate friend . They read Bacon and Adam Smith together , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and formed a magnificent scheme for instituting a Philological Society , with an ultimate view to the invention of a real character . The project was rather a presumptuous one for two very young men , whose knowledge of languages was probably confined to a modicum of Latin , Greek , and French , in addition to their mother tongue ; and though patronized by the Duke of Somerset himself we are not surprised to learn that // it failed to be carried out . Lord Webb Seymour had a stronger taste for natural science than his friend ; he travelled over Scotland and part of England , in company with Mr. Playfair , that he might have the benefit of his geological instructions in the field . He also studied mathematics under the same teacher , though he had little taste or aptitude for the science ; but he believed it would be a useful discipline for his habits of thought . Though constantly learning , and committing the results of his inquiries to paper , he was too distrustful of himself and too deaf to the voice of ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public life . After a while , he purchased a beautiful estate in Scotland , and there passed most of the remainder of his days , still keeping up a correspondence with his early friends , and manifesting the warmest sympathy in their plans and welfare . He visited Edinburgh occasionally , that he might have the pleasure of a metaphysical discussion with Dr. Thomas Brown ; but nature had formed him to be a philosophical recluse , and he soon hastened back to his books in his solitary home . " It is not only the time engrossed by society , " he wrote to his friend Hallarn , " that I find to be the loss in a town ; there is a still more serious obstacle to any independtrnt pursuit in the sympathy excited by the occupations of other men , who are continually thrusting in upon you political discussion , the business of the world , and the novelties of literature . " It is not every young nobleman of ample fortune , we imagine , who is afraid of having such topics and amusements " thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps there was something morbid in the state of mind or moral principle which created so strong a dislike of what the world generally considers as innocent relaxation . He was not a misanthrope , however , and he had considerable power of pleasing in general society . His affection for his friends led him to entertain a nice regard for their moral well-being , as well as for their success in life . After he had been separated from Homer for several years , and when the latter was in the full tide of Parliamentary success , he wrote him a long letter on the danger of allowing his judgment to be warped and his moral sense to be blunted by the excitements of politics and // the influence of party connections and party views . Here is a lesson in toleration which parties in a monarchy or a republic might profit by , though it be preached by a young nobleman who never had a voice in legislation . " Opposition in Parliament is generally conducted upon one very false principle , namely , that the measures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , as to deserve , upon the whole , very severe reprobation . I will not suppose this principle to be speculatively recognized ; but it seems , at least , to be practically adopted . Now it is plain , that , where a set of men have the good of the country mainly at heart , and have tolerable capacities for business , though their talents be neither profound nor brilliant , and though their principles lean rather more than is right in favor of the Crown , yet their measures must , in all probability , be often as good as circumstances will admit of , and sometimes entitled to praise for unusual prudence or magnanimity . On such occasions , justice is , for the most part , denied them altogether by the opposition side of the House ; or , if praise is bestowed at all , it is bestowed in feeble terms , and with reservations much insisted on ; but what is denied them in Parliament is granted by an impartial public without doors , with proportionate disgust at the bitter and unremitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 352 . We subjoin an entry from Mr. Homer 's diary , written at the time when he was about parting from his excellent friend in order to try his fortunes at the English bar . " This day Lord Webb and I read Lord Bacon , I am afraid for the last time ; I go to London in a few days , and by the time I return , he will be prepared to bid farewell to Scotland . We have not finished the Novum Organum , having got no farther than that part of the second book in which the author begins to illustrate the prerogative instantiarum ; but we have worked very accurately through the whole of what we have read , and prepared ourselves tolerably well for the study of the Baconian logic upon an enlarged plan , by an attentive study of what may be called its grammar or rudiments . I must take some future opportunity of examining , retrospectively , the kind as well as degree of improvement which these studies with . Seymour have purchased ; that it is considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noble subject to which it directed my attention for so considerable a space of time , I must have learned something from the manner and habits of my companion . He is indeed very slow in apprehension , partly from what may be called a want of energy , or at least imagina .. // tion , partly too from principle and voluntary habit ; but then he possesses , in an eminent degree , the truly philosophic qualities of scrupulous caution , unconquerable patience , unclouded candor . From this crisis of our studies , what different roads we are to follow ! His life devoted to speculative labor and scientific accumulation ; mine immersed , Si SW fata , in the passing ephemeral details of professional activity . He has the prospect , and the resolution , before him , of persevering through all the general reasonings of Lord Bacon 's philosophy , and all the pleasing illustrations that can be culled from every field of science . I must content myself in that department with imperfect knowledge , and with the chance of assimilating some portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infusing something of the spirit of liberal science into the gross and unformed details of business . " - Vol . I. pp. 177 , 178 . The short time , little over two years , that Mr. Homer remained in Edinburgh , after his admission to the bar , was not unprofitably spent , though he met the usual fate of young advocates , in. obtaining very little professional business . His own phrase , that he was " entirely immersed in law , political economy , and history , " does not express the whole truth ; for the first of these three studies , though it should have been his chief object , occupied the smallest share of his attention . He had some taste for the antiquities , and what may be called the philosophy , of the law ; but its details and practice were excessively irksome to him . But he diligently traversed the broad fields of philosophical and political disquisition , and wrote several articles on Political Economy for the Edinburgh Review . In March , 1802 , he made a preliminary visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Webb Seymour , by his intimacy with Sydney Smith and John Allen , and his own reputation as an Edinburgh Reviewer and a young lawyer of great abilities and liberal politics , he was received with open arms by the Whigs , and at once admitted into the most select circle of the wits and talents of their party . The doors of Holland House opened to him , as it were , of their own accord , and before a fortnight had elapsed , he had dined at the King of Clubs , in company with Mackintosh , Romilly , Abercromby , " Conversation* ' Sharp , and Scarlett , afterwards Lord Abinger . Homer 's account of this dinner , as given in his diary , shows that he was not dazzled by the // literary or social reputation of these stars of the *Vhig faction , but that he judged them very coolly and with much fairness . " The conversation was very pleasing ; it consisted chiefly of literary reminiscences , anecdotes of authors , criticisms of books , &amp;c . I had been taught to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wit , and all the flourishes of intellectual gladiatorship : which , though less permanently pleasing , is for the time more striking . This expectation was not answered ; partly , as I am given to understand , from the absence of Smith , and partly from the presence of Romilly , who evidently received from all an unaffected deference , and imposed a certain degree of restraint . I may take notice of one or two particulars , which struck me as the characteristic defects of this day 's conversation . There was too little of present activity ; the memory alone was put to work ; no efforts of original production , either by imagination or the reasoning powers . All discussion of opinions was studiously avoided ; this could not proceed from any apprehension of unpleasant discord of sentiment , for upon the fundamental doctrines in religion and politics the whole company were certainly biassed to the same side ; neither could it arise from a want of difference in opinion , in deductions farther removed from first principles ; that can never be the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only explain the circumstance , therefore , from an erroneous fashion or taste in conversation I shall only remark farther in this place , that between Sharp and Mackintosh , for example , there seems to me to be too much of assentation with respect to canons of criticisms , &amp;c. ; as if they lived too much together ; as if they belonged to a kind of sect ; or as if there was something of compromise between them . Their principles of criticism and taste appear to me quite just , and formed very much upon the French school ; IRacine and Virgil the models of poetical composition , and Cicero the prince of prose writers : at the same time , they do not carry the principles , upon which this judgment is founded , to that cold and dull extreme , which limits all excellence to correctness , and allows no relish for the wildness of untamed imagination , or the flights of extravagant eccentric genius . I rather apprehend that they even suffer this indulgence a little farther than is quite consistent with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not qualified enough ; and their appetite for the nervous or flowing passages that may with toil be detected in the obscure folios of some of our old English writers , apparent ran nantes in gurgite vasto , ' betrays unquestionably a palate not fully gratified with the milder relish of chastened excellence . " - Vol . I. pp. 183 - 185. // Homer himself appears to have made a very agreeable impression on these men , partly perhaps because he was not a wit , and the inherent modesty and amiableness of his disposition prevented him from entering into any rivalry with them as accomplished conversers , and partly because his excellent abilities and extensive information were manifest enough to prove that he was a very desirable accession to the party . He also made the acquaintance of Sir Humphrey Davy and the poet Campbell , and , on the whole , passed the time in London so much to his satisfaction , that we are not surprised to learn that he shortened by one year his intended future stay in Scotland , so that he might the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractions . It is amusing to be informed from his own confession , made not long after his final settlement in the great metropolis , that he soon found the necessity of unlearning some of the habits which he had formed in " the metaphysical climate of Edinburgh ; such as the inclination to theorize , and to present general principles or rules in a scholastic dress . " Some frank confessions were also made to him , as when Mackintosh admitted his recent discovery , forced upon him by his practice at the Cockpit , that he knew almost nothing about international law , though he had lectured upon it with great iclat some years before in Lincoln 's Inn . Success at the bar was evidently a secondary object with Homer , though he had some show of business in the Scotch law cases before the House of Lords , and though he entered his name at Lincoln 's Inn with the intention , afterwards fulfilled , of regularly going the circuit . But an opening into political life was the great aim of his endeavors ; and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers ' gallery in the House of Commons , to hear the debates , with much greater enjoyment than he found in the courts . A political crisis had arrived , and the debates were unusually interesting . " Doctor " Addington , as he was called , had presumed to think and act for himself , and to keep his post at the head of the ministry , after William Pitt , who had regarded him only as a warming-pan , had signified a wish that he should retire , and thus open the way for his own return // to power . Strong in the personal favor of the king , and in a very respectable " political connection , " the Doctor turned a deaf ear to the mandate ; and Pitt , in great wrath , formed a sort of league with Fox and the Whig opposition , in order that their united forces might compel him to retire . As the country was greatly excited from the imminent prospect of an invasion by Napoleon , and the whole conduct of the war was at stake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their strength for the encounter . Homer and Mackintosh often waited seven or eight hours to secure a seat in the gallery , and did not always succeed . The following is an account by the former of one of the great debates . " Fox 's opening speech was not eloquent ; on the contrary , slovenly as to manner , and languid ; probably from an express intention to restrain himself on personal topics , that he might not anticipate Pitt in this respect ; he did not allude to ministers , but confined himself to the inadequacy of the present arrangements for national defence , and the means of improving them into a permanent system by a better plan of recruiting , and by regulations for military exercises among the peasantry . All the substance of his speech was excel1*nt . Pitt gave us both substance and manner , as a debater of the highest powers ; most explicit in his declaration against ministers , which he delivered , however , as if at last after much consideration and reluctance ; but he enforced it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some touches of that bitter , freezing sarcasm , which everybody agrees is his most original talent , and appears indeed most natural to him . His speech was very argumentative and full of details ; throughout , the impression he left was , and he disguised very successfully his anxiety to make this impression , that every measure government had adopted for the national defence originated from his suggestions , which they had marred , however , by adopting them imperfectly , and carrying them still worse into execution . The speeches of ministers were confined , till the Attorney-General rose , to the defence of the different parts of their military measures that had been attacked ; Percival took a much more judicious view of the debate , and treated the motion as if it had been in terms for the dismissal of ministers . This was the true mode of treating it , if he could have executed his idea with skill ; but his want of talent drove him to violence and extreme personality , so as to betray the fury and despair of his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse of Fox and Windham was vulvoL . Lxxvnm. - No. 162. 17 // gar and gross in the extreme . But we in the gallery were much indebted to him , for it produced a masterly speech from each in their very different styles . Wiudham repelled the personality , chiefly by the contrast of his own manner ; with great fire , but perfect temper , a very polite contempt , and exquisite wit ; he spoke not more than ten minutes , but he refreshed one 's mind from all the bad feelings that Percival had given us . Fox treated him after a different regimen ; condemning , with much vehemence and indignation , the faction and ribaldry which he had introduced into the debate ; and defending his own political connections and conduct with all the manliness and simplicity of his best manner . " - Vol . I. pp. 261 , 262 . We add an account of two other distinguished speakers , whom Homer heard on a subsequent occasion , as the criticism upon one of them shows very plainly the sagacity and excellent judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament . Dr. Lawrence will be best remembered as the intimate friend and literary executor of Edmund Burke , though we can hardly pardon his remissness in the duties of the latter office . " The best hkits as to the real substance of the case gleamed through the darkness and turbidness of Dr. Lawrence , who would fairly have talked his audience to death , if they had not coughed him to silence ; his expectoration ( to use a delicate phrase of Lord Ellenborough 's ) was dreadful to the hearer , but seemed to be full of knowledge and sense and acuteness , as I have always found him whenever I have had self-command sufficient to listen . There was one extraordinary oration that night , - Sir William Grant 's ; quite a masterpiece of his peculiar and miraculous manner : conceive an hour and a half of syllogisms strung together in the closest tissue , so artfully clear that you think every successive inference unavoidable ; so rapid that you have no leisure to reflect where you have been brought from , or to see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornament or illustration or refreshment , that the attention is stretched - stretched - racked . All this is done without a single note . And yet , while I acknowledge the great vigor of understanding displayed in such performances , I have a heresy of my own about Grant 's speaking ; it does not appear to me of a parliamentary cast , nor suited to the discussions of a political assembly . The effect he produces is amazement at his power , not the impression of his subject ; npw this is a mortal symptom . Besides this , he gives me a suspicion of sophistry , which haunts me through his whole de // duction ; though I have nothing immediately to produce , I feel dissatisfied , as if there were something that might be said . And after all , there are no trains of syllogism nor processes of intricate distinctions in subjects that are properly political . The wisdom , as well as the common feelings that belong to such subjects , lies upon the surface in a few plain and broad lines ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and it belongs to talents of the second order to proceed with a great apparatus of reasoning . " - Vol . I. pp. 307 , 308 . Homer was soon to enter the arena of which he had so long been a wishful spectator . When he had been little more than a year in London , he was formally invited by Lord Fitzwilham , with whom he had had no previous acquaintance , to attend a dinner-party at his house , at which many of the Whig leaders were to be present , in order to consult about some new move on the political chessboard . Such an invitation kindled his hopes anew ; but his diary shows that , with his usual conscientiousness , he entered into a severe examination of himself , his opinions and principles , to learn whether he could , by accepting it , honestly join Mr. Fox 's party . The result of this scrutiny being favorable , he attended the dinner , and found , to his great disgust , that the grand project which they were called together to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for writing pamphlets , squibs , epigrams , &amp;c. against the administration . " The epigrams were evidently considered more important than the pamphlets ; and the only result of the meeting was , that Jekyll wrote half a dozen very good ones . This first view of the petty man ceuvres of a great political party almost sickened an ingenuous neophyte like Homer . He tried to smooth the plumes of his ruffled dignity by gravely recording this lofty purpose in his diary - " I shall perhaps look out for some opportunities , of my own accord , for writing constitutional tracts , such as those opportunities which my Lord Somers , in his earlier days , thought no improper temptations from the general career which he pursued . " Bravo , young Scotch philosopher ! But perhaps it was quite as well that the " constitutional tracts , " after the manner of " my Lord Somers in his earlier days , " were never written ; Lord Fitzwilliam and the other veteran Whig schemers would only have shrugged their shoulders at them . // When Homer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not an intriguer , not a catspaw in dirty or fiery business , but as a person of immense industry , large attainments , and scrupulous uprightness , and as therefore not only a sound but a safe man , the party soon found fitting employment for him . He judges himself very fairly in a letter which he wrote about this period to his friend Murray . " As for the splendid , hazardous pursuits of foreign policy and ministerial intrigue , into which our friend Brougham is plunging himself with a resolution to succeed that seems to insure success , and will at all events secure distinction , they are as unsuitable to the habits of my mind as to its powers ; too bustling for the indolent predilection ( which grows upon me hourly ) for domestic and confined society , and not of magnitude , I will acknowledge , adequate to my idea of the highest sort of ambition . Lord Bacon and Dugald Stewart have made me a little of a visionary , as I believe you have sometimes thought ; I am sure Brougham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet reasoned myself out of those shades ; the fantastic spell ' is unbroken , so I must even go on still perque dornos vacuas et mania regna. ' " - Vol . I. p. 279 . The first honorable application made for Mr. Homer 's political services was by the Chairman of the East India Coinpany , that he should write an exposition of the views of the Directors with respect to the extension of their Eastern dominions . It is not known that any thing came of this proposal , though he accepted it for the dignified reason stated in his journal , that , " in advocating a case which is congenial to my own principles and feelings , I shall have to illustrate the high rules of political virtue , to assert the rights of remote nations of men , and to prescribe maxims to the government of England , for the preservation and improvement of her empire in Asia . " Pretty well for a youth of twenty-six ! Two years afterwards , when the Whigs were in power , and the famous administration of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer from Lord Minto of a seat , vacated by the resignation of Lord Harrowby 's brother , at the Board of Commissioners appointed to adjust the long-disputed claims of the creditors of the Nabob of Arcot . With some misgivings on his own part , and a great many on that of his // friends , for he was endangering his chance of earning an independence at the bar , this offer was accepted . It is honorable both to Mr. Homer and his advisers to be able to say , that their scruples entirely vanished only when it was ascertained that the Commissionership , though a highly respectable office , was attended with no emolument whatever . It was a post of hard work and no pay ; but it was an earnest of better things . Hardly four weeks had elapsed before he received a proposal from Lord Kinnaird to bring him into Parliament as member for his Lordship 's rotten borough of St. Ives . Homer 's immediate reply was characteristic . He told Lord Henry Petty , who communicated the offer , that he must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no expense ; that he never would come into Parliament under instructions from any man ; that his political attachment was to Mr. Fox 's party ; and that he must be satisfied that Lord Kinnaird held the same views , and was likely to be steady in them . The assurances given on all these points were satisfactory ; and then , though he had received a letter of affectionate warning and remonstrance from his philosophic friend , Lord Webb Seymour , the young Scotchman accepted the dazzling proposal , and came into the House of Commons just after his friends the Whigs left the ministry . As all expectations of obtaining office or emolument were thus dissipated , we may suppose that even Lord Webb Seymour 's scruples were dissipated also . We do not propose to follow Mr. Homer 's Parliamentary career , as it is a part of the history of the times , and is sufficiently familiar to all . Indeed , our object all along has been , to show rather what he was , than what he accomplished . It is not often that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , as we hope , because the character itself is rare , but because it is usually manifested only in private life . We shall think better of professed politicians in future , because one such man deigned to take service , and even found favor , among them . Mr. Homer 's part in the House of Commons was not showy or bustling , but it was eminently discreet , laborious , and honorable . On such subjects as the currency and the corn laws , he soon became an authority , and his opinions 17 // were received with much deference . On another important point , the resumption of cash payments by the Bank , as we have seen , he had the honor of leading the public opinion of England . If his party adopted measures about the policy of which he was doubtful , he was silent , or he absented himself from the House ; if they swerved a hair 's breadth from what he conceived to be the true line of uprightness and magnanimity , he opposed them . A striking proof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return from Elba . He had fully shared his countrymen 's intense dislike of England 's great enemy , with whom she had waged a furious war for fourteen years , broken only by one brief and hollow truce , - who had almost constantly foiled her on the land , while he had been regularly beaten by her at sea . No one had been more despondent than Homer , at the time when , after the peace of Tilsit , Napoleon appeared 1813 - 14 had dashed this mighty empire into fragments , and left the great conqueror as master only of a petty islet in the Mediterranean . And his imagination was not kindled or his judgment warped by the most astounding feat recorded in modern history , - by Napoleon 's landing at Frejus , and his unresisted march to Paris . He still detested the Corsican 's character and policy , and grieved to see him restored to the throne of France . But here he stopped , for the circumstances had changed . Napoleon was no longer a usurper , for when destitute of power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acclamation , - by what seemed to be the free and unanimous voice of the French people ; and as a consistent Whig , Mr. Homer could not deny the right of a nation to choose its own ruler without foreign interference . Moreover , Napoleon was now a constitutional sovereign , having conciliated the republican party by the grant of the acte additionnel , which confined the imperial power within comparatively narrow limits ; and this act had been accepted by a popular vote of over 1,500,000 to 5,000 . Probably not another monarch in Europe could have obtained the free vote of so large a majority of his people for his own continuance // on the throne . But more than all , Napoleon now appeared as a suitor for peace , while the allies proposed to put him under the ban of nations , and to wage interminable war against him as an enemy of the human race . If England was again to engage in the conflict , the war on her part - xvas to be unquestionably an aggressive one . Entirely unprovoked , and rejecting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sole purpose of dethroning one who had just been raised to the throne with unparalleled unanimity by his own subjects . If Mr. Homer had disliked Napoleon less , these con siderations might have had less weight with him . They would not have appeared so formidable , moreover , if his own interests - the good-will of his friends , his popularity with all parties , and even the chance of retaining his seat in Parliamenthad not plainly required him to disregard them . But suspecting that his judgment might be biassed by these two reasons , he anxiously pondered over the arguments against renewing the war till they appeared irresistible ; and then , nobly disregarding the astonishment and reproaches of those who knew him best , the suspicions of the still larger number of persons who always impute ill motives to those who differ from them in opinion , and the opposition of his own party , he formed one of the very small minority who voted against the declaration of hostilities . Immediately after the division , he wrote to the Marquis of Bnckingham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offered to resign it , as he was no longer able to reconcile his sense of duty to the public with the support of that line of public policy which the Marquis had adopted . And this was not merely a formal offer , made with a good hope that it would not be accepted ; for though his patron handsomely declined to take immediate advantage of it , he said very plainly in his reply , that if the difference of opinion between them , which had as yet been manifested only upon one topic and in one vote , should lead " to a continued difference in our public line of conduct , " he would then accept Mr. Homer 's honorable proposal . There still remained the difficult task of satisfying his father , his scrupulous philosophic friend , Lord Webb Seymour , and even his old asso // ciates , Murray and Jeffrey , not merely that his vote was founded on sincere conviction , - for that they never doubted , - but that it did not imply any dereliction of principles formerly avowed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Napoleon . To Murray he wrote : - " If we are to open a new Iliad of war against the military power of France , it is of the last importance that we should so commence it , as to stamp upon it , in the opinion of the people of the Continent , its true character of a war of defence merely against aggrandizement . By going to war now , we go to war for the Bourbons , to force that feeble , worn-out race upon the French ; we go to war too upon a still more hopeless , and in my sentiments unjustifiable principle , that of proscribing an individual , and , through him , the nation which has adopted him , as incapable of peace or truce . It is obvious , that , proceeding in that manner , we do what we can to inspire into the French soldiery all the fire of enthusiasm , every feeling of pride for their national independence , and the utmost devotion for their great chief . The argument used on the other side is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act over again his old part as soon as he has collected sufficient means , and that the interval should not be let slip of overbearing him , while he is unprepared , with the whole combined numbers of the allies . Even if these things could be taken for granted , I question if it would not still be but a short-sighted prudence , . to reject the opportunity which his professions of peace and moderation might afford of confirming in the pi*iblic mind of Europe , an impression of the justice of our cause in that war , which , if it be renewed , will be one of no short duration , and must , in the course of it , involve in all the vicissitudes of fortune the best parts of the world . For England , I own , I can not see , if we are to have another period of war , that ultimate success abroad , if*to be hoped , would compensate our sure and irreparable losses at home ; the inevitable insolvency of the Exchequer must , in one disguised shape or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ruin of all those families , whom the Courier ( resuming the ancient Jacobinical phrase of its editor when he was the hireling of violence of another sort ) stigmatizes as the drones of society , the annuitants , those who live on the savings of former industry ; and in addition to this calamity , we shall witness the acceleration of that change , which is already begun , of our old civil system of freedom and law , for a military government . Such are my present melancholy dreams ; sleeping or waking , they are about my bed , and about my path , speaking most literally ; for since this devil incarnate rose again from the dead , I have known no comfortable day . " - Vol . II . pp. 246- 248. // The battle of Waterloo relieved Mr. Homer from one perplexity only to throw him into another . The war was over , but Napoleon gave himself up to the English , declaring that he had terminated his political career , and that he came , like Themistocles , to seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to claim the protection of its laws ; and Mr. Homer could not see , under these circumstances , how it was either just or magnanimous to send " this devil incarnate " as a prisoner for life to St. Helena . Nearly all England , it is tine , ratified this conduct of its government by acclamation ; and the unanimity of opinion did not allow the subject to come up for debate , or even for a division , in Parliament , so that Mr. Homer had no opportunity to express his dissent . But he communicated his scruples to his friends , among others to Mr. Hallam , and was good-naturedly scolded by him for being so wrong-headed . The termination of Mr. Homer 's own career was at hand . As early as June , 1816 , we find him writing to his father that he was " a little plagued with a cough , in which there is nothing at all material , except the circumstance of its continuing so long , which , I think , is owing to the cold weather . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered him to give up public speaking , to suspend a ' ) professional engagements , and to pass the ensuing winter in a warmer climate . Then appeared the strength of the attachment which bound his friends to him . Inquiries and expressions of sympathy came from all quarters ; and as he was especially reluctant to leave England , Lord and Lady Holland invited him to take a suit of rooms at their house , where he might live all the winter within doors , and be tended by her Ladyship as carefully as by a mother . But this course was not held by the physicians to be expedient , and Mr. Homer went to Italy to die . He expired at Pisa , on the 8th of February , 1817 , and was buried in the Protestant cemetery at Leghorn . We ought not to close without expressing our thanks to the American publishers , for the liberality and good taste which they have evinced in this very handsome reprint of an excellent work . It is decidedly superior to the English edition , not only on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in its mechanical style and execution . Hitherto , the superiority of an English to an American book , in point of paper and typography , has been taken for granted ; but the recent publications of the firm to which we are indebted for the Memoirs of Homer go far towards justifying a reversal of this opinion .
