CAREY , of Philadelphia . Published in the Boston Daily Advertiser . 1857-8 . IN times of epidemic , there is no lack of physicians or of remedies , which are regarded with admiring faith by their inventors . The recent commercial disasters have naturally produced numerous speculations respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurrence . The pamphlets and documents enumerated above furnish a fair specimen of these , and if they do not altogether illuminate a notoriously misty subj ect , they at least supply useful correctives to one another . Thus the Banking Superintendent eulogizes , with characteristic ardor , the secured ' currency of New York , possessing a strength with the public beyond any in the world , ' and only grieves that any portion of it , however redundant , was suffered to be redeemed . The President endorses the principle of security , ' but remarks with quiet sagacity , that it may be so abused as to make the whole public debt of the country the basis for inconvertible issues of paper . The same illustrious functionary , in company with Mr. Amasa Walker // and a Merchant of Boston , ' condemns in no measured terms the whole system of paper money in general , and the issue of small notes'in particular ; - on which Mr. Carey most inconveniently remarks , that the banks which first snspended payment , and whose suspension continued longest , were precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He might have added , that those most entirely unrestricted in their issues were not in fact compelled to suspend at all , and that the worst explosions and most utter destruction occurred where no notes were issued ! No wonder that a puzzled public , after many vain attempts to reconcile conflicting theories and stubborn facts , should at last be disposed to relinquish all hope of understanding , or satisfactorily adjusting , this vexed question . Practically , indeed , it can never be so adjusted , for no system can be perfect in its results , which is worked by imperfect beings . But it is something if we can disentangle the subject from the meshes of one-sided theory , and by a simple process of analysis point out where the difficulties lie , which we can not hope entirely to remove . At the risk of adding one more to the numerous failures of the last few months , we propose to offer our contribution towards this desirable result . The principal theories claiming our attention are two . The first , expounded and ably defended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merchant of Boston , ' takes the ground that all the inflation of prices and extravagance of speculation to which they ascribe our commercial revulsions , are directly caused by the issue of paper money . Their logical process is a brief and simple one . The prices of commodities in any given community being determined by the quantity of circulating medium in that community for which they can he exchanged , it is evident that by multiplying the currency fivefold or ten-fold , the nominal prices of commodities must be enhanced to the same extent . But as we have in circulation five or ten dollars of paper to one of specie , the conclusion is inevitable that we are really paying five or ten times as much nominal value for all our purchases , as if we enjoyed the blessings of a hard currency . ' No wonder that such a state of // thin gs invites incessant and excessive importations from more favored countries , where the circulation of paper being partially restricted , prices are only two hundred or three hundred per cent . above par , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national bankruptcy , more or less frequent and complete , is the invariable result . To this view it is objected that as our bank notes are , like those of other nations , exchangeable on demand for specie , they can not fall lower , or remain longer below the specie level , than the delay and expense of making the exchange may require . But this objection is met by another special theory , that though specie per se may retain its value , specie in a mixed currency must necessarily fall to the level of that currency , taken as a whole , and thus become ( in a sense ) itself depreciated-as powerless to elevate the paper money with which it is associated and mingled , as the pieces of ice which remain floating in a vessel of heated water , are powerless to restore its temperature to the freezing point . The first exception which common sense must take to this argument , is that it proves too much . If one half the effect were produced by our bank issues which is here ascribed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six consecutive months . But secondly , this theory is utterly inconsistent with facts . The last few months have witnessed perhaps the greatest and most sudden contraction of our circulating medium that has ever been known . The amount of specie in the banks of our principal commercial centres , has largely exceeded their total issues of paper-yet the prices of some commodities which have not been in excess of the actual wants of the community , have remained perfectly steady . Where there was an over supply , prices would ultimately have fallen under any ordinary conditions of currency , though an excess of circulating medium might have retarded the process . The truth is , there is munch delusion respecting this matter of currency or money . ' Gold and silver are unquestionably the only real money we possess ; but it is a great mistake to suppose that they can be made to take the place of a paper currency , in any highly civilized community . The days are // past when silver dollars and golden guineas were hoarded in countless strong boxes , or old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the enlightened , peaceful and happy denizens of Bengal and China . We have learned to consider these irresponsible banks ' which excite the dread and abhorrence of our chief magistrate , as on the whole the safest , and certainly the most convenient receptacles for our spare cash . We have no desire to make of every rich man 's town or country residence a tempting bait for the crew of distinguished highwaymen ' who formerly infested both our mother country and her colonies . If a momentary panic or a foolish impulse leads us now and then to withdraw a few hundreds or thousands from their quiet resting place , we can not sleep in peace till they are again out of our hands , and restored to the bank vault out of which they were taken . If , then , we could stop the circulation of bank notes all over the country , our money would still be deposited in banks , excepting such small amounts as we could conveniently and safely keep in our purses . But would that prevent the circulation of paper ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented by checks or bank credits , and payments would be made in these , as they now are in bank notes. * The truth is , that in a civilized community all merchandise not needed for immediate wants , will naturally become concentrated in depots at the most convenient points for distribution and replenishment . The advantages of such an arrangement in protecting the public both from plethora and scarcity , are too obvious to need explanation . In the case of money , which is not consumed like other merchandise , but may return again and again to the point whence it was issued , it is plainly desirable to have the concentration as great , and the alternate movement as restricted as possible . This is accomplished by substituting for it , both in domestic and foreign exchanges , the * It is not many years since the ladies of Paris were obliged to go shopping with large bags of silver crowns , and within a still less period we have known a horse and sledge necessary to convey a thousand pounds in hard currency , ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments of the morrow in regions temporarily relieved from the curse of banks and bank notes . // pro*nise* of individuals and corporations , which may fulfill the same office with much less risk and expense , provided they are both trusted and trustworthy . It is evidently much more convenient for an eastern merchant to send bank bills to the west to purchase corn , arid for these bills to be returned in payment for eastern manufactures , than for large amounts of gold to be traveling backward and forward , exposed to the innumerable chances of river and lake , steamboat and locomotive , to say nothing of thieves and robbers . The same principle of economy applies to checks , drafts , and all the complicated machinery of exchange , which , though possessing only a promissory or representative value in themselves , do really perform to a great extent , the functions of currency . It will not be pretended that all these forms of credit may not as readily be abused as bank notes , and it is certain that they would not do the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now done . Yet it is equally certain that if bank notes were abolished , their circulation would be to a great extent replaced by similar contrivances . This is shown by the uniform practice of all banks and bankers where the issue of notes is restricted , as in New York and London , where checks , drafts , promissory notes and balances of account do in fact supply to a large extent the deficiency of a paper medium , such as our banks possess . If therefore a mixed currency ' is necessarily a depreciated currency , we might fairly argue that the same depreciation must be produced by any other machinery for economizing and facilitating exchanges , whether by checks , drafts , or bank credits . And as such a machinery exists in all the principal countries of the civilized world , and is indispensable to the wants of an extended commerce , we might console ourselves by the hope that all are depreciated alike , and that we may be no worse off than our neighbors . But here , we apprehend , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes of domestic circulation , a paper currency of undoubted credit , is in fact precisely equivalent to the real money for which it is exchangeable . So long therefore , as it is confined to domestic circulation , and restricted to the actual demands of that circulation ; - in other words , so long // as it is not more abundant than specie would be , if specie were equally portable and convenient , there can be no inflation , and prices can not be affected by it . Suppose now the volume of currency to be augmented either by an influx of specie , or by further issues of notes . IJ there be no outlet , prices must rise , unless the angmentation of currency be only sufficient to counterbalance the waste of circulating medium , or the demands of increasing population and commerce . But if there be an outlet , the demand for foreign merchandise , and the consequent exportation of specie , will soon reduce the currency to its former level , perhaps below it , and a fall in prices will soon restore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all , and it is not always an agreeable one ; *but its operation is as certain as that of any other natural law , and it is as impossible for any modern community ( without the aid of a protective tariff ) to keep up a permanent inflation of currency , as it would be to cause our great lakes to overflow without damming up the St. Lawrence . By way of illustration , let us suppose all the paper-money in New England annihilated , and its place supplied by a metallic currency of ( say ) thirty . millions of dollars . Suppose further , that for convenience and economy ( as was actually done in Russia in 1842 ) the whole of this sum should be deposited in safe hands , and replaced in circulation by certificates payable on demand . So long as this deposit of specie remained untouched , and the certificates possessed entire credit , it is clear to demonstration , that the volume of currency remaining the same , and its exchangeable value the same , no effect could possibly be produced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guardiaft of the treasure , finding that in the course of years not a single certificate was presented for payment , and that the quantity of specie in the community continued to augment , should conceive the idea of lending it on interest to a foreign government ( as was also done in Russia ) or of exporting it to pay for certain foreign commodities , which he could sell here at a profit . If the credit of his certificates continued undoubted , the direct and immediate effect of the operation upon our currency and prices would // evidently be nothing , unless the importation of goods should tend to lower the of similar o'oods . The effect on the prices currency of the foreign country to which our specie was exported , would of course be to increase its circulating inediumby thirty millions of dollars , and either ( under a protective tariff ) cause a permanent rise of prices , or lead to an increase of unportations from other countries , until by the operation of the inevitable laws of trade , the supply of precious metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tastes and the habits of each . Ultimately , the wave would reach our own shores , but with so gentle an undulation as to be scarcely perceptible . In other words , our thirty millions of coin would have been replaced in domestic circulation by an exact equivalent of credit , and the effect of the exchange upon prices would have been simply the very moderate proportion which its amount might bear to the currency of the whole commercial world . Now between this supposed state of things and the real process which is continually going on among us , there is but a single intermediate step . Instead of sending abroad for themselves the specie confided to their care , our banks lend it to the merchants , who send it abroad . So long as the bank certificates possess undoubted credit , and are not issued in a larger quantity than our domestic exchanges require , their * ) ay1nent is not called for , and the specie received in exchange for them can be loaned with safety . If tki8 8pecie continued in do ? ne8-tic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory we are discussing , ) the effect upon prices would doubtless be such as our buhlionists suppose . But this is notoriously not the case . It is exported as fast as it is received , and the volume of currency remains substantially the same , with no more serious fluctuations than would occur in a lake receiving at one end a river of very irregular bulk and volume , and discharging at the other end the average contents of the same river , with a more steady and equal flow . It seems , therefore , to be mathematically demonstrable that so long as the issues of paper money arc kept within the limit of what is actually required for domestic exchanges , they can // produce no inflation ; and that when by over-issues such inflation is produced , it is immediately rectified by the exportation of specie , unless this is prevented by a protective tariff , or by a suspension of specie payments . The idea that a permanent surplus of paper money can be kept in circulation by banks , is both theoretically and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there can be no permanent inflation of prices , except what is common to the whole commercial world . But there is another view in which paper money ( always within the limits defined above ) would appear to possess in certain cases a positive advantage over gold and silver , namely , that it can not be exported . There are occasional crises in the financial history of every nation , when the tide of exchange turns so rapidly against it , that a large portion of the specie in circulation is at once gathered up for export . The scarcity thus produced begets panic , which in turn aggravates the scarcity , and both panic and scarcity are usually in inverse proportion to the elasticity of the circulating medium . Such was the crisis of 1825 , cited by a Boston Merchant , ' when nothing but the discovery of a box of one pound notes saved the Bank of England from insolvency . Similar , but less critical instances occurred in 1847 and 1857 , when special issues of notes were made by the same bank with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic exchanges of England being more copiously supplied with the needful medium , a larger amount of real money became available to meet the demands of foreign exchange . Here , however , we are met by the objection , that as every dollar of specie among us represents five or ten dollars of paper , the latter must be called in as the former is exported , in the ratio of five or ten to one , or the banks can not remain solvent ; and that the pressure of such a contraction must necessarily far exceed that caused by any possible diminution of a purely metallic currency . Undoubtedly , if this were the case ;  --  but here , we apprehend , is another enormous fallacy of the hard currency theory . When the issues of bank paper are limited to the actual demand for domestic exchanges ( and we are no advocates of any other ) the proportion of those // issues to the amount of specie in the vaults of banks is utterly irrelevant to the question of their solvency . By long experience the managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its circulation ; ' ( i. e. the amount of its notes , which are permanently retained for use by the public , ) and with no immediate provision at all for the pay* ment of that amount , they are really safer than with one dollar in specie for every two or three of a mere temporary circulation . It is but fair also to remark , that the assertions above referred to , are in general grossly exaggerated . A large part of the circulation ' thus unfairly adduced in evidence , consists merely of notes representing the daily payments and transfers from bank to bank , which mutually cancel each other , and are in no proper sense circulation at all . To illustrate our meaning , let us suppose a bank with a temporary circulation of a million , and with only $200,000 in specie . According to the theory we are considering , the withdrawal of half the latter amount , by the redemption of one tenth of the circulation , would necessitate the immediate contraction of the currency by $400,000 more , producing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this so-callA circulation represents merely payments into other banks , against which our bank holds $700,000 of their notes . At the settlement it receives the balance , $100,000 , in specie , thus restoring the whole amount withdrawn , and leaving it with two dollars in specie for every three of circulation , or supposing only $100,000 of the latter permanent , it will have dollar for dollar to redeem the residue . It is plain , therefore , that any argument based on the proportion of specie to circulation , as at present reported in bank tables , must be utterly irrelevant . We are far from asserting that the issues of paper money are properly regulated or restricted , but we think we have clearly shown that the charges made against paper money a such , can not be substantiated . Instead , therefore , of agreeing in the comparison of a Boston Merchant , ' who likens it to the unsubstantial barns and sheds which can not protect the farmer 's property , we would rather compare it to the neat and convenielit china and plated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly and cumbrous gold and silver plate which locks up capital that might be more usefully employed , and which must itself be locked up from the cupidity of thieves and the treachery of servants , while in times of pecuniary difficulty it may be seized by the sheriff 's officer , and leave the unlucky host and his household without a circulating medi-unL ' * Having thus disposed of the mixed currency ' theory , we must devote a few words to the opposite hypothesis , which attributes all our troubles to free trade , and advocates a protective tariff as the only remedy . This position has recently been re-asserted with much ingenuity and marvelous industry by Mr. Henry C. Carey , in a long series of letters to the President . We can not undertake to follow him through the long and discursive exposition of his econonmical creed , and this is not the place to re-open a question which has been already practically settled by the nation . The dispute is in fact interminable , for while few are bold enough to advocate either absolute prohibition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made to agree precisely upon the intermediate point where legitimate protection ends , and where foreign competition may safely be allowed to begin . As in politics , one party is perpetually deprecating the centralization of power , while its opponents are equally in fear of popular license , so we have one set of political economists incessantly pointing to the ruinous effects of indiscriminate importations , while another set no less eagerly maintain the right of the people to purchase where they can buy cheapest , whether at home or abroad . Mr. Carey 's theory of protection is apparently of the most stringent kind . He would have everything shut out from abroad which can be made at home , by whatever sacrifice of domestic capital and labor , and he confidently asserts that whenever the central government of this country has moved in one direction , * A Merchant of Boston ' refers to the great depreciation in the notes of the Bank of England , after the suspension of 1797 ; but he omits to mention that for a considerable period after that suspension , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged , they remained on apar with specie . ( See the report of the first bullion committee , drawn up by Francis Homer. ) // ( that of a high tariff , ) prosperity has abounded , while " in every case in which it has moved in an opposite direction , ( that of free trade , ) the reverse effects have been produced . " The general law developed by such results , he announces as follows : " Under the system which looks to bringing together the producer and the consumer , the community increases in strength , wealth , and power ; whereas , under that which looks to separating the consumer and producer , and is known as free trade , it declines in all ,  --  becoming daily poorer , weaker , and more dependent . " We have hitherto supposed that consumers and producers do contrive to come together without legislative assistance ,  --  but Mr. Carey 's meaning will become more evident as we proceed . His next postulate is , that a steady rise in the prices of raw materials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles , are an unerring test of advancing civilization . Having then proved to his own satisfaction , that the prices of raw materials have been steadily declining atnong us for many years past , the syllogism is complete , and the deduction inevitable , that we are in the high road to barbarism and utter demoralization ! To use his own words , the result is " the cheapening of the raw products of the earth , the establishment of the supremacy of trade ; and the reduction of man to the condition of a mere instrument , to be used by the trader ,  --  or , in other words , to that of a slave ! " Of course the only remedy is a protective tariff , to shut out from us the hated influx of foreign goods , and to bring together the consumer and producer , ' by compelling the starving operatives of Europe to emigrate to our shores , and to earn and purchase in our midst the food which constitutes the raw material of labor . ' To such assertions and arguments we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our national progress has been stopped , our prosperity turned to ruin , and our civilization to barbarism , by the magic operation of diminished duties on imports-first , because the thing is essentially absurd , and secondly , because the evils , so far as they exist , are abundantly accounted for by other and more intelligible causes . It is not true that the difference of a few days ' sail , more or less , // between consuwier and producer , involves the difference between benefit and injury ; or that while the consumption of our raw material at Lowell and Lawrence is a good to be encouraged , the export of the same material to Manchester and IRonen is an evil to be repressed . It is not true that in a country possessing an unlimited supply of cheap and fertile land , the cheapness of raw material is a curse rather than a blessingneither is it true that Adam Smith , *r any other political economist in his senses , ever denounced the cheapness of food as an evil in itself . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to view a picture of peaceful and quiet progress such as the world had , theretofore , never seen . " On the contrary , the train was even then being laid for those gigantic financial explosions which have recently astonished and disgraced New England . It is not even true , ( though if true , it would be no subject for regret , ) that since 1846 the prices of food and other raw materials ' have been steadily declining . On the contrary , their production has been so profitable as to excite a fever of speculation all over the country , and to raise the prices of land and labor to an unreasonable point , from which a violent crisis has been required to dislodge them . It is not true that under a prohibitory tariff the prices of raw material were steadily augmented-for under the full influence of the tariff of 1842 , the price of cotton fell in 1844-5 far below the lowest point lately reached after ten years of what Mr. Carey calls free trade , and under the pressure of the severest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not true-it is utterly contrary to truth-that " with us men are almost exwerywhere flying from each other as if from pestilence-the enormous emnigrations of Europe being here reproduced , and affording conclusive evidence of decline in wealth , strength , and power . " Mr. Carey 's ideal of economical perfection appears to be free trade among ourselves and prohibition to the rest of the world . Why free trade should be turned from a blessing into a curse when extended beyond certain arbitrary limits , he does not explain . And if it be such an advantage to Georgia and South Carolina to have their raw material worked up in Massachu // setts , rather than in England , would not their advantage be still greater to work it up at home ? If our southern friends must relinquish to abolitionists the pleasure and profit of manufacturing their cotton , might not Old England have the preference over New England ? Where shall we draw the geographical line which neither consumer nor producer shall pass ?  --  or fix the point up to which the free exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its result is slavery and mm ? Mr. Carey is particularly indignant that so many of our people are employed in scratching up the soil and selling it ' in the shape of food , cotton , and tobacco . He would have all this changed . Our coal mines , our iron mines , should be developed - manufactures of all sorts should be stimulated , and in short all the various phases of European life and industry should be transferred to our midst . Now , with all deference to his opinion , we venture to think that Divine Providence has arranged all this better than lie could have done it . The Creator evidently did not intend the New World to exist in selfish isolation from the Old . So long as our soil is abundant and fertile , there is no reason why it should not be scratched out in the form of food , ' and its surplus produce exported to feed the hungry artisans of Europe . Our almost boundless deposits of coal and iron ' will be wanted soon enough  --  and we have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future wants of an almost countless population . By the time our soil is exhausted , the means of fertilizing it will be at hand ; and the tendency of population to increase and multiply over it , needs no assistance from the artificial stimulus of legislation . But we can not tax the patience of our readers to follow Mr. Carey any further in his speculations-still less can we undertake to refute 8erutt't ? Th the numerous misstatements and erroneous conclusions ( as we esteem them ) with which his letters abound . On one point , however , ( and that an essential one in the present discussion , ) he is undoubtedly right . A prohibitive tariff must check the exportation of the precious metals , and therefore must make money abundant and in a great degree // prevent those financial crises which arise from foreign indebtedness . This has been very clearly exemplified in the recent conjuncture . The Bank of England , in a state of perfect financial sonndness , and managed with the utmost prudence , was nearly wrecked by free trade with America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans inflated to the utmost , so as only to maintain its ( nominal ) specie payments by incessant borrowing from abroad , yet when compelled to adopt a more prudent system of management , was in a few weeks entirely relieved by the natural operation of the balance of trade . ' There are other countries of Europe so hopelessly bankrupt that they could not sustain even a modified free trade for a few months , yet which are enabled by high protective duties to keep their rotten currency nominally at par with that of their neighbors , and often at so high a premium as to lead to considerable importations of specie . So far , then , we agree with the advocates of protection ; and it is undoubtedly desirable that the duties levied on imports for the purposes of revenue , should be so adjusted as to afford the greatest aid arid encouragement to our own manufactures . But the protection advocated by Mr. Carey , as we have seen , is quite another affair , and appears to aim at nothing short of excluding all merchandise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such merchandise are now enormous , the effect of the change would of course be a complete derangemnent of the balance of trade . Probably all the gold shipped from California would remain permanently in the country , and its volume would be augmented by frequent shipments from Europe , to pay for the cotton and bread stuffs which Europe would still be compelled to consume . The enormous increase of circulating medium would produce a rapid and steady advance in prices ; and 80 long a the demand for labor exceeded the 8upply ( which might be the case for many years ) the rate of wages would at least partly keep pace with this advance , and the nation might to all appearance present to view a picture of peaceful and quiet progress , ' &amp;c. , &amp;c . Capital would be rapidly growing at the expense oJ labor ; and so long as both capital and labor could be profitably // employed , there would be no apparent check to the general prosperity . But when cotton and woolen mills and ironfoundries had been multiplied beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom our prosperity had attracted to our shores could no longer find profitable employment , what could we do but recommence that scratching up of the soil ' for which Mr. Carey has such a profound abhorrence ? In other words , we should be just where we are now , but with a vastly larger and more unmanageable *opulation , and less room to bestow it in . The higher the scale of protection , ' the more rapidly would this point be reached . Meantime the vast profits of protected and accumulated capital and the plethora of money , would encourage private and public extravagance , and a moneyed aristocracy would speedily become permanently established among us . The gulf between rich and poor would widen rapidly ; the former would gradually become sole possessors of the land , and the latter would be at their mercy . The eternal war between capital and labor would be commenced and prolonged till government tottered on its base , and the very foundations of social order were shaken . This is no fancy picture-it is substantially the history of England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that career of protected'industry and that dangerous accumulation of capital , which made her the envy of Europe , but which even she has not had the hardihood to pursue to its unmitigated result . Let it never be forgotten that large accumulations of wealth in few hands are inimical to the very existence of a republic . Even the general and reckless squandering of our resources for which we are justly reproached , may work less permanent mischief than would the same amount of wealth accumulated and permanently distributed among a small class of the community . Our conclusion then is , that the proposed remedy is worse than the disease . If the balance of trade is against us , we can spare enough of foreign luxuries in any given year to restore the equilibrium , and to enable us to retain in addition as much specie as the wants of commerce and the safety of our currency may require . More than this , in a financial point of view , would never be needed . But if it were in our power to // do more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we would not thus anticipate the designs of Providence , or prematurely stimulate and exhaust the resources which we hold in trust for countless future generations . We would not build an artificial wall of separation between our plenteous harvests and the starving multitudes of Europe ; nor will we refuse to let them purchase food by furnishing at least a part of our comforts and luxuries , while we are permitted to expatiate in the broad field of agriculture , which they ( how different froni Mr. Carey ) regard as the highest and noblest of callings . We have no desire , like the magnates of the middle ages , to compel the poor operative to build up a castle , by means of which we may hereafter domineer over and enslave him . We see no advantage in flooding our land with gold and silver by raising artificial barriers to their exportation , and thus enhancing prices and encouraging speculation and extravagance in every form . In a word , we wish to protect chiefly the laborer and consumer , knowing that the capitalist is both able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed of the two theories most prominently brought forward to account for our commercThi troubles , the quest*on recurs , what is the cause of those troubles , and what remedy can be applied ? In a former Article on this subject , * we briefly answered this question , and our opinion remains unchanged . The cause has been , in one word , the a*ntse of credit , and the remedy , in one word , is , to limit credit to its legitimate we . Undoubtedly this is but a vague conclusion , and the various panaceas of hard currency , ' abolition of small notes , ' general bankrupt law , ' and protective tariff , ' may sound much more definite and attractive to an impatient sufferer . So the physician who can only recommend diet , air , exercise , and general moderation , is sure to be deserted for the bold empiric whose nostrums poison while they profess to cure . Like the physician , we can indicate palliatives and prescribe measures of temporary relief ; but if the disease is to be cured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolute cooperation of the patient himself . // To begin with that form of credit which is most open to inspection and amenable to legislation  --  the credit of banks , in the shape both of bank notes and credits . There can be no doubt that in both these forms it has been shamefully abused , and the abuse has done the more mischief because to avoid general distrust the stronger banks have been compelled to divert to the aid of the weaker those resources which were greatly needed and fairly due in other quarters . Let us now inquire what can be done to diminish these dangers for the future . First , if the paper currency of a country is to be strictly equivalent to gold and silver , it must not only be payable in those metals on demand , but it must possess the entire and steady confidence of the commnnity , that its volume may not be suddenly contracted , ( as happened last year at the West , ) and it must never exceed the amount of sJ*ecie which would circulate in its place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course fall short of that amount , as much as the convenience of time public may permit , but it can not permanently exceed it without depreciation . In European countries , with large central banks , these conditions can easily be secured ; and the charter of the Bank of England accomplishes the object to perfuction , by allowing the issue of only a certain fixed amount of notes , ( *l4 , OOO , OOO , ) which had been previously ascertained to be far below th' minimum circulation of the country . These notes are made a legal tender , ( though payable at the Bank and its branches in gold , ) and are guaranteed by the whole credit of the nation , being secured by a perumanent deposit of governmnent stocks to their full amount . The remainder of the circulating medium ( excepting a small proportion of notes of long established country banks ) is composed entirely of gold and silver , or of notes issued against actual deposits of gold and silver ; and as the demands of trade call for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in circulation or in reserve composes undoubtedly by far the larger half of the currency . Our own country is young and not yet rich in those permamuent forms of wealth which are the result of long accu // mulation ; and what eapital we have , we are usually disposed to employ more profitably than by keeping it idle in bank vaults . Accordingly , instead of being reduced far within the limit indicated above , our paper currency is too often made by various expedients , to press upon and even temporarily to pass far beyond it . Its very convertibility is thns frequently endangered-and too often the solvency of banks is secured only by the mm of merchants . Of course , such a currency can not enjoy that universal and unvarying confidence which is essential to the proper fulfillment of its functions ; and it is thus found to be wanting in all the indispensable conditions of a sound circulating medium . For all this there can be no perfect remedy without centralization . Nothing short of a United States Treasury or Bank of Issue can determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which the issue of notes ought never to exceed . No less central institution can possess the confidence of the entire country , and nothing less than the machinery and res&amp;urces of the general government can ensure universal convertibility . It is with deep regret that we feel compelled to add , what has long since been practically decided by the country , that no set of partisan politicians can safely be charged with such a momentous trust . But why should not New York and New England at least provide for their own population a currency worthy of their high commercial character ? The paper money of New York possesses two advantages , that of being in theory restricted to the permanent circulation required by the community , ( i. e. it is not usually made the medium of bank transfers and of large payments , as it is in New England , ) ' and that of being secnred to some extent by deposits of public stocks . It has also three glaring defects : the want of centralization , the want of any practical check upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redemption at a discount at the great centres of trade  --  the only places where it needs to be redeemed at all . Of the three essential conditions we have specified , it possesses therefore but one , the confidence of the community , and of this it certainly appears to have quite enough . But it is nem // ther strictly convertible into specie , nor is it in any way restricted in volume to the amount to which a specie currency would be restricted by the natural laws of trade . On the contrary , the privilege of redemption at a discount is a direct and most unwise premium on over-issues . Now the single element of centralization would at once rectify all these defects . It would of course involve par redemption at the commercial centre-it would speedily reduce the issues of paper to the safe limit of domestic , or at least of permanent circulation-  --  and though it could not well increase , it need not diminish and might warrant and justify the enthusiastic attachment shown it by the citizens of our sister state . Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central department at New York city might furnish all the notes required by all the banks of the state , against deposits partly of stocks , and partly ( say one third ) of specie , and might be charged with the par redemption of all the notes issued . The statistics of this department would speedily show what is the minimum of a safe paper circulation , and the total issues could be kept below that amount , either by a positive limit , as in England , or by requiring the banks to deposit a larger proportion of specie against the notes they receive . The paper issues of New England banks are not secured by deposits of stocks , and the legal limits to their amount are by no means narrow . A currency so elastic may prove the best or the worst possible , according to its management ; and it reflects no small credit upon that management , that throughout the whole of the unexampled pressure and panic of 1857 , the immense majority of the banks of New England not only continued to enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a par with specie , ( though compelled by the insolvency of New York temporarily to suspend specie payments , ) but were able to keep up their loans with comparative steadiness , and thus preserve the commercial community from the titter disorganization which prevailed elsewhere . It is well known that the banks of New Haven and a few others continued to pay specie at least one day after those of the commercial centres had stopped , and it // is certain that at the moment of suspension in New York , those of Boston were daily gaining strength , and would not have suspended , had New York remained solvent . To this satisfactory state of things there were , however , numerous exceptions , particularly among the country banks , and in many cases the cause was a redundant issue of paper . Large amounts of New England country bank notes had been loaned for the purposes of circulation at the west , and the progress of panic brought them suddenly home for redemption . The Suffolk system ' by interposing the wealth and credit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to weather the storm which they could not singly have resisted for a moment ; but this temporary diversion of bank capital and credit from its legitimate employment at such a crisis of extreme need , could not fail greatly to aggravate the distress of the mercantile community . If , however , the bank currency of New England possessed in 1857 the entire confidence of the people of New England , if it continued convertible until the example of New York compelled a temporary suspension-if when ( without preliminary notice ) the New York banks suddenly resumed payment , those of New England instantly followed  --  and if during the whole period of forced suspension , their notes continued substantially at par with specie , what was their weak point ? Evidently the same ( though in another form ) as that of New York -- tlte want of centralization . Had their whole issues been made from one common centre , with all the checks , guards , and guarantees which might so easily be thrown around them , does any one suppose they would have been returned as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the great West would thankfully have received still larger amounts ( of which it stood in grievous need ) in exchange for the produce which lay helplessly stagnant in its barns and store-houses , instead of returning in a panic what it held , and reducing itself to the primitive condition of living by barter . But how is this centralization to be accomplished ? Not by a crusade against existing banks , but by an organization which it shall be the interest of all to promote . The Suffolk system ' // works admirably to enforce the redemption of surplus issues , but it can not control the issues themselves , and it can not create entire confidence in distant states towards petty and unknown country banks . To accomplish filly this object it seems essential to have one central bank of issue ( suppose a Bank of New England ' ) established in Boston , our commercial centre , with an agency of par redemption at New York . Such a bank must be chartered by Massachusetts , but all New England l ) anks should share in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive and pay out its notes on a par with specie , and have the privilege of its gratuitous agency at the centres of trade . Its capital might be paid iii , partly in specie and partly in approved stocks ; and each subscribing bank might receive in return for each installment an equal amount of the notes of the new bank , which it need not of course be obliged to redeem in specie . The Bank of New England might receive deposits , but should be allowed to discount only for its stockholders , the local banks , and thus relieve the teinporary pressures to which small banks are so liable , and which are apt to disturb the community far beyond the proportion of their real importance . Its issues should be jealously restricted by compelling it to retain , over and above its deposits of stocks , specie to the amount of one third or even one half of its circulation and deposits . Many further details of constitution and management might be suggested , but this is not the place for them . Our object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish not only New England , but many other parts of the country , with a more perfect , secure , and undoubted paper currency than they have known for many years . It will be seen at once that such a currency would possess in perfection the three characteristics we have assumed as essential . It would enjoy unbounded credit , not only here , but everywhere . The facility of par redemption in specie would be complete ; and the issues of notes wQnld be kept far below the minimum of domestic circulation . Being prohibited from discounting for the public , the bank could not compete with other banks , but would only aid and sustain them . Its accumulation of coin would gradually become so large as to render // us independent of New York , in case of another suspension there . Its transactions should all be open to public scrutiny , and its weekly statements would for us rival in interest those of its European prototype . Its government should be strictly democratic , carefully guarded against favoritism and sectionalism , and subject to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We believe there is enough of skill , integrity , and public spirit in New England to make such an organization the pride and bulwark of our commercial community . But returning to the existing system , we may remark that the proposed svppres8ion of 8mall note8 , though it may produce no greater harm than inconvenience , can hardly accoinplish much good . If such notes can more readily be forced into distant circulation , to be returned when the bank that issued is least able to redeem them , their suppression is so far desirable ; but where they possess a legitimate domestic circulation , they are precisely the least likely to be so returned , ( for few in the community are without some such notes in their possession , ) and therefore they constitute the form of bank credit which can most safely be relied on to sustain it in a time of pressure , just as the merchant is less likely to be called on at sucl* times to repay his tens and hundreds than his thousands . If paper money be an evilper *e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the most desirable to suppress ; but if the contrary is the case , no valid reason can be given for suppressing small notes , though much may be said against the present mode of issuing them . Keeping in mind the distinction already pointed out between temporary and permanent bank issues , it is evident that no fixed proportion can be established between the amount of a bank 's circulation , as at present reported , and the amount of specie which prudence may require it to hold . The proportion of the latter to its permanent circulation may be less than one dollar to ten , with much less danger than a ratio of one in three would indicate when the circulation was chiefly of a temporary character . The more the circulation of any bank exceeds the average , tIme larger must be the proportion of spe // cie to notes , or the weaker will be its position . A bank with a minimum circulation of $100,000 , might really be safer with only $10,000 in specie than with ten times that amount and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teniporary , though in the former case it had but one dollar of gold to ten of notes , and in the latter , one to two ; unless in the latter case it also held ( as it probably would ) the notes of other banks as an offset to its own . Our conclusion then is , that large notes form as convenient a medium of bank transfers as book accounts , and that small notes of well managed and generally trusted banks are a peculiarly usefully form of local currency . When issued by small banks in large amounts , they are a great evil and a great danger ; but this evil and danger we think , can be best avoided , not by suppressing small notes , but by substituting for all general and distant circulation a centralized currency such as we have indicated , which would inevitably replace the issues of local banks , except in their legitimate local spheres of circulation . These last might then be safely and properly limited to fifty per cent . of their capital . 2 . We come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite as liable to abuse as any , and in most cases at least , as dangerous as that based on circulation . Here again , a broad distinction must be drawn between the permanent and the temporary deposits of a bank . The former represent the minimum amount which its depositors are accustomed to leave in its charge , as a remuneration for the trouble , expense , and risk of collecting , keeping and paying out their funds . This amount , like the permanent circulation of a bank , may be safely reckoned as an addition to its available capital , and loaned with perfect safety . All above it is fluctuating , and can not be relied on ; and the proportion of specie requisite to meet the demands upon it ( as in the case of temporary circulation ) must increase in a kind of geometrical ratio to the increase of the deposits themselves . Practically , however , a satisfactory sliding scale ' of this kind , to regulate the varying proportion of specie to deposits and circulation , would seem almost unattainable ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unfairly . Perhaps the simplest mode of cutting the knot would be , to limit the loans of all banks to 150 , and their circulation to 50 per cent . of their capital , and to abrogate all bank taxes , except on circulation , the profit on which being created by the state , may fairly be shared by it , by means of an annual tax of 3 per cent. , as recommended by Mr. Nathan Appleton , in an excellent pamphlet lately republished . But though munch may undoubtedly be done to improve our present system , both of currency and banking , let us not forget that no system will work well unless wisely and prudently managed , amid that the worst system so managed may work as well as the best . What we need most of all , therefore , is to cultivate in our community that spirit of caution and conservatism , which , though it have no law , is a law unto itself . A little reflection will show that the abuse of mercantile credit has done far more mischief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved ultimately insolvent , if their loans had been sound ? We have already endeavored to refute the fallacy ( as we esteem . it ) that the inflation of prices to which we are unquestionably liable , is the result of a mixed currency . The cause of this inflation , when it occurs , we believe to be the abu8e of credit , whether of banks , individuals , firms , corporations , or communities . Usually these all go together , as we have seen them do of late . But what i8 an abuse of credit ? It is evident that all credit can not be an abuse . If none but rich capitalists , who can buy for cash , were permitted to purchase , manufacture , and supply the commodities needed all over the world , the world would fare'very badly-for such men would not be very likely to give themselves much trouble to provide for its wants . But they may lend to trustworthy and hard-working men the necessary funds for this purpose , and in some form share their profits  --  and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What the merchant , thus assisted , buys for cash , he may transfer to another who supplies by retail a whole neighborhood , and receives his pay as the annual produce of the earth enables the farmer , the la // borer , and all the various classes of society , to reimburse him . The retail merchant is not often a large capitalist , and the six months ' credit allowed him to sell his goods and collect his debts , is again a necessary and legitimate use of credit . By degrees , as the division of labor increases and society becomes more complex , the banker , the ship owner , the importer , the manufacturer , the jobber , all find their place in the great social machine , and a certain portion of credit , aided and guaranteed by capital , is necessary to each . Thus far we suppose no more goods bought , sold , imported , manufactured , or consumed , than the community actually requires and is able to pay for , besides gradually accumulating a reserve of capital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to facilitate production and exchange . The merchant , combined ( perhaps in the same person or firm ) with the banker , has profitably exchanged his ready money for domestic or foreign goods , which he sells on credit to the jobber , the retailer , and the manufacturer-the bank by discounting the promissory notes of the buyer , replaces the capital of the seller , and enables him to repeat his operations in time to meet the recurring wants of the community . The credit of the bank , which enables it to enlarge its capital by means of circulation and deposits , increases its ability thus to mediate between consumer and producer , while it furnishes them with a place of safety for their funds and a convenient medium of exchange . So long as the credit of bank , merchant , and consumer is limited to the actual wants of the community and its ability to supply them , though there may be much convenience , there is no inflation from its use . It is true that if trade were strictly limited to cash transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means invariably ) be reduced ; but this would as truly be a depreciation from the real intrinsic value of commodities , as the opposite course would be inflation . lilt would be in fact a return to the old and barbarous system of barter , instead of the complicated and delicately balanced machinery of exchanges , which , in all civilized countries , has long since supplanted it . The man who had physical strength to carry , and bravery to defend the largest pile of gold and silver , would // go through the country purchasing commodities often at great advantage , and here and there he might even realize the dreams of Mr. Walker , by buying grain of some forlorn and solitary farmer , at a fifth or a tenth of its real value . But we venture to assert that all classes would need but a few weeks ' or months ' experience of the difficulty of exchanging their commodities and guarding their treasures , before the aid of credit was again invoked , and civilization and the division of labor resumed their accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auxiliary to facilitate the operations of commerce , and is made to supply the place of actual capital and thus to create a fictitions demand for labor or the products of labor , the result must be inflation . Not only when large speculative purchases are made for the express object of raising prices , but when large amounts of capital are borrowed for the purpose of purchasing , importing , or manufacturing goods , of building ships or railroads , or constructing great public works , without reference to the wants of the community and its ability to pay for them-when banks and bankers , to increase their loans , stipulate for large deposits and for an artificial circulation of their notes , perpetuated by a virtual refusal of par redemption-when individuals in the community incur debts which they can not pay , and live by borrowing instead of subsisting upon their earnings-in all these and many other ways the great engine of credit is abused to purposes for which it was never made , and under the pressure of which it must sooner or later break down or explode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sails and braces , by which the masts and yards of a ship are so readily handled and so efficiently sustained , but which , unless well secured to mast , yard and ship , are worse than useless , credit , to be safe and harmless , must be based on solid capital . It is often remarked of individuals that they were ruined by their good fortune . In like manner , it will generally be found that extensive public and social calamity has been preceded and probably originated by a sudden influx of wealth . Let us suppose an abundant harvest at home , with a largely deficient one in Europe , new 6ntlets for our own trade , and an // 338 currency , Banlein9 ' , and credit . impending war between the consuming nations and their principal European producer , causing an unprecedented demand for American shipping , already in great request to carry out the abundant produce of our own land , to be sold abroad at enormous profit . Money becomes abundant , for exchanges are in our favor from every quarter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our debtors , and the balances due from them are to us virtually the same as real money . ' Our banks and merchants are called on to advance their capital and credit for the purchase of western produce , and are reimbursed by cash from abroad , with the addition of large amounts of freight and profit . Specie comes in as usual from California , but it does not go out as usual , for the balance of trade is in our favor . This encourages the banks to increase their loans-money , and credit which answers the purpose of money , become more and more abundant - all kinds of merchandise are in demand , and prices rapidly advance . Every one feels himself rich , and many are really so . Thus far there has been no serious delusion , except the common one of supposing that good times will last forever . But this from the very nature of things is impossible . The community , it is true , has been suddenly enriched , chiefly in the persons of the merchants , capitalists , ship-owners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exceptional circumstances of the case . By degrees , however , as our surplus produce becomes exhausted and domestic consumption increased , the stream flows more slowly , till at length prices are equalized and the usual balance of trade is restored . The first unerring indication is the rapidly increasing export of specie ; but this is little heeded , for the accumulation had been large . Meantime the contagion of gain has done its work . Every one who can command or borrow capital , invests it in corn , cotton , a ship or a piece of a ship , ' and all are confident of golden harvests . As the foreign demand diminishes , domestic speculation replaces it , and while credit lasts , prices are maintained . The enriched farmer or merchant naturally increases his expenditure , and there is no lack of ready importers to supply him with the materials of luxury // 3*9 and folly . For banks , bankers , and capitalists generally , there are other temptations , in the shape of railroad bonds , mining shares , and every species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth and unparalleled resources of our country - wealth which has already assumed its wings and is flying away faster than an eagle towards heaven . ' By the time these schemes and speculations are fairly launched beyond recall , the reaction has become too serious to be disregarded . The efflux of specie compels the banks at the sea-board to curtail their loans ; and by this time the tension of credit has become so great that every check is felt throughout the Union . IDown go prices of corn and cotton , freights and ships , and a multitude of fictitious values which had been based upon them . The large profits realized by early good fortune are more than lost by subsequent speculation . Trade languishes , ships ho idle , railroads , completed at enormous cost , fail to pay their expenses , factories stop work , money becomes so scarce that many nierchants and even banks are compelled to suspend payment  --  and in short the circle of expansion and contraction , prosperity and collapse , now so unhappily familiar to us , is completed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? Is it the fruit of a paper currency ? Or is it not rather the result of a general abuse of credit , of which the expansion of the currency is rather an effect than a cause ? To us this seems the true explanation . In the case supposed , ( and it is not altogether a supposed case , ) the banks did not force their notes upon a reluctant public , but issued them only in compliance with the urgent demands of trade , to accomplish a most legitimate movement of produce from those regions where it was redundant and cheap , to distant markets where scarcity and high prices showed that it was wanted . So long as this movement was attended with profit , the credit both of banks and merchants was legitimately employed and richly rewarded . When the equalization of prices and markets rendered its profitable continuance impossible , it was the duty both of banks and merchants to recognize the plain signs of the times , and gradually to reduce their transactions // 340 Currency , Banking , and Oredit. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the legitimate demands of trade were supplied , the machinery of credit should not have been kept in operation by a fictitious speculative demand , based on the mere reckless hope of gain . Had this rule been acted upon , the tide of wealth which Providence had rolled in upon our shores , would have ceased to flow , it is true , when its work was accomplished , but no loss or disappointment would have ensued . Its course would'have been a blessing to the community , if cupidity and extravagance had not turned it to a curse . But what had paper money to do with the mischief ? Evidently it was merely employed as the readiest medium of purchase at the West , where it was more convenient than specie both for circulation and for subsequent remittance to the seaboard . In its absence , other forms of credit would have taken its place , and certainly nothing would have been gained by transporting millions of specie instead , only to be returned in a few weeks to the spot whence it came . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when those issues were speculative and excessive , ) but in neglecting to make provision for their redemption when their mission was accomplished . A curtailment of five per cent . each week of the 8urp1u8 loans of every bank which had expanded ' during a time of abundance and activity , a curtailment commenced as soon as the first diminution of deposits , the tightening of exchanges and the export of specie gave the first signal of danger , would have speedily placed them in a position of safety , besides giving a salutary warning to the merchants , who depended on them . But the failure to do this , let it be observed , was an error not of currency but of banking , which might have been equally committed , and the results might have been equally fatal , had no bank notes been issued ; for so long as our debts to the West for its produce , and to Europe for the goods returned in exchange for that produce , remained unpaid , money must continue abundant , and banks might lend it as easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So the merchants and farmers , had they been content with supplying the legitimate demands of commerce , and refused to employ their credit in any shape // for mere purposes of speculation , or had they even refused to buy more goods or land , or ships or houses than they could conveniently pay for , would have been safe from all dangerous reaction . No one is obliged to risk a loss of hundreds of thousands , because he has just gained fifty thousand  --  and if a farm of 500 acres , or a ship of 500 tons has proved unusually profitable , that is no reason for concluding that two farms of 1000 acres , or two ships of 1000 tons each , acquired by straining the credit of the purchaser to the utmost , and without the resources necessary to pay for and to manage them , must prove a mine of wealth to their possessor . Neither has the laborer any right to suppose that because a sudden increase of business had temporarily raised his wages , he and thousands like him could henceforth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus involve the whole industry of the country hopelessly in debt . But we need not multiply illustrations to show that from first to last these periodical expansions and revulsions , with all their dismal consequences , are the work of the whole community , and can no more be charged upon paper money than upon any other form of private or public credit . On the other hand , we may safely affirm that a sound , well regulated and trusted paper currency furnishes the best medium of exchanges and the most effectual aid in a financial crisis that can be devised . For it not only supplies a trustworthy currency which can not be exported , and thereby prevents the panic which the rapid disappearance of specie by unfavorable exchanges would occasion , but its amount is an important addition to the mercantile credit of the country , when the latter is at its lowest ebb , and insufficient to carry on the necessary transactions of commerce . It was thus that but a few months since , the issue of less than a million sterling of Bank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic and averted an amount of financial ruin which many millions could not have repaired . In a recent number of this Journal we briefly discussed the effect of usury laws and the importance of their abolition . We recur to the subject merely to point out the error of those who // think that these laws alone stand between the public and the most ruinous extortion . The terrified fancy of some persons presents to them the whole array of banks as so many armies of Philistines , panting to be let loose upon the defenseless borrower , and withheld only by the strong arm of the law from preying upon the very vitals of the community . There can not be a greater or more dangerous mistake . So long as the banks are limited to six per cent . they can only earn their dividends by resorting to various contrivances to increase their profits . They will therefore prefer borrowers who can extend their circulation and enlarge their deposits , and who will allow them to charge a higher rate of interest under the name of exchange - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . they are able to make dividends at the rate of 7 , 8 , and even 10 ! In the meantime , the class of small but safe borrowers for whom banks are established , are too often set aside , and a large part of their loans goes to wealthy capitalists , who can re-loan it without regard to the prohibitions of nsnry laws . Now this forced and unnatural position of the banks is in fact one of the principal reasons of onr financial catastrophes . Not being allowed to rent their capital , as the holders of every other species of capital may do , at its fair value , they are driven to lend their credit and the funds of their depositors in addition , and often to an nnsafe extent . The effect naturally is to keep their loans expanded np to the last moment of safety , and then suddenly to stop them altogether , and to turn over the unwary borrower to the tender mercies of professed moneylenders . When a panic prevents even these from coming to the rescne on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the banks had been able at the first approach of scarcity to economize their revennes by raising the rate of interest , the gradual but steady pressure would have speedily checked the speculative tendency of the mercantile commnnity  --  the prudent would have voluntarily curtailed their operations , the reckless would have been compelled by want of credit to do the same , and there would have been money enough for all . It is too often forgotten in discussing this question , that // banks and money-lenders are as much at the mercy of borrowers , as the latter are at theirs . In 1857 the scale turned strongly in one direction-in 1858 it has turned not less strongly the other way . Banks can not create an abundance of money ; and when it is scarce , the sooner borrowers find it out , the better . Should usury laws be abolished , there would probably be a weekly minimum rate of interest adopted by mutual understanding among the banks in each of our principal commercial centres , as is done by the Bank of England ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every law of analogy would be violated if the result were not to produce a lower average rate of interest everywhere ; but if any state should be unwilling to make the fearful plunge ' too suddenly , why could not the experiment be tried partially at first , by fixing a maximum rate of ( suppose ) nine per cent. , below which any rate should be lawful if mutually agreed on between borrower and lender , on promissory notes and bills of exchange of short term , such as four months ? This would suffice to test the principle and secure the speedy triumph of common sense and justice . If then no suppression of small or large notes can prevent the existence in some shape of a paper currency , if wealth and credit can not be banished from the community , and the abuse of wealth and credit will produce inflation and reaction-if a prohibitive tariff would only render permanent and ultimately aggravate indefinitely the evils of expansion , what is to become of us ? That depends upon ourselves . If every individual in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buy a little less than he can pay for , so as to accumulate , however slowly , rather than fall in debt-if every merchant , trader , and manufacturer would proportion his transactions to his capital , and constantly fortify his capital by reserving a portion of his average gains-if large corporations were managed as economically as private firms , and possessed an amount of capital which would render them independent of money-lenders ; if bank-managers would always keep on hand a reserve of funds for possible contingencies , and would look rather to the safety of our currency and our commerce than to the amount // of their dividends-what need would there be of legal restrictions to protect the community from ruin ? On the other hand , if the principal abnses of credit are such as can not be reached by laws , however stringent , it is evident that no legislation can save us from the consequences of our own folly . At best it can but mitigate the evil , and too often it will only aggravate what it undertakes to cnre . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that their doctrines ignore all the finer feelings of our nature , and rednce the whole fabric of society to a mere struggle of contending interests , in which every man 's hand is against every man , and the general interest is best subserved by the most intense selfishness of each and all . Such unjust imputations arise from a want of comprehensive appreciation of these great doctrines . God forbid that the selfish passions which degrade our nature should be held up as its legitimate springs of action ! There i8 a legitimate self-love which the Creator has stamped on every heart , and which the highest law has made the measure of our duty to others . " Self-love , thus pushed to social , to divine , Gives thee to make thy neighbor 's blessings thine . * * * * * * Friend , parent , neighbor , first it will embrace , His country next , and next all human race .

It is true that ignorant or stupid moralists and preachers have been found to assert that the one end and aim of commerce is to enrich its votaries at the expense of the community . If selfishness is the recognized mainspring of society , the charge is doubtless true , and equally true of all the professions and industrial occupations which benefit the community-lawyers and physicians , farmers and mechanics , clerks and laborers . But it is not so . The legiti // mate exercise of self-love works no ill to its neighbor . The lawyer or physician receives his fee , it is true , but he renders a service which is worth more to the client or the patient . The farmer feeds the manufacturer , and the manufacturer clothes the farmer-each does his part for the other , better and cheaper than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both are prudent and economical , the result is mutually beneficial . The same is true of the artisan and the agricultural laborer . So the merchant , in buying as cheap and selling as dear as he can , consistently with frankness , liberality , and honesty , is but supplying one part of the world with the commodities it most needs , and which some other part of the world can best afford to spare ; and his profit on the transaction is his only means of knowing whether he has rightly interpreted the wants of both . He might easily buy and sell goods in such a way as to ruin instead of enriching himself ; but they would be precisely such goods as the seller could least spare , and the buyers were least in want of lie therefore consults their interest when he consults his own . When from scarcity the prices of his commodities rise , he may reap a temporary harvest ; but the consequent gain can neither be promptly realized nor readily repeated ; and to the consumer this rise of price is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to economize consumption , without which the supply would be prematurely exhausted . The same principles apply in their full force to banks and bankers , who deal in money , the merchandise of all others most essential to the community , and the regular demand and supply of which can least bear to be interfered with . All that is wanted is moderation and prudence on all hands , to secure the safe and harmonious working of the social machine . But when , losing sight of that great Christian law which harmonizes self-love with the rights of others , the lust of gain induces the merchant , the manufacturer and the capitalist to forestall the demands of society by providing more commodities than they can pay for or profitably dispose of ; when credit is abused for the purposes of speculation , whether to produce artificial scarcity or artificial demand ; when banks and bankers employ the capital and credit which should be the sheet anchor // of the public , to promote speculation and extravagance , for the sake of a temporary harvest ; the interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all its naked deformity . No sound political economist will defend such abuses of those tendencies and those resources which are bestowed for purposes of good , but which are thus turned into ministers of evil . Their control and regulation , however , is the office , not of political economy , but of a higher law and a nobler philosophy . If , as individuals and as a community , we will rise superior to the vulgar lust of gain , and seek rather to do our duty in the world , and to do it well ; if , instead of striving only to make or to spend all the money we can , we will recognize those higher aims and loftier purposes for which men and nations are placed on this earthly stage , and will pursue the various walks of life and their emoluments as means , but not as ends ; the machinery of capital and credit may safely be left to its own working .                   @ @
