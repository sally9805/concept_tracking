ART . VII. -A PHILOSOPIIICAL SURVEY OF THE OCEAN . Explanations and Sailing Directions to accompany the Wind and ( *arrent Charts , and published by authority of Hon. John C. iDobbin , Secretary of the Navy . By M. F. MAUIRY , Lieut . U. S. N. , Superintendent of the National Observatory . MAN has as yet but partially learned the great truth which Nature has ever been striving to teach him , that he no sooner becomes acquainted with the laws which govern any of her operations , than they becom* subservient to his use , and reveal to him the secret that they were made for that very end . The way , and the only way , which conducts him to this mastery over the powers of nature , lies through the slow but sure process of induction , as prescribed by Lord Bacon . The method pursued in constructing Maury 's Wind and Current Charts , is in exact accordance with the Baconian philosophy . It consists , first , iii collecting all the facts of the case ; secondly , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are similar ; and , thirdly , in observing what language they speak-what new truths they reveal . These constitute principles , and principles in science , when they are applied to practical use , become rules in art . The first example of the application of this method to the phenomena of the Ocean , was set by Win . C. iRedifeld , Esq. , of New York , more than twenty years since , in his investigation of the phenomena and causes of Atlantic Gales . After any storm which he proposed to investigate , he collected as many as possible of the log-books of vessels that had been caught in the storm . These he submitted to careful and diligent inspection , noting in what direction each vessel took the wind ; how that direction changed during the progress of the storm ; and with what degree of violence the wind blew at successive periods . Such a comparison between vessels situated in different parts of the storm , revealed to him the great fact , that the storm was a whirlwind spinning on its axis like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress along its path . The same comparison , extended to other storms , indicated an unexpected uniformity in their modes of action ; a uniformity which further revealed the surprising fact , that these apparently lawless // and destructive blasts , which seem to be out of the course of nature , are in fact governed by laws no less fixed , than those which control the movements of the planets . They were found to rotate always from right to left ; to move with greatly aceelerated velocity towards the center of the storm ; and to pursue along the coast of the United States , paths which , when plotted on paper , appeared remarkably similar to each other , *nd of a definite order of curvature . The in cj1uirers into natural phenomena are learnlno* to think that t ere is nothing b n " lawless " in Nature , since whenever she is interrogated with precision , her responses are equally precise ; and so often has it . *ppeared that events of the natural world which were deemed the most capricious , are essential parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good philosophy as poetry to say , that not a dew drop glistens , or a leaf tre*mbles , but helps to fulfill some grand design . By this happy application of the principles of the inductive philosophy to ocean storms , a new field of philosophical inquiry was laid open , which has since been most sedulously cultivated , not only by iRedileld himself , but by Reid , Espy , Thorn , Piddington , Dove , and others . The result of these labors has been a set of rules , which will help the mariner who encounters a storm , so to steer his vessel as to escape its violence , while without such a knowledge of the laws of storms , he might run directly into the jaws of destruction . Although the method pursued by Lient . Maury in constructlug his Wind and Current Charts , is similar to that of Mr. Redfield in investigating the laws of storms , his immediate object is different . It is not so much to assist the mariner to escape the violence of the elements , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . Instead of regarding them as impediments to his progress , with which he is forced to maintain a desperate and endless warfare , he thus learns to make them quicken his speed , by so timing his voyage and steering his vessel , as ever to sail with the wind and float with the current . Lord Bacon places it among the first of his philosophical maxims , that man is the ser*rant of Nature , *md can do nothing only as he is o'bedient to her mandate*s ; and this is true while he is learning her secrets . Nature , until her laws are discovered , is the tyrant , and man the slave ; but the instant these laws are understood , man becomes the master and Nature the humble menial , to bear his messages or to dr*g his car . The lightning , before his terror and his scourge , now submits itself to his authority more tru ! y than in fabulous *tomy it awaited the nod of Jove. // The situation of Lieut . Maury at the grand depository of the log-books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him special advantages for such an investigation ; but the facts thus amassed in the old log-books were so deficient in precision or defective in details , that he found it impossible to derive from them sufficient data for completing the proposed charts . He next brought the subject before the American Association , ( then called the National Institute , ) who expressed a deep interest in it , and appointed a committee to urge its importance upon the attention of the government . The Hon. John Y. Mason , then Secretary of the Navy , entered warmly into the p lan , as did those enlightened men who sncceeded him in office . Jul 845 , the labor was commenced anew , and a fresh supply of log-books was procured from our men of war . Jn 1848 were issued the first three sheets of the Wind and Current Charts . They contained only the tracks of men of war , but their utility was at once apparent , for they enabled Mr. Maury to point out at once a shorter , quicker , and better route to Rio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery , and it was soon verified . A Baltimore vessel was the first to try this new route . She crossed the line the 24th day out , ( it has since been done in 18 days , ) the usual time before being 41 days , and made the trip to Rio and back in 75 days , a period by many days shorter than had before been occupied by the same voyage . Navigators began now more fully to comprehend the object and to understand the utility of these researches , and came forward with offers of hearty and gratuitous coöperation . In a short time a large fleet , without the promise or hope of pecuniary reward , were lending their zealous aid . Ship after ship joined the corps of observers ; so that more than a thousand navigators are busied night and day in all parts of the world in making observations , and collecting materials of great value to science , commerce , and navigation . The marked approbation which lii e illustrious Humboldt ( who is better qualified than any other man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan ) gave to these researches , contributed much to increase their popularity both at home and abroad . He says in a letter to the U. S. Consul at Leipsic , " I beg you to express to Lieut . Maury , the author of the beautiful Wind and Current Charts , prepared with so much care and profound learning , my hearty gratitude and esteem . It is a great undertaking , equally important to the practical navigator , and for the advance of meteorology in general . It has been viewed in this light in Germany by all persons who have a taste for physical geography . The shortening of the // voyage from the United States to the equator , is a beautiful result of this undertaking . The bountiful manner in which these Charts are distributed raises our expectations still higher . " In the year 1851 , a proposition came from the British government , inviting the codperation of our government in establishing a uniform *ystem of meteorological observations , both on sea and land . he o inion of Lieut . Maury being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but thought there would be insuperable difficulties in carrying the plan into execution here , since a great part of the meteoroloo4-cal observations in the United States , are not subject to tT*e control of the national government , being under the direction of state governments , or learned institutions , or private individuals . Still a uniform system of observations might be arranged between the British and American governments , which should be fully carried out on board their respective ships of war and at their military posts ; and contemplating from such a system great benefits to navigation and to science , he proposed a meteorological conference-that England , France , Russia , and other nations , be invited to cooperate with their ships , by causing them to keep an abstract log , according to a form to b* agreed upon , and that authority be given to confer with the most distinguished navigators and meteorologists , at home and abroad , for the purpose of devising , adopting , and establishing a universal system of meteorological observations for the sea as well as for the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be taken at sea , while the plan of Lieut . Maury contemplated from them the finest results . He urged the utility of a conference upon the subject of a uniform system of meteorological observations on board British lines deleted // from the British government expressive of the high interest felt by his department in the proposition , and authorizing the Superintendent of the Naval Observatory to confer as to such a uniform plan of observations , with the proper officers , at home and abroad , and in concert with them to agree upon a system of observations both on sea and land . Mr. Maury proceeded to publish a pamphlet embodying the features of his plan , to which he gave a wide circulation . Several governments responded to the proposition , as did many learne*1 societies . When the original proposition , as amended by the American government , to include the sea also in the system of research , went back to the British government , it was by that government referred to the President and Council of the Royal society for a report . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labors of Lient . Maury are represented to the government in the most flattering terms . The efforts already made in this country up to that time , ( 1852 , ) are thus comprehensively exhibited in that Report : " The proposition and the results obtained , of Lieut . Maury , to give a greater extension and more systematic direction to the meteorological observations to be made at sea , appear to be deserving of the most serious attention of the Board of Admiralty . In order to understand the importance of this proposition , it will be proper to refer to the system of observations which has been adopted of late years in the Navy and Merchant Service of the United States , and to some few of the results to which it has actually led . Instructions are given to naval captains and masters of ships , to note in their logs the points of compass from which the wind blows , at least once in every eight hours ; to record the temperature of the air , and of the water , at the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea ; to notice all remarkable pheszomena which may serve to characterize particular regions of the ocean , more especially the direction , the velocity , the depth , and the limits of the currents . Special instructions also are given to whalers to note down the regions where whales are found , and the limits of the range of their different species . Detailed instructions are given to all American ship-masters upon their clearing from the custom house , accompanied by a request that they would transmit to the proper office , after their return from their voyage , copies of their logs , as far at least as they relate to their observations , with a view to their being examined , discussed , and embodied in Charts of the Winds and Currents , and in the compilation of Sailing Directions to every part of the globe . For some year&amp; the instructions furnished received very little attention , and very few observations were made or communicated ; the publication , however , in 1848 , of some charts founded upon the scanty materials which had come to hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which indicated much shorter routes than had hitherto been followed to Rio , and other parts of South America , was suffis*ient to satisfy some of the more intelligent ship-masters of the object and real importance of the scheme ; and in less than two years from that time , it had received the cordial cooperation of the master of nearly every ship that sailed . Short as is the time that this system has been in operation , the results to which it has led have proved of very great importance to the interests of navigation and commerce . The routes to many of the most frequented ports in different parts of the globe , have been materially shortened ; that to San Francisco , in . California , nearly one-third ; a system of southwesterly monsoons , // in the equatorial regions of the Atlantic , and on the west coast of America , has been discovered ; a vibratory motion of the trade wind zones , with their lelts and calms , and their limits for every month of the year , has been determined ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gulf Stream have been more accurately defined ; and the existence of almost equally remarkable systems of currents in the Indian Ocean , on the coast of China , on the northwestern coast of America , and elsewhere , has been ascertained . There are in fact very few departments of the science of meteorology and hydrography , which have not received very valuable additions ; whilst the most accurate determination of the parts of the Pacific Ocean ( which are very limited in extent ) where the sperm whale is found , as well as the limits of the range of those of other spscies , has contributed very materially to the success of the American whale fishery , one of the most extensive and productive of all the fields of enterprise and industry . " It was ascertained that a number of the leading governments of Europe were averse to making any change in their established systems of meteorological observations on the land , while they would heartily coöperate in promoting a uniform system on the sea . It was therefore deemed advisable to confine the proposed concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lient . Maury , official invitations were issued by Hon. Mr. Everett , then Secretary of State , to a conference to be held at Brussels , in August , 1853 . The conference met accordingly , and consisted of representatives from Portugal , France , England , Belgium , Denmark , Sweden , Norway , iRussia , Holland , and the United States . By order of the Secretary of the Navy , Lient . Maury was commissioned to attend the conference on the part of our government . The history of this celebrated and important meeting is given in the work before us , in full , and indeed with needless prolixity ,  --  a fault which characterizes a large portion of the documents that proceed fi-om Washington . The " abstract log , " or formula for observations agreed on by the conference , consisted of twenty-two blank columns , with an additional column of " Remarks . " It might be tedious to enumerate the various particulars which constitute the headings , but it may be truly said they leave little to be desired , embracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean and the atmosphere that can contribute to our knowledge of either . Under a system of observations so excellent in itself and rem dered efficient by so many zealous collaborators , we may reasonably anticipate that our knowledge of the ocean will be rapidly extended ; that new laws governing its winds and its currents will be successively developed , until it will appear that every wave that rolls , and every breeze that blows is a part of some great system ; that from the knowledge thus acquired will arise new facilities for navigation , and he opened new mines of // wealth ; that as in other departments of nature , man having now become the master where he was before the slave , he will no longer be borne off his track by the currents , or wrecked by the winds and waves , but will turn to his own account the violence of these elements , and their seeming irregularities , and compel them to speed him on the way . With such visions of the future , we may now advantageously take a comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , and its useful products . The waters of the ocean cover nearly three-fourths ( or more exactly , five sevenths ) of the surface of the globe ; and of the thirty-eight millions of miles of dry land in existence , twentyeight belong to the northern hemisphere . The mean depth of the ocean has been variously state 6 , but may for the present be taken at four miles : the numerous soundings now in progress will soon enable us to speak with more definiteness on this point . Enough has already been done to prove that the depth is exceedingly unequal ; that like the surface of the earth , the bottom of fih e ocean here rises in mountain peaks , and there sinks in dee p valleys . Until recently the deepest sounding ever made , was that by Captain Scoresby in the polar seas , which was short of a mile and a half . As late as 1848 , the maximum sounding was that of Captain Ross , in the South Atlantic , and gave 27,600 feet , or a little over five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a point of the Atlantic farther north , Lient . Walsh , of the U. S. Schooner Taney , sounded , without reaching bottom , to the depth of 34,200 feet , or nearly f3* miles . Within a short time Captain IDenham communicated to the Royal Society a report of having reached the bottom of the Atlantic , in a passage from Rio Janeiro to the Cape of Good Hope , at the astonishing depth of 7,706 fathoms , or miles ; a depth so profoun d , t*at the plummet occupied in its descent from the reel nearly P* hours . From these results it appears that the depths of the ocean exceed the heights of the mountains , since the loftiest summits of the Himmalaya are little more than 28,000 feet , or 5* miles . Notwithstanding these enormous depths , there are large tracts of the ocean comparatively shallow ; and in the immediate vicinity of places where no bottom could be found , were spots of no uncommon depths . These facts indicate that the bed of the sea is diversified like the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exceed on an average one mile ; and the Greenland seas are of such moderate depth , that whales , when harpooned , often run to the bottom , as is indicated by their appearance when they rise again to the surface . Whales are even supposed to seek a part of their food at the bottom of the sea . // The pressare that bodies must undergo at such vast depths , is enormous . As the pressure of a column of water varies in proportion to the depth , and is found by experiment to amount to 500 pounds on a square foot , at the dept1* of 8 feet , it would be , at one mile below the surface , on the same area , 330,000 pounds ; and at the depth of 8* miles ( the deepest sounding yet made ) it would exceed 1200 tons to the square foot . It has tong been known that square bottles let down to even a moderate depth into the sea , are crushed ; and that junk bottles , when sunk to a greater depth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if before full of fresh water , this is displaced and the bottle , when drawn up , is found full of salt water , the gre at compression of the cork having permitted the exchange . The late Mr. Jacob Perkins , many years ago , instituted an interesting series of experiments of this kind , during his voyage across the Atlantic , with the view of ascertaining the compressibility of water ; and afterwards , in Philadelphia , he applied by means of the hydraulic press , a force no less than nearly 2000 tons to the square foot , without changing the water from the fluid to the solid state , as some have imagined might be the case with water under the pressure sustained by sea water in the lowest depths of the ocean . Water itselS however , by such an incumbent pressure , would be sensibly reduced in bulk , and its density would be proportionally increased ; so that substances which , like the human body , but little exceed water in specific gravity , might float at a certain depth , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same cause themselves undergo a still greater compression . This is commonly the case with light bodies submerged to a great depth , so that parts of a vessel when wrecked in deep water , which would float near the surface , never rise . The Greenland whale is said sometimes to descend to the depth of a mile , but always to come up exhausted and blowing out blood . Specimens of the matter that was brought up from the bottom of the sea , by our vessels employed in taking deep soundings , at the depth of more than two miles , were transmitted to Prof. Bailey , of West Point , ( well known for his great skill in microscopic examinations , ) and were found to be filled with the remains of exceedingly minute animalcules , consisting of calcareous shells . Prof. Bailey thinks it impossible that these microscopic animals lived at the depths where those shells are found , but that their home is near the surface , and that when they die their shells settle to the bottom . Mr. IMlaury remarks that*we are taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursery teeming with nascent organisms ; its depths as the // 125 cemetery for families of living creatures , that outnumber the sands of the sea-shore for multitude . The temperature of the ocean undergoes but slight variations in the torrid zone , being generally from 800 to 83*6 , and in the higher latitudes the variations are much less than on the land . It becomes , therefore , a fountain of cool breezes in summer and of warm gales in winter . In certain parts of the Indian Ocean , the hottest sea in the world , the water reaches the heat of 900 . At a certain depth below the surface throughout the ocean , we come to a cold stratum of invariable temperature , that of 400 . At the equator this is found at the depth of a mile and a quarter , ( 7,200 feet , ) but it comes continually nearer and nearer to the surface until , in latitude 560 , it reaches quite to the surface . North of this the cold water is uppermost , and in latitude 700 the depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4,500 feet . ) Nothing could be more favorably situated for evaporation than the waters of the ocean , whether we regard the extent of surface , the elevated temperature , or the agitation by winds ; and , accordingly , the amount of water thus raised into the atmosphere , is prodigious , being estimated as sufficient , were none returned to it , to sink the levelof the ocean four feet per annum , implying more than 3,000,000 of tons weight , to every square mile . One portion of this vapor is precipitated upon the ocean again ; another portion is borne by the winds over the lands , and waters the earth with showers , feeds the springs , sustains vegetable and animal life , and then returns again to the ocean by the rivers . These restore to the sea what the land had before borrowed from it ; and thus , by this constant exchange , the land is not drained and the sea is not full . The Mississippi alone delivers to the Gulf of Mexico , nearly fifteen trillions of cubic feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley of the Mississippi alone had borrowed from the ocean . These statements give us some faint idea of the energy which Nature puts forth in watering the earth . Tier beneficent care is still further manifested in the purifying processes which water undergoes in this circulatory system , which is carried on between the sea and the land . All the impurities that can soil the person , or clothing , or dwelling of man ; all that can corrupt the air from the decay of organic substances , is received by the rivers and borne away to the sea . Here the tides and the waves meet it , and sweep it far from the shore , and deposit it in the ocean depths . In return , a constant supply of pure water is raised from the sea by distillation , leaving behind all saline and all other foreign ingredients of sea-water ; it is borne over the land by winds , where it either falls in // showers of rain , or is still further purified by the process uf crystallization , and descends in snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impurities which may happen to be present in this medium , ( a process by which the purity of the atmosphere itself is maintained , ) it is again subjected to filtration through the stratum of sand that covers the surface of the earth , and being thus separated from every impurity which it had either transported to the sea or accidentally imbibed on its return , it is restored to the earth to gush forth again in pure fountains , for the use of man . Since the rivers carry down saline matters to the sea , which they have dissolved in owing on or under the earth , while by evaporation , in the returning system , water leaves all foreign ingredients behind , the ocean becomes permanently salt . It is not , however , certain that all the salt is thus supplied by the rivers . Since the different saline substances contained in river water are appropriated more or less in the marine structures that are constantly forming , as sea-shells and coral groves , it is not . easy to determine whether the ocean was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . It amounts , at present , to about 3* per cent. , and is nearly uniformly distributed over the globe , a proof that the waters of the ocean commingle throughout their whole extent . The numerous currents which form so proniinent an object of the work before us , keep its waters in continual circulation . No sooner is a portion of the equatorial seas heated , than it expands , and starts for the polar regions , and like portions of the polar waters commence their circuit to the equator . This mutual exchange goes far to prevent excesses of heat on the one side , or of cold on the other , and contributes greatly towards diffusing a uniform temperature over the globe . Until recently these currents were little known , and it is chiefly by investigating their course and the laws that govern them , that the labors of Lieut . Maury and those who ai d him in collecting materials for his Wind and Current Charts , have proved so useful to navigation , and will , as we believe , become , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a still more signal benefit . Among these currents the Gulf Stream is the most remarkable , and that which has longest received the attention of both navigators and men of science . It is a hot sea river issuing from the Gulf of Mexico , where it has a temperature of 86 degrees . In the Straits of Florida its breath is 38 miles , but it widens as it advances northward , and attains a breadth of 75 miles off Cape Hatteras , and expands still more as it reaches the latitude of the Grand Banks , still preserving a temperature nearly // 12T 20 degrees above that of the neighboring seas . Its color ( indigo blue ) serves to distinguish its borders from the adjoining waters , which are of a dark green hue ; but the thermometer is a still more definite guide to its exact limits , and shows that its margin is exceedingly well defined , and that its waters hardly mix at all with the cold and dense waters through which it flows . These , indeed , on either hand , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earth that form the margin of an ordinary river . Since the bottom of the sea , as it advances to the north , grows more and more shallow , its breadth of course expands , and thus the lower surface of the stream presents an inclined plane rising in the direction of the stream * and this is what Lieut . Maury means by the apparently paradoxical expression , that " the Gulf Stream runs up hill . " The amount of water kept in motion by this hot sea river is prodigious , being , as our author supposes , 3,000 times as great as all that the Mississippi pours into the Gulf of Mexico , and equal to one-fourth of the entire water of the Atlantic ; and since whatever amount of fluid is withdrawn from the equatorial regions and conveyed to the polar , must be replaced by a corresponding amount in the opposite direction , he concludes that the great current which descends from Baffin 's Bay is no less in amount than the Gulf Stream . This it meets near the Grand Banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf Stream at a considerablc depth , where its course is detected by the masses of ice which it bears along in its current , and the other flowing down the coast , commonly at a great depth , but occasionaly elevated by shoals almost to the surface of the ocean , as at the Banks of Newfoundland , and at Cape Hatteras . The Gulf Stream itself also divides into two parts beyond the Banks , one portion running northward and flowing along the western side of northern Europe , contributing greatly to soften the rigors of those wintry climates , and the other taking a sweep towards the Coas* of Africa , and returning again to the Gulf of Mexico to renew the same grand circuit . The Gulf Stream retaining somewhat of the superior diurnal velocity of the earth in the regions from which it flows , has an easterly tendency as it proceeds towards the higher latitudes , while the polar current , retaining somewhat of its inferior diurnal velocity , has a westerly tendency as it flows southward , clinging closely to the main land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where at a little depth the water is found to be as cold as at the corresponding depth off the Arctic shores of Spitzbergen. // Feb . What power can be assigned adequate to the movement of such a vast amount of water as that of the Gulf Stream ? The cause usually assigned is the influence of the trade winds , which accumulate the waters of the Atlantic upon the great basin of the Gulf of Mexico . But our author considers the fact of such an elevation of the waters of this basin as is usually represented to take place , improbable , and maintains ( what appears to us extremely probable ) that the expansion of the waters of the equatorial seas , makes them how off either way towards the poles , local circumstances determining them to run in particular channels , rather than in one unbroken wave ; while the condensation of the cold waters of the polar seas , causes them in like manner to make their way towards the equator . The tendency of the waters of the middle portions of the Atlantic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico , is strongly evinced by the following fact . It is a custom often practiced by sea-faring people , to throw bottles overboard , with a paper stating the time and place at which it is done . Lient . Maury is in possession of a chart representing in this way the tracks of more than one hundred bottles . Of many thousands that have been cast into the sea , these are all that have been found and recorded . This chart indicates that the waters from every part of the Atlantic tend towards the Gulf of Mexico and its stream . Bottles cast into the sea midway between the old and new worlds , near the coasts of Europe , Africa , and America , at the extreme north and farthest south , have been found either in the West Indies , or within the wellknown ran *e of the Gulf Stream . Besides t e immense aid which these researches promise to lend to the navigators of the ocean , they will also contribute vastly to promote the discovery and acquisition of its hidden treasures . Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreats of the sperm whale , which lives only in warm water , and brought to light new homes of the right whale , which is the tenant only of cold water , and never crosses the torrid zone . So great indeed is the importance of the whale fishery to the United States , that our author , with an excusable degree of enthusiasm , pronounces it to be a source of wealth transcending all the mines of California .
