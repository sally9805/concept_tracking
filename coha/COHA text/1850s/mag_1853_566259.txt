txt ART . VIL-THE CHURCH AND ITS MINISTRY . Report of the Committee of New Haven County , Conn. , on the Subject of Salaries and Parsonages . Svo . New Haven : George B. Bassett , 1852 . Thffty-sixth Annual Report of the Directors of the American Education Society , May , 1852. 8vo. pp. 46 . Boston . SOME of our readers will perhaps remember that we undertook , in a former number , * to discuss the relation of ministers to their people . The pamphlets whose titles are given above have reminded us that we then but partly carried out our design , and prompt us to take another step in the same direction . We are the more willing to do this from the fact , that so much evidence has reached us that our former observations , inadequate and incomplete as they were , met an admitted exigency , and declared the truth in respect to it . In the article referred to we endeavored to call attention to the obligations imposed respectively on the parties to the relation in question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , they are not properly discharged . We undertook to show that the labors of ministers in behalf of the people of their charge are not met , as a general thing , by adequate pecuniary provision , or by a proper measure of sympathy with them in their work . We maintained that there is between every minister of the Gospel , and the people over whom he is regularly set as a religious teacher , a contract-implied if not expressed  --  and if not expressed , only because of its being too manifest to need any foi:mal expression , by the terms of which contract so long as he gives himself to the study of word and doctrine for their edification , they are bound to see that he and his family are supplied with the temporal necessaries and comforts of life . We declared , too , that although the civil tribunals might enforce only the payment of the stipulated salary , this was nevertheless but a merely nominal sum ; in fact only the npproximate exponent of the real interest of the contracting parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avowed Christians certainly is the highest law , is not satisfied with anything short of compliance with the entire spirit of the sacred contract . We were the more free also to argue and set forth this // matter , because we knew how reluctant ministers of the Gospel are to complain to their people of any real or seeming delinquency on this score . They shrink from making their relation to their people prominently one of pecuniary hire . it goes against their sense of propriety , or delicacy to say the least , and against their ideas of the proper character and spirit of their calling . They , too , who suffer most from lack of outward comforts and the proper manifestation of sympathy , are very often just the ones to keep their troubles to themselves , and suffer with least complaint . Since the writing of our former article , we have casually come to the knowledge , possessed we presume by few , save the sufferers themselves , that in what would be deemed the part of New England more exempt than any other from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a large number of the Congregational clergy who are deprived of a proper livelihood , and toward whom in several instances their parishes have acted in a manner shameful to an intelligent and Christian age . We are glad , therefore , to see the evidence given by the Report of the Committee of the clergy of New Haven county , that some of the profession have ventured to speak out upon this subject , in a way likely to attract attention , and to be productive of a desirable effect . We are all the more glad too , that the Report before us emanates from the Episcopal clergy of that county , rather than from those of other denominations , and could readily excuse , if need be , the amusing arrogance with which that not overweighty body of men would ignore the existence of Yale College , and the First Church of New Haven with their pastors , from the time of Davenport until now , to say nothing of others of the same faith , who lifted up their voices in the several towns of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were heard in the meetinghouses in which now officiate those who so complacently style themselves " The Clergy of New Haven County . " We say that we are glad that the Report in question has emanated from this particular family of the glergy , rather than from another denomination , for our Episcopalian laity have not been considered slack in comparison with others , in providing for the comfort of their ministry . There certainly is no want of wealth among the Episcopalians of New Haven county , and they are too accustomed in all their historical associations , to the knowledge , that the support of the clergy costs money , not to be as ready as others to make that pecuniary provision which is needful for the proper maintenance of religious ordinances. // The Report alledges two facts , on the basis of which it makes its appeal to the public . One is , " that in general the salaries of the clergy have not been increased , in proportion to the increased expense of living . " The other is , " . that comparatively but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the first of these alledged facts , the report presents an array of figures , which tell their story very summarily , and which we can not do better perhaps than quote : " The average of the salaries of the Connecticut clergy of the present day , is about $450 per annum , showing but little , if any , increase over the grade established thirty years ago ; while we venture to say that the expense of living has doubled , and the wealth of the church quintupled . A few figures will very much assist in showing the pecuniary condition of the priesthood . Let us , therefore , estimate a few articles of the necessary expenses of the minister who is receiving the full salary of a thrivin0 country parish , $500 . House rent , $75. lie must keep a horse and carriage , the annual expense of which , including wear and tear , ' horse feed and interest on original outlay , can not be less than $100 . Wages and board of one domestic , $ lOt ) . Three fires ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' and of course one in the study , making the year 's bill for fuel , 60 . He must attend the Convention and all county meetings , besides being subject to many other calls of duty to the church , involving expense , all of which , to , , ether with necessary stationery and postage , can not be less than $50 . Total , $385 . Leaving $115 to clothe and feed his family , pay educational debts , buy books and periodicals , and meet all contingent expenses 1 " In connection with their statement in regard to the inadequacy of salaries , the Committee making the report advert to the manner of payment , as having not a little to do in occasioning the indebtedness and consequent troubles of the clergy . It seems from the statements here made , that the custom of paying ministers their stipulifted salary , only at the close of ther year , is not confined to one denomination , but that even the most apostolic or canonical pedigree does not ensure the payment of tythes any more promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight in the observation of the Committee , " were salaries paid punctually at the end of every three months , the church would at once be largely relieved from the weight and disgrace of an indebted clergy , and the laity , so far from finding their burdens to be heavier* wo*uld , in the end , derive great benefit to themselves . " We might , however , go somewat farther and suggest , th , at in some parishes the experiment has been tried of paying the salary in monthly installments , and found to work beneficially in respect both to pastor and people . On the other hand , we have known the case where *t clergyman 's salary was considered due only at the clqse of each official year , though by special grace he was allowed to draw from the treasury occasionally in anticipation ; and we have known one thus situated to hire a horse and ride to his treasurer , at the extremity of the parish perhaps , // and then get hardly enough to pay for the beast which took him there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think are not very rare . But how people possessed of common sense , and of common knowledge in regard to the practical matter of living , and especially in regard to the pecuniary condition of most of those who are called to the ministry , should ever expect a man to live on a salary thus paid , even if adequate in itself , passes our comprehension . Such an expectatioii is most unwarrantable . Those who fill the ministerial offi2e are , for the most part , persons not born to wealth , but poverty rather . They are commonly the sons of parents in moderate worldly circumstances , who by diligence and utmost economy , have been able to give their children a common school education , and perhaps afford one son some help towards a collegiate training . From some friend or society that son has borrowed what was needful to pay his way through the college and the 6eminary , and the chance is that when he is finally invited to assume the charge of a parish , he ascends the pulpit with a debt already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's salary . If he has anything of the spirit which fits him to be a minister of the Gospel , he will be anxious to repay the loan , by which he has obtained his education , as soon as possible . His sensitive soul will ache to do it , and the more lenient his creditors are , the more solicitous will he be to discharge his obligations to them . But how is he to do it ? With the pastoral he has perhaps commenced the family relation . He takes a house and furnishes it , of necessity , on credit . He buys a horse and carriage also on the same terms , for these his people give him to understand , are as indispensable a part of the equipment of a clergyman as of a doctor . And now he is fairly , or unfairly , launched in life , with a salary of five hundred dollars perhaps , to be paid at the end of the year , and a debt contracted at the beginning of it , large enough to swallow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these extremes are to be supplied somehow the no less indispensable articles of daily use and daily life . Man shall not live by bread alone ' may be a very good t*xt for our young minister to preach from , but nevertheless he can not live without bread , and if indeed he should venture to preach from so spiritual a text , it will in all probability greatly damage his prospects of receiving any material aid , ' when farmer A. threshes out his shocks of grain , or farmer B. brings home his grist from the mill . Then the minister must never undertake to cheapen the price of anything which he needs for his household . That would be to // discredit the character of his parishioners , and at once create a ferment of excitement. , What then shall he hope for , between the fact that he is unskilled , because unpractised , in the art ol domestic economy , and the fact that he is obliged to buy everything on credit , what shall he hope for , we say , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find him not only without any of his salary wherewith to diminish his indebtedness for his education , but on the contrary with an increase of indebtedness on the score of the first year 's expenses of living ? And how is the matter likely to be changed for the better in years to come ? As his family increases , expenses will not adopt the inverse ratio of progression and diminish at an equal ' pace . The prospect is dark indeed . And they who may have loaned him the funds necessary for the procurement of his education , may as well first as last relinquish their claim upon him . They will thereby relieve him somewhat , and they will realize full as much to themselves , as though they continue to set it down from year to year as an item in their inventory of assets . It would surprise many of our congregations to learn , as any of them might learn by a little inquiry at the proper source , that their minister , though he may perhaps have grown old in their service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dues for that intellectual furnishing which has made him an acceptable minister to them , and the source of unmeasured benefit both to them and to their children . Yet so it is . Congregations , and not those in the country alone , but those resident in the city , and whose wealth is able to meet the largest demands , are often so indifferent in this matter as to suffer a man of noble intellect and keen sensibility , to shorten his days among them , because , in addition to the proper burdens of the ministerial office , he is weighed down by pecuniary burdens which they could most easily remove . The last Report of the Education Society , were there no other means of information on this subject , would be en9ugh to show us that a large portion of the ministry are very much straitened in their pecuniary resources . This Report informs us , that while there has been *paid to beneficiaries of the Society during the past year , the sum of seventeen thousand four hundred and eighty-five dollars , there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been assisted since the formation of the Society , only eight hundred and eighty-nine dollars . It will be remembered here also , that this Society , some years since , changed the basis of its operations so far as to make its appropriations as a gratuity , when so preferred , instead of a loan . The Report states , ( p. 13 , ) that " quite a large proportion // of the young men now receive the money as a gratuity . " It further informs us , that while under the loan system , the amount annually refunded averaged about two thousand dollars , it now averages , under the gratuity system , less than one thousand . Here we see , in a single view , how inadequate are the pecuniary resources of the ministry . It seems that even With the pressure of a loan , and the sense of indebtedness and obligation which it must generate , and the self-denial it must prompt to , for the discharge of such obligation , the ministers aided by this Society , have refunded but a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their education , while under the gratuity system , that amount has diminished more than half . This shows , beyond all dispute , either that the ministry are not able to extinguish their indebtedness , or that they are men of altogether too facile or obtuse consciences to be entrusted with the charge of the pulpit . But enough on this point , on which , after having said what we have in our former article , we did not design to dwell at any such length . If , however , the repeated allusion to this topic shall turn the effective thoughts of any to this really important subject , the iteration will not be in vain . The Report of the New Haven Committee presents another subject of kindred character , which may claim a little of our attention . The Resolution under which the Committee was raised makes the averment " that comparatively but few parishes are provided with parsonages . " The matter of parsonages is certainly a new subject to be argued publicly in this country . We think , however , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means premature or unwise . At the settlement of our country , and down to a comparatively recent period , in fact , a parsonage was deemed well nigh as indispensable as a house of worship . The church , the school house and the parsonage were on nearly the same footing in public estimation . In the days of the Colonies the thought of settling a minister without providing for him a comfortable house , to be kept in repair at the expense of the parish , and a liberal allowance of land for pasture and tillage , was never entertained . Such a provision has continued in many places even to the present time . The word parsonage is not yet quite obsolete with us . Gradually , however , a different state of things from the first has become prevalent . From various causes it has come to pass that a house for the minister is not deemed , as once it was , an indispensable article of parish equipment , and in many a village the boy may now grow to man s estate without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glebe . The care of the parsonage has at times introduced disputes into the meetings of Ecclesiastical Societies , or in the intervals between the dismission or death of one pastor and the installation of another , it has suffered for lack of proper oversight and become the prey of the elements , or it has been voted cheaper to hire than to own , and so the parsonage and glebe have in many cases been sold and converted into a fund . This , in one view , might have been well enough perhaps , if the avails of the fund had been placed within*the control of the pastor . But when , as has too often been the case , the fund so secured has been appropriated to pay in part the regular salary , while the minister has been left to hire a house as he could , it has been made a mere cheat , and the people have speculated in the six per cents at the cxpense of their pastor . In some instances it is probable that the minister who , as has occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained it only nominally , while continuing a resident of the parish still , has counted the parsonage as pertaining to him , rather than to the acting minister , or to the ministerial office . And the people acquiescing out of their affection for him , the parsonage , at his death , has been alienated and the people , thinking to learn wisdom by experience , have declined to make any new investments of like character . From these and other causes it has come to pass , as it is stated in the Report of the New Haven Committee , " that comparatively but few parishes are provided with parsonages . " The remarks of the Report on this subject , though brief , are eminently just , we think , and worthy of consideration . The report lays great , though not undue stress upon the importance of parsonages or rectories as the means of *ndering the connection of a minister with a parish more permanent than it has been of late . It says , " In the opinion of the Committee , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which bind together the Minister and people , as this want of comfortable , cheerful parsonages ; for it not only adds largely to the Rector 's current expenses , but it destroys  --  or rather prevents the growth of-all settled , home feelings . " Frequent changes do not occur in the Rectorship of the parish which provides a comfortable home and a competent support for its Rector . But when neither is afforded , the Minister will of course soon become uneasy ; this will beget uneasiness in the people , and a disruption of the connection will ensue . A disruption too often attended by crimination and recrimination . " " It is of greater importance , by far , that parsonages be provided , especially in the rural parishes , than that an addition // equal to the rent of a house be made to each salary ; because , rectories tend directly to give stability to rectorial relations . We see abundant proof of this in the history of the older parishes , where more attention was paid to this matter . In these a clerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The clergyman was made to feel that his parish was his home ; and people were not then , as is now sometimes the case , afraid to make him too comfortable lest it might be difficult to get rid of him . It may be good for the souls of Rectors thus to make them feel that here they have no continuing city , ' but it is undoubtedly weariness of the flesh . ' " " It is the decided opinion of the Committee that in no one way can the mutual interests of Ministers and people be better subserved , than by the provision of pleasant parsonages ,  --  to be of course free from rent . A Rectory , just as much as a Rectory should be a natural sequence to the formation of a parish and the erection of a church . " ( p. 7 . ) Changing the Episcopal technicality of that last sentence , we adopt it as expressing concisely a very important truth . If the church , the Ecclesiastical Society , should have its house of worship , its religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church should have its fixed and abiding place of occupancy , and not be hiring this hall for the present year and that school-house or dancing room for the next , so should he who preaches the word , and who is the visible embodiment of the gospel , have his fixed place of abode , provided as a part of the parish equipment and seen to be , and felt to be , a permanent endowment of the church . And if a house of worship gathers new religious power to itself as it is mellowed by time and its walls are hung with the rich memories of gospel grace and with the trophies of the truth which has resounded therein , and if it has an increased sacredness and impressiveness to the son because the father or the father 's father has bowed his head therein or lifted up his voice in praise ,  --  so , too , should the pastor be able to catch an inspiration from the odor of thoughts and prayers which his predecessors in the holy office have left as a perfume behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do not make enough in our country of these or of hardly any good associations . We are too much a migratory and an isolated race . We talk much of independence , and endeavor to cast off those bonds , by which we are united to one another and made necessary to each other 's prosperity and comfort . We do not like to confess or even to feel that we are not able to go alone in all respects . We have , to be sure , our Societies and Associations . But these are , for the most part , // temporary in their character . They are designed for the accomplishment of an immediate result , and we go into them as a matter of necessity , wishing all the while that we could do without them and determined to escape from them as soon as possible . The old societies and guilds of England and the Continent we know little of except by report . The association and fellowship of feeling to which they give origin or which they serve to perpetuate , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have imparted is a thing which we lack . It is with us every man for himself , and too often every man by himself . And so we know and understand little of the feeling which is kindled in the soul of the worshiper in older countries when he passes under the arched door-way of the church which has echoed to the tread of ancestral feet through many a generation , or bows his head in the same pew which has been occupied for centuries by those from whom he is descended and whose ashes await in the neighboring God 's acre , ' as they used to call it , the resurrection trump . We need those ancestral associations . They would go far to chasten and mitigate the rawness and wildness which is now so conspicuous a trait in us , and would mellow the too common asperity of our religious life . The limited period of our existence as a people , of course interposes a bar to associations as far-reaching or as potent as those of the old world , which no emigration or intervening Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , we can do something to possess ourselves of kindred advantages . If not old , we are at least growing old ; and there is even now the true savor of antiquity hanging about here and there an old dwelling or church , that dates from the ante-revolutionary period . We can certainly do more than we are in the habit of doing to preserve for ourselves and for our posterity the beneficent power of such visible connections with the past . We can repair , while , if need be , we modify also and make additions to , the old homestead , instead of forsaking it at the earliest possible period , as young birds do the parent nest , or pulling it down to give place to some miserable imitation in clapboards of a Greek temple or a baronial castle . And so , also , we can keep the old church , replacing its square , uncomfortable pews , if expedient , with the cushioned and convenient slip ; though those old pews have about them the blessed idea that people used to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from oldest to youngest . Those old churches made little pretension indeed to architectural excellence , and will not always stand by the rules of esthetic taste or refined art , but with their steep shingled roofs and tapering spires shooting // up heavenward from their own independent base upon the ground , they were a thousand times better than the flimsy structures with their fluted columns in front and nonsensical gingerbread towers on top , which have too often replaced them . And if the old structure is too small or is inconveniently situated in reference to the shifting tide of population , so that it must give place to a new one , let us endeavor at least to make the new one such , that it shall not soon need to be pulled down . Let it be built , not , as men build barns , for present convenience , but with some regard to the future . A church is not a body whose life is limited to three-score years and ten , and its home , its place of worship , should not be calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should carry in itself some idea of the durability and permanence of the body% by which it is to be occupied . There may be a necessity , in some new settlement or for special reasons , that a house of worship should be built of wood . But such cases are rare , and where such necessity does not exist , it is little short of profanity , in this enlightened age and portion of the world , to build a structui-e of clapbo.ards , scantling , lath , and white lead , and then call it a house of God , and dedicate it to Him with great parade of psalm and sermon . The Church of Christ is expected to live while the world lasts . The local church , the church pertaining to any village or town , it is presumable will exist as long as the trees grow upon the village hill-sides , or the rocks abide in their pi-imeval beds . God will be worshiped there , it is hoped , while there is a saint to praise him , or a sinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure therefore in which the church has her visible home and office , the place where she lifts up her penitent soul in prayer , or sounds her lofty psalmodies , or preaches the word of life , ought not to be a structure of which the winds may make havoc , or which a chance spark may kindle with consuming fire . It ought to be permanent and enduring as the worship and the wants of man . Having a purpose for all time , its walls should be of the very stony foundations of the earth itself , and its supports and adornments should be massive as the forests of Lebanon . Nothing less enduring than stone is fit for the *valls of the house of God ; nothing less enduring is in keeping with the enduring purpose of such a structure , or fit to be rendered unto Him , who is from everlasting to everlasting , and the erection of anything less substantial for a house of worship , is to be tolerated only from the necessity of the case , or as a temporary expedient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offend the eye so // often in our towns and villages , are at best only tabernacles , and the day for the ark of God to abide in tabernacles is past . We say , let what purports to be the church 's home , the church 's place of worship , have a durability sori*ewhat cornporting with the protracted life of the church , and its permanent services . Let it not mock by its frailty those holy psalms and prayers , which have echoed through the ages since they first broke from Miriam 's lips and David 's harp . If the village temple may not rival that at Jerusalem in the nice and costly chiseling of its stone , which is by no means needful , it can be reared by humble architects from the rough stones of the field , as the hand of God has shaped them , and they will not be the less fit for sacred use on that account . Let it stand in its native roughness , in keeping with the unsmoothed hills and valleys around , and as abiding as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elements , however rude or protracted , but rather gathering new grace and tints of beauty , alike from sunshine and storm , as years and centuries roll by , and the free winds peal their varying anthem around it . Let it stand , the same church , while the dwellings beside . it change and give place to new ones , and generation after generation of their inhabitants are borne through its solemn aisles to burial . Let it stand till it shall speak to the worshiper of to-day , of the faith which dwelt in his mother Eunice , and in his grandmother Lois , and which was breathed out by them under its arches , in many a song and prayer . Let it stand , one permanent structure if possible , amid the shifting , changeful sceneries of surrounding life , one emblem of the eternal , a visible link of connection between earth and heaven ; yea , truly , and from age to age , the very gate of heaven . And it would add not a little to the proper impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming to be indeed a part of it , the parsonage were found nestling under its sacred shadow , itself also partaking the durable character of the superior edifice , and ever telling the passer-by , that as there is a place for the public worship of the people , so also is there one for the minister who conducts that worship , and both alike beyond the ordinary contingencies of change . The vine climbing over that sunny wall would remind the people , as they should go by on the errands of toil or pleasure , of the good pastor now dead , by whose hand it was first planted and trained to grow there . The venerable tree in yonder corner of the dooryard , would be known from generation to generation as Parson s tree . The walks and the windows of the place would be redolent of the memories of many a pleasant interview with // one and another of the successive ministers of Christ , who had trod them or gazed from them . There , year by year , the people would gather to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mutual attachment . It would be the pastor 's house , and yet the people 's also , and so would be a constant bond of sympathy , union , and enduring confiAence . It would be indeed one of the silent influences of religion . But the silent influences of nature , let us remember , are the most potent , though often the most unnoticed of all . These remarks have been suggested by the perusal of the first pamphlet which we have set at the head of the present article , and we again express our conviction , that this Report of a Committee of the Clergy of New Haven county , is timely and important . We would suggest too , that their example is one which might well be followed by other clerical bodies . It is difficult to believe that the people at large are not ready to make every proper provision for the clergy , when they know what such provision demands , or in what it consists . One grand cause of the evils complained of in the Report before us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . But a minister in his individual capacity does not like to speak of them . It is an unwelcome task . 1-us motives are liable to be misconstrued . So he keeps silence , though he wishes all the while some one would speak , and the evils continue . But if the clergy in their local Associations , and like organizations , would take up this delicate subject and state the facts of the case , and bring the matters in question to the notice of the public , as the Episcopal clergy of New Haven county have done , we think they would profit by it , and so would our churches also . It is time that something was done in this respect , and we know not how anything effective will be done , except at the instigation of those most concerned , the clergy themselves . A general and united testimony from them would be received as conclusive . Most of our churches would cheerfully correct existing defects , and supply existing wants , and public opinion would soon compel the rest to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to say , under the lead of our second pamphlet , more particularly in regard to ministers themselves and their work . What we have to say , however , will have the form of hints and suggestions , rather than that of a formal discussion of the topics presented for our notice . And at the outset the grand fact meets us , that our country , to say nothing of the world elsewhere , is by no means adequately supplied with the gospel ministry . This is true also , whether we regard the ministry in the aspect of numbers or quality . // There are not men enough in our land whose business it is to preach the gospel from the pulpit , or whose culture will enable them to do so . Nor , again , is what preaching we have such as we ought to have . Those who have had occasion to be conversant with the facts relative to the course of religious affairs on the broad scale , have told us from time to time , during several years past , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of those capable of taking the oversight of our churches . This deficiency has been felt too by individual churches , when they have had occasion to look out a pastor . And yet the Christian public as a whole , have been very insensible to the reality or the bearing of this great fact . They have taken no pains to inquire into its extent , its causes , or its remedies . Meanwhile the fact has , to those who have had eyes to see , gained a greater importance , and excited increasing apprehension continually . As might be anticipated , the Report of the American Education Society , closely connected as that society is with the whole scheme of ministerial education , could not fail to notice the fact in question . Accordingly we find it using the following decisive language on the point . " For several years past , there has been a silent but steady tendency downward , in respect to an adequate supply of ministers . A very uniform testimony upon this point has for some time been coming up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood at the posts of observation , and could take accurate note of what was passing . " ( p. 1* . ) To substantiate this declaration , the authors of the report present some statistics which speak for themselves . They confine their figures to New England , on the presumption that no worse state of things will thus be shown , than is to be found existing throughout the land . They have , accordingly , given us a summary of the operations of the four theological schools of our order in New England , for the period of the last sixteen years . Dividing this period into sections of eight years each , they show that during the first half of the period under survey , that is , from the year 1836 to the year 1843 inclusive , there were graduated , from Andover , Bangor , East Windsor , and New Haven , taken together , five hundred and eighty-eight candidates for the ministry , while during the latter half of the period , that is , from 1841 to 1851 inclusive , there were graduated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disparity of more than a hundred in favor of the earlier years . But this does not exhibit the actual disparity , for that is to be measured in connection with the ministerial demand of the // different periods . On consulting the census returns it will be seen that the population of the country , the number needing the labors of the ministry , increased from the middle of one period of eight years , to the middle of the later period , not less than thirty per cent. , and in New England itself , not less than twenty per cent . Taking the increase of the whole country as the fair basis of ministerial demand upon the seminaries in question , there should have been during the last eight years , seven hundred and sixty-four graduates and candidates for the ministry , instead of the four hundred and eighty-four actually sent out ; and if we confine the basis of demand to New England , there should have been seven hundred and five to meet the wants of the churches , instead of the four hundred and eighty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These figures show but too plainly that the announcements from time to time of a diminishing clerical supply , have not been unfounded . A more minute examination of the figures also shows , that the decline in the number annually offering themselves to the churches , has been steady and continuous . In the year 1837 , the before mentioned theological schools graduated eighty-eight candidates for the ministry , while in the year 1851 , they sent out only forty-nine . These are the extremes of the comparison . But the tables show that during the first eight years under review , the number of graduates in four of those years reached above eighty , while during the later period , they reached as high as seventy in only two instances , and half the time fell below sixty . Now these are facts which deserve to be looked at , and their causes investigated . The churches , the Christian public , should ponder them . The church , the world  --  the world lying in sincannot afford to have such facts existing , unless there are other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question how and whence are our churches to be supplied with the ministry of the word is a vital question , vital to the best intere*ts of man , and the advancement of the Redeemer 's kingdom on earth . Unless we are provided with something to take the place of that ministry , the indications of a deficiency in its supply are of fearful omen . The matter is growing worse too all the while . Nothing appears to check the diminution of which we have been speaking , and unless we mistake as to the causes which have engendered this doctrine , they will continue to operate for some time to come . Any measures which may be taken to counteract this downward tendency of things , will require some time before they can work their expected or legitimate result . Meanwhile the existing deficiency will become more and more manifest , // and the evils incident to it more conspicuous and deeply felt . Measures can not be taken too soon therefore to investigate this matter , and to provide , if possible , a remedy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have produced the present state of things , we can hardly do more than allude to some of them . It has been our purpose rather to call attention to facts , than to propound any theories of remedy . It can require but little reflection upon the subject , however , to convince one that the prevailing defective type of our piety must be a prominent cause of our ministerial deficiency . Our idea of a renewed life is too commonly limited to the one fact of conversion , or rather , we speak and think of religion as something done for us , or put into us once for all , in the indivisible moment of the new birth , not seeming to be aware that birth has its value only as giving the possibility of subsequent life . We talk of gettzng religion , ' as though it were something to be gone after , or we speak of obtaining a hope , ' as though religion , the requirements of the gospel , and the expectations of Christ , were satisfled with the possession of a hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which we are evermore to anchor ourselves and swing at ease . There is too little apprehension of religion as a life , a life renovated in its every part and motive , a life patterned after the holy and divine life of the Saviour , yea , a life wh'ich is hid with Christ in God . How few seem to have this sublime wide-reaching conception of religion ! How much fewer still the number who properly realize it in visible character ! Our religion is an appendage of life rather than life itself ; a part of our character , rather than the rounded whole of it . It is a thing of sabbaths and sanctuaries too exclusively . It does not enter as it should , into our week days and our places of business , hallowing them all and pervading them with a divine presence and a heavenly joy . It is but a partial consecration to God , to truth and to duty . Self-denial is a task from which we shrink , and which is too often left undone , notwithstanding the strongest pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just enough of the renewed about us , to afford a hope of final acceptance rather than to escape from any felt corruptions within , or to possess a character which is holy even as God is holy . Such we think is the prevailing conception , certainly the prevalent realization of religion . Any one can see too , how easy it will be , under such circumstances , for young men of professed piety , to turn aside from the ministry and engage in merchandise , or enlist in some other than the ministerial profession . And the acting incumbents of the ministerial office are in // part responsible for the existence of this state of things . They have preached , to a great extent , an imperfect gospel . They have presented an imperfect ideal of religion in the life . Theoretically , their scheme of religion has been too generally embodied in a rigid form of doctrines , defined and elaborated by some school or schoolman . It has been full of the technics of human philosophy , and comparatively barren of the life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowed its aims to the accomplishment merely of the beginning of the new life , without sufficient regard to the breadth and reach of the gospel demands . It has preached a religion at the same time , mechanical and mathematical . It has measured its value as a ministry by the number and immediate visible effect of its services , rather than by the inherent quality of them and their adaptation to the wants of the spiritual nature of man . Or the pulpit has pandered to the love of novelty and excitement , and our churches have become places of entertainment , religious cafis , where the truth pertaining to life and godliness is served up with all sorts of spices and piquant sauces , adapted to the multifarious tastes of the fastidious public , and he draws the largest house who can display the most varied and tempting bill of fare . Now we apprehend it will not be difficult to understand how , in such a state of things , with such prevalent ideas of religion , and such expositions of religion , taken together with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to be a falling off in the number of those IATho are ready to assume the sacred office of the ministry . The culture of the age , the culture of Providence on the large field of social and national life , has kindled new ideas in the minds of many of the rising race , imparted new views of life , presented the problem of existence under new aspects , given a more spiritual and elevated tone to the feelings and aspirations , and the old theology finds itself left very much in the background . The present generation are not so ready to swear by creeds and platforms as their predecessors have been , nor content to go in a beaten track because their fathers did . Consequently , the ministry , judged by the established patterns of it , looks less inviting to many than it otherwise would . Men of the finest mould and the best spirit sometimes feel a hardly definable shrinking from it . Meanwhile other doors of usefulness , hitherto almost unopened , now swing wide their inviting gates , and beckon many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traffic and mercantile enterprise also come in to entice many , whose piety is not yet settled and firmly bedded , into the // paths of worldly business and ambition . Between these various motives , originating in defective piety , and no less defective theology on the one hand , and the grand material and mercantile developments of the age on the other , we discover some ground at least for the defective clerical supply under which the churches are now suffering . We should not do justice , however , even to our proposed partial treatment of the subject before us , did we not advert here to some errors , theoretical and practical , which have prevailed in reference to the theological training of the ministry , and which have contributed to the production of the state of things which we lament . In the first place , there has been no such just conception in the public minds of the greatness of the ministerial work , considered intellectually , no such idea of its proper reach and grasp over the entire field of human life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate impression of the importance of both great native and acquired abilities in the ministry . It has been generally supposed , indeed , that they who teach goodness must themselves be good , and therefore piety has been deemed indispensable in the preacher of the Gospel . This is right . Goodness is the first and pr&amp;iminent endowment of an effective ministry . Without it all else is of no account . But it has not been properly understood , how much of intellectual force and sagacity are requisite to the most successful prosecution of the ministerial work ; how much of hard , severe , wearying thought is demanded of him who would meet all the varying occasions of life , and the varied wants and circumstances of his people , with the proper applications of truth . It has quite generally been thought a very easy thing for the preacher to discourse twice or thrice a week from the word of God , in addition to other pastoral duties . And so any young man giving credible evidence of piety , has been thought fit to . be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so lacking in force of character , as hardly to have given a reasonable hope of being able to get a living by the ordinary pursuits of life , the chances have often been greatly in his favor , that his unintelligent piety would be regarded as of an eminently spiritual type , and because he had not enough of individuality about him , to prevent his bowing with most unquestioning assent to creeds and catechisms , and whatever bore the stamp of orthodoxy , the good fathers and mothers in Israel have too often set him down at once as proper material for the ministry . Thus encouraged , he has , by dint of dry digging , been able perhaps to pass through college and enter the theologiccl school . But all the while he has // 129 The Church and its Ministry . become no stronger in his own resources . The internal force within him is no greater than it was years ago . What he has is a *mere dry accumulation from books , a mass of other men s thoughts , and worth but little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gamaliels of theology , his easy negative nature is made the mere recipient of a system of doctrine ready morticed and dove-tailed to his hand , concerning which , he finds it most conducive to his comfort to raise no doubts , and engage in no speculations of his own . The impression is made upon his mind , that to be Orthodox is everything , and to be Orthodox he has only to believe and write down the lectures which are read to him . If perchance a fellow-student thinks he sees a joint in the theological system presented to him , which is not as well fitted as it might be , or asks for the reconciliation of seemingly opposing facts , he perhaps hears him denied any adequate explanation , and told to go to his dormitory and pray over the matter . Having however passed the prescribed term at the seminary , our student now goes forth licensed , to try his hand at preaching the Gospel , and at once proceeds to give the people the treasure of his lecture-room note-book ; often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the mere echo of his teachers , and often a false echo at that . He preaches consciously from the license which men have given him , rather than from a license bestowed by God , and speaks from rusty bodies of divinity , rather than from the experiences of his own soul . His discourses are , in fact , so many lectures on the anatomy and physiology of the soul , illustrated not from the recent subject , not from the actual body of flesh and blood , but from woodcuts and copperplate . Such has been too often the history of our ministry . Such too often had been its training . And its results are what might have been expected . God has blessed its good endeavors in the renewal of many souls . But the ministry to a large extent have not impressed men with a vivid and pervading sense of the greatness , the scope , and the surpassing importance of the Gospel demands . They have encouraged the notion that religion is a matter of time and seasons , of frames and moods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple conversion , and religion has under their teachings come to be very much a matter of church going , the value and quality of one 's piety being very generally measured by the frequency with which he is found in some place ofpublic worship . We have had too few men in the ministerial office , who have been able to impress their hearers generally with a proper // sense of spiritual things , and to make them feel that they are , in all places and at all times , surrounded by the powers of the world to come . We have had too few who have been expounders of the word of God , in the proper sense of that term . Our preachers have I*een , too commonly , the expounders of human systems , of other men 's sermons and creeds , rather than of the word of God as the Holy Ghost has given them utterance through the door of their own vital experience . This , as we have said , has been the result of erroneous ideas and expectations in regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also of the prevalent mode of training men for the ministry . Neither ministers nor their hearers have been sufficiently independent of the trammels of theological systems , or of educational routine . With the great and true ideas of great minds , we have imbibed their mistaken and pernicious ones , and have been too ready to let those who have gone before do our thinking for us . Hearers have been too ready to take the expositions and philosophies of ministers without questioning , and ministers have been too ready to go the treadmill round of some school , or system-maker in their preaching . These dispositions we think are clearly among the more prominent causes which have thrown the ministry , in a sense , behind the age . The causes lying still back of these , we have not space now to discuss , though it would not be amiss or unimportant to do so . We shall close what we have to say , by suggesting briefly some hints looking toward a better state of things . What we want then is a higher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea upon the general mind . We want a wide-spread , deeply practical conviction , that religion is not a thing of sabbaths , and sanctuaries , and prayer meetings , merely , but the great , constant , ever-pressing , topmost business of life , the great occupation of man . We want the conviction , the pervading conviction , that religion is not an insuiance policy , guaranteeing one against final perdition , but that rather , as its etymology signifies , which binds a man back to God , from whom sin has sundered him , and so binds him to his true normal position now , as well as makes sure to him his future welfare . And to this end , among other influences and agencies , we want a ministry that can rise above the systems of the schools , however good and valuable in their place , and escape the constraints which they have such a strong tendency to cast about those who accept them . We wa1nt a ministry also that can come down from its cloistered study , and mingle more with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre // pared to adapt its teachings to them . This preaching on " the exceeding sinfulness of sin " is not what the world wants . It wants Nathans who can say " thou art the man , " and say it in such a way , that the truth shall show itself the sword of the Spirit . It wants men in the pulpit who can send the precepts of the divine word through all the channels of business , into the countinr-room and work-shop , into the political caucus , and the gathering of the drawing-room , and make men feel that God and his truth are with them everywhere . And we have often thought that our present system of theological education in the seminary , tends to make the ministry less practical and adapted to the actual and infinitely varied circumstances of real life than it otherwise would be , or certainly might be . As the matter now is , we take a young man who has been shut up in the academy and college seven years , and shutting him up for three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send him out into the world to preach the Gospel . There could hardly be a more sudden or complete change of one 's condition than is thus occasioned . From an almost total seclusion from the actual world , he is cast at once into its great seething caldron of activities and passions . From the companionship of books , or a select few , whose feelings , tastes and pursuits are akin to his own , he is thrust at once into the company of those most unlike in habits and occupations . From the quiet of the school he is ushered into the din and whirl of the world 's marts and mechanisms , its pleasures and its agonies , its good and its evil of every sort and of every grade . Such a transition can not but give a shock to the whole nature of the young minister of the word . It is like throwing one suddenly into the water , who , though he may have read many treatises upon the art of swimming , and may have settled most accurately the philosophy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand or a foot in the water , or ventured where he could not touch bottom . Figure aside , nothing would seem more likely than that the young man , who , on tak* ing his parish charge , is thus confronted with sin in real life , rather than with sin in the books , and in place of cool theories of virtue and vice , of motive and conduct , meets the beating hearts of his fellow-men with the living tides of feeling and purpose coursing through them , should be appalled and discon* certed , and in his bewilderment and ignorance , should pattern his conduct after some minister who has gone before him , and drive his theology in the rut which he has made for him . The chance is that for years , such a man will be worth little to his parish , except barely to keep alive in them the chomforta .. // ble knowledge that they have some one regularly in their pulpit , and as the phrase is , are " enjoying the means of grace . " The chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person , if he ever recover himself , and is able to stand on his own feet , will carry not a few of the habits of his rawness and inexperience with him through life . But if , instead of being thus plunged suddenly into the unknown , untried realities of life , he had been introduced to them gradually , he would very likely have met them wisely , and from the outset would have been a better minister of the Gospel . The old plan of educating candidates for the sacred office in the study of some settled pastor , instead of in a herd , crowded in the class-room of a professor , had the advantage , in this respect at least , over the arrangement now prevailing . It took the student day by day from his books to the practical work of the pastor . He rode with his teacher to visit the sick and the dying , and he practised the preaching art under the eye of the dominie , at the village school-house of an evening , or in the best room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Saturday night meeting for prayer and conference . Thus he was from the outset a kind of colleague pastor , and it was a comparatively slight transition from such a position to that of the sole charge of a parish . The thousand questions of the practical application of the Gospel to actual life and conduct , which everywhere arise , had already come up , and in some mode had been solved . For ourselves , therefore , while we do not think our present course of instruction furnishes by any means a superfluity of doctrinal and historical equipment for the ministry , we should like to see that old parish training grafted upon it , and rather than not have it we would be willing to exchange one of the three years of the seminary course , for a year of practical instruction with some acting pastor . And we will suggest that this practical equipment might now be attained without lengthening the present term of study , by a somewhat different arrangement of it . Let the study of books as such , he confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then let the student be required to spend the three or four warm months of each of his three seminary years in the company of some settled pastor . This would divide the year in the manner most congenial to the purposes of the student , and would give him relaxation , for it would be such , at the season of the year when there is least inclination for systematic appliance to books* and least profit in it , while it would occupy that season in a manner no less profitable than any other of the year . If need be too , // one might support himself pecuniarily during his short terms in the country , by teaching the district school while receiving his pastoral education , though many a pastor would be ready to receive a well behaved student as a member of his household gratuitously , in consideration of his society , and the nameless assistances which he might render him , especially if students were to be licensed to preach , at the discr*tion of the pastors under whose charge they might for the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the case , until just as they are expected to become full blown pastors . If we consider for a moment our present system of theological education , in comparison with that prevalent in the medical profession , it may serve to place our preceding remarks in their proper light . It is not , as every one knows , all that is requisite to the proper practice of the healing art , that one shall have attended one or more courses of lectures upon the theory and practice of medicine , though it may have been under the most accomplished instructors . It is expected that he will have prepared himself to profit to the utmost from such lectures by a previous course of study , in the society of some practising physician , and then it is equally expected that he will learn the upplication of the instructions of the lecture-room by subsequently accompanying of such a physician in his daily rc*und of practice . No amount of study or information gathered from books and lectures , is deemed an adequate equipment for a practitioner of medicine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected fees , who has not that best passport to the confidence of the sick , the observation of the practical application of remedial agents by one already established in the profession . And pray , is there less need of an acquaintance , on the part of the newly licensed preacher of the Gospel , with the practical applications , the remedies of the system of grace than there is , in the other case , with those of the materia medica ? Will no amount of attendance upon courses of lectures give one confidence with the public , so that they will entrust to him the care of their bodies , and ought a two or three years sitting in the class-room of a theological seminary , to be thought sufficient to fit one for the cure of souls ? It is enough to ask such questions , and it is only because mankind think so much more of their bodies than they do of their souls , that they are willing , as they so often are , to sit under the ministrations of those so crude and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel . It deserves consideration also , we think , whether a better result of education would not be attained by our seminaries , if , // instead of the present courses of written lectures upon systematic theology , for instance , there were substituted , to a greater or less extent , a different scheme , under which the Bible , in the hands alike of instructor and instructed , and in the original tongues , should be the point of departure for every inquiry , and the constant source of appeal and proof . In other words , let the theology taught , be more the theology of the Bible , and less that of schools and sects . There is a disposition in the best men to overvalue their own favorite philosophical systems and explanations of truth , and a disposition equally strong almost on the part of others , and especially the young , to accept any well adjusted scheme of doctrine , as being an adequate summary and exposition of biblical truth . In this there is a tendency adverse to that familiarity with the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It tends to make the Scriptures a book of reference too often for proof-texts to support a preconceived and adopted philosophy , or a mere dictionary of quotations with which to garnish a rhetorical essay in the pulpit . It would obviate these dangers , to a great extent certainly , if the grand truths and facts of religion were studied topically and directly from the word of God ; if , for instance , the atonement were announced as the theme of study , at a given time , and all were to come on the appointed day , Bible in hand , and report what they had gathered upon this subject from the whole wide field of Scripture ; the teacher , meanwhile , correcting misinterpretations , adding further illustrations , and applying the resources of his philosophy and learning to adjust the different parts of the great central truth , and to give it definiteness in the conceptions of his class and a harmony with the general system of doctrine . It seems to us that , under such a scheme of instruction , the Scriptures would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are not apt to have under the present arrangement of things , and that our young theologians would be less the disciples of any human master , and mightier in the Scriptures , than they now are . Their knowledge would be more consciously their own , and it would be in their own heads and hearts , rather than in note books and bodies of divinity on the shelves of the library . With such , or other modifications of our schemes of theological education , and a loftier ideal of the ministerial work in the minds of the people at large , there should be added the disposition on the part of local churches to discern promising talent in the young , and to secure it for the ministry . They should give the pious young man of superior powers of mind to understand that there is no calling so important , and none in itself so // noble , as that of vindicating the ways of God to man and expounding that stupendous scheme of redemption which " angels desire to look into . " Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solicitations of worldly gain or aggrandizement in determining his grand occupation in life . The church should come forth with her appeals and secure him to herself . She should give him to understand that she has a work for him to do above that of teaching the catechism or rehearsing systems of doctrine drawn out by men as fallible as himself . She should tell him that she expects him to look into his own heart and into the untrammeled word of God , and as the Holy Spirit interprets to him the one by the other , and as he beholds himself reflected in those around him , so to speak , as God 's ambassador , responsible for what he says and what he thinks , to no council or judicatory of the church , but to God alone . She should tell him that he is to speak because commissioned of God , not because licensed of men , and thit he is to speak what God , in his personal communings with him , gives him to know and to say . When the church is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to train them properly for their work , when she rightly estimates that work herself and is no longer satisfied with the " decent debility " which one has charged as being the aim of preaching on the other side of the Atlantic , when the preachers of the gospel are given to understand that they are to preach  --  and for themselves are determined that they will preach  --  the gospel , as God interprets it to their individual consciousness , and not any mere human compilations of doctrine , however good ; when they shall no longer be obliged , on penalty of the ban of the church and the brand of heresy , to ask whether their convictions of truth square with Oxford or Cambridge , with Edwards or with Calvin , before they give utterance to them ; when , in short , the church and the preacher alike feel that he is anointed of God and not by the fathers or his contemporaries , to proclaim a living gospel , a gospel of facts and not of philosophies , a gospel of life and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the conduct and its command upon all the pursuits of man , and overarches them with the constant presence of God and the great realities of eternity , then we shall look for both a more abundant and a better ministry than we now have , and shall expect the church to arise and shine because her light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon her .
