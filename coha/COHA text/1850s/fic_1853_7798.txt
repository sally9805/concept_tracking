Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : MONODY ON THE DEATH OF HORATIO GREENOUGH. from Monody on the death of Horatio Greenough ( 1853 ) The generous hopes of youth Are firstlings of our procreant being ; Born while the heart is newly seeing Great visions of the truth . Life 's morning glows with fires , Reddening the soul with lusty flashes , That , ere its noon , are silent ashes Of dead dreams and desires . He is the highest man , Whose dreams die not ;  --  in whom the ideal , Surging for ever , makes life real , Ending where it began , In visionary deeds ;  --  By plastic will deserted never , His life-long joy and sweet endeavor To prosper Beauty 's seeds . ' T is he helps Nature 's might , Echoing her soul , whether it crieth , Or silent speaks ; and when he dieth , On Earth there is less light . Then mourn , my country ! Shed Deep tears from thy great lids , and borrow Night 's gorgeous gloom to deck thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A crownd son of Art And thee ; lifted by love and duty To his high work of marble beauty , Coining thereon his heart . Quick is grief 's shadow sped Across the seas to Tuscan mountains , Darkening the depths of living fountains By Art and Friendship fed . That peopled solitude , The Studio , where , amid his creatures , Broodeth the God , his busy features Irradiant with his mood , Is orphaned now ; and pale , Each sculptured child seems sadly listening For the warm look , that came in glistening With a fresh morning hail . These are his inmost heirs ; In them still pulse his heart 's best beatings , Of soul and thought deep nuptial greetings : What most was his , is theirs . And they are ours . Our sight Grows strong , as , compassing this gifted Enmarbled life , we are uplifted :  --  On Earth there is more light .
