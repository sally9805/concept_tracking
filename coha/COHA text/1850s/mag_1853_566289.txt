txt ART . I X.-TIIE COMPLETE ACADEMIC EDUCATION OF FEMALES . THE present Article is a Report , written by one of the Contributors of this Journal , Rev. Samuel Harris , of Pittsfield , Mass. , and read by him at a Convention of gentlemen from several different States convened at Pittsfield , March 31 , 1853 , to discuss the subject of Female education . As this Conven .. tion was called in connection with the " Young Ladies ' Institute " in that place , the report had references to that Institution , which , with the consent of the writer , we omit-presenting our readers with the discussion of the general question . We may add , that the entire report , together with the doings of the Convention , will be published in pamphlet form . Female Education is a topic which has become familiar even to weariness . A considerable amount of well-directed thought has been expended on it ; some of the best minds of the country have devoted themselves to its advancement ; and real improvement has been made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , experiment , and theorizing ; its first principles can scarcely be said to be settled ; and the public mind is undetermined both as to what a complete Academic education for females is , and what are the best means of realizing it . We do not propose to consider what is the best education which it is practicable for all girls to obtain . While we yield to none in our advocacy of universal education , we believe that there are higher departments of female culture which are indispensable . Many parents are seeking for their daughters , many daughters are seeking for themselves , the highest mental culture and attainments . Confining our remarks to this higher department of female training , we propose to show what is the true idea of a complete Academic training for girls , what is its necessity , and what the best means of realizing it and of giving permanence to the institutions in which it is acquired . J rJ7flJ* TRUE IDEA OF A COMPLETE ACADEMIC EDUCATION FOR GIRLS . We dismiss , for the present , all inquiries respecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education itself , with the purpose of determining its character and extent . 1 . It must be adapted to woman 's peculiar constitution and sphere . Woman is not inferior to man , but she is different from him . If inferior in some respects , she is superior in others . In her sphere she is as perfect as man is in his ; and where each , when first from the Creator 's hand , was perfect , it is idle to ask which is superior . If she has less strength and swiftness , she has more delicacy and beauty . If , in her mental constitution , she has less of the logical , she has more of the Intuitive ; if less of the prudential , she has more of the spontaneous ; if less of the passions characterized by desire , she has more of the emotional and affectionate . A due regard to the physical and mental peculiarities of the female constitution will modify , not so much the course of study to make it differ from that of boys , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school , and its entire organization and arrangement . The whole system should be planned , with the design not only of avoiding injury to the physical frame , but of sending out the girl , at the completion of her course , in the bloom and elasticity of the highest health . And in all its parts it should so harmonize with the female nature , that , while controlling , it may not crush it , nor stiffen the manners into mechanical precision , but send forth the educated girl with all the fresh and gushing feelings of a true woman 's heart . *Equally must the whole course of her education be planned // with regard to her future sphere of life . Her sphere is home . Here is her throne , from which her influence pervades society to its circumference . That is her best education which best fits her for this sphere ; for here her whole intellectual and moral character is most fully called into exercise ; and the education which best fits her for it , must most fully and harmoniously develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers may need to give additional attention to particular studies or accomplishments . But , even in these cases , an education for the station of the wife and the mother will be the best foundation for the professional acquirements of the teacher . Therefore the usual college-course , adapted to the wants of boys , is unfit , without modification , to the best female culture . The attempts to force this system unmodified on girls , and to train them , as if their sphere of action were to be the same with that of men , can only be disastrous . 2 . A complete Academic education should furnish to girls an equivalent to the college-course for boys ; as thorough culture and discipline of mind , as extensive attainments , and a corresponding completeness of preparation for the highest stations of woman in society . We are aware that the very mention of a collegiate education for girls is wont to awaken ridicule . If this springs from narrow and even heathenish views of woman 's position and claims , it is but the expression of covert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here be rebutted . So far as it has jtrisen from the extravagant promises and shortlived existence of various institutions styled female colleges , in which the attainments were as meagre as the pretensions were fulsome , and which have met the failure necessary to attempts to realize impracticable theories , the ridicule has a legitimate object , and ought not to prejudice our endeavor to feel our way to what is wise and practicable . If this ridicule has been originated by the absurdity of forcing on girls a college system adapted only to boys , and , if applied to girls , adapted only to send out on the world an array of graduated women-female grenadiers-formidably fitted for all the activities of man , it casts no reproach on our system , which , while it demands an equivalent to a college-course , adapts the entire education to the peculit*rities and the sphere of woman . In claiming that girls should receive an education equivalent to what a college imparts to the other sex , it seems to be thought that we are claiming something exceedingly magnificent . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XL 38 // entirely beyond the compass of female attainments . But in reality the attainments acquired in college are not very great . It is only a popular delusion which magnifies them . Our colleges rank nearly with the schools and gymnasia which are preparatory to English and continental Universities . And whatever opinion the young man may have of himself in the flush of commencement-day , when , after a few years of further progress , he looks back to his graduation , he can hardly resist the conviction that his attainments were only insignificant1 Is it less than ridiculous to describe an equivalent attainment as entirely surpassing the necessities and capacity of females ? The true end of a college course is to impart that discipline of mind , those rudiments of learning , the capacity and the instruments of acquiring knowledge , which will enable the student successfully to prosecute his researches at pleasure . The college is not a professional school ; it only prepares the student to commence the studies and duties of his active life . The same is the true aim of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad foundation on which to build the superstructure of future attainments . It is like clearing and breaking up a piece of wild land , which brings it into a condition to bear any kind of harvest which the farmer may choose to raise upon it . The same must be the end contemplated in the complete Academic education of girls . It must be equivalent to a college course in imparting as thorough culture and discipline of mind , as extensive attainments , and a corresponding completeness of preparation for the higher stations of woman in society . 3 . A complete Academic education for girls requires a course of study having the unity and system of a college course , so that , from the beginning of the preparatory studies , all the parts of the course may harmonize in promoting the best development of the female mind . The boy , from the moment he begins to fit for college until he graduates , is subjected to the discipline of one harmonious system , each part fitted to every other part , and the whole working every moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his progress , he is receiving the development and discipline imparted by this system , which has been compacted by the wisdom of ages for this very purpose . Even if he removes from one college to another , he still finds the same system , is subjected to the same influences , and borne along to the same result . When he graduates , if he has gone through and not been merely carried through , the impress of that training is on his whole being and is conspicuous through all his life , marking him as a liberally educated man . // No such system exists for the other sex . The wisdom of ages has compacted nothing like it for them . Each school has its own methods and aims , differing from each other and often contradictory . Individual schools have often no plan of study for their own guidance , but the pupils study what their own caprice dictates . Many of them , originated as pecuniary adventures , adopt only such schemes as are most popular and will soonest fill the pockets of the proprietors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often is , A few terms at some village or city school near home ; a session at one fashionable school and a session at another ; a few months ' lessons from a private teacher in music .  --  and this is called female education ! What wonder if the very words have come to be associated with charlatanry What we claim , and what we believe , that woman , with the consciousness of real and long-endured injustice , has a right to claim , is the opportunity of systematic and comprehensive culture , a system of education compacted expressly for the highest and happiest culture of the female mind , harmoniously bearing , in all its parts , on this one end , sufficiently extensive to realize the result , and sending forth the woman stamped with the beautiful imprint of a thorough education , and as completely invigorated and equipped for her future sphere as at the end of the college-course , the young man is for his . 4 . Like the college-course , the Academic education of girls should discipline the mind by the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The principal aim of an Academic course is to discipline and develop the mind . It must awaken a desire for knowledge and incorporate into the soul an imperishable taste for intellectual pursuits ; it must develop and strengthen the faculties and enable the mind to control their action and to use them in acquiring knowledge and investigating truth ; it must lay open the field of knowledge , that the mind may know in what direction to seek it ; and it must provide the instruments of knowledge and skill in using them . An Academic education which does not aim at these results is a farce ; it is raising a superstructure without first laying a foundation . The attempt to cram the mind with information without the laborious process of disciplining it , is like putting money " into a bag with holes , " or putting water into a sieve . It compels the luckless pupil , like Penelope , to weave a web each day which will certainly be all unraveled each night . In the education of boys this has long been an acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is equally essential in the education of girls . In each sex education is an impossibility , unless it secures the discipline of the mind . To this end substantially the same studies are needed in each sex . Though the female mind has its peculiarities , yet it is a mind , and in all essentials the same with that of a man . Therefore that which will best develop and discipline the one , is substantially the same which will best develop and discipline the other . One of the most distinguished female teachers of New England used to say that ten years afterwards it made no difference what a girl had learned at school , provided she had acquired a proper mental discipline . The remark is true in its spirit , recognizing the preeminence of mental discipline , which , once gained , qualifies the pupil for a life-time of well-directed intellectual acquisition , influence , and enjoyment . But the form of expression may suggest the error that for the purpose of mental discipline it is immaterial what a scholar studies . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline the mind equally with another . And for the purpose of strengthening and disciplining the mind , the college-course of study is the best ever devised . It imparts the use of those two grand engines of the mind 's operations , language and mathematics ; by its diverse yet harmonious studies it quickens all the intellectual tastes , strengthens equally all the faculties , and secures a rounded and harmonious development of the whole mind . It is fashionable in some quarters to decry the college system ; but by enlightened minds who understand that , in education , discipline takes precedence of acquisition , that it is impossible to cram an undisciplined mind with knowledge , that attention to one or two favorite departments produces ill-balanced and erratic minds , and that the subsequent usefulness and enjoyment derived from education depends on the completeness of the mental culture , rather than on the extent of the acquisitions , the college-system will long be acknowledged as the best method of Academic training . It is then a foolish sneer to ask what girls have to do with Latin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have anything to do with them , the discipline of mind which the study of them imparte*l remains and shows itself in all the acts of life ; and no other studies could so effectually have imparted that indispensable discipline . 5 . A portion of the languages and sciences pursued in a college , must give place in female education to the fine arts , the modern languages , and a more extended study of history and English literature . This is essential to polish and adorn the // mind , to impart that peculiar finish which is necessary to give its highest beauty to the female mind , and to confer the accomplishments needed to enable her to enliven her sphere . Mathematics should be pursued at least to the extent of mastering Algebra and Euclid . The Latin language should be studied , not only because admirably fitted to discipline th' intellect , but as the best accessible language for acquiring a knowledge of universal grammar , and as the parent of the Southern European languages and of a large part of our own . The higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but may be pursued at the option of those who have time and taste for them . In the increasing intercourse with Europe , ability to read and speak French is indispensable to a thoroughly educated woman . Either drawing or instrumental music , according to the taste of the pupil , should constitute a part of the prescribed course . A talent for graceful and interesting conversation is one of the most important of female accomplishments . On it the cultivated woman greatly depends to illuminate and vivify her sphere of action , and to extend her influence in society . It should be a special aim of female education to cultivate it . For this end , a wide aequaintance with literature , the mental tastes which it awakens , and the habits engendered by a discriminating criticism , are important . By this combination of severe studies with the ornamental , the mind will be at once strengthened and disciplined , polished and refined , and will receive the full , firm , and graceful development which befits the woman and unfolds alike her loveliness and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be equal in amount to a college-course. 6 . We have spoken only of intellectual culture . It is hardly necessary to add , that the whole course should be planned with reference to the paramount importance of moral and religious education . 7 . It must also be added , that an enlightened and practical regard to the inferior strength and the peculiar wants of woman 's physical constitution , must pervade and control the whole system . With reference to this the amount of study must be determined , the time divided , the table regulated , and the whole school arranged . And there must be , not only daily exercise , but the daily opportunity of complete relaxation and exhilarating exercise . In the foregoing principles of female education , it will be perceived that we do not claim a college education for girls , but only its equivalent modified to meet their peculiar wants . Should a system based on these principles be matured and // adopted in one or two seminaries , it might reasonably be hoped that it would commend itself to public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ultimately might come to be recognized as the standard of a complete Academic education for women , as the college-course is the acknowledged standard of a liberal education for men . II . THE DEMAND FOR A COMPLETE ACADEMIC FEMALE EDtrcATIoN . The strength and self-reliance which education imparts , its power to liberalize the mind , the new and inexhaustible sources of pleasure which it opens , the new interests with which it illumines every object in the universe , the aid which it gives to virtue and piety , are the right of woman not less than of man . In truth , secluded as she is from the great world , shut up to converse with her own thoughts , having her peculiar trials and sorrows , there are peculiar reasons why she should have opened to her all the fountains of joy which gush up in and around , a cultivated mind . Presiding , as she does , over the fountain-head of all education , entrusted with the training and moulding of every human being during the first dozen years of life , bearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every individual as he sets forth for immortality , and thus exerting more influence on society than all other human influences combined ; there are the strongest reasons why she should have all the qualifications which education can impart . The very names , wife and mother , are the mightiest talismans to move the rugged hearts of men . She who is to wield such an influence is entitled to an education as systematic , as thoroughly compacted , as complete in its results as that of man . It is the climax of absurdity to deluge the earth with eulogiums of the mother 's influence , and yet leave unsettled and even uninvestigated the first principles of the mother 's own training . We do not demand for the whole sex a complete Academic education . We cordially desire education to be universal in its highest possible degree . We desire it for the general good ; we desire it not less for the success of our own plans , since the more nearly universal and the better is the education of the whole sex , the more will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we do not pretend that this higher education is either to be expected or desired for all . If a woman s entire life must be consumed in manual labor , surrounded by ignorance and boorishness , it may be a doubtful kindness to awaken tastes which can never be gratified , *and which can manifest their existence only by // the pain of denying them . In the abstract it may be true that such an education would be a universal blessing . But , as society is , it is neither practicable nor desirable ; and it is not worth while to propound a theory of education wich can be realized only in the Millennium . Nevertheless , our position is not opposed to universal education , but coincident with it . The true theory of education does not contemplate the same education for all ; but adequate provisions for every grade of education , accessible to all who choose to avail themselves of them ; so that each may prose* cute his education to that extent which his own capacities , tastes , and future course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose is the natural growth of a system of general education , and is essential to make it complete . Education , diffused in the lower schools , will awaken in many minds aspirations for higher attainments , while it will prove their capacity to make such attainments . Hence the demand for a more complete Academic training , grows directly out of the general education of the people . The more extensive and complete that education is , the greater the demand for the higher schools . Therefore the Common-School System remains glaringly defective until this demand is met . In the case of boys it is provided for by the colleges , which are the natural head of the educational system , and ought to be recognized as such . But there is nothing analogous for girls . Hence some facilities for imparting such an education for girls are essential to remove a glaring defect of our present system , to give to it completeness , and to supply the demands which its action on the community creates . Though comparatively few may obtain such an education , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have capacity , energy , and disposition to acquire it , is based alike on the rights of woman and the demands of society . It is essential not only to the advantage*of the individual educated , but to the best interests of society . This claim has the same basis with the claims of the colleges . It is neither expected nor desired that all young men should enter college . Yetit is indispensable that opportunities for obtaining a college education be provided . It is the right of young men who have the capacity , energy , and disposition to acquire such an education and thus fit themselves for the highest stations . It is indispensable to the welfare of the country , to qualify young men for the professions and for stations of public trust , to create an American literature , to advance science , and , by advancing science , to promote an enlightened and productive // agriculture and inventions in the mechanic arts . We include even the mechanic arts , because , though the actual invention is often hit upon by ingenious minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention is based and without which it would forever have been unknown , depends on the highest education of colleges for its advancement . Similar arguments are applicable to the higher education of girls . Some women are destined to move in circles of literature and intellectual cultivation . They have a right to an opportunity to qualify themselves by education to appreciate and to adorn such society . Some women must be the wives of professional men , of judges , foreign ministers , and presidents . They have a right to facilities for qualifying themselves by education to honor , in these positions , themselves , their husbands , and their country . Some women have genius capable of enriching American literature . They have a right to the best facilities for cultivating it . Education elevates a woman as really as a man , and so fits her to rise above the station in which she was born , and to grace the more influential stations of society . She has a right not less than the man , to opportunities of elevating herself and her social position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuits , unhappily far more rare among men ; and were it only to give to them the opportunity of intellectual culture , facilities for the highest education would be desirable . Many women have wealth ; and they demand an education capable of fitting them to adorn the abodes of wealth , and to infuse into that portion of society , tastes for something more elevated than fashion and show . Here opens an important argument founded on the wants of American society . We ought not to be blind to the evils resulting from the energy and activity of American life . Such are , the almost continual absence of the father from home , the lack of leisure and rational enjoyment , the absorption of all the energies in business and the tendency to the predominance of the meaner and more worldly passions . Therefore home is in danger of becoming an eating-house , rather than a home ; and men the feeders , rather than the fathers of their children . The prevalence of a more genial and liberal culture would be a powerful check on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole character of society . To woman , giving the tone to domestic and social intercourse , we must chiefly // look to infuse this genial influence into social life . Though the sons must usually commence early the toils of their future business , a larger portion of the daughters are exempt from this necessity , and may acquire the highest culture of education , which will enable them to give a purer and more elevated tone to American society , and to supply , in both senses of the word , our deficiency in the Humanities . A reasonable independence in life , as it regards livelihood and position in society , demands opportunities for a complete Academic education for woman . Though a happy marriage is the most desirable lot of woman , it can not be the lot of all . The census of 1840 showed twenty thousand more females than males in three of the smaller old states . Therefore some , every way qualified to preside in the domestic circle , must remain single . Yet at present it is too true that marriage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent on their own exertions for a livelihood , present many a tragic story . Even to the wealthy , failure to marry is often a detriment to the influence and happiness , which may well be dreaded . Therefore the great anxiety of parents is to have their daughters settled in life , and , in their anxiety for this , they sometimes resort to arts not consistent with an enlightened regard to the daughter 's welfare , or encourage matches having no recommendation but wealth and a prosperous business . The daughter catches the corresponding spirit , and long before the period of youth is passed , is thoroughly imbued with the sentiment that the one end of her existence is to get a husband . This precocious development of the feelings pertaining to conjugal love , whether it tends to a morbid and romantic sensibility or to a calculating and heartless husband-hunting , must be injurious alike to the intellect and the heart ; and under the united effects of this unnatural stimulus and of the instinct for marriage , it is not strange that the girl sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to be relieved from this necessity of marriage as her only resource . While she should feel that a happy marriage puts her in the most desirable position , she should also have reason for the conviction that marriage is not indispensable to happiness , that an ill-assorted marriage is more to be dreaded than life-long maidenhood , and that , if unmarried , she may still feel a reasonable independence , and have resources adapted to her happiness , and , if needed , to her support . Precisely here is the reason , so far as it has any just reason , // for the agitation of the subject of woman 's rights . Precisely here are the reasons by which the movers of this strange agitation have gained the attention and the countenance of the few intelligent men who have been disposed , even in a partial degree , to extend to them their sympathy . Extravagant as are the claims set up , they may best be met , not by ridiculing their misguided extravagance , but by investigating the wrongs of woman in this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by devising an adequate relief . We welcome any " SONG or TIlE SHIRT , " which turns public attention and sympathy in this direction ; and the extravagance of a few misguided women , whose very history is a proof of the evils of an incomplete and ill-balanced training , and of the need of a welladapted , harmonious , and complete culture , will not be lost , if it still further concentrate public attention on the reality of the evil and the necessity of a remedy . Our subject does not lead to a discussion of this evil in all its comprehensiveness ; nor does it suggest a remedy which will reach at once the extent of the difficulty . But it suggests a complete remedy to the evil for all who are competent to attain it . In truth , the more coml ) lete a girl 's education is , the better her prospect of marrying well , and , at the same time , the surer her resources of honorable independence , if she does not marry . A young woman , whose education qualifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , is almost sure of a livelihood in an employment which though toilsome , is at once delightful , honorable and useful , and precisely in the line of woman s highest calling , as the teacher of the infancy and childhood of all mankind . But a complete education , such as we have sketched , insures to any young womau , of ordinary tact , a certain support , and an honorable and useful , if not a fash ionable position in society . If she has a competence , it opens resources of enjoyments and influence ; if she has not , and in the changes of American society the richest may become poor , it gives the means of support . And it is reasonable to claim , as a right of woman , access to facilities for acquiring such an education . We will state here a fact , showing the demand for an education as complete as we have described . The reports of the societies engaged in sending teachers to the West state , that they encounter a difficulty in procuring teachers sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they demand teachers , having more of the accomplishments of music , modern languages , and drawing . Nuns , with all the gracefulness and accomplishments which the most finished edu // cation in Italy can impart , gain patronage as teachers on account of their superior accomplishments . With these our teachers must compete . They must have opportunity to qualify themselves for the competition . Here the subject opens broadly out upon all the educational , the moinl , and the religious interests of America . That the young shall be rightly trained is essential to our national wellbeing . This needs no argument . The first and the most important influences exerted in the universal education of the race , must come from woman . And here her position as the teacher of the young , whether in the family or the school , discloses all its momentous relations to the destiny of the nation . The Romish church has always understood the necessity of employing women to sustain and propagate religion . With her system , she can select a few , consecrated to celibacy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work assigned them , can employ them to uphold and extend among the young the influence of the church . With her usual consummate skill , that church secures the servicesof some of every class , in order that thus all classes may feel her influence . The lady of wealth is made a Lady Superior , a Prioress , or Abbess , where she retains her rank and yet labors for the church ; and those of humbler stations are admitted to positions among some Sisters of Charity , where they are at once pleased with the consciousness of influence and employed in the work which they are best fitted to perform . Protestantism can avail itself of no such machinery . Abiding by the natural relations of life , it has undertaken , not in pretense but in reality , to lift the whole population up to the intelligence and purity of true Christianity . The work is such , in its very nature , as no delegated agency can perform . It can be accomplished only as the good , in their several spheres of life , toil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitally essential as in the Romish system . But it can be secured only as women individually feel their responsibility and labor for the result . Hence the necessity of increasing the number of rightly educated women , who understand their position as the educators of the race , and have the qualification to educate them aright . Every family where such a mother presides , effects something to the right training of the people . Every young woman who spends a longer or shorter period in teaching school is accomplishing the same great work . And it is only by labors like these that Protestantism can perform the indispensable work of educating the young , and thus accomplish for good , what , by its machinery , Rome so much more cheaply accomplishes for evil . // Here then is a work resting on educated women , which men can never perform . Every educated woman should feel her obligation to contribute to its accomplishment . Every female school should train its pupils to act from these enlarged and Christian motives , and to consecrate their education to the elevation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teaching of schools for a longer or shorter period should he confined only to those who are compelled to resort to it for support . The daughter of the late President was engaged in teaching a school during part of her father 's presidential term . While the example is a significant illustration of the simplicity of our political institutions , it is invaluable as a lesson , teaching the wealthy and refined , that no abundance of wealth or elevation of position can excuse the daughters of America from the obligation to activity in the education of the American people . Such are the grounds of the claims of women to the opportunity of a complete Academic education . That facilities for such an education are not afforded , need hardly be proved . Female schools usually fail either in the adaptation , unity , or extent of their course . Some drive girls through a course of study adapted only to boys . Some have a course so heterogeneous that it can produce no abiding or symmetrical development . Some have a course too limited . The sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is frequently less than that required for admission to college . The graduate of some of the most fashionable schools has often acquired little but half-learned accomplishments and a smattering of knowledge . Her mind has not been disciplined , nor any taste for intellectual pursuits established . Her school training has opened to her no resourses within herself , nor any sources of elevated enjoyment around her . Therefore her studies are dropped and forgotten ; literature is abandoned ; she has no resource but fashion and frivolity , dress , or dissipation ; or she falls a prey , to use the language of Jane Taylorr to those " meannesses , jealousies , and petty competitions to which the " uneducated " female mind is prone . " To make her education really a source of strength and happiness , to make it a real education , it should have been comprehensive enough to unfold a taste for knowledge , to develop the mental resources , and to impart a noble incapacity to make up life of the inanities of fashion , the arts of rivalry , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that women are no sooner settled in a family than drawing , piano , and books are all abandoned . This is not always owing to lack of leisure . Many women have time enough . In many cases literary pursuits are // abandoned simply because the girl never was educated ; and her abandonment of intellectual pursuits and conversation proves that her education , through lack of adaption , unity , or comprehensiveness , was mainly a sham . If her education has been carried far enough really to awaken the mind , and to impart a facility of acquisition and a real discipline , it will be strange if she do not find some time for intellectual cultivation ; while amid all her cares , her education will shine out in her conversation , her influence on her children , her comprehensiveness of views , and in all the counsels and duty of domestic life . III . THE INSTITUTiONS NEEDED TO IMPART A COMPLETE AcADEMIC TRAINING TO FEMALES . There are arguments in favor of home education . This point , however , need not be discussed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impracticable . It is essential , therefore , that there be institutions for female education . 1 . These must be of collegiate rank , with the apparatus , teachers , and appurtenances essential to the success of such institutions . A professor should superintend the instruction in each department . All this is demanded by the same reasons which demand similar institutions to give a collegiate education to boys . 2 . As these institutions , though imparting an equivalent to a college education , are yet different in their organization and course of study , the name college seems inappropriate and liable to be misunderstood ; some other name should be adopted , indicating that the institution is organized and conducted with an enlightened regard to the different wants of the sexes . INSTITUTE is proposed . Whatever the name , it is desirable that it should become a common name , as the name college is , designating all female institutions of the highest rank . 3 . The institutes should be for female pupils exclusively . In the period of childhood the education of the sexes may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later stages of their education they should be separated . This arises from the necessity of adapting the course to the character and sphere of woman . Social reasons also require it . 4 . For the sake of unity , these institutes should require substantially the same course of study . This , however , must be a result of time and the growth of the institutes , rather than of preconcerted agreement . 4 . They should require a preparatory course analogous to that of the colleges , equal maturity  --  the age of fourteen yearsand an equal length of time in completing the course ; because the requisite amount of study can not be mastered in a less time . Especially regard must be had to the inferior strength of girls . // An attempt to force them rapidly through a great amount of study will be ruinous to their health . Though girls in childhood learn faster than boys , yet it is more perilous to urge them to an undue rapidity and continuity of study . Their education can be safely conducted only on the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prevalent in many boarding-schools , must result at best in superficial attainments . An experienced eye will see at once that the studies presented in their catalogues can not be mastered in the time prescribed , and that exercises are so crowded that little time is left for study , little knowledge gained , except what is poured in by recitations and lectures , and mental discipline entirely neglected . The intellectual results of a slow and late development are larger , richer , and more abiding . Indeed at an earlier age the mind is , as it were , too soft to retain the impress of discipline . The attempt to impart it has been compared to attempting to hang a chain by the ends fastened iii a substance too yielding to sustain the weight . The later years of youth are the best years for study . The proficiency of one of these years is nearly double that of one of the earlier years . The more advanced studies can not be mastered earlier , except by precocious minds . A less time and an earlier period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind of abiding tastes for intellectual pursuits , such as will hold the mind to them in after life . The young lady returns home only to plunge into the scenes of fashion and frivolity , and thus the best years of youth are often worse than wasted , until an immature and , it may be , ill-advised marriage ushers her into the responsibilities of life , while yet destitute of the strength and liberalization of mind which her new sphere demands . But a strong objection to so long a course is founded on the necessity of so long an absence from home . If this objection arises from the apprehension that a girl 's health will be unequal to it , the answer derived from our own observation is , that the average of health is uniformly higher than among the same number of girls at home . More pupils gain than lose in health . The correction of errors of management arising from parental ignorance or fondness , the healthful influence of intellectual activity , the regularity of life , the daily exercise and recreation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole routine of life with an intelligent reference to physical culture , justify the expectation of a similar result in all well located and well regulated schools . // If the objection is founded on the apprehension of injury from so long a separation from home influences , the answers are various . It is well understood that absence from home is , to a certain extent , desirable in a daughter 's education . The school is , as far as possible , a home school , and surrounded by home influences . Young ladies now , in the irregular prosecution of their studies , frequently spend an equal period away from home . In the smaller family schools , girls often remain six or seven years . The girl may be at home till fourteen or older ; in that time the love of home is established so that it can not be eradicated ; and home influences have done their most important work . She also spends one quarter of each year at home in vacation . Correspondence perpetuates home influence . It may often be the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than would have been imparted in conversation at home . Legh Richmond never conversed with his children on their personal religion , but communicated with them even when at home by letter . By absence the home feeling is made more intense ; home is more valued . The school-girl 's brightest vision is her return home ; but the girl always kept at home , mopes , and calls it dull . The schoolgirl 's joy is to get home ; the home-trained girl 's joy is to get away . Thus it is possible that absence may make the home influence more powerful and beneficent . Returning at eighteen , the young woman has still two or three years , before marriage is desirable . If rightly trained , she will feel the dignity and importance of home duties , and under the guidance of her mother , will soon know how to preside alike in the kitchen and the parlor . If the objection arises merely from parental fondness for the daughter 's society , painful as the separation is , it is probably more keenly felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the good of the latter is best promoted by it , it is a sacrifice which parental duty ought to make . 6 . Admission to the course , to advanced standing , and to the diploma , should be granted only on evidence of qualification for the same by previous attainments . But a larger latitude than is usual in colleges must be allowed to all who choose to take only a partial course . This is rendered necessary by a regard to the different strength and health of individuals , and also by the present state of female education . At the same time the constitution of a family school , being more flexible than that of a college , readily admhs this arrangement . Even pupils in the preparatory departments can be received and instructed in the family of the Institute . Each pupil on leaving would receive an honorable certificate of the attainments actually made . // 7 . The Institutes must assume the form of family-schools . Day-scholars residing with their parents or guardians may be admitted . College students board in families , room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in the recitation-room . Female schools do not admit such an organization . They must be family schools , associated in one family , under the parental supervision of a responsible head , and associated not only in recitations but in the entire family life with the teachers . The necessity for this difference from a college lies in the difference of the sexes ; it has its foundation in nature and it can not be safely disregarded . The life of girls is an in-door life ; they can not be thrust out of that life without continually crossing the instincts of their very nature . They need protection and aid , and can not be turned off , like boys , to meet alone the roughness of life and push unaided through its difficulties . They need protection from the indiscretions of youth . A young man at college may be led into temptation ; yet he may return , wipe off the filth , and his indiscretion be forgotten . But stains can not be wiped off from the character of girls . They need protection from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ; the very first requisite , in intrusting a daughter to a school , is the assurance of her safety ; the assurance of a protection vigilant and affectionate like that of a parent . This can be realized only in a family school . This organization is thus demanded by the necessity of the case . It is also recommended by decisive advantages . The pup il 's mind is more completely surrendered to the influences of the place . There is a deeper sense of responsibility . There is a more perfect system . Contact with numbers removes prejudices and peculiarities , and enlarges the mind . Manners and minor morals can be more effectually taught . The system admits of arrangements more adapted to the health . It affords a more healthy stimulus . It secures in the highest possible degree the influences of home . s . The teachers should be men and women . Men alone can not rightly train the female mind , much less attend to the details of a family-school of females . And yet there are branches of study which men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is hardly possible for a woman to teach successfully . And the female mind receives a better discipline and development under the action in part of the minds of men . 9 . The entire executive management , including the choice and control of teachers , must be in the hands of the Principals . A family must have a head . A family school can not be well conducted on any other principle . // 10 . The number of pupils ought to be large . We should say from seventy-five to one hundred and fifty . This is a necessity in order to sustain schools of the rank proposed . To sustain professional teachers , to give them their entire support from the school , in order that they may bestow on it their entire energies , to secure all the provisions and appurtenances of the best education , involves an expense which can not be met without an extensive patronage . A large number is necessary to secure the highest advantages of classification and stimulus to the pupil , and the complete division of labor among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are defended by the argument , that the instruction can be better adapted to the individual peculiarities . To this we reply , that in a larger school the greater number of teachers and the more perfect classification equally secure all the advantages of this adaptation to almost all scholars ; that the close connection of the pupil in a small school with the teacher , the constant dependence on her , and subjection to this strong individualizing influence accustom the mind to leading strings and hinder the attainment of a proper self-reliance ; and that , if this be an advantage , it is offset by the compensating advantages of larger schools , which no small school can attain . Another aro*ument for smaller schools is that they have more b of the home influence . We answer , that no school can be like a father 's house in all respects . A school of twenty must have the rules , the precision and the machinery of a school , as really as a school of one hundred . A small school , too , may fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genial influences of home . Some of the schools the most precise , formal , mechanical , rigid , severe , and unlike home that we have ever known , have been ver*t small family schools . It will depend alike in the large school and the small , on the character of teachers . A good teacher will abate these evils in a large school , and a poor teacher will produce them in a small one . And if this is the character of a small school , their influence is more disastrous , because it is more omnipresent , concentrated , and constant . IV . MEANS OF GIVING PERMANENCE TO THE INSTITUTES . This is the most difficult part of the subject . We do not expect to remove its difficulties ; yet we venture the following suggestions . // public will have no guaranty either of their perpetuity or of their character . 2 . They should be endowed . The higher female schools are exceedingly expensive . The reason of this is that the public have neglected to endow such schools , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pupils . They must be expensive , so long as this state of things continues . It ought to be understood that education at the colleges is in great part gratuitous to all . The public have given to the trustees the real estate , the library and apparatus , and the endowment of Professorships . For all this the student pays nothing . Yet even now the college education of a young man , unless , as some do , he equals the most famous ascetics in selfdenial , costs nearly as much as that of a young lady . If the officers of college were obliged to own everything from a pair of globes to the college buildings , and all the expense were charged on the pupils , it would enormously exceed the charges at our best female schools . Therefore the public have no right to complain of the expensiveness of female schools , because they have been so neglected that their teachers have to provide everything and charge the expense on the pupils . If it is desirable that they be made cheaper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endow them . And such endowments are essential to the permanence of such schools , and to the existence of a harmonious system of academic education for females . Therefore every argument for endowing colleges is equally an argument for endowing institutes for female education . But here we encounter difficulties . The property of the Pittsfield Institute , for instance , is dwned by its principal . The same is true of many of our best female schools . We deem it wisdom to perfect an Institute which has already grown to excellence , rather than to attempt to create a new one . Institutions of every kind , political , social and educational , are generally the most enduring which have grown into existence , rather than those which have been created to meet the demands of a theory . Actual institutions may have incongruities and deformities not apparent in a theory of what they ought to be ; and yet the very fact that they have grown up , gives them an element of strength ; and the wisest policy is to develop and direct their growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas realized only as institutions , by actual experience , enlarge and perfect their system . // If then the property of a female school is actually owned by the principal , and we aim to perfect the system of instruction in it , what guaranty of its permanence can we obtain ? There is the strongest pecuniary interest inducing the proprietor , when he wishes to transfer the property , to transfer it for the purpose of continuing the school ; for in most cases the discontinuance of the school would depreciate the value of the property . Another mode of giving permanence might be by special endowments for apparatus , library , scholarships or professorships , owned and controlled by the trustees . But an objection arises at once against giving endowments to a private enterprise . Such endowments , however , would be to a public body , the trustees . The trustees having power to withdraw them , would have an effectual control of the management of the school ; and the existence of such endowments would tend strongly both to perpetuate the school and to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove , as perhaps it practically will , insuperable , then , either the principal must go on and b* his own enterprise make the school as near as possible to what it ought to be , or else the property may be purchased and given by the friends of education to the trustees as college property is . The fact that the property of female schools belongs so frequently to the principal is generally regarded as a serious imperfection of the system . But it is a question whether it is not an advantage , if not a necessity . It is a question whether female schools have not sprung up in this form because it is their most natural and advantageous form . Divesting them of their character as merely private enterprises , by bringing them under the supervision of an incorporated board of trustees , the interest and responsibility of the principal resulting from his ownership of the property are advantages which must in some way be secured ; and the whole details of a family school present difficulties which the principal 's owning the property is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted ought to be relieved from the objection against them , to which this constitution gives occasion , by an understanding of the fact that such a constitution affords peculiar advantages to the best working of a family school . And if it shall be found not only to have advantages , but , actually to be the best mode of constituting such schools , then the objection to special endowments for their benefit ought to cease . If the real estate does not belong to the principal , then there is a difficulty on the other side . The ownership and use of the furniture of the school , and the details of the management of // the family , and of all the business relations of the principal and trustees involve responsibilities and difficulties of a peculiar character . The constitution of a family school requires that the principal feel an interest and be held to a personal responsibility such as would result from an ownership in the property , and consequently that he be entrusted with a corresponding extent of control over the management of the whole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as difficult to find suitable men who will be willing to be principals , as , in case the principal owns the real estate , it will be to find endowments . No competent man will stand before the public as the responsible head of a female school , who has not full liberty to carry out his own ideas . By what means this result may best be secured-if the time shall come when endowed schools with all their buildings intrusted to trustees shall demand the solution of the question-we will not undertake to say . It may be , perhaps , by a long and liberal lease . It may be by some other method . We only insist that it is essential to the best success of a family school , that the family and the home should be in some way under the control of the principals , with the whole management of its internal affairs ; and that the evils of a merely delegated authority be avoided by securing to them an interest and holding them to a responsibility equivalent to what would naturally result from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The summary of our idea is this . Female Institutes have a reasonable claim to be endowed . If the principal owns the real estate , his own pecuniary interest is a stroncr motive to secure the permanency of the school . a Special endowments to the trustees will also tend to secure permanency and at the same time give superior excellence to the school . The real estate may be purchased and intrusted to trustees . In this case , the relation of the principal to the property and to the trustees must be such as the successful management of a family school renders necessary , so that by a long lease or in some other way , the peculiar advantages to a family school resulting from his owning property be , to a reasonable extent , received . 3 . Both in colleges and young ladies ' institutes it would be just for the state to open access to them to all classes , either by endowing them so as to make tuition free to all , or by founding scholarships , or by providing otherwise for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * // We shall not be expected to indicate a plan perfected in its details and free from objection . Our aim will be accomplished if we direct attention to the general principle involved in the foregoing proposition , and show that it is founded in truth . We are met in the outset by an objection founded on the demand of the State to exclude from its schools the distinguishing tenets of the sects . In our common schools this principle is barely tolerable , though it is alleviated in its practical workings by the religious sentiment generally pervading school districts in New England , and permitting and even demanding a large amount of religious instruction in the schools . In these , also , the scholar spends but six hours in the day , and all the influences of home and of the Sabbath are left available for religious instruction . But when we come to colleges , where the student is away from home and dependent on his teachers for the whole amount of his religious teaching , and especially to family schools for females where the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers , the principle becomes insufferable . Anything would be better than to have the state so aid these institutions as to require the exclusion of all the doctrines rejected by any one sect . But we suggest that the state may allow the school fund to accumulate to a larger sum than is at present contemplated , and that the income of this be appropriated to educating , in such colleges or female institutes in the state as the pupils themselves prefer , meritorious pupils selected from the high schools . This would accord with our democratic institutions . At present no young man or young woman can obtain a collegiate education or its equivalent without paying a great price for it . Therefore these avenues to all the happiness , influence , and distinction which such an education opens are shut against all who can not pay largely . The spirit of our government demands that these be open to all ; that the poor boy or girl , whose talents insure success and whose soul longs for knowledge , have equal opportunity with the rich to attain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions are sometimes unjustly stigmatized as aristocratic . But if the expense exclude the poor , it is only because the state , by a narrow policy , provides for the poor , only the schooling of common schools . This arrangement is desirable for the best interests of the inferior schools . The fact that the meritorious in the common schools are admitted into the high schools , is a stimulus to the common schools . If the meritorious of the high schools were admitted free into the college or the institute , it would be a stitn // ulus to the high schools , and an aditional stimulus to the common schools . These institutions also are the appropriate schools to furnish teachers to the high schools . The Normal schools do not carry their pupils any farther than the high schools . And are incompetent to furnish teachers to them . Such an arrangement would give unity and completeness to the common school system . it would restrain the tendency to crowd more studies into the common and high schools , and make each grade of schools more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to the system , which it now lacks , so that it would be a complete system of Academic education , furnishing to all that amount of education which they choose to attain , up to the point of commencing professional studies . Professional schools may he left , as at present , to individual generosity and enterprise . The present system is in this respect defective . The Normal schools do not at all meet the demand . If they are merely professional schools to educate teachers , they ought not to teach the branches taught as well in the high schools . If they are to teach these branches , they resolve themselves into high schools , and instead of three or four in a state , one is needed in every town . If they are simply to give a professional education , then they should give simply a professional training to those already familiar with high school studies , and their course of instruction should be shorter and strictly professional . It is a question if the transient Teachers ' institutes do not better realize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little enlargement and systematizing , they would not better accomplish the work . If the Normal schools are intended as the highest schools of the state , as the head of the common school system , they are utterly inadequate , because the education they impart is not more extensive than that of the town high schools . To give unity , efficacy and completeness to the system of public education , there must be a class of institutions above the high schools , competent to receive scholars from them and give them a complete Academic training . As a matter of fact , it might be shown , had we time for it , that common schools in Massachusetts have drawn their life from the colleges . It is also a matter of fact that the most earnest and judicious friends of common schools have always been those who themselves have been most highly educated . And this is true , though colleges have been cast out , sometimes with contempt , from the system of public education , and every graduate knows that he owes nothing of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much more potent and happy would be their influence on the common sch the colleges themselves included in it . ool system , were The free education of meritorious pupils by the state would benefit the higher institutions . It would introduce more talent and ultimately tend to eliminate dullness and bring into identity the men ot talents and the men of education in society . It would also bring the colleges into closer sympathy with the popular mind . There is no more unfounded cant than that which sneers at colleges as behind the times . Their history has been a history of constant improvement , and their system , as it now is , embodies the results of the wisdom of ages . They adapt themselves to the progress of knowledge and the wants of the times . As to natural science , respecting which some clamor as if the Greek and Latin of college were opposed to it , it ought not so much to be said that colleges have kept up with its pi'ogress , as that they have originated and sustained it . But were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would bring them into more immediate sympathy with the popular mind , it would be a continual stimulus to the teachers , would make them feel the pulsation of the popular life , awaken a perpetual consciousness of responsibility as the educators of the people , and direct their eyes to their practical influence on all the interests of American society . This arrangement would ultimately elevate the literature and science of America , and the character of her professional and public men , and thus enhance the dignity of the national character before the world . By drawing from the whole population the highest talent existing in each rank , by giving scope to an original bent to intellectual pursuits wherever it exists , the hidden genius of the country would be allowed its full development , and opportunity to achieve discoveries in science , eminence in literature or statesmanship , or success in the professions . Those of most talents being then educated , and not merely those who have the pecuniary means , mediocrity and dulness would retire to more congenial pursuits , and stations of intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and furnished by the highest cultivation . We must add a word respecting the common objection that such legislation would be legislation for the few , not for the many . This objection is based on the principle that no laws should be passed directly benefitting only the few . But this is an utterly untenable position ; and no legislature ever acts on it . Every year laws are passed directly benefitting individuals . Such are laws protecting the fisheries in particular rivers ; or // the law empowering aliens to hold real estate . Even in education the state does not act on this principle . High schools are established , although it is well known that , through lack of time , energy , talent , or disposition , a large portion of the young never enter them . Normal schools are established for educating teachers . Agricultural schools are regarded with favor , which are not only for a part of the population , but partake of the character of professional schools , proposino* to educate a few for their profession , while those who are preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and law , are neglected . There are local objects , respecting which legislation may confer neither direct nor indirect benefits on the population generally . Aside from these , the true principle of legislation is , that it wrong no one , and that it will indirectly be benefi2ial to the public at large . Thus the high school , though attended by few , is accessible to all and a benefit to all . The same argument is urged in favor of Normal and Agricultural Schools . But it is evident that this argument equally justifies legislation for opening to all , access to the colleges and the corresponding schools for young ladies ; for though comparatively few may avail themselves of the privilege , it is open to all alike , and is a benefit to the interests of society .
