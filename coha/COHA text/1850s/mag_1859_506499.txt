txt THE VIRGINIANS . BY W. M. THACKERAY . CHAPTER LXXXIV . HARD times were now over with mc , and I had to battle with poverty no more . My little kinsman 's death made a vast difference in my worldly prospects . I became next heir to a good estate . My uncle and his wife were not likely to have more children . " The woman is capable of committing any crime to disappoint you , " Sampson vowed ; but , in truth , my Lady Warrington was guilty of no such treachery . Cruelly smitten by the stroke which fell upon them , Lady Warrington was taught by her religions advisers to consider it as a chastisement of Heaven , and submit to the Divine Will . " While your son lived your heart was turned away from the better world " ( her clergyman told her ) , " and your ladyship thought too much of this . For your son 's advantage you desired rank and title . You asked and might have obtained an earthly coronet . Of what avail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to pass upon earth-of what importance compared to the heavenly crown , for which you are an assured candidate ? " The accident caused no little sensation . In the chapels of that enthusiastic sect , toward which , after her son 's death , she now more than ever inclined , many sermons were preached bearing reference to the event . Far be it from me to question the course which the bereaved mother pursued , or to regard with other than respect and sympathy any unhappy soul from seeking that refuge whither sin and grief and disappointment fly for consolation . Lady Warringtoa even tried a reconciliation with myself . A year after her loss , being in London , she signified that she would see me , and I waited on her ; and she gave me , in her usual didactic way , a homily upon my position and her own . She marveled at the decree of Heaven , which had permitted , and how dreadfully punished ! her poor child 's disobedience to her  --  a disobedience // qwq deplore . Had I been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have taken the provincial side , if out of mere opposition to that resolute mistress of Castlewood , who might have driven me into revolt , as England did the colonies . Was the Stamp Act the cause of the revolution ?  --  a tax no greater than that cheerfully paid in England . Ten years earlier , when the French were within our territory , and we were imploring succor from home , would the colonies have rebelled at the payment of this tax ? Do not most people consider the taxgatherer the natural enemy ? Against the British in America there were arrayed thousands and thousands of the high-spirited and brave , but there were thousands more who found their profit in the quarrel , or had their private reasons for engaging in it . I protest I do n't know now whether mine were selfish or patriotic , or which side was in the right , or whether both were not ? I am sure we in England had nothing to do but to fight the battle out ; and , having lost the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soreness the loser felt no rancor . What made brother Hal write home from Virginia , which he seemed exceedingly loth to quit , such flaming patriotic letters ? My kind , best brother was always led by somebody ; by me when we were together ( he had such an idea of my wit and wisdom that if I said the day was fine he would ponder over the observation as though it was one of the sayings of the Seven Sages ) , by some other wiseacre when I was away . Who inspired these flaming letters , this boisterous patriotism , which he sent to us in London ? " lie is rebelling against Madam Esmond , " said I. " He is led by some colonial person-by that lady , perhaps , " hinted my wife . Who " that lady " was Hal never had told us ; and , indeed , besought me never to allude to the delicate subject in my letters to him ; " for Madam wishes to see em all , and I wish to say nothing about you know schat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection could be greater than that which his letters showed . When he heard ( from the informant whom I have mentioned ) that in the midst of my own extreme straits I had retained no more than a hundred pounds out of his aunt 's legacy , he was for mortgaging the estate which he had just bought ; and had more than one quarrel with his mother in my behalf ; and spoke his mind with a great deal more frankness than I should ever have ventured to show . Until her angry recriminations ( when she charged him with ingratitude , after having toiled and saved so much and so long for him ) , the poor fellow did not know that our mother had cut off my supplies to advance his interests ; and by the time this news came to him his bargains were made , and I was fortunately quite out of want . Every scrap of paper which we ever wrote our thrifty parent at Castlewood taped and docketed and put away . We boys were more careless about our letters to one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down upon my younger brother 's literary performances ; but my wife is not so supercilious , and hath kept no small number of Harry 's letters , as well as those of the angelic being whom we were presently to call sister . " To think whom he has chosen , and whom he might have had ! Oh t is cruel ! " cries my wife , when we got that notable letter in which Harry first made us acquainted with the name of his charmer . " She was a very pretty little maid when I left home , she may be a perfect beauty now , " I remarked , as I read over the longest letter Harry ever wrote on private affairs . " But is she to compare to my Hetty ? " says Mrs. Warrington . " We agreed that Hetty and Harry were not to be happy together , my love , " say I. Theo gives her husband a kiss . " My dear , I wish they had tried , " she says with a sigh . " I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think she bath the better head . But , from reading this , it appears that the new lady has taken command of poor Harry , " and she hands me the letter . " My dearest George hath been prepared by previous letters to understand how a certain lady has made a conquest of my heart , which I have given away in exchange for something infinitely more valuable , namely , her own . She is at my side as I write this letter , and if there is no bad spelling such as you often used to laugh at , t is because I have my pretty dictionary at hand , which makes no faults in the longest word , nor in any thing else I know of : being of opinion that she is peifection . " As Madam Esmond saw all your letters , I write you not to give any hint of a certain delicate matter-hut now t is no secret , and is known to all the country . Mr. George is not the only one of our family who has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a dutiful younger brother I have followed his example ; and now I may tell you how this mighty event came about . " I had not been at home long before I saw my fate was accomplisht . I will not tell you how beautiful Miss Fanny Mountain had grown since I had been away in Europe . She saith , You never scill think so , ' and I am glad , as she is the only thing in life I would grudge to my dearest brother . " That neither Madam Esmond nor my other mother ( as . Mountain is now ) should have seen our mutual attachment , is a wonder-only to be accounted for by supposing that love makes other folks blind . Mine for my Fanny was increased by seeing what the treatment was she had from Madam Esmond , who indeed was very rough and haughty with her , which my love bore with a sweetness perfectly angelic ( this I will say , though she will order me not to write any such nonsense ) . She was scarce better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk much more free before Madam Esmond than ever my Fanny could . " And yet my Fanny says she doth not regret // Madam 's unkindness , as without it I possibly never should have been what I am to her . Oh , dear brother ! when I remember how great your goodness hath been ; how , in my own want , you paid my debts , and rescued me out of prison ; how you have been living in poverty which never need have occurred but for my fault ; how you might have paid yourself back my just debt to you and would not , preferring my advantage to your own comfort , indeed I am lost at the thought of such goodness ; and ought I not to be thankful to Heaven that bath given me such a wife and such a brother ! " When I writ to you requesting you to send me my aunt 's legacy money , for which indeed I had the most profitable and urgent occasion , I had no idea that you were yourself suffering poverty . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be governor to a brewer 's son ! - that you should have to write for booksellers ( except in so far as your own genius might prompt you ) never once entered my mind , until Mr. Foker 's letter came to us , and this would never have been shown-for Madam kept it secret-had it not been for the difference which sprang up between us . " Poor Tom Diggle 's estate and negroes being for sale , owing to Tom 's losses and extravagance at play , and his father 's debts before him - Madam Esmond saw here was a great opportunity of making a provision for me , and that with six thousand pounds for the farm and stock , I should be put in possession of as pretty a property as falls to most younger sons in this country . It lies handy enough to Richmond , between Kent and Hanover Court House - the mansion nothing for elegance compared to ours at Castlewood , but the land excellent and the people extraordinary healthy . " Here was a second opportunity , Madam Esmond said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my commissions and her own savings I might pay more than half of the price of the property , and get the rest of the money on mortgage ; though here , where money is scarce to procure , it would have been difficult and dear . At this juncture , with our new relative , Mr. Van den Bosch , bidding against us ( his agent is wild that we should have bought the property over him ) , my aunt 's legacy most opportunely fell in . And now I am owner of a good house and negroes in my native country , shall be called , no doubt to our House of Burgesses , and hope to see my dearest brother and family under my own roof-tree . To sit at my own fireside , to ride my own horses to my own bounds , is better than going a-soldering , now war is over , and there are no French to fight . Indeed , Madam Esmond made a condition that I should leave the army , and live at home , when she brought me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , she said , who chose to write playbooks , and live in England-let the other stay with her at home . " But after the purchase of the estate was made , and my papers for selling out were sent home , my mother would have had me marry a person of her choosing , but by no means of mine . You remember Miss Betsy Pitts at Williamsburgh ? She is in no wise improved by having bad her face dreadfully scarred with small-pock ; and though Madam Esmond saith the young lady bath every virtue , I own her virtues did not suit me . Her eyes do not look straight ; she bath one leg shorter than another ; and oh , brother ! didst thou never remark Fanny 's ankles when we were boys ? Neater I never saw at the Opera . " Now , when t was agreed that I should leave the army , a certain dear girl ( canst thou guess her name ? ) one day , when we were private , burst into tears of such happiness that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ab ! ' says she , do you think , Sir , that the idea of the son of my revered benefactress going to battle doth not inspire me with terror ? Ab , Mr. Henry ! do you imagine I have no heart ? When Mr. George was with Braddock , do you fancy we did not pray for him ? And when you were with Mr. Wolfe-oh ! ' " Here the dear creature hid her eyes in her handkerchief , and bad bard work to prevent her mamma , who came in , from seeing that she was crying . But my dear Mountain declares that , though she might have fancied , might have prayed in secret for such a thing ( she owns * that now ) , she never imagined it for one moment . Nor , indeed , did my good mother , who supposed that Sam Lintot , the apothecary 's lad at Richmond , was Fanny 's flame-an absurd fellow that I near kicked into James River . " But when the commission was sold , and the estate bought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I found her crying , one day , in her mother 's room , where the two ladies had been at work trimming hats for my negroes . " What ! crying , miss ? ' says I. Has my mother been scolding you ? ' " No , ' says the dear creature . Madam Esmond has been kind to-day . ' " And her tears drop down on a cockade which she is sewing on to a hat for Sady , who is to be head-groom . " Then why , miss , are those dear eyes so red ? ' says I. " Because I have the toothache , ' she says ; or because-because lam a fool . ' Here she fairly bursts out . Oh , Mr. Harry ! oh , Mr. Warrington ! You are going to leave us ; and t is as well . You will take your place in your country , as becomes you . You will leave us poor women in our solitude and dependence . You will come to visit us from time to time . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay companions , you will remember your . . . " Here she could say no more , and hid her face with one hand as I , I confess , seized the other . " Dearest , sweetest Miss Mountain ! ' says I. Oh ! could I think that the parting from me // has brought tears to those lovely eyes ! Indeed , I fear , I should be almost happy ! Let them look upon your . Oh , Sir ! ' cries my charmer ; oh , Mr. Warrington ! consider who I am , Sir , and who you tire ! Remember the difference between us ! Release my hand , Sir ! What would Madam Esmond say if-if . . . " If what , I do n't know , for here our mother was in the room . " What would Madam Esmond say ? ' she cries out . She would say that you are an ungrateful , artful , false , little . " Madam ! ' says I. " Yes , an ungrateful , artful , false , little wretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss ! What would Mr. Lintot say if he saw von making eyes at the Captain ? And for you , harry , I will have you bring none of your garrison manners hither . This is a Christian family , Sir , and you will please to know that my house is not intended for captains and their misses ! ' " Misses ! mother , ' says I. Gracious powers , do you ever venture for to call Miss Mountain by such a name ? Miss Mountain , the purest of her sex ! ' " The purest of her sex ! Can I trust my own ears ? ' asks Madam , turning very pale . " I mean that if a man would question her honor I would fling him out of window , ' says I. " You mean that you-your mother 's sonare actually paying honorable attentions to this young person ? ' " He would never dare to offer any other ! " cries my Fanny ; nor any woman but you , madam , to think so ! ' " Oh ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping her a flue courtesy ; I did n't know the honor you were doing our family ! You propose to marry with us , do you ? Do I understand Captain Warrington aright , that he intends to offer me Miss Mountain as a daughter-in-law ? ' " T is to be seen , madam , that I have no protector , or you would not insult me so ! ' cries my poor victim . " I should think the apothecary protection sufficient ! ' says our mother . I do n't , mother ! ' I bawl out , for I was very angry and if Lintot offers her any liberty I 'll brain him with his own pestle ! ' " Oh ! if Lintot has withdrawn , Sir , I suppose I must be silent . But I did not know of the circumstance . He came hither , as I supposed , to pay court to Miss , and we all thought the match equal , and I encouraged it . ' " He came because I had the toothache ! ' cries my darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he took it out for her , and there is no end to the suspicions and calumnies of women ' ) . " What more natural than that he should marry my housekeeper 's daughter-'twas a very suitable match ! ' continues madam , taking snuff . But I confess , ' she adds , going on , 1 was not aware that you intende for my son ! ' d to jilt the apothecary " Peace , for Heaven 's sake , peace , Mr. Warrington ! ' cries my angel . " Pray , Sir , before you fully make up your mind , had you not better look round the rest of my family ? ' says madam . Dinah is a fine tall girl , and not very black ; Cleopatra is promised to Ajax the Blacksmith , to be sure ; but then we could break the marriage , you know . If with an apothecary , why not with a blacksmith ? Martha 's husband has run away , and- ' " here , dear brother , I own I broke out aswearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a man is angry , it do relieve him immensely . I 'm blest but I should have gone wild , if it had n't been for them oaths . " Curses , blasphemy , ingratitude , disobedience ! ' says mother , leaning now on her tortoiseshell stick , and then waving it-something like a queen in a play . These are my rewards ! ' says she . Oh , heaven , what have I done , that I should merit this awful punishment ? and does it please you to visit the sins of my fathers upon me ? Where do my children inherit their pride ? When I was young , had I any ? When my papa bade me marry , did I refuse ? Did I ever think of disobeying ? No , Sir . My fault bath been , and I own it , that my love was centred upon you , perhaps to the neglect of your elder brother . ' ( Indeed , brother , there was some truth in what madam said . ) I turned from Esau , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward , I have my reward ! I fixed my vain thoughts on this world and its distinctions . To see my son advanced in worldly rank was my ambition . I toiled and spared that I might bring him worldly wealth . I took unjustly from my eldest son 's portion that my younger might profit . And oh that I should live to see him seducing the daughter of my own housekeeper under my own roof , and replying to my just anger with oaths and blasphemies ! " I try to seduce no one , Madam ! ' I cried out . If I utter oaths and blasphemies , I beg your pardon ; but you are enough to provoke a Saint to speak em . I wo n't have this young lady 's character assailed-no , not by my own mother nor any mortal alive . No , dear Miss Mountain ! If Madam Esmond chooses to say that my designs on you are dishonorable-let this undeceive her ! ' And as I spoke I went down on my knees , seizing my adorable Fanny 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss , ' says I , they are yours forever . ' " You , at least , I knew , Sir , ' says Fanny with a noble courtesy , never said a word that was disrespectful to me , or entertained any doubt of my honor . And I trust it is only Madam Esmond , in the world , who can have such an opinion of me . After what your ladyship hath said of me , of course I can stay no longer in your house . ' " Of course , Madam , I never inteuded you should ; and the sooner you leave it the better , ' cries our mother . // I ; , ii qwq looked at us as pale as a stone . While I was telling my story to Mountain ( who , poor thing , had not the least idea , not she , that Miss Fanny and I had the slightest inclination for one another ) , I could hear our mother once or twice still saying , I am punished for my crime ! ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know at first , or indeed take much heed of what she said ; for you know her way , and how , when she is angry , she always talks sermons . But Mountain told me ttfterward , when we had some talk together , as we did at the Raleigh Tavern , whither the ladies presently removed with their bag and baggage-for not only would they not stay at Madam 's house after the language she used , but my mother determined to go away likewise . She called her servants together , and announced her intention of going home instantly to Castlewood ; and I own to you t was with a horrible pain I saw the family-coach roll by , with six horses , and ever so many of the servants on mules and on horseback , as I and Fanny looked through the blinds of the Raleigh . " After the words Madam used to my spotless Fanny t was impossible that the poor child or her mother should remain in our house : and indeed M. said that she would go hack to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in James River , she went and bargained with the captain about a passage , so bent was she upon quitting the country , and so little did she think of making a match between me and my angel . But the cabin was mercifully engaged by a North Carolina gentleman and his family , and before the next ship sailed ( which bears this letter to my dearest George ) they have agreed to stop with me . Almost all the ladies in this neighborhood have waited on them . When the marriage takes place , I hope Madam Esmond will be reconciled . My Fanny 's father was a British officer ; and , sure , ours was no more . Some day , please Heaven , we shall visit Europe , and the places where my wild oats were sown , and where I committed so many extravagances from which my dear brother rescued me . " The ladies send you their affection and duty , and to my sister . We hear his Excellency General Lambert is much beloved in Jamaica : and I shall write to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother will participate in it , and I am ever his grateful and affec tionate , H. E. XV . knolledge this in answering : as there 's no good in botharing women with accounts : and with the extra ? 5 by a capp or what she likes for my dear sister , and a toy for my nephew from Uncle Hal . " The conclusion to which we came on the perusal of this document was , that the ladies had superintended the style and spelling of my poor Hal 's letter , but that the postscript was added without their knowledge . And I am afraid we argued that the Virginian Squire was under female domination - as Hercules , Samson , and fortes multi had been before him - -* Ii *j* *N -K CHAPTER LXXXV INX ENI *ORTUM WHEN my mother heard of my acceptance of a place at home I think she was scarcely well pleased . She may have withdrawn her supplies in order to starve me into a surrender , and force me to return with my family to Virginia , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying day , had any explanation on the pecuniary dispute between us . She cut off my allowances : I uttered not a word ; but managed to live without her aid . I never heard that she repented of her injustice , or acknowledged it , except from Harry 's privnte communication to me. qwq when Madam Esmond and I met the period of necessity was long passed away : I had no need to scheme ignoble savings , or to grudge the doctor his fee : I had plenty , and she could but bring me more . No doubt she suffered in her own mind to think that my children had heen hungry , and she had offered them no food ; and that strangers had relieved the necessity from which her proud heart had caused her to turn aside . Proud ? Was she prouder than I ? A soft word of explanation between us might have brought about a reconciliation years before it came ; but I would never speak , nor did she . When I commit a wrong , and know it subsequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a satisfaction to my own pride , and to myself I am apologizing for having been wanting to myself . And hence , I think ( out of regard to that personage of ego ) , I scarce ever could degrade myself to do a meanness . How do men feel whose whole lives ( and many men 's lives are ) are lies , schemes , and subterfuges ? What sort of company do they keep when they are alone ? Daily in life I watch men whose every smile is an artilice , and every wink is an hypocrisy . Doth such a fellow wear a mask in his own privacy , and to his own conscience ? If I choose to pass over an injury , I fear t is not from a Christian and forgiving spirit : t is because I can afford to remit the debt , and disdain to ask a settlement of it . One or two sweet souls I have known in my life ( and perhaps tried ) to whom forgiveness is no trouble  --  a plant that grows naturally , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remit , I say , not forgive . I wonder are we proud men proud of being proud ? So I showed not the least sign of submission toward my parent in Virginia yonder , and we continued for years to live in estrangement , with occasionally a brief word or two ( such as the announcement of the birth of a child , or what not ) , passing between my wife and her . After our first troubles in America about the Stamp Act , troubles fell on me in London likewise . Though I have been on the Tory side in our quarrel ( as indeed upon the losing side in most controversies ) , having no doubt that the Imperial government had a full right to levy taxes in the colonies , yet at the time of the dispute I must publish a pert letter to a member of the House of Burgesses in Virginia , in which the question of the habitual insolence of the mother country to the colonies was so freely handled , and sentiments were uttered so disagreeable to persons in power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licenser , to the terror and horror of my uncle , who never could be brought to love Ieople in disgrace . He had grown to have an extreme affection for my wife as well as my little boy ; but toward myselg personally , entertained a kind of pitying contempt which always infinitely amused me . He had a natural scorn and dislike for poverty , and a corresponding love for success and good fortune . Any opinion de* ) arting at all from the regular track shocked and fribhtened him , and all truth-telling made him turn pale . He must have had originally some warmth of heart and genuine love of kindred : for , spite of the dreadful shocks I gave him , he continued to see Theo and the child ( and me too , giving me a mournful recognition when we met ) ; and , though broken-hearted by my free-spokenness , he did not refuse to speak to me as he had done at the time of our first differences , but looked upon me as a melancholy , lost creature , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must cast about for some new scheme of life ; and the repayment of harry 's debt to me at this juncture enabled me to live at least for some months even , or years to come . Oh strange fatuity of youth ! I often say . Ilow was it that we dared to be so poor and so little cast down ? At this time his Majesty 's royal uncle of Cumherland fell down and perished in a fit ; and , strange to say , his death occasioned a remarkable change in my fortune . My poor Sir Miles Warrington never missed any court ceremony to which he could introduce himself , lie was at all the drawing-rooms , christenings , balls , funerals of the court . If ever a prince or princess was ailing , his coach was at their door : Leicester Fields , Carlton House , Gunnersbury , were all the same to him , and nothing must satisfy him now but going to the stout duke 's funeral . He caught a great cold and an inflammation of the throat from standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , before almost I had heard of his illness , a lawyer waits upon me at my lodgings in Bloomsbury , and salutes me by the name of Sir George Warrington . Party and fear of the future were over now . We laid the poor gentleman by the side of his little son , in the family church-yard where so many of his race repose . Little Miles and I were the chief mourners . An obsequious tenantry bowed and courtesied before us , and did their utmost to conciliate my honor and my worship . The dowager and her daughter withdrew to Bath presently ; and I and my family took possession of the house , of which ' I have been master for thirty years . Be not too eager , 0 my son ! Have but a little patience , and I too shall sleep under yonder yew-trees , and the people will be tossing up their caps for Sir Miles . The records of a prosperous country life are easily and briefly told . The steward 's books show what rents were paid and forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What visitors came to us , and how long they staid : what pensioners my wife had , and how they were doctored and relieved , and how they died : what year I was sheriff , and how often the hounds met near us : all these are narrated in our housejournals , which any of my heirs may read who choose to take the trouble . We could not afford the fine mansion in Hill Street which my predecessor had occupied ; but we took a smaller house , in which , however , we spent more money . We made not half the show ( with liveries , equipages , and plate ) for which my uncle had been famous ; // l ) ut our beer was stronger , and my wife 's charities were perhaps more costly than those of the Dowager Lady Warrington . No doubt she thought there was no harm in spoiling the Philistines ; for she made us pay unconscionably for the goods she left behind her in our countryhouse , and I submitted to most of her extortions with unutterable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her greenhouses bore ! What a price she set upon that horrible old spinet she left in her drawing-room , and the framed pieces of worsted-work , performed by the accomplished Dora and the lovely Flora . Had they been master-pieces of Titian or Vandyck , to be sure my lady dowager could hardly have valued them at a higher price . But though we paid so generously , though we were , I may say without boast , far kinder to our poor than ever she had been , for a while we had the very worst reputation in the county , where all sorts of stories had been told to my discredit . I thought I might perhaps succeed to my uncle 's seat in Parliament , as well as to his landed property ; but I found , I knew not how , that I was voted to be a person of very dangerous opinions . I would not bribe . I would not coerce my own tenants to vote for me in the election of 68 . A gentleman came down from Whitehall with a pocket-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chance against my competitor . Bon Diew ! Now that we were at ease in respect of worldly means-now that obedient tenants bowed and courtesied as we went to church , that we drove to visit our friends or to the neighboring towns in the great family coach with the four fat horses-did we not often regret poverty , and the dear little cottage at Lambeth , where Want was ever prowling at the door ? Did I not long to be bear-leading again , and vow that translating for booksellers was not such very hard drudgery ? When we went to London we made sentimental pilgrimages to all our old haunts . I dare say my wife embraced all her landladies . You may be sure we asked all the friends of those old times to share the comforts of our new home with us . The Reverend Mr. Hagan and his lady visited us more than once . His appearance in the pulpit at B ( where he preached very finely , as we thought ) caused an awful scandal there . Sampson came too , another unlucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay among us . Mr. John*on talked of coming , but he put us off once or twice . I suppose our house was dull . I know that I myself would be silent for days , and fear that my moodiness must often have tried the sweetest tempered woman in the world who lived with me . I did not care for field sports . The killing one partridge was so like killing another that I wondered how men could pass days after days in the pursuit of that kind of slaughter . Their fox-hunting stories would begin at four o'clock , when the table-cloth was removed , and last till supper time . I sate silent , and listened : day after day I fell asleep : no wonder I was not popular with my company . What admission is this I am making ? Here was the storm over , the rocks avoided , the ship in port , and the sailor not over-contented ? Was Susan I had been sighing for during the voyage not the beauty I expected to find her ? In the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William 's log-book , and so , Madam , I am not going to put my secrets down there . No , Susan , I never had secrets from thee . I never cared for another woman . I have seen more beautiful , but none that suited me as well as your ladyship . I have met Mrs. Carter and Miss Mulso , and Mrs. Thrale and Madam Kaufmann , and the angelical Gunnings , and her Grace of Devonshire , and a host of beauties who were not angelic by any means , and I * as not dazzled by them . Nay , young folks , I may have led your mother a weary life , and been a very Bluebeard over her , but then I had no other beads in the closet . Only , the first pleasure of taking possession of our kingdom over , I own I began to be quickly tired of the crown . When the captain wears it his Majesty will be a very different Prince . He can ride a hunting five days in the week , and find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon at church fifty times , and not yawn more than I do at the first delivery . But sweet Joan , beloved Baucis ! being thy faithful husband and true lover always , thy Darby is rather ashamed of having been testy so often , and , being arrived at the consummation of happiness , Philemon asks pardon for falling asleep so frequently after dinner . There came a period of my life , when , having reached the summit of felicity , I was quite tired of the prospect I had there : I yawned in Eden , and said , " Is this all ? What , no lions to bite ? no rain to fall ? no thorns to prick you in the rose-bush when you sit down ? - only Eve , forever sweet and tender , and figs for breakfast , dinner , supper , from week 's end to week 's end ! " Shall I make my confessions ? Hearken ! Well , then , if I must make a clean breast of it . * * * * * * Here three pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which the editor is sincerely sorry . I know the theory and practice of the Roman Church ; but , being bred of another persuasion ( and skeptical and heterodox regarding that ) , I ca n't help doubting the other too , and wondering whether Catholics , in their confessions , confess all ? Do we Protestants ever do so ; and has education rendered those other fellow-men so different from us ? At least , among us , we are not accustomed to suppose Catholic priests or laymen more frank and open than ourselves . Which brings me back to my question-does any man confess all ? Does yonder dear creature know all my life , who has been the partner of it for thirty years ; who , whenever I have told her a sorrow , has been ready with the best of her gentle power to soothe it ; who has watched when I did not speak , and when I was silent has // been silent herself ; or with the charming hypocrisy of woman has worn smiles and an easy appearance so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not even ask to disturb her lord 's secret when he seemed to indicate a desire to keep it private ? Oh , the dear hypocrite ! lIave I not watched her hiding the boys ' peccadilloes from papa 's anger ?

Why , from the very earliest days , thou wise woman , thou *vert forever concealing something from me-this one stealing jam from the cupboard ; that one getting into disgrace at school ; that naughty rebel ( put on the caps , young folks , according to the fit ) flinging an inkstand at mamma in a rage , while I was told the gown and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another .

But when Mr. Random and Mr. Thomas Jones are married is all over ? Are there no quarrels at home ?

But can Gumho shut the hall-door upon hlue devils , or lay them always in a red sea of claret ? Does a man sleep the better who has four-and-twenty hours to doze in ? Do his intellects hrighten after a sermon from the dull old vicar ; a ten minutes ' cackle and fiat. - tery from the village apothecary ; or the conversation of Sir John and Sir Thomas with their ladies , who come ten moonlight muddy miles to eat a haunch and play a rubber ?

In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we came to Warrington manor , our two what they called best neighbors were my Lord Thtbury and Sir John Mudbrook . We are of an older date than the Mudbrooks , consequently my Lady Tutbury always fell to my lot when we dined together , who was deaf ; and fell asleep after dinner ; or if I had Lady Mudbrook , she chattered with a folly so incessant and intense that even my wife could hardly keep her complacency ( consummate hypocrite as her ladyship is ) , knowing the rage with which I was fuming at the other 's clatter . I come to London . I show my tongue to Dr. Heberden . I pour out my catalogue of complaints . " Pshaw , my dear Sir George ! " says the unfeeling physician .

" No , my brother Harry ought to have been the squire , with remainder to my son Miles , of course . Harry 's letters were full of gayety and good spirits . His estate prospered ; his negroes multiplied ; his crops were large ; he was a member of our House of Burgesses ; he adored his wife : could he but have a child his happiness would be complete . Had Hal been master of Warrington Manor-house , in my place , he would have been beloved through the whole country ; he would have been steward at all the races , the gayest of all the jolly huntsmen , the bieu veuu at all the mansions round about , where people scarce cared to perform the ceremony of welcome at sight of my glum face . As for my wife , all the world liked her , and agreed in pitying her . I do n't know how the report got abroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful cruelty , and that for jealousy I was a perfect Blueheard . Ah me ! And so it is true that I have had many dark hours ; that I pass days in long silence ; that the conversation of fools and whipper-snappers makes me rebellious and peevish ; and that , when I feel contempt , I sometimes do n't know how to conceal it , or I should say , did not . I hope as I grow older I grow more charitable . Because I do not love bawling and galloping after a fox , like the captain yonder , I am not his superior ; but , in this respect , humbly own that he is mine . He has perceptions which are denied me ; enjoyments which I can not understand . Because I am blind the world is not dark .

And it was now , after we had been some three years settled in our English home , that a correspondence between us and Madam Esmond began to take place . It was my wife who ( upon some pretext such as women always know how to find ) re-established the relations between us . Mr. Miles must need have the small-pox , from which he miraculously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this recovery the mother writes her prettiest little wheedling letter to the grandmother of the fortunate babe . She coaxes her with all sorts of modest phrases and humble offerings of respect and good-will . She narrates anecdotes of the precocious genius of the lad ( what hath subsequently happened , I wonder , to stop the growth of that gallant young officer 's brains ? ) , and she must have sent over to his grandmother a lock of the darling boy 's hair , for the old lady , in her reply , acknowledged the receipt of some such present . I wonder , as it came from England , they allowed it to p*55 our custom-house at Williamsburg . In return for these peace-offerings and smuggled tokens of submission comes a tolerably gracious letter from my Lady of Castlewood . She inveighs against the dangerous spirit pervading the colony : she laments to think that her unhappy son is consorting with people who , she fears , will be no better than rebels and traitors . She does not wonder , considering who his friends and advisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menial situation be expected to sympathize with persons of rank and dignity who have the honor of the Crown at heart ? If evil times were coming for the monarchy ( for the folks in America appeared to be disinclined to *ay taxes , and required that every thing should be done for them without cost ) , she remembered how to monarchs in misfortune the Esmondsher father , the marquis , especially - had ever been faithful . She knew not what opinions ( though she might judge from my new-fan qled Lord Chatham ) were in fashion in England . She prayed , at least , she might hear that one of her sons was not on the side of rebellion . When we came , in after-days , to look over old family papers in Virginia , we found " Letters from my daughter Lady Warrington , " neatly tied up with a ribbon . My lady Theo insisted I should not open them ; and the truth , I believe , is , that they were so full of praises of her husband that she thought my vanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write , she gave us brief notices of Harry and his wife . " The two women , " she wrote , " still govern every thing with my poor boy at Fannystown ( as he chooses to call his house ) . They must save money there , for I hear but a shabby accon t of their manner of entertaining . The Mount Vernon gentlema continues to be his great friend , and he votes in the House of Burgesses very much as his guide advises him . Why he should be so sparing of his money I can not understand : I heard of five negroes who went with his equipages to my Lord Bottetourt 's only two had shoes to their feet . I had reasons to save , having sons for whom I wished to provide ; but he hath no children , wherein he certainly is spared from much grief , though , no doubt , Heaven in its wisdom means our good by the trials which , through our children , it causes us to endure .

Had Mr. Warrington lived , I should have endeavored to follow up that sacred precept , holding that nothing so becomes a woman as humility and obedience . ' Presently we had a letter sealed with black , and announcing the death of our dear good Mountain , for whom I had a hearty regret and affection , remembering her sincere love for us as children . Harry deplored the event in his honest way , and with tears which actually blotted his paper . And Madam Esmond , alluding to the circumstance , said : " My late housekeeper , Mrs. Mountain , as soon as she found her illness was fatal , sent to me requesting a last interview on her death-bed , intending , doubtless , to pray my forgiveness for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could forgive her as a Christian , and heartily hope ( though I confess I doubt it ) that she had a due sense of her crime toward me . But our meeting , I considered , was of no use , and could only occasion unpleasantness between us . If she repented , though at the eleventh hour , it was not too late , and I sincerely trusted that she was now doing so . And , would you believe her lamentable and hardened condition , she sent me word through Dinah , my woman , whom I dispatched to her with medicines for her soul 's and her body 's health , that she had nothing to repent of as far as regarded her conduct to me , and she wanted to be left alone ! Poor Dinah distributed the medicine to my negroes , and our people took it eagerly-while Mrs. Mountain , left to herself , succumbed to the fever . Oh , the perversity of human kind !

Did words not exactly consonant with truth pass between the ladies in their // correspondence ? I fear my Lady Theo was not altogether candid : else how to account for a phrase in one of Madam Esmond 's letters , who said : " I am glad to hear the powders have done the dear child good . They are , if not on a first , on a second or third application , almost in*fal1ible , and have been the blessed means of relieving many persons ro**nd me , both infants and adults , white and colored .

I never allow any thing to be altered in his room or his brother 's . I fancy the children playing near me sometimes , and that I can see my dear father 's head as he dozes in his chair . Mine is growing almost as white as my father 's . Am I never to behold my children ere I go hence ? The Lord 's will be done . " AT HOME . Such an appeal as this of our mother would have softened hearts much more obdurate than ours ; and we talked of a speedy visit to Virginia , and of hiring all the Young Rachel 's cabin accommodation . But our child must fall ill , for whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother of course could not part ; and the Young Rachel made her voyage without us that year . Another year there was another difficulty , in my worship 's first attack of the gout ( which occupied me a good deal , and afterward certainly cleared my wits and enlivened my spirits ) ; and now came another much sadder cause for delay in the sad news we received from Jamaica . Some two years after our establishment at the Manor our dear General returned from his government , a little richer in the world 's goods than when he went away , but having undergone a loss for which no wealth could console him , and after which , indeed , he did not care to remain in the West Indies . My Theo 's poor mother  --  the most tender and affectionate friend ( save one ) I have ever had-died abroad of the fever . Her last regret was that she should not be allowed to live to see our children and ourselves in prosperity . " She sees us , though we do not see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been good to her children , " her husband said . He , we thought , would not be long ere he joined her . his love for her had been the happiness and business of his whole life . To be away from her seemed living no more . It was pitiable to watch the good man as he sate with us . My wife , in her air and in many tones and gestures , constantly recalled her mother to the bereaved widower 's heart . What cheer we could give him in his calamity we offered ; but , especially , little Hetty was now , under heaven , his chief support and consolation . She had refused more than one advantageous match in the Island , the General told us ; and on her return to England , my Lord Wrotham 's heir laid himself at her feet . But she loved best to stay with her father , Hetty said . As long as he was not tired of her she cared for no husband . " Nay , " said we , when this last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months with us at the Manor here , and you can have him at Oakhurst for the other six . " But Hetty declared her father never could bear Oakhurst again now that her mother was gone ; and she would marry no man for his coronet and money-not she ! The General , when we talked this matter over , said , gravely , that the child had no desire for marrying , owing possibly to some disappointment in early life , of which she never spoke ; and we , respecting her feelings , were for our parts equally silent . My brother Lambert had by this time a college living near to Winchester , and a wife of course to adorn his parsonage . We professed but a moderate degree of liking for this lady , though we made her welcome when she came to us . Her idea regarding our poor Hetty 's determined celibacy was different to that which I had . This Mrs. Jack was a chatter-box of a woman , in the habit of speaking her mind very freely , and of priding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . " My dear Sir George , " she was pleased to say , " I have often and often told our dear Theo that I would n't have a pretty sister in my house to make tea for Jack when I was up stairs , and always to be at hand when I was wanted in the kitchen or nursery , and always to be dressed neat and in her best when I was very likely making pies or puddings or looking to the chil CHAPTER LXXXVI. // dren . I have every confidence in Tom , of course .. I should like to see him look at another woman , indeed ! And so I have in Jemima : hut they do n't come together in my house when I 'm up stairs-that I promise you ! And so I told my sister Warrington . " " Am I to understand , " says the General , " that you have done my Lady Warrington the favor to warn her against her sister , my daughter Miss Hester ? " " Yes , pa , of course I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman is a woman , and a man 's a man , os I know very well . Do n't tell me ! lie is a man . Every man is a man , with all his sanctified airs ! " " You yourself have a married sister , with whom you were staying when my son Jack first had the happiness of making your acquaintance ? " remarks the General . " Yes , of course I have a married sister ; every one knows that ; and I have been as good as a mother to her children , that I have ! " " And am I to gather from your conversation that your attractions proved a powerful temptation for your sister 's husband ? " Law , General ! I do n't know how you can go for to say I ever said any such a thing ! " cries Mrs. Jack , red and voluble . " Do n't you perceive , my dear madam , that it is you who have insinuated as much , not only regarding yourself , but regarding my own two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I 'm a Christian woman ! And it 's most cruel of you to say so , Sir . And I do say a sister is best out of the house , that I do ! And as Theo 's time is coming , I warn her , that 's all . " " Have you discovered , my good madam , whether my poor Hetty has stolen any of the spoons ? When I came to breakfast this morning my daughter was alone , and there must have been a score of pieces of silver on the table . " " Law , Sir ! who ever said a word about spoons ? Did lever accuse the poor dear ? If I did , may I drop down dead at this moment on this hearth-rug ! And I ai n't used to be spoke to in this way . And me and Tom have both remarked it ; and I 've done my duty , that I have . " And here Mrs. Jack flounces out of the room , in tears . " And has the woman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asks the General , when Theo ( who is a little delicate ) comes to the teatable . " She has told me every day since she has been here . She comes into my dressing-room to tell me . She conies to my nursery , and says , Ah , I would n't have a sister prowling about my nurscry , that I would n't ! ' Ah , how pleasant it is to have amiable and well-bred relatives , say I. " " Thy poor mother has been spared this woman , " groans the General . " Our mother would have made her better , Papa , " says Theo , kissing him . " Yes , dear . And I see that both of them are at their prayers . " But this must be owned , that to love one 's relatives is not always an easy task ; to live with one 's neighbors is sometimes not amusing . From Jack Lambert 's demeanor next day I could see that his wife had given him her version of the conversation . Jack was sulky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his anger did not prevent his appetite . He preached a sermon for us *vhiich was entirely stupid . And little Miles , once more in sables , sate at his grandfather 's side , his little hand placed in that of the kind old man . Would he stay and keep house for us during our Virginian trip ? The housekeeper should be put under the full domination of Hetty . The butler 's keys should be handed over to him ; for Gumbo , not , I thought , with an over-good grace , was to come with us to Virginia : having , it must be premised , united himself with Mrs. Molly in the bonds of matrimony , and peopled a cottage in my park with sundry tawny Gumbos . Under the care of our good General and his daughter we left our house then ; we traveled to London , and thence to Bristol , and our obsequious agent there had the opportunity of declaring that he should offer up prayers for our prosperity , au ( l of vowing that children so beautiful as ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miles ) were never seen on any ship before . We made a voyage without accident . How strange the feeling was as we landed from our boat at Richmond ! A conch and a host of negroes were there in waiting to receive us ; and bard by a gentleman on horseback , with negroes in our livery , too , who sprang from his horse and rush - ed up to embrace us . Not a little charmed were both of us to see our dearest Hal . He rode with us to our mother 's door . Yonder she stood on the steps to welcome us ; and Thico knelt down to ask her blessing . Harry rode in the coach with us as far as our mother 's house ; but would not , as he said , spoil sport by entering with us . " She sees me , " he owned , " and we are pretty good friends ; but Fanny and she are best apart ; and there is no love lost between em , I can promise you . Come over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . And to-morrow I shall have the honor to present her sister to Theo . T was only from happening to be in town yesterday that I heard the ship was signaled , and waited to see you . I have sent a negro boy home to my wife , and she 'll be here to pay her respects to my Lady Warrington . " And Harry , after this brief greeting , jumped out of the carriage and left us to meet our mother alone . Since I parted from her I had seen a great deal of fine company , and Theo and I had paid our respects to the King and Queen at St. James 's ; but we had seen no more stately person than this who welcomed us , and raising my wife from her knee , embraced her and led her.into the house . T was a plain , wood-built place , with a gallery round , as our Virginian houses are ; but if it had been a palace , with a little empress inside , our reception could not have been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the evening my Lady Warrington had to receive all the gentry of the little town , which she did with perfect grace and good-humor , and I had to shake hands with a few old acquaintances-old enemies I was going to say ; but I had come into a fortune and was no longer a naughty prodigal . Wby , a drove of fatted calves was killed in my honor ! My poor hal was of the entertainment , hut gloomy and crest-fallen . His mother spoke to him , but it was as a queen to a rebellious prince , her son , who was not yet forgiven . We two slipped away from the company and went up to the rooms assigned to me ; but there , as we began a free conversation , our mother , taper in hand , appeared with her pale face . Did I want any thing ? Was every thing quite as I wished it ? She had peeped in at the dearest children , who were sleeping like cherubs . How she did caress them , and delight over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airs , and the little Theo 's smiles and dimples ! " Supper is just coming on the table , Sir George . If you like our cookery better thtin the tavern , Henry , I beg you to stay . What a different welcome there was in the words and tone addressed to each of us ! Hal hung down his head , and followed to the lower room . A clergyman begged a blessing on the meal . He touched with not a little art and eloquence upon our arrival at home , upon our safe passage across the stormy waters , upon the love and forgiveness which awaited us in the mansions of the Heavenly Parent when the storms of life were over . Here was a new clergyman , quite unlike some whom I remembered about us in earlier days , and I praised him , but Madam Esmo.nd shook her head . She was afraid his principles were very dangerous ; she was afraid others had adopted those dangerous principles . hind I not seen the paper signed by the burgesses and merchants at Williamsburg the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washingtons , and the like ; and oh , my dear , that I should have to say it , our name-that is , your brother 's ( by what influence I do not like to say ) , and this unhappy Mr. Belman 's who begged a blessing last night . If there had been quarrels in our little colonial society when I left home , what were these to the feuds I found raging on my return ? We had sent the Stamp Act to America , and been forced to repeal it . Then we must try a new set *f duties on glass , paper , and what not , and repeal that Act too , with the exception of a duty on tea . From Boston to Charleston the tea was confiscated . Even my mother , loyal as she was , gave up her favorite drink ; and my poor wife would have had to forego hers , hut we had brought a quantity for our private drinking on hoard ship , which had paid four times as much duty at home . Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying duty . The home government must have some means of revenue , or its pretensions to authority were idle . They say the colonies were tried and tyrannized over ; I say the home gov eminent was tried and tyrannized over . ( T is but an affair of argument and history now ; we tried the question , and were beat ; and the matter is settled as completely as the conquest of Britain by the Normans . ) And all along , from conviction I trust , I own to have taken the British side of the quarrel . In that brief and unfortunate experience of war which I had had in my early life , the universal cry of the army and wellaffected persons was , that Mr. Braddock 's expedition had failed , and defeat and disaster had fallen upon us , in consequence of the remissness , the selfishness , and the rapacity of many of the very people for whose defense against the French arms had been taken up . The colonists were for having all done for them , and for doing nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend them ; they failed in contracts ; they furnished niggardly supplies ; they multiplied delays until the hour for beneficial action was past , and until the catastrophe came which never need have occurred but for their ill-will . What shouts of joy were there , and what ovations for the great British minister who had devised and effected the conquest of Canada ! Monsieur de Vaudreuil said justly that that conquest was the signal for the defection of the North American colonies from their allegiance to Great Britain ; and my Lord Chatham , having done his best to achieve tho first part of the scheme , contributed more than any man in England toward the completion of it . The colonies were insurgent , and he apPlauded their rebellion . What scores of thousands of waverers must he have encouraged into resistance ! It was a general who says to an army in revolt , " God save the king ! My men , you have a right to mutiny ! " No wonder they set up his statue in this town , and his picture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and governors in effigy . To our Virginian town of Williamshurg some wiseacres must suhscribe to bring over a portrait of my lord , in the habit of a Roman orator speaking in the Forum , to he sure , and pointing to the palace of Whitehall , and the special window out of which Charles I. was beheaded ! Here was a neat allegory , and a pretty compliment to a British statesman ! I hear , however , that my lord 's head was painted from a hust , and so was taken off without his knowledge . Now my country is England , not America or Virginia ; and I take , or rather took , the English side of the dispute . My sympathies had always heen with home , where I was now a squire and a citizen ; but had my lot been to plant tobacco , and live on the banks of James River or Potomac , no doubt my opinions had been altered . When , for instance , I visited my brother at his new house and plantation , I found him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had some words upon the matter in dispute-who had not in those troublesome times ?  --  but our argument was carried on without rancor ; even my new sister could not bring us to that , though she did her best when we were // together , and in the curtain lectures which I have no doubt she inflicted on her spouse , like a notable housewife as she was . But we trusted in each other so entirely that even I-larry 's duty toward his wife would not make him quarrel with his brother . He loved me from old times , when my word was law with him ; he still protested that he and every Virginian gentleman of his side was loyal to the Crown . War was not declared as yet , and gentlemen of different opinions were courteous enough to one another . Nay , at our public dinners and festivals , the health of the King was still ostentatiously drunk ; and the assembly of every colony , though preparing for Congress , though resisting all attempts at taxation on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard for the King our Father , and pathetic in its al ) peals to that paternal sovereign to put away evil counselors from him , and listen to the voice of moderation and reason . Up to the last our Virginian gentry were a grave , orderly , aristocratic folk , with the strongest sense of their own dignity and station . In later days , and nearer home , we have heard of fraternization and equality . Among the great folks of our Old World I have never seen a gentleman standing more on his dignity and maintaining it better than Mr. Washington : no , not the King against *vhomn he took arms . In the eyes of all *e gentry of the French Court , who gayly joined in the crusade against us , and so took their revenge for Canada , the great American chief always appeared as anax andrjn , and they allowed that his better could not be seen in Versailles itself . Though they were quarreling with the Governor , the gentlemen of the House of Burgesses still maintained amicable relations with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived , and held his court at Williamsburg in no small splendor and state , all the gentry waited upon him , Madam Esmond included . And at his death , Lord Dunmore , who succeeded him , and brought a fine family with him , was treated with the utmost respect by our gentry privately , though publicly the House of Assembly and the Governor were at war . Their quarrels are a matter of history , and concern me personally only so far as this , that our burgesses being convened for the 1st of March in the year after my arrival in Virginia , it was agreed that we should all pay a visit to our capital , and our duty to the Governor . Since Harry 's unfortunate marriage Madam Esmond had not performed this duty , though always previously accustomed to pay it ; but now that her eldest son was arrived in the colony my mother opined that we must certainly wait upon his Excellency the Governor ; nor were we sorry , perhaps , to get away from our little Richmond to enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a great price , the best house to be had at Richmond for herself and her family . Now I was rich her generosity was curious . I had more than once to interpose ( her old servants likewise wondering at her new way of life ) , and beg her not to be so lavish . But she gently said , in former days she had occasion to save , which now existed no more . Harry bad enough , sure , with such a wife as he had taken out of the housekeeper 's room . If she chose to be a little extravagant now , why should she hesitate ? She had not her dearest daughter and grandchildren with her every day ( she fell in love with all three of them , and spoiled them as much as they were capable of being spoiled ) . Besides , in former days I certainly could not accuse her of too much extravagance , and this , I think , was almost the only allusion she made to the pecuniary differences between us . So she had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plate , and furniture from Castlewood by sea at no small charge , and her dress in which she had been married in George II . s reign ; and we all flattered ourselves that our coach made the greatest figure of any except his Excellency 's , and we engaged Signor Formicalo , his Excellency 's major-domo , to superintend the series of feasts that were given in my honor ; and more flesh-pots were set a-stewing in our kitchens in one month , our servants said , than had been known in the family since the young gentleman went away . So great was Theo 's influence over my mother that she actually persuaded her , that year , to receive our sister Fanny , Hal 's wife , who would have staid upon the plantation rather than face Madam Esmond . But trusting to Theo 's promise of amnesty , Fanny ( to whose house we had paid more than one visit ) came up to town , and made her courtesy to Madam Esmond , and was forgiven . And rather than be forgiven in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would prefer perdition or utter persecution . " You know these , my dear ? " says Madam Esmond , pointing to her fine silver sconces . " Fanny bath often cleaned them when she was with me at Castlewood . And this dress , too , Fanny knows , I dare say ? Her poor mother had the care of it . I always had the greatest confidence in her . " Here there is wrath flashing from Fanny 's eyes , which our mother , who has forgiven her , does not perceive-not she ! " Oh , she was a treasure to me ! " Madam resumes . " I never should have nursed my boys through their illnesses but for your mother 's admirable care of them . Colonel Lee , permit me to present you to my daughter , my Lady Warrington . Her ladyship is a neighbor of your relatives the Bunburys at home . Here comes his Excellency . Welcome , my lord And our princess performs before his lordship one of those courtesies of which she was not a little proud ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smile . " By George ! madam , " says Mr. Lee , " since Count Borulawski , I have not seen a bow so elegant as your ladyship 's . " " And pray , Sir , who was Count Borulawski ? " asks madam . " He was a nobleman high in favor with his // Polish Majesty , " replies Mr. Lee . " May I ask you , madam , to present me to your distinguish-edson ? " " This is Sir George Warrington , " says my mother , pointing to me . " Pardon me , madam . I meant Captain Warrington , who was by Mr. Wolfe 's side when he died . I had been contented to share his fate , so I had been near him . " And the ardent Lee swaggers up to Harry , and takes his hand with respect , and pays him a compliment or two , which makes me , at least , pardon him for his late impertinence : for my ( learest Hal walks gloomily through his mother 's rooms , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had had many meetings , which the stern mother could not interrupt , and in which that instinctive love which bound us to one another , and which nothing could destroy , had opportunity to speak . Entirely unlike each other in our pursuits , our tastes , our opinions-his life being one of eager exercise , active sport , and all the amusements of the field , while mine is to dawdle over books and spend my time in languid self-contemplation -- we have , nevertheless , had such a sympathy as almost passes the love of women . My poor Hal confessed as much to me , for his part , in his artless manner , when we went away without wives or womankind , except a few negroes left in the place , and passed a week at Castlewood together . The Ladies did not love each other . I know enough of my lady Theo to see , after a very few glances , whether or not she takes a liking to another of her amiable sex . All my powers of persuasion or command fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a word against Mrs. This or Miss That ? Not she ! Has she been otherwise than civil ? No , assuredly ! My lady Theo is polite to a beggarwoman , treats her kitchen-maids like duchesses , and murmurs a compliment to the dentist for his elegant manner of pulling her tooth out . She would black my boots , or clean the grate , if I ordained it ( always looking like a duchess the while ) ; but as soon as I say to her , " My dear creature , be fond of this lady , or t' other ! " all obedience ceases ; she executes the most refined courtesies ; smiles and kisses even to order ; but l ) erforms that mysterious undefinable freemasonic signal , which passes between women , by which each knows that the other hates her . So , with regard to Fanny , we had met at her house , and at others . I remembered her affectionately from old days , I fully credited poor Hal 's violent protests and tearful oaths , that , by George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry her . He could n't stand by and see a poor thing tortured as she was without coming to her rescue ; no , by Heavens , he could n't ! I say I believed all this , and had for my sister-in-law a genuine compassion as well as an early regard ; and yet I had no love to give her ; and , in reply to Hal 's passionate outbreaks in praise of her beauty and worth , and eager queries to me whether I did not think her a perfect paragon ? I could only answer with faint compliments or vague approval , feeling all the while that I was disappointing my poor ardent fellow , and cursing inwardly that revolt against flattery and falsehood into which I sometimes frantically rush . Why should I not say , " Yes , dear Hal , thy wife is a paragon ; her singing is delightful , her hair and shape are beautiful ; " as I might have said by a little common stretch of politeness ? Why could I not cajole this or that stnpid neighbor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , finding all sorts of lively prattle to amuse them , while I sit before them dumb and gloomy ? I say it was a sin not to have more words to say in praise of Fanny . We ought to have praised her ; we ought to have liked her . My Lady Warrington certainly ought to have liked her , for she can play the hypocrite , and I can not . And there was this young creature - pretty , graceful , shaped like a nymph , with beautiful black eyes - and we cared for them no more than for two gooseberries ! At Warrington my wife and I , when we pretended to compare notes , elaborately complimented each other on our new sister 's beauty . What lovely eyes ! - Oh yes ! What a sweet little dimple on her chin ! - Ak , oei ! What wonderful little feet ! - Perfectly Chinese ! where should we in London get slippers small enough for her ? And these compliments exhausted , we knew that we did not like Fanny the value of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that we ha . . . Well , what hypocrites women are ! We heard from many quarters how eagerly my brother had taken up the new anti-English opinion , and what a champion he was of so-called American rights and freedom . " It is her doing , my dear , " says I to my wife . " If I had said so much I am sure you would have scolded me , " says my Lady Warrington , laughing : and I did straightway begin to scold her , and say it was most cruel of her to suspect our new sister ; and what earthly right had we to do so ? But I say again , I know Madam Theo so well , that when once she has got a prejudice against a person in her little head , not all the king 's horses nor all the king 's men will get it out again . I vow nothing would induce her to believe that Harry was not hen-pecked - nothing . Well , we went to Castlewood together without the women , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had been so happy , and I , at least , so gloomy . It was winter , and duck time , and Harry went away to the river , and shot dozens and scores and bushels of canvasbacks , while I remained in my grandfather 's library among the old mouldering books which I loved in my childhood-which I see in a dim vision still resting on a little boy 's lap , as he sits by an old white-headed gentleman 's knee . I read my books ; I slept in my own bed and room - religiously kept , as my mother told me , and left as on the day when I went to Europe . Hal 's cheery voice would wake me as of old . Like all // men who love to go a-field , he was an early riser : he would come and wake me , and sit on the foot of the bed and perfume the air with his morning pipe , as the house negroes laid great logs on the fire . It was a happy time ! Old Nathan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were deposited . We had had cares , struggles , battles , bitter griefs , and disappointments ; we were boys again as we sat there together . I am a boy now even , as I think of the time . That unlucky tea-tax , which alone of the taxes lately imposed upon the colonies the home government was determined to retain , was met with defiance throughout America . T is true we paid a shilling in the pound at home , and asked only threepence from Boston or Charleston : but as a question of principle , the impost was refused hy the provinces , which indeed ever showed a most spirited determination to pay as little as they could help . In Charleston , the tea-ships were unloaded and the cargoes stowed in cellars . From New York and Philadelphia , the vessels were turned back to London . In Boston ( where there was an armed force , whom the inhabitants were perpetually mohbing ) , certain patriots , painted and disguised as Indians , hoarded the ships , and flung the obnoxious cargoes into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against this city of Mohocks in masquerade . The notable Boston Port Bill was brought forward in the British House of Commons ; the port was closed and the Custom-house removed to Salem . The Massachusetts Charter was annulled ; and-in just apprehension that riots might ensue , in dealing with the perpetrators of which the colonial courts might be led to act partially-Parliament decreed that persons indicted for acts of violence and armed resistance might be sent home , or to another colony , for trial . If such acts set all America in a flame , they certainly drove all well-wishers of our country into a fury . I might have sentenced Master Miles Warrington , at five years old , to a whipping , and he would have cried , taken down his little smallclothes and submitted ; hut suppose I offered ( and he richly deserving it ) to chastise Captain Miles of the Prince 's Dragoons ? He would whirl my paternal cane out of my hand , box my hair-powder out of my ears . Lord a-mercy ! I tremble at the very idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word ; and if ; I say , I think the home Parliament had a right to levy taxes in the colonies , I own that we took means most captious , most insolent , most irritaflag , and , above all , most impotent , to assert our claim . Mv Lord Dunmore , our Governor of Virginia , upon Lord Bottetourt 's death , received me into some intimacy soon after my arrival in the colony , being willing to live on good terms with all our gentry . My mother 's severe loyalty was no secret to him ; indeed , she waved the king 's banner in all companies , and talked so loudly and resolutely that Randolph and Patrick Henry himself were struck dumb before her . It was Madam Esmond 's celebrated reputation for loyalty ( his Excellency laughingly told me ) which induced him to receive her eldest son to grace . " I have had the worst character of you from home , " his lordship said . " Little birds whisper to me , Sir George , that you are a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Wilkes and Alderman Beckford . I am not sure you have not been at Medmenham Abbey . You have lived with players , poets , and all sorts of wild people . I have been warned against you , Sir , and I find you- " " Not so black as I have been painted , " I interrupted his lordship with a smile . " Faith , " says my lord , " if I tell Sir George Warrington that he seems to me a very harmless , quiet gentleman , and that t is a great relief to me to talk to him amidst these loud politicians ; these lawyers with their perpetual noise about Greece and Rome ; these Virginian squires who are forever professing their loyalty and respect , while they are shal*ing their fists in my face - I hope nobody overhears us , " says my lord , with an arch smile , " and nobody will carry my opinions home . " His lordship 's ill opinion having been removed by a better knowledge of me , our acquaintance daily grew more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my own , a close friendship arose - between them and my wife at least . Hal 's wife , received kindly at the little provincial court , as all ladies were , made herself by no means popular there by the hot and eager political tone which she adopted . She assailed all the Government measures with indiscriminating acrimony . Were they lenient ? She said the perfidious British Government was only preparing a snare , and hiding its time until it could forge heavier chains for unhappy America . Were they angry ? Why did not every American citizen rise , assert his rights as a freeman , and serve every British governor , officer , soldier , as they had treated the East India Company 's tea ? My mother , on the other hand , was pleased to express her opinions with equal frankness , and , indeed , to press her advice upon his Excellency with a volubility which may have fatigued that representative of the Sovereign .

And if not only the burgesses but the burgesses ' wives could have been led off to punishment and captivity , I think this Brutus of a woman would scarce have appealed against the sentence .
