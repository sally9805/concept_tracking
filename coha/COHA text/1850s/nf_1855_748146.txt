I beg that you will thank the young philosopher , and make my compliments to Lady 13 and her sister . " Believe me , your very obliged and faithful , BYRON . " Ill subsequent letters to Lord Blcssington , Byron repeatedly returns to the subject of the count s English journal . One writ ten on the 6th of April ( the very day after that before quoted ) , to condole with the Earl of Blessington on the death of his only son , thus concludes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power , and to your Alfred . I think , since his majesty of the same name , there has not been such a learned surveyor of our Saxon , society . " Again , on the 9th , " I salute the illus trious Chevalier Count D Orsay , who , I hope , will continue his History of His Own Times . There are some strange coinci dences between a part of his remarks and a certain work of mine now in MS. in England ( I do not mean the hermeticallysealed memoirs , but a continuation of certain cantos of a certain poem ) , especially in what a man may do in London with impu nity while he is a la mode . " And in a letter which Mr. Moore did not print at length , Byron said of D Orsay , " He seems to have all the qualities requisite to have figured in his brother-inlaw s ancestor s Memoirs " alluding to the famous Memoirs of Grammont .

My approbation , as you are pleased to term it . was very sincere , but perhaps not /z/ very impartial ; for , though I love my country , I do not love my countrymen at least , such as they now are . And besides the seduction of talent arid wit in your work , I fear that to me there was the attraction of vengeance . I have seen and felt much of what you have described so well . I have known the persons and the reunions described ( many of them , that is to say ) , and the portraits arc so like , that I can not but admire the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry for you ; for if you are so well acquainted with life at your age , what will be come of you when the illusion is still more dissipated ? " The illusion was wholly dissipated , but only a few months before D Orsay s death . On the 6th of May following , his lordship writes to Lady Blessington : " I have a request to make my friend Alfred ( since he has not disdained the title ) , viz. , that he would condescend to add a cap to the gentleman in the jacket it would complete his costume , and smooth his brow , which is somewhat too inveterate a like ness of the original , God help me ! " The diary of Count D Orsay , illustrative of London fashion able life , which was pronounced by such competent authority to be equal to any thing Count de Grammont has left us about con temporary frivolity , is said by others to have surpassed the me moirs of the latter in genuine wit and humor . The Duchesse de Grammont has the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects ; most of the latter were sold to pay debts . His journal was burned by himself some years back . It was on the occasion of D Orsay s first visit to London that he made the acquaintance of Lord and Lady Blessington , not in garrison in France , as has generally but erroneously been stated ; neither is the assertion true that it was to accompany them to Italy that he abandoned the intention of joining the expedition to ypain , there being no question of his doing so at the period of that visit . &gt; At the earnest desire of Lord and Lady Blessington , the young Frenchman became one of the party in their tour through France mid Ttaly . During thoir jouruoy nnrl prolonged sojourn in the /z/ latter country , the companionable qualities , and that peculiar power of making himself agreeable , which he possessed to a degree almost unequaled , so endeared him to his English friends , that a union was at length proposed by Lord Blessing-ton be tween the count and one of his daughters , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sister of Lord Blessington . This proposition meeting the approval of the count s family , it was finally decided that Lady Harriette , the younger daugh ter , should become his wife , and she was accordingly sent for to Italy , where the marriage was celebrated. * After a long Continental tour , and a sojourn of some years in Italy , Lord and Lady Blessington , with the Count and Countess D Orsay , came to reside in Paris , where , in 1829 , Lord Blessington died of apoplexy . During the Revolution of 1830 , the events of which are related by Lady Blessington in the ; Idler in France , " Count D Orsay , during the most dangerous moments , was constantly abroad in the streets ; and on more than one occasion , when recognized , though known to be the brother-in-law of the Due de Guiche , one of the staunchest of the Legitimists , he was greeted by the people with shouts of " Vive le Comte D Orsay / " Such was the influence which his mere presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others of his insinuating manners and pre possessing appearance was the extreme affection and confidence he inspired in children , of whom he was very fond , but who usually seemed as if they were irresistibly drawn toward him , even before he attempted to win them . The shyest and most reserved were no more proof against this influence than the * We find in the " Annual Register " for 183f an account of the marriage cere mony having been performed at Naples by the chaplain of the British cmbassador . " At Naples , in December 1827 , Count Alfred D Orsay , only son of General Count D Orsay , to the Lady Harriette Anne Frances Gardiner , daughter of the Right Hon. the Earl of Blessington . " Of this unhappy marriage an account has been given in the preceding memoir , and the sentiments of the author in regard to it have been expressed there . Of the greatness of the calamity of that union , and the grievous wrong done by it to one almost a child in years , experience , and understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been already said by him on that painful subject . R. R. M /z/ most confiding . Children who in general would hardly venture to look at a stranger , would steal to his side , take his hand , and seem to be quite happy and at ease when they were near him . The same power of setting others perfectly at their ease in his presence extended to his influence over grown-up persons . In society he was agreeable , attentive , kind , and considerate to all ; no one was too humble , too retiring , too little au fait in the modes of living , acting , and thinking of those among whom he might be accidentally thrown , to be beneath his notice , or beyond the reach of his extraordinary power of finding out mer it , devising means of drawing out any peculiar talent the per son might possess , or of discovering some topic of interest to the party on which he could get into conversation with him . Men of all opinions , classes , and positions , found themselves at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this not from any effort or any unworthy concession on his part , but from a natural facility of adapting himself to the peculiarities of those around him . His active mind sought and found abundant occupation in such conversational exercise . He often said that " he had never known the meaning of the word cmiui " No matter where or with whom he might be , he found means to employ his mind and his time more or less usefully or agree ably . The dullest country - town had for him as many resources as Paris or London . Wherever he went , he was disposed to find every thing interesting and good in its way , and every body capable of being made amusing and agreeable . To the last , when time , grief , and disappointment , the loss of fortune , friends , and nearly all he loved best on earth , might well be supposed to have soured his disposition , this happy turn of mind yet remain ed unimpaired as in his eaj.iy youth . Arrogance , and affectation , and purse-proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his keen wit and re markable powers of raillery were not unfrequently set , and per haps his only enemies were those who had fallen under his lash , or who were jealous of the superiority ot his talents . Some months after the death of Lord Blessington , Lady Blessington and the Count and Countess D Orsay returned to England . /z/ Shortly before the death of Count D Orsay s mother , who en tertained feelings of strong attachment for Lady Blessino-ton , the former had spoken with great earnestness of her apprehensions for her son , on account of his tendency to extravagance , and of lier desire that Lady Blessington would advise and counsel him , and do her utmost to counteract those propensities which had already been attended with embarrassments , and had occasioned her great fears for his welfare . The promise that was given on that occasion was often alluded to by Lady Blessington , and , after her death , by Count D Orsay . A variety of painful circumstances , which have no place in the present memoir , led to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the death of Lord Blessington . On her return to London , Lady Blessington took a house in Seamore Place , and Count D Orsay one in Curzon Street ; from thence they removed to Kensington Gore Lady Blessington to Gore House , Count D Orsay to a small dwelling adjoining it ; but finally they both occupied the former place of abode till the break-up of that establishment in April , 1849 . The count returned to his native country after a residence of nineteen years in London . In Paris he was joined by Lady Blessington and her nieces , the Misses Power , shortly after his arrival ; and in the following month of June he met , in her loss , an affliction , from the effects of which he never thoroughly re covered . The ensuing year he realized a plan he had formed and often spoken of in happier days . He hired an immense studio , with some smaller rooms connected with it , attached to the house of M.Gerdin , the celebrated marine painter . Here he transported all his possessions ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brushes , paints , &c.),; and with the extraordinary taste and talent for arrangement that constituted one of his gifts , a large waste room , with naked loft , became transformed into one of the most elegantly fitted up and admirably disposed studios of Paris , and , at the same time , a habitable salon of great beauty , combining requisites for a museum en miniature , arid objects of virtu and art sufficient to furnish a small gallery . In this salon /z/ he might be said to be domiciled . Here he lived , here he daily received the visits of some of the greatest celebrities of Europe ; statesmen , politicians , diplomatists , men of letters , and artists , were his constant visitors and frequent guests . The ex-roi Jerome continued to be one of the most faithful and attached of his friends . The paternal affection of the good old man , with the warm regard of his son , the Prince Napoleon , formed a remarkable contrast to the conduct of others , which fully bore out the observation , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paid by the blackest ingratitude . " The ex-king Jerome never swerved in his affection for Count D Orsay , and his earnest desire was to see him elevated to a post worthy of his position and talents . This hope , however , was destined to be defeated . The President of the Republic had nothing in common with the exile and prisoner of Ham ; he who had long and largely served , counseled , and aided in various ways the latter , through good report and evil report had been a faithful friend to him , was looked on with coldness and aver sion when he proved too independent and high-spirited to be a mere servile , opinioiiless partisan of the most astute as well as successful conspirator of modern times ; and as his presence recalled obligations in private life , he became an object of jeal ousy , his services a disagreeable souvenir . The poor count pined away , long expecting an appointment , but expecting it in vain . His health broke down , and when it was completely broken down , Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck by the hand of death , the nominal post of Director of Fine Arts , the duties of which office he was no longer able to perform . The prince imagined , by the tardy act of grat itude , he had screened himself from the just reproaches of all who knew their former connection . Count D Orsay was struck to the heart by ic ingratitude of Louis Napoleon , but his generous nature was incapable of bit terness , and no sentiment of animosity was engendered by it ; he suffered deeply and long in silence , but the wound festered , and at times it was evident enough how much it galled him . From thr period of Lady Bles si niton s death , the count had /z/ given up general society , and during the last two years of his life he confined himself almost altogether to the house , receiving in his studio-salon morning visits of his family and a very small circle of intimate friends . Lady Blessington s nieces , the com panions of his happy and prosperous days , his attendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his familv , his beloved sister , the ex-roi Jerome and his son , Emile de Girardin , Dr. Cabarrus , his school-fellow , the son of the celebrated Mad am Tallien , and the well-known Monsieur Ouvrard , Madam de U , the Comtesse of D , were among the last in whose constant society he found repose and pleasure when that of others had lost its charm . In the spring of 1852 , the spinal malady which finally proved fatal declared itself , and then commenced a long series of suf ferings , which ended but with his life sufferings endured with fortitude , patience , uncomplaining gentleness , a manifest ab sence of all selfishness , and consideration for those attending on him , which none but those whose painful task it was to watch by his couch could form any idea of . In the month of July he was ordered to Dieppe as a last re source , and thither he was accompanied by Lady Blessington s nieces . From the time of his arrival in Dieppe he sunk rap idly ; at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 4th of August , 1852 , breathed his last , surrounded by those whose unremitting care had been the last consolation of his declining days . During his illness he had more than once been visited by the excellent Archbishop of Paris , though a comparatively late ac quaintance , who entertained for him a warm regard . Two days previous to his decease , the archbishop had a long conversation with him , arid at parting embraced him , assuring him of his friendship and affectionate regard. * The following day , the last of his existence , he received the consolations of religion from the cure of Chambourcy . For the church of this good priest he had done a great deal : he had restored many /z/ of the pictures , and bestowed the original picture of the Mater Dolorosa , which had been painted by himself expressly for the church , the lithograph of which is well known , and is sold un der the title of the Magdalen , though why thus called it would be difficult to say . Thus terminated , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly-gifted man , when hardly beyond the prime of life . An innate love of all that was beautiful in nature and excel lent in art , a generous , chivalrous nature , strong sympathies with suffering , ardent feelings , a kindly disposition , elegant tastes , and fine talents , capable of being turned in almost any pursuit to an excellent account , these were the distinguishing charac teristics of Count Alfred D Orsay . Many gifts and advantages , natural and intellectual , were united in him . To remarkable personal comeliness were added great strength and courage , which nothing could daunt , and an adroitness which enabled him to excel in every thing he at tempted . He was one of the best horsemen , the best shots , the best fencers , and the best boxers of his day . His talents as a painter and sculptor , though wanting cultivation and study , were of the first order ; he had an excellent ear , and some taste for music , with a tolerable tenor voice , which , however , he very rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste in all matters of dress , furniture , and equipage , as well as in art , excellent . In his mind and his manners there was a singular mixture of refinement , simplicity , warmth , and frankness , very productive of strongly pleasing impressions . Generous to lavishness , frank to indiscretion , unsuspicious to credulity , disinter ested to imprudence , his defects were , in the eyes of his ardent friends , the excesses of his noble qualities . He has been often heard to say that he would prefer being deceived a hundred times rather than suspect another unjustly . He had a great horror of scandal , and possessed chivalrous feelings , which led him always to take the part of those who were violently assail ed , absent or present , known to him or utter strangers . During his residence at Gore House he was a generous bene factor to those of his nation who required alms , encouragement . /z/ assistance , introductions , hospitality . From Louis Napoleon to the poorest exile , his services were rendered with a frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy for mis fortune , that increased the value of his assistance . He founded the Socicte dc Bienfaisance , still existing in London , for the bene fit of his distressed countrymen , nor was his aid ever withheld from the poor or suffering of his adopted country , for his admi ration for England ended only with his life . In his temper , either in sickness or in health , he was never irritable nor morose . Those who were about him and in attend ance on him said , " They never knew any one so easy to live with , so little given to find fault . " But there was one thing in his demeanor and carriage of a very marked and distinguished character ; the high bearing , proud spirit , and strong energy of a nobly constituted man were mingled with the gentleness , the sensibility , self-devotion , and tenderness of a woman s nature . Frank and open in all his deal ings , the idea of deceiving or condescending to stoop to any sophistry in conversation never entered his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition were admirably associated with external advantages , and set off by an appearance of no ordinary comeliness , which in its perfec tions united excellence of form , coloring , and expression . Yit , genius , and generosity , thus gracefully presented , and graciously recommended in his person to observation , it may not be much wondered at , were admired ; nor need we doubt that Alfred D Orsay was regarded by many with sentiments of regard and esteem , and by some with stronger feelings of affection than may be easily reconcilable with the prevailing opinion of his faults and his defects . Many of the preceding observations have been written by one most intimately acquainted with Count D Orsay , and devoted in her attentions to him in his last illness , and up to his last mo ments ; one who had known him long and well in the full force and vigor of life and health in happier times , in the brilliant circle in which he moved , " the glass of fashion and the mould of form ; " who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all /z/ around him , and in splendid equipages , witching also the world of fashion in Hyde Park " with noble horsemanship , " " the ob served of all observers , " there and every where he came . They were written by one who had seen him in a few months re duced from a high position , surrounded with all the luxuries of life , from health and happiness to comparative obscurity and in digence , to wretchedness and weariness of life , utterly broken down in health and spirits . They were written with the warm feelings of elevated kindness and of unfailing friendship of a woman s heart , ever most true and faithful when the object of its solicitude stands most in need of pity and of care . In this notice we must not look for a close and scrutinizing search for frailties and errors ; and we may fairly presume , however truthful the account may be which is given to us of the many excellent qualities of this gifted man , that he had his faults and imperfections ; and happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of evil is counterbalanced to some ex tent by that of good . The nearest and dearest living relation of Count D Orsay , who cherishes his memory as one of the objects in this world most precious to her , makes no concealment of her conviction that Count D Orsay s ignorance of the value of money the profuse expenditure into which he was led by that ignorance , the temp tation to play arising from it , the reckless extravagance into which he entered , not so much to minister to his own pleasures as to gratify the feelings of an inordinate generosity of disposi tion , that prompted him to give whenever he was called on , and to forget the obligations he contracted for the sake of others , and the heavy penalties imposed on his friends by his frequent ap peals for pecuniary assistance , were very grievous faults , and great defects in his character . In other respects , it can not be denied that great wrongs were inflicted on one entitled to pro tection from him ; that public opinion was outraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many plausible themes ; and , however groundless may be the innumerable ru mors prejudicial to character that had been industriously prop agated in relation to them , that great imprudence had been com- /z/ mitted , and grave suspicions had " been incurred by that impru dence . Those who deal rigorously with the defects of other people may be very conscious of being exempt from the failings they discover in eminent persons filling a large space in the public view like the late Count D Orsay ; but before they exult over much in the fullness of their sense of superiority over others less perfect than themselves , and in the abundance of their self-com placency give thanks to God they are not like those other frail and erring people , let them be well satisfied they have no frail ties themselves of a different description , and that they are in possession of all the good qualities that may belong even to their erring brothers ; let them be well assured that , had their own position in early life , and at the commencement of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil influences , as those of the persons who are condemned by them may have been , their own virtue was of such exalted ex cellence that it would have triumphed over all those unfortu nate circumstances and influences which had militated against the happiness and good repute of others . The following facts need no comments , and render any further statements unnecessary on the subject I have referred to , of lav ish extravagance . Soon after the count separated from his wife , an agreement was executed , in 1838 , whereby he relinquished all his interest in the Blessington estates , in consideration of certain annuities amounting to .2467 being redeemed , or allowed to remain charged upon the estates ( the sum then necessary to redeem them was calculated at 23,500 ) , and also in consideration of a sum of 55,000 to be paid to him ; 1 3,000 , part thereof , as soon as it could be raised , and the remaining .42,000 within ten years . These latter sums were not paid until the estates had been sold , namely , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80,000 , and that entire amount was paid to parties to whom the count had given securities on the estates ; so that with the annuities , the actual amount paid to his creditors out of the estates was upward of 103,500 . During his residence /z/ in England lie had an allowance from the Court of Chancery in Ireland of 550 , and Lady Harriet .400 a year . ** D Orsay s embarrassments , from the years 1837 and 1838 to the close of his career , were continuous . In 1841 , some efforts . were made by his friends to extricate him from them . It was the honorable motive of turning his talents to a profitable ac count which subsequently led him to devote himself to art with the idea of ultimately increasing his income by his pursuits as a sculptor and a painter , and to cultivate the friendship of art ists , with the view of deriving advantage from their several excellences in their pursuits . Most of his works of art are well known . His portrait of " Wellington , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ficient to mention Count D Orsay s name to insure his attention and interest even when otherwise occupied , was , he believes , the last for which the duke ever sat . At its completion his grace warmly shook hands with the noble artist , exclaiming , " At last I have been painted like a gentleman ! I ll never sit to any one else . " In Paris he executed a splendid bust of Lamartine , on which the poet wrote some fine verses ; one ofErnile de Ciirardin , the boldest , the ablest , and the last open supporter of liberty against oppression ; one of Napoleon Bonaparte , the son of Jerome ; a picture of &gt;Sir Ilobert Peel ; various other sketches and medallions ; and , shortly before his death , he had completed the small model of a full-sized statue of the ex-king Jerome , ordered by government for the Salle des Marechaux de France , and had commenced a colossal statue of Napoleon . The following article respecting the merits of Count D Orsay as an artist appeared in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( written by Monsieur dc la Guerronniere ) , on the occasion of the exhibition of a bust of Lamartine executed by the count . The lines which follow the article , composed by Lamartine , are not the least admirable of the celebrated poet . /z/ " M. le Comtc D Orsay est un amateur de Part plutot qu un artiste .

As the arbiter clegantiarum , he has reigned supreme in matters of taste and fashion , confirming the attempts of oth ers by his approbation , or gratifying them by his example . To dress or drive , to shine in the gay world like Count D Orsay , was once the ambition of the youth of England , who then dis covered in this model no higher attributes . But if time , who steals our years away , steals also our pleasures , he replaces them with others , or substitutes a better thing ; and thus it has befallen with Count D Orsay . " If the gay equipage or the well-appareled man be less fre quently seen than formerly , that which causes more lasting sat- /z/ isfaction , and leaves an impression of a far more exalted nature , comes day by day into higher relief , awakening only the regret that it should have been concealed so long . When we see what Count D Orsay s productions are , we are tempted to ask , with Malvolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " But AVC are glad to see that they are hidden no more , and the accomplished count seems disposed to show the world of how much he is really capable . His croquis de societe had long charmed his friends , and his great skill in modeling was bruited abroad , when the world began to ask , Is it true that in the man of fashion exists the genius of the sculptor and the painter ? Evidence was soon given that such surmises were true . " Count D Orsay s statuettes of Napoleon and the Duke of Wellington , and his portraits of Dwarkanauth Tagore and Lord Lyndhurst , exhibited capabilities of the first order , and satisfied every inquiry . Additional proof of his powers has been afford ed by the publication of the engraving of his portrait of Lord Byron . " It is certainly a highly interesting work of art , and , in point of resemblance , we are assured that one who knew him , per haps best of all , has declared that , until now , there never exist ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that thoughtful and intelligent countenance were want ing in other portraits , but in this they are all happily united . " Count D Orsay has represented the noble bard where most he loved to be , on the deck of his own vessel . He is sitting in sailor s costume , leaning on the rudder , with his right hand un der his chin , and his head elevated . In his fine large eyes is an expression of deep thought , and a pensive character marks his firm , but femininely-cut mouth . His noble expanse of fore head and fine contour of head are drawn with a free and vigor ous pencil . If we did not know whose likeness was intended , we should still call this portrait an exceedingly fine study ; but our interest in it is increased by the fidelity of the resemblance . The portrait is well engraved by Lewis . " We understand that his grace the Duke of Wellington is so well pleased with the statuettes to which we have alluded , cop- /z/ ies of which he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is now sitting to the count for his portrait also . We there fore look forward with a very pleasant anticipation to another likeness of the hero of a hundred fights and pictures too . " Haydon , in his Diary , 31st of June , 1838 , makes mention of D Orsay : " About seven D Orsay called , whom I had not seen for long . Pie was much improved , and looking the glass of fashion and the mould of form ; really a complete Adonis , not made up at all . He made some capital remarks , all of which must be attended to . They were sound impressions and grand . He bounded into his cab , and drove off like a young Apollo with a fiery Pegasus . I looked after him . I like to see such speci mens. " * Again , in his Diary , 10th of July , 1839 , Haydon observes : " D Orsay called and pointed out several things to correct in the horse ( the Duke of Wellington s charger ) , verifiying Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he took my brush in his dandy gloves , which made my heart ache , and low ered the hind-quarters by bringing over a bit of the sky . Such a dress white greatcoat , blue satin cravat , hair oiled and curl ing , hat of the primest curve and purest water , gloves scented with eau de Cologne or eau de jasmine , primrose in tint , skin in tightness . In this prime of dandyism he took up a nasty , oily , dirty hog-tool , and immortalized Copenhagen ( the charger ) by touching the sky . " f A friend of D Orsay s , in a notice of the count s death in the " Globe " newspaper , has truly observed : " Unquestionably one of the celebrities of our day , the de ceased man of fashion , claims more than the usual curt obituary . It were unjust to class him with the mere Brunirnels , Mildmays , Alvanleys , or Pierreponts of the Regency , with whom , in his early life , he associated , much less the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle were the attempt to rank him with a Prince do Ligne , an Admirable Crichton , or an Alcibiades ; yet was he a singularly gifted and brilliantly ac complished personage . " /z/ A writer in the " Annual Register , " in another notice of the count s death , thus speaks of his talents and acquirements : " Few men in his position have shown greater accomplish ments . His literary compositions were lively and imaginative . His profile portraits of his friends ( of which many have been published in lithography ) are felicitous and characteristic , and his statuettes are not only graceful , but possess greater original ity of conception than is evinced by the majority of professional artists . In his general intercourse with society , Count D Orsay was distinguished not merely by true politeness , but by great amiability . He was kind and charitable to his distressed coun trymen , and one of the most assiduous supporters of the Societe de Bienfaisance . " In England the count became acquainted with Prince Louis Napoleon , and soon after the arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . residence in Paris . His name was designated several times for diplomatic office , but it was rumored , and gen erally believed , that the prince was too dependent upon his per sonal advice and assistance to spare his society . We are now told ( by M. Girardin , in La Pressc ) that , before the 2d of De cember , nobody made greater or more reiterated efforts for a policy of a different course and of the highest aspirations ; after the 2d of December , no man exerted himself more to assuage the stroke of proscription . The President of the Republic had not a more devoted and sincere friend than the Count D Orsay , and it is at a moment when the prince had attached him to his person by the title and functions of Superintendent of the Beaux Arts that he has lost him forever . " * Count D Orsay s connections with English families of distinc tion , and relations with eminent persons of his country residing in England , had made him well acquainted with London and its society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Blessington speaks of the General and Count ess D Orsay as having taken up their abode in Paris , and their recent arrival from their chateau in Francke Comic . No mention , however , is made in that portion of her journal , /z/ nor , indeed , in any previous part of the " Idler in France , " of their son Count Alfred D Orsay . " The Countess D Orsay , " Lady Blessington observes , " had been a celebrated beauty , and though a grandmother , still retains considerable traces of it . Her coun tenance is so spirituclle and piquant that it gives additional point to the clever things she perpetually utters ; and what greatly enhances her attractions is the perfect freedom from any of the airs of a belle esprit , and the total exemption from affectation that distinguishes her . " General D Orsay , known from his youth as Le Beau D Or say , still justifies the appellation , for he is the handsomest man of his age that I ever beheld . It is said that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make an admirable model for a Jupiter , so noble and commanding 1 was the charac ter of his beauty . There is a calm and dignified simplicity in the manner of General D Orsay that harmonizes with his lofty bearing . " * Elsewhere Lady Blessington observes , " I know no such brilliant talker as she ( the Countess D Orsay ) is . No matter what may be the subject of conversation , her wit flashes bright ly on all , and without the slightest appearance of effort or pre tension . She speaks from a mind overflowing with general in formation , made available by a retentive memory , a ready wit , and inexhaustible good spirits . " ! The customary transmission of intellectual power in the ma ternal line , and of striking traits of physical conformation from sire to children , were not deviated from in the case of the chil dren of the brilliant countess and the beau D Orsay . The mother of the Countess D Orsay , Madame Crawford , was a person of singular endowments . The King of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the legal mar riage of the king with a royal personage , which his former wife considered as an act of injustice to herself and her children ( a son who died young , though grown up , and a daughter , after ward Madame D Orsay ) , she went to France , and fixed her abode there . She subsequently married a Mr. O Sullivan , an Irishman /z/ of large fortune in India , and after his death , Mr. Crawford , a member of an ancient Scotch family , and also possessed of large property . She survived him , and died at the age of eighty-four . In India , the personal attractions of this lady obtained for her the title of " La Belle Sullivan . " On her return , one of her countrymen addressed the following jeu d* esprit : /z/ " Quand la belle Sulivan , quitta 1 Asie , La Rose , amoureuse de ses charraes , Pleura le depart de sa belle amie , Et ce flacon contient ses larmes .

In her eightieth year , she does not look to be more than fifty-five , arid possesses all the vivacity and good humor peculiar only to youth . Scrupulously exact in her person , and dressed with the utmost care as well as good taste , she gives me a notion of the appearance which the cele brated Ninon de 1 Enclos must have presented at the same age , and has much of the charm of manner said to have belonged to that remarkable woman . It was an interesting sight to see her surrounded by her grandchildren and great-grandchildren , all remarkable for their good looks , and affectionately attached to her , while she appears not a little proud of them . " Lady Blessington , in referring to the fascinating powers of this elderly gentlewoman , and comparing them with those of Ninon de 1 Enclos some seven-and-twenty years later , might have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing the extraordinary attractions she alluded to in the case of the old French lady , who had a violent attack of youth every spring for upward of half a century . Ninon de 1 Enclos , at the age of fifty-six , inspired the Marquis of Sevigne with the tender passion . Bordering on her seventieth year , she inspired a Swedish no bleman , a bold baron , with feelings of admiration and affection . /z/ Her last conquest was at the age of eighty : " Monsieur 1 Abbe Gedouin fut la derniere passion . " But the last-named abbe , it would appear , was not the first abbe who had felt the power of her attractions , even in her ma ture years . The Abbe Chaulieu , descanting on the loveliness of this remarkable old woman , said , " L amour s est retire jusque dans les rides de son front . " Ninon preserved not only her beauty , but her sprightliness of fancy in her advanced years . She had the art of saying good things promptly and appropriately on proper occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never to violate the decencies of life in conversation . She made no affectation of prudery , however , and even declaimed much against prudes . " Elles ctoient les Jansenistcs de 1 amour. " * The late Duke de Grammont , father of the present duke ( brother-in-law of Count Alfred D Orsay ) , is described by Lady Blessington as " a fine old man , who has seen much of the world , without having been soured by its trials . Faithful to his sov sovereign during adversity , he is affectionately cherished by the whole of the present royal family , who respect and love him , and his old age is cheered by the unceasing devotion of his children , the Duke and Duchesse de Guiche , who are fondly at tached to hiin. " t * Lettres de Ninon do 1 Enclos , &c.,; avcc sa Vic , IGmo , London , 1782 , tome t The celebrated Duchesse dc Grammont , who perished on the scaffold in tho French Revolution , was the sister of the famous minister , the Duke de Choiseul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one of her contemporaries : " She never dissembles her contempt or dislike of any man , in what , over degree of elevation . It is said she might have supplied the place of Madame de Pompadour if she had pleased . She treats the ceremonies and pageants of courts as things beneath her . She possesses a most uncommon share of under standing , and has very high notions of honor and reputation . " This celebrated lady possessed a very uncommon share of courage and magnanimity , which she was called on some thirty years later to exhibit not in gilded salons or brilliant rircles of wit and fashion , but before the Revolutionary tribunal and on the scaf fold . The duchosso , when brought before the judges of that murderous tribunal , with an energy and eloquence that even struck the judicial assassins of that ini quitous court with surprise , pleaded for the life of her dear friend , the Duchesse de Chatek-t , but plead for it in vain . They died on the same scaffold . /z/ The parents of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Scotland . The mother of the duke died in Holy rood House in 1803 . In October , 1825 , " the remains of the Duchess of Grammont , which had lain in the royal vault of the chapel of Holyrood since the year 1803 , were transported in a hearse from the palace to Newhaven , to be embarked on board a French corvette at an chor in the roads . The lord provost and magistrates , the lord advocate , the lord chief baron , Sir Patrick Walker , Sir Henry Jardine , &c.,; attended , and followed the hearse in mourning coaches to the place of embarkation , as a testimony of respect for the memory of the illustrious lady , who died while sharing the exile of the royal family of France . The original shell had previously been inclosed in a coffin of a very superb description , covered with crimson velvet , and gorgeously ornamented . The plate bore the following inscription : " Louise Franchise Gabrielle Aglae De Polignac , Duchesse de Grammont , nee a Paris le 7 Mai , /z/ morte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present Duke of Grammont , is a native of Paris .

The Duke de Berri , before his alliance with a Neapolitan prin cess , wished much to marry Mademoiselle de Grammont . On the downfall of the elder branch of the Bourbons , her family having suffered severely in the Revolution , she came to England , and during her residence in this country in quasi exile , married the Earl of Tankerville . This lady possesses all the vivacity of her nation , and graceful , sprightly manners .

He had the art of exerting influence with out exciting envy or raising opposition . At an interval of thirty years he married two ladies of the highest rank in France a Coigny and a Grammont . In a letter of the Due de Grammont , then Due de Guiche ( without date ) , to Lady Blessington , he says , " My sister is gone to London as embassadrice de Ls . Pe . Is it not strange ?

Believe me , my dear Lady Blessington , ever faithfully your at tached friend , ( Signed ) , GUICHE . " Count D Orsay was a year younger than his sister , the present Duchess of Grammont . Shortly after the death of the count , by the desire of that lady I visited her at her seat at Charnbourcy , near St. Germain en Laye . Her resemblance to her brother is striking . A more dignified and commanding , but , withal , ami able-looking lady I have seldom met . Though her face and noble form had been touched but recently by the hand of sorrow and of sickness , the remains were still there of surpassing love liness and beauty , and in her conversation there were ample evi- /z/ dences of a high order of intellect , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously she was described by Lady Blessington as the most striking-looking wom an she ever beheld . Tall and graceful , her commanding figure , at once dignified and perfectly symmetrical , was in harmony with her noble features , their lofty expression of superior intel ligence , and the imposing character of her conversational powers . With respect to Count D Orsay s sentiments on the subject of religion in the latter part of his life , I have a few words to add . I visited my poor friend a few weeks before his death , and found him evidently sinking , in the last stage of disease of the kidneys , complicated with spinal complaint . The wreck only of the beau D Orsay was there . He was able to sit up and to walk , though with difficulty and evidently with pain , about his room , which was at once his stu dio , reception room , and sleeping apartment . He burst out cry ing when I entered the room , and continued for a length of time so much affected that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talked about Lady Blessington s death , but all the time with tears pouring down his pale , wan face , for even then his features were death-stricken . He said with marked emphasis , " In losing her I lost every thing in this world she was to me a mother ! a dear , dear mother ! a true , loving mother to me / " While he uttered these words , he sobbed and cried like a child . And referring to them , he again said , " You understand me , Madden " I understood him to be speaking what he felt , and there was nothing in his accents , in his position , or his expressions ( for his words sounded in my ears like those of a dying man ) which led me to believe he was seeking to deceive himself or me . I turned his attention to the subject I thought most important to him . I said , among the many objects which caught my at tention in the room , I was very glad to see a crucifix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , as he had done , were so much in the habit of forgetting all early religious feel ings . D Orsay seemed hurt at the observation . I then plainly said to him , " The fact is , T imagined , or rather T supposed , you /z/ had followed Lady Blessington s example , if not in giving up your own religion , in seeming to conform to another more in voirue in England . " D Orsay rose up with considerable energy , and stood erect and firm with obvious exertion for a few seconds , looking like himself again , and pointing to the head of the bed , he said , " Do you see those two swords ? " pointing to two small swords ( which were hung over the crucifix crosswise ) ; " do you see that sword to the right ? With that sword I fought in de fense of my religion . I had only joined my regiment a few days , when an officer at the mess-table used disgusting and im pious language in speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he repeated the foul language he had used ; I threw a plate of spinach across the table in his face ; a chal lenge ensued ; we fought that evening on the rampart of the town , and I have kept that sword ever since . " Whatever we may think of the false notions of honor , or the erroneous ones of religion which may have prompted the en counter , I think there is evidence in it of early impressions of a religious nature having been made on the mind of this singular man , and of some remains of them still existing at the period above named , however strangely presented . On this occasion , Count D Orsay informed me that Lady Blessington never ceased " in her heart " to be a Catholic , although she occasionally attended the church of another persuasion ; and that while she was in Paris , she went every Sunday to the Mad eleine , in company with some member of his family . And here I may observe , that on one occasion , when I visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , I found her with several visitors , discussing the merits of the ser mon she had just heard preached . Her ladyship inveighed strongly against the sermon , and the style of preaching in En gland . A young man observed , he should hardly have expected such severe censures on their pulpit from a person of such high church principles as her ladyship . Lady Blessington said , very calmly , and more deliberately than usual . : The doctrines of the Protestant Church never appeared /z/ to me better than those of the Catholic Church . I was educated in the doctrines of that church . When I married I got into the habit of accompanying my husband to his church , and I contin ued to go there from the force of habit and for convenience , but never from conviction of its doctrines being better than those of the Catholic Church . " I think there were seven or eight persons present when this startling avowal was made . But perhaps I ought to have observed , fully two or three years before that period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privi leged friend to write a letter to her ladyship , venturing to re mind her of the faith she had been born in , to point out the hollowness of the pleasures of that society in which she moved , of the insufficiency of them for her true happiness , of the day that must come , when it would be found that religion was of more importance than all the fame , or glory , or delight that ever was obtained by intellectual powers , or enjoyed in brilliant circles . And though that letter has no place among her papers , I have reason to know it did not pass altogether out of her memory . The death of D Orsay was thus noticed by " La Presse , " ed ited by Emile Girardin , of the 5th of August , 1852 : " Le Cornte Alfred D Orsay cst rnort ce matin a trois heures . " La douleur et le vide de cette inort seront vivement res- sentis par tous les amis qu il comptait en si grand nombre en France et en Angleterre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tous les drapeaux de la politique .

Clesiriger , the sculptor ; M. Charles Lafitte , M. Bixio , M. Alexandre Dumas , Jun. , M. Hughes Ball , and several other En glish gentlemen . The Duke de Grammont , brother-in-law of Count D Orsay , being confined to his bed by illness , Count Al fred de Grammont and the Duke de Lespare , nephews of the deceased , were the chief mourners . No funeral oration was pronounced over the body , but the emotion of the persons pres ent was great , and the sadness of the scene was increased by the appearance of the Duchess de Grammont , sister of the de ceased , who , with her husband , had assiduously attended him during his illness . /z/ " The Bulletin de Paris says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orsay was communicated to the Prince President , he exclaimed that he had lost " his best friend .

Clesinger was formally charged by him to finish his marble statue of the exking Jerome . " * The Prince President , we are told , exclaimed , when he heard of the death of Count D Orsay , that he had lost " his best friend . " The Prince President may have said these words , and the day may come when he will feel that Count D Orsay was one of his very best and truest friends , when he raised his voice , not once or twice , but frequently , it is asserted , against the meditated act of treason to the government he , the Prince President , had sworn to maintain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orsay something more than a mere leader of fashion in Lon don the intimate friend of statesmen of all parties , of political people of great eminence in Parliament , of editors of newspa pers , mighty men of influence of " the fifth estate of the realm ; " of the foreign ministers at the court of St. James s , and the sec retaries of the several legations ; and though last , not least in importance , the intimate and confidential friend of the lady at whose reunions in Gore House of the celebrities of all political parties and of all intellectual pursuits in London and the pro scribed Prince Louis Napoleon , the twice discomfited conspira tor , and still conspiring refugee in England , were such as might have been expected ; they were most intimate , cordial , and con fiding .

D Orsay , with all his faults , was a man of chivalrous notions as to the obligations of solemn promises and sacred oaths ; he believed the President of the Republic had violated those obligations , and D Orsay was not a man , for any consideration on earth , to refrain from ex pressing his opinion of the dishonor of such a violation . very shortly after the coup d etat , a friend of mine , Monsieur du P , dined in Paris at the house of a French nobleman of the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were about twenty or two-and-twenty persons present , persons of distinction and of various political sentiments .

D Orsay at length coming out with one of * On the 9th of April , 1849 , the Duke of Wellington wrote a letter to the Count D Orsay , in which the following passage occurs : " Je me rejouis do la prosperite de la France et du succes dc M. le President de la Republique . Tout tend vers la permanence de la paix de 1 Europe qui est necessaire pour le bonheur de chacun . Votre ami tres devoue . WELLINGTON . " This singular letter of one of the most clear-sighted , far-seeing men of modern times , was written after the election of Louis Napoleon to the presidency of the republic . Not after the coup d etat of December , 1851 . A few dates of remarkable occurrences in the latter part of the career of Louis Napoleon will enable us to form a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Louis Napoleon was elected President of the Republic the 10th of December , 1848 . His coup d etat , the arrest of the leading members of the Chamber of Dep uties , and the downfall of the republic , took place the 2d of December , 1851 . His presidential powers were prolonged for ten years the 20th of December , 1851 . IIo was proclaimed emperor the 2d of December , 1852 , then in his forty-third year , being born the 20th of April , 1808 . From the time of the Chartist demonstration in London in 1848 , when the Prince Louis Napoleon ( then in exile ) was sworn in as a special constable for the preservation of the peace in the metropolis of England , to the period when he was proclaimed Emperor of the French in December , 1852 , there was an interval of about four years and a half . /z/ his customary notes of preparation , " a bas . " made short work of the reserve and prudence of the discussion . He expressed his opinion in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but emphatically and distinctly , these words : " It is the greatest political swindle that has ever been practiced in the world ! " My friend , who was deeply interested in the welfare of D Orsay , was dismayed at " the indiscretion of this explosion of opin ion . " It was like a bomb-shell in the circle . There were per sons present who might be supposed to have to advance their fortunes by the prince s favor ; there were several servants in the room at the time , moreover , and it might be reasonably feared at that period the police were not remiss in making themselves acquainted with the servants of all persons of political influence and importance in Paris . It must be borne in mind that D Orsay at that time was wholly dependent on the favor of the prince for his future position in his own country . He had left England utterly ruined in his cir cumstances , and came to France counting on the friendship and gratitude of his former friend at the head of the French repub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed . He was well received by the prince , and proffers of public em employment adequate to his expectations and his talents were made to him . But after the period of the coup d etat and the dinner above referred to post or propter that entertainment the friendship of the prince for the count cooled down from blood heat to the freezing point , and eventually to zero . The man with the heavy eyelids , and the leaden hand of care and calcu lation pressing them down , when he imposed on himself the weight of empire , could not see his former friends without look ing down on them , and D Orsay was not a man to be looked down on , or coldly at , even by an emperor . For eighteen months before his death his relations with Louis Napoleon had wholly ceased . The prince at last , when D Orsay was laboring under the ill ness which soon after consigned him to an early grave , allowed himself to be persuaded , by urgent arid pressing friends of the poor count , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The /z/ emperor deigned to recognize the claim . His imperial majesty appointed Count Alfred D Orsay " Director of Fine Arts . " Of all things it can not be said truly " better late than never . " This thing , that was meant to look like an act of kindness and of gratitude , was too late to be of any use . No one was bet tered or deceived by it . I spoke with some surprise of similar acts of the same exalt ed personage to Lamennais , not long before his death ; the abbe , with the quiet look , the cold , unimpassioned expression of the bright , clear gray eyes of his , observed , " Voyez vous mon chcr Monsieur Madden , cctte homme la , n a pas le sentiment ni du bien , ni du mal il n a pas de sentiment quo de soi merne . " English history , as well as French , will yet have to ratify the opinion of the Abbe Lamennais . Among the papers of Lady Blessington I find some very re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master spirits of original mind of his age lines which might be read with advantage by all " swimmers in the stream of politics . " /z/ " The swimmers in the stream of politics , That keep each other down where none float high But who are rotten , shouted in my ear , Come hither ! here is honor , on this side ; He hates the other . I passed on , nor look d , Knowing the voices well : they troubled me Vociferating : I searched for willow wand To scourge and silence the importunates , And turned me round : lo ! they were all upon The farther bank , , and , basking in the sun , Mowed at me , and defied me to cross o er , And broke their cakes , and gave their curs the crumbs , Weary with wanderings . " In. bringing this sketch of the career of Count Alfred D Orsay to a close , a summary notice of his most remarkable qualities , his talents , and the application of them , is given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate of his character and abilities . One was reminded not unfrequently , by the wit combats at /z/ Gore House , of the days of the Chevalier de Grammont , when Dorset , Sedley , Ethelridge , Denham , Killigrew , " and all the whole band of wits " * diverted the beau monde with bon mots , sarcastic repartees , quaint observations , humorous sallies , and sharply-pointed epigrams , brought to bear on striking peculiar ities of absent acquaintances , or well-known persons of quality within the category of " precieuses ridicules . " " The wits " of the age of Horace Walpole were pretty much the same as those of the times of Holland House and Kensing ton Gore intellectual gladiatorship . The wit combatants of both in the arena of fashionable literary circles are composed of va rious grades of competitors for celebrity and pretenders to dis tinction , and success in sprightly conversation , in lively corre spondence , and occasional written drolleries in prose and verse ; the efforts of all are to amuse and to be distinguished , and for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lous , a facility for catching salient points in conversation , and combining apparent similitudes of things ludicrous in them selves with ideas of subjects naturally grave or serious ; they must evince a strong sense of the obligations imposed on vivacity of mind and liveliness of imagination by the patronage of people a la mode or a favored position in society ; they must submit to the necessity , in short , of amusing its magnates by a felicitous expression of quaint , jocund , and striking thoughts opportunely brought forth and without apparent effort . In this strife of high ly-excited intellectuality , mere pleasant conversationalists jostle against story-tellers and retailers of anecdotes of more or less celebrity , humorists at table after the cloth is taken away , and only then at home in broad and farcical jests , and in impromptu double entendres come in contact with the pet poets of the salons , who figure in albums , and compose vcrs de societc on the spur of the occasion , previously expected or anticipated , furnish par odies and burlesques to order , conveyed in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load their memories in private , and with malice in their wit aforethought , and come charged into company with sarcastic epigrams , to be fired oft in public /z/ at the peculiarities of absent friends , or the failings or absurd ities of the celebrities of other circles . In this sharp encounter of keen wits , the mere punster , endowed with great natural powers of impudence , and a large stock of animal spirits , whose whole laborious leisure is devoted to the amusement of playing upon words , is to be met cheek by jowl at the same tournament with one like Curran , not always , however , to be found in the most brilliant circles of fashion , or salons of ladies of literature a la jnodc , whose wit is " as keen as his sword , but as polished as the scabbard , " which relies 011 its success neither on flippant sarcasms , or vulgar scoffing in society at high principles or he roic actions , or sneering humorous observations on sacred or on serious subjects , but on its own bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into action , of irradiating every subject on which it glances even for a moment . " When the mind of genius is charged with intellectual elec tricity , we have sparkles of intelligence flashing from the as similation of dissimilar ideas , which have been suddenly , and apparently accidentally , brought into collision ; and these fitful gleams of bright thoughts , felicitously expressed , constitute what is called wit . But we have as many kinds of these bright emanations of in tellectuality as we have of atmospheric meteors in all the va ried forms of electrical phenomena . Perhaps the highest order of wit exhibited in our times ( the keenest wit combined with the greatest powers of eloquence ) was that which was displayed by Curran in public and in pri vate . Of Curran s conversational powers , Byron , in his mernor.in- durn-book , has spoken in terms of no stinted praise : " Curran Curran ! the man who struck me most . Such imagination ! There never was any thing like it that I ever saw or heard of . His published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man none at all . He was a machine of imagination ; as some one said of Piron , that he was an epigrammatic machine . " * Elsewhere in his memoranda he said , " The riches of his /z/ ( Curran s ) Irish imagination were exhaustless . I have heard that man speak more poetry than I have ever seen written , though I saw him seldom , and but occasionally . I saw him presented to Madam de Stael . It was the great confluence be tween the Rhone and the Saone . " The wits of Horace Walpole s day , Sir George Selwyn , Sir Hanbury Williams , Bubb Doddington , Charles Townsend , and their associates , it is difficult to judge of at the distance of a century from their times . But it would appear their wit was of the social , unpremeditated , conversational character , in which Sydney Smith , Talleyrand , Hook , and Barham particularly ex celled in our times . For conversational humor and drollery in the composition of quizzical verses , Sir Charles Hanbury Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporaries speak truly of him ) , can hardly have been excelled by any modern humorist . The social character of the clubs , taverns , or coffee-houses of those days was favorable to the development of conversational talent. * Selwyn , the man renowned for social wit , was utterly defi cient in the gift of oratory . He sat forty years in Parliament for Gloucester , and never spoke on any question . He was al ways torpid as well as silent in the House . Sir Hanbury Williams , the celebrated sayer also of bo ? i mots , and composer of pointed epigrams , a man of astounding audac ity in turning sacred subjects into ridicule , and treating the most solemn subjects with flippant jocularity and revolting lev ity , sat in the House of Commons a silent member , rapt in gloom , which terminated in insanity and suicide . " Sayers of good things , " in general , are not men of great powers of eloquence . Wits who can set the table in a roar , and give utterance to bon mots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty consecutive sentences on any serious subject before a number of people prepared to listen to them . * Count D Orsay was a member of Crockford s as long as it lasted , and after ward of the Coventry . An attempt was made to get him into " White s , " but it was discovered there were some parties who were determined to exclude him , and consequently his friends withdrew his name before the ballot took place . /z/ D Orsay was no exception to the rule . He abounded in rich humor , and excelled in repartee . There was an air of aristo cratic nonchalance in the grave irony of his conversational sal lies . He gave vent to his wit in the quietest tone , and with the most immovable features possible . He was an adept in the art of quizzing people who were at all ridiculous with singular composure of mien and manner . His performances in this line were gone through with ease and elegance , but the gift of elo quence was not bestowed on him . Of D Orsay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Selwyii s : " His social wit , which , never kindling strife , Blazed in the small , sweet courtesies of life ; Those little sapphires round the diamond shone , Lending soft radiance to the richer stone/ It would be difficult to convey in words any precise idea of D Orsay s Avit and powers of facetiousness in conversation . A mere report would be in vain of the ban mots he uttered , with out a faithful representation of his quiet , imperturbable manner , his arch look , the command of varied emphasis in his utterance , the anticipatory indications of coming drollery in the expression of his countenance , the power of making his entourage enter into his thoughts , and his success in. prefacing his jcu d esprit by sig nificant glances and gestures , suggestive of ridiculous ideas . The literary artist who could describe these peculiarities must be no ordinary word-painter . L ) 0rsay had made a study of the wit of Talleyrand , and he became a proficient in that species of refined conversational esprit , combining terseness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aim , with the polish of the shaft and the sharpness of the point of an intellectual weapon of rare excel lence . The macaronis of a century ago , the bucks , bloods , and bcaus of a later period , represented by the fops , exquisites , or dandies the inane cxclusives the ephemeral petits mat ires of our times , are not the tribe which furnish men of fashion of D Or say s stamp . D Orsay was a fop in attire and appearance , but /z/ his foppery was only a spice of vanity , superadded to superior intellectual powers , which condescended at times to assume a dandyish character . D Orsay s fine taste was particularly exhibited in the con struction and turn-out of those well-known , elegant vehicles of his and Lady Blessington , which used to attract so much atten tion in Hyde Park a few years ago . D Orsay , like Grammont , has left reminiscences of promenade achievements " a cheval ct en voiture " in that favored locality , but of a very different character . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one knows , was the promenade of London . " In 1659 it was thus described to a nobleman of France : " I did frequently , in the spring , accompany my Lord N into a field near the town , which they call Hide Park ; the place not unpleasant , and which they use as our course , but with nothing of that order , equipage , arid splendor ; being such an assembly of wretched jades and hackney-coaches , as , next a regiment of carr men , there is nothing approaching the resem blance . The Park was , it seems , used by the late king and no bility for the freshness of the air and the goodly prospect , " * &c; In these latter days Hyde Park makes a different figure in the pages of Mr. Patmore . The scene he describes is the ring , and the writer of the sketch is supposed to be lounging there , gaz ing at the brilliant equipages as they pass , and the celebrities of fashion who figure there . " Observe that green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of equipages . Though it is now advancing toward us , with at least a dozen carriages between , it is to be distin guished from the throng by the elevation of its driver and foot man above the ordinary level of the line . As it comes nearer , we can observe the particular points which give it that perfectly distingue appearance which it bears above all others in the throng . They consist of the white wheels , lightly picked out /z/ with green and crimson ; the high-stepping action , blood-like shape , and brilliant manege of its dark bay horses ; the perfect style of its driver ; the height ( six feet two ) of its slim , spiderlimbed , powdered footman , perked up at least three feet above the roof of the carriage , and occupying his eminence with that peculiar air of accidental superiority , half petit maitrc , half plow-boy , which we take to be the ideal of footman perfection ; and , finally , the exceedingly light , airy , and ( if we may so speak ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters blazoned on the centre panels , and the small coronet beneath the window , indicate the nobility of station ; and if ever the nobility of nature was blazoned on the complement extern of humanity , it is on the lovely face within lovely as ever , though it has been loveliest among the lovely for a longer time than we dare call to our own recollection , much less to that of the fair being before us . " But , see ! what is this vision of the age of chivalry , that comes careering toward us , on horseback , in the form of a stately cavalier , than whom nothing has been witnessed in modern times more noble in air and bearing , more splendid in person , more distingue in. dress , more consummate in equestrian skill , more radiant in intellectual expression , and altogether more worthy and fitting to represent one of those knights of the olden time , who warred for truth and beauty beneath the banner of Cceur de Lion . It is Count D Orsay , son-in-law of the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quiche . Those who have the pleasure of being personally intimate with this accomplished foreigner will confirm our testimony that no man has ever been more popular in the upper circles , or has better deserved to be so . His inexhaustible good spirits and good nature , his lively wit , his generous disposition , and his varied acquirements , make him the favorite companion of his own sex ; while his unrivaled personal pretensions render him , to say the least , the observed of all observers of the other sex . Indeed , since the loss of poor William Locke , there has been nobody to even dispute the palrn of female admiration with Count D Or say . " * /z/ D Orsay s position in English fashionable society was not due to rank , wealth , or connections , or to his generally admitted ex cellence of taste in all matters appertaining to attire , equipage , the adornment of saloons , " the getting up " of liveries , the train ing of his tigers , or the turning out of cabs , tilburies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lightness of construction . It is very evident that the individual was something more than a mere fop and man of fashion , or " a compound even of Hercules and Adonis , " who could count among his friends the Duke of Wellington , Marquis Wellesley , the Lords Brougham , Lyndhurst , and Byron ; and such men as Landor , Forster , D Is raeli , the Bulwers , &lt;fee . The foreigner could be no ordinary person who figured in the society of the most eminent men of England for nearly twenty years , and who , in circles where genius , as well as haut ton , had its shrines , " claimed kindred there , and had his claim allowed . " D Orsay s celebrity was undisputed as a man of fashion a noble-looking , classically-moulded , English-mannered young Frenchman " of the vicllc cour " a beau monde gentleman , at once graceful , dignified , frank , and dcbonnaire , full of life , wit , humor , and originality an " exquisite " of the first water in brill iant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world " of the Parks of London " with noble horsemanship ; " a keen sports man , a capital boxer for an amateur , a good swimmer , an excel lent swordsman , a famous shot , a celebrated cricket-player ; at one time a great collector of classical rarities , " far gone ( like Horace Walpole in his youth ) in medals , lamps , idols , prints , and all the small commodities of antiquity ; " at another time a zealous partisan of a great conspirator , and great promoter of his plans to effect a revolution . Alfred D Orsay figured , in his day , in all these characters ; but , alas ! of what avail to his memory is the celebrity he ob tained in any of them ? All the celebrity which his true friends may desire to be coupled with his name is that which he derived from the ex ercise of his fine talents as an artist , and of his kindly feelings /z/ as a man naturally disposed to be benevolent , generous , and open-hearted . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 536 ) there are a few kind words spoken of poor D Orsay , in some allusions made to the former occupants of " the little stuccoed houses " of Kensington Gore , contiguous to Lady Blessington s : " At number 5 lived Count D Orsay , whose name is publicly synonymous with elegant and graceful accomplishments ; and who , by those who knew him well , is affectionately remembered and regretted as a man whose great abilities might have raised him to any distinction , and whose gentle heart even a world of fashion left unspoiled . " Mr. Patrnore , in his recent work , " My Friends and Acquaint ances " ( vol. i. , p. 230 ) , alluding to one of the chief difficulties of Count D Orsay s social position in England , and the anomalies in the constitution of fashionable society there , says : " And yet it was in England that Count D Orsay , while a mere boy , made the fatal mistake of marrying one beautiful woman , while he was , without daring to confess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more beautiful , whom he could not marry because , I say , under these circumstances , and discovering his fatal error when too late , he separated himself from his wife al most at the church door , he was , during the greatest part of his social career in England , cut off from the advantages of the more fastidious portion of high female society by the indignant fiat of its heads and leaders . " A man in his twenty-seventh year can hardly be designated as a mere boy , nor can the circumstance of his separation from his wife " almost at the church door " be accounted for in any manner that will appear excusable to the friends of the young deserted wife , or the fastidious portion of high female society in England or elsewhere . This marriage was not only a great misfortune for those who were married , but a great crime on the part of those who promoted that marriage , and were consenting to it . If any comment must be made on this unfortunate union and its results , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking /z/ counsel of Montesquieu , to speak out a solemn truth on an oc casion that can be best served by its enumeration ? " Religion , good or bad , is the only test we have for the probity of men " There is no dependence to be placed in probity or purity of life without the protection of religion . Human honor is inade quate to the security of either . There is an amount of indi gence at which honor , long resisting , will stagger in the end ; there is a degree of temptation at which honor will suffer vice to approach her in the mask of innocent freedom , and will dally with it till infamy itself becomes familiar to her bosom . But respectable folks , who figure in good society , solemn-faced sa ges and literary celebrities , will say it is false : honor is alone sufficient to regulate the minds of educated men , and to prevent all disorders in society . It is to libel honor to say that it is suf ficiently strong to bind respectable members without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happiness of people in another world . Nevertheless , there is not one of those peo ple who does not know in his own breast that such is not the case that in his own character and conduct the assertion does not hold good , and in very few of those of the individuals with whom he is best acquainted . There is no dependence on any man s probity or any woman s virtue whose reliance is not placed in religion . Nothing more can be said with profit or advantage on this subject , except that it is deeply to be lamented this marriage was forced on Count D Orsay , and that he consented to contract a marriage with a young lady for whom he entertained no sen timents of love or kindness . It would be very unjust to D Orsay , with all his errors , to place him in the same category with his profligate countryman De Grammont , and still more unjust to set him down on the same list with the Dukes of Buckingham , Wharton , and ( Queensberry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions , the Marquis of Hertford . In one very essential matter he differed from most of them . Though practically not living in the world of fashion under the 316 iNOTiCE OF COUiNT ALFRED D ORSAY. restraints of religion , all the influences of an early recollection of its sacred character were not lost , and these , which , in the midst of a wild and thoughtless career , sufficed at least to show that all respect for that character had not been wholly aban doned , and that they were still faintly perceptible in some of the noble qualities possessed by him , at the close of life were strong ly manifested , and made the mode of his departure from it the best , the only consolation taken that could be given to a sister eminently good and spiritually minded . The close of that career , and the ministrations on it , form a strong contrast with the termination of a life of an English duke , and the attendance on a death-bed , of which Sir N. Wraxall , in his Memoirs , has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in December , 1810 , his bed was covered with billets and letters to the number of at least seventy , mostly , indeed , addressed to him by females of every description and of every rank , from duchesses down to ladies of easiest virtue . Unable , from his attenuated state , to open or peruse them , he ordered them , as they arrived , to be laid on his bed , where they remained , the seals unbroken , till he expired . " If the sordid homage paid to the wealth of the expiring deb auchee had been offered only by the ladies of easiest virtue , there might be little to be surprised at ; but what is to be said or thought of the ladies of reputed virtue , of exalted rank , who manifested so much sympathy for the old libertine of enormous wealth , and still more enormous wickedness ? Society suffers little from charity toward its erring members , but morality suffers a great deal when habitual vice and dis soluteness of life of persons in high places or regal station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find sycophants and slaves to pander to them , and people , forgetful of the dignity of their position or their pursuits , to lend their services to palliate them . Count Alfred D Orsay died in Paris , the Hh of August , 1852 , in his fifty-second year , having survived the Countess of Blcssington three years and two months . His remains were laid in the same sepulchral chamber in which hers were deposited . /z/ The monument erected to her memory at Chambourcy had been hardly finished , when it became the resting-place of all that is left of the accomplished , highly-gifted , generous-hearted Alfred D Orsay ; " Pulvis et umbra , nomen , nihil . " /z/ THERE is one thing well worthy of observation , and that must strike every person who looks over the extensive correspondence of Lady Blessington , namely , the implicit trust that was put in her judgment and integrity by the most eminent men of her time in politics , literature , and art . Statesmen of great renown for wisdom , judges and grave lawyers , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have had entire confidence in her honor , discretion , and common sense and kind ness of heart . They communicated with her with the utmost freedom , and evidently with a firm conviction that their con fidence would never be abused . In their letters it is plainly to be seen how fully sensible they were the only account that con fidence would be ever turned to by Lady Blessington would be to promote peace where strife had sprung up ; to make people who had been estranged think less unkindly of one another ; and those who were at variance* disposed to consider that the state of nature in their several pursuits was not a state of war . Lady Blessingtoii s correspondents were not of one class , or country , or profession , or pursuit ; they were of all orders of high intelligence , of all lands , of all positions ennobled by gen ius , of every science , art , or walk in literature , or in public life distinguished for talent , or deserving in her opinion to attain any distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them like wise persons who had no pretensions to intellectual gifts , or re markable abilities of any kind , but who possessed amiable qualiticT , honorable principles and kindly feelings , bookish people /z/ not pedantic , amateurs of art without the airs of dilettanti , trav elers more at home in a desert than a drawing-room , who had seen outlandish places , and could be drawn out a little on the subject of their peregrinations on rare occasions . Among the correspondents of her ladyship we find princes and princesses , authors and authoresses of all lands , rich and poor , generals and critics , poets and politicians , publishers and diplomatists , play-actors , novelists , and ministers of state , lord chancellors and literary ladies , peers of the realm , nabobs of In dia , natives of Hindostan , hidalgos of Spain of " thirteen grand fathers , " descendants of ancient Irish kings , and gentlemen , in fine , of no ancestors at all , renowned in literature , art , or science . The lady who was engaged in this extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for a long series of years with many of the master-spirits , not only of England , but of the world . The qualities of mind and of disposition of this gifted lady , the influence of that goodness of heart that was diffused over every act and word of hers , the fascination of her manners , and all the collateral allurements of her external beauty , could sure ly be of no common order , that could procure for her not only the admiration and esteem of passing observation , but such longenduring friendship and affectionate regard as we see , by this correspondence , she enjoyed to the close of life at the hands of many of the most eminent persons of our age . There arc many difficulties of an editorial kind to be dealt with in the present undertaking ; and one of the most serious that presented itself was that of the arrangement of the corre spondence . The natural and usual course would be to introduce the let ters generally in the order of their dates , and not those of each correspondent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a course as this to be considered , and a very great difficulty to be surmounted . Lady Blessington s intercourse with eminent persons distin guished in literature , art , . science , and politics , and her literary career , had three phases : one of these was included in the pe- /z/ riod between her marriage and her departure for the Continent her early London life from 1818 to 1822 ; another was the period of her Continental tour and sojourn chiefly in Naples her Italian life from 1823 to 1829 ; and , lastly , that which in cludes the period between her return to England , her residence in Seamore Place , and the break-up of her establishment at Gore House , from the end of 1831 to the spring of 1849 , a few weeks before her decease in Paris the period of her second Lon don career of nearly nineteen years . Each of these phases in the life of Lady Blessington was dis tinct from the other , in the composition of the society in which she moved , in the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of her literary pursuits , at one time engaged in solely on account of the delight taken in them , at another for sake of distinction , and finally with a view to gain . Her correspondence partook of the nature of those differences and distinctions , and the value of it seemed to consist , to a great extent , in that distinct individualism which belonged to the let ters , and the style and subjects of them in such numerous in stances , that to separate and scatter the several letters of each writer over different portions of the work would have been to break up the interest taken in the several subjects , and the con nection between matters frequently referred to in the letters of the same writers . The difficulty above referred to , in the way of arrangement according to dates , was , in fact , insuperable . Literary men and artists are singularly prone to forgetfulness in regard to dates and addresses in their correspondence . A vast number of the letters addressed to Lady Blessington are without date or place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week specified but not of the month , and where both are to be found the year is seldom mentioned . In many cases the dates are determined by the post-marks , but in many more , where the letters have been written prior to the general use of envelopes , there is no clew whatever to the date , and the period can only be approx imately arrived at by knowledge , of the place where Lady Bless- /z/ ington was residing at the time such letters were received by her , or derived from matters referred to in them . For the above-mentioned reasons , and some others which may readily suggest themselves to the reader , I have , as a general rule , inserted the letters of the different correspondents consec utively , as they appear to have been addressed by Lady Blessin gton . In the notices prefixed to the letters , I have endeavored to brino- before the readers of these volumes the correspondents and friends of Lady Blessington , and the acquaintances espe cially of her ladyship during her sojourn in Naples and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to recall the particular traits of character which belonged to them. * In the letters of Lady Blessington , it will be in vain to seek for those excellencies in the art of epistolary correspondence , graces of style and composition , vivacity , esprit , and epigram matic power of expression which arc to be found in the corre spondence of Madame de Sevigne , and more or less in that of the Marquise du Deffand , Madame Geoffrin , our own Lady Mary " Wortley Montague , or Madame D Arblay . But , in one respect , the letters of Lady Blessington were not inferior to those of any of the above-mentioned letter-writing celebrities , namely , the manifestation in her letters of kindly feelings , as ardently expressed , as generously and unselfishly entertained .

Mr. St. Leger remained at Brunswick . Shortly after her royal higness s arrival in Mi lan , Bartholomew Bergami was taken into her service as cou rier and valet . The princess and her suite set out for Rome and Naples the latter end of October , and arrived in the latter city on the 8th of November , 1814 . King Joachim Murat was then sovereign of Naples . Her royal highness gave a fancy ball to his Neapolitan majesty , in which she appeared in three charac ters ; first as a Neapolitan peasant , secondly as " The Genius of History , " and thirdly as a Turkish peasant , in costumes by no means cumbersome , though not quite in accordance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The princess re mained in Naples till March , 1815 . She then took her depart ure for Rome , Genoa , and Milan , leaving four of her suite , Lady E. Forbes , Sir W. Gell , Mr. Craven , and Captain Hesse , in Naples . Lady Charlotte Lindsay had previously left her royal highness at Leghorn . At Genoa she was joined by Lady Charlotte Camp bell , who remained with her only two or three months . After her return from Palestine , Sir William Gell accompanied her from Naples to Rome , and continued with her there in attend ance upon her as chamberlain while she remained in Rome . The following year he was again about three months in at tendance on hor at Fvaseati and RufinelM ; and again , on the /z/ occasion of her last visit to Rome , he attended her for some days . In his evidence on the trial before the House of Lords , Sir " William swore that it was on account of an attack of gout he had quitted her royal highness s service ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observing the conduct of the queen and Bergami toward each other , never saw any impro priety pass between them upon any occasion . " Nevertheless , the opinion of Sir William of his royal mis tress s habits , modes , and manners was not more favorable than those of Lord Malmesbury , of which he has left a curious rec ord in his diary . In 1815 and 1816 , we find Gell , in his letters , under various signatures " Blue Beard , " " Adonis , " " Anacharsis , " " Gellius ( Aulus ) , " and while still retaining the title , and occasionally fill ing the office , of chamberlain to the Princess of Wales , indulg ing in his sarcastic propensities playing the part of a male gos sip , conveying little bits of scandal in humorous passages , and making fun of his royal mistress for the sport of the fair Philis tines who had once been maids of honor and friends of her roy al highness . But even at that time Sir William was a martyr to gout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Bologna that he was then reduced to the necessity of confining himself to his fireside ; but , in giving the account of his ailments , he could not help having a fling at his royal lady s orthography : " To a person of my romantic disposition , rcduit by di dizctte of legs and now of arms to the fireside , it is a great comfort to have escaped from the land of wine , houses , and carts , and wooden shoes , arid neckless children ( France ) , and to find one s self once more in Italy , and to be able io leave rny painful leg or arm for a moment out of bed without finding it frostbitten. " * Sir W. ( Jell and the Honorable Keppel Craven are mentioned in Moore s diary of August , 1820 , as being " on the way from Naples to England as witnesses for the queen . " " Gell still a coxcomb , but rather amusing said the Constitution of Naples /z/ came in a gig ( corricolo ) told some ludicrous things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her passion for Gonsalvo , her admiration for the purity of the Roman government . " ( Memoirs , vol. iii. , p. 137 . ) Moore s compendious opinion of Gell as " a coxcomb , rather amusing " if relied on , would give not only a very unfavorable , but a very incorrect notion of his character and his acquirements . He was a man of much erudition and artistic talents , and of great humor . Sir William Gell s literary tastes were chiefly devoted to antiquarian researches . For the last twenty years , Naples was his head-quarters . There he was universally known and respected , and terminated his earthly career . Sir William Gell was a man of very amiable character , ex tremely amusing and lively , fond of the society of young people , with much singularity of mind , and originality of character , manners , and ideas . His indolent easiness of temper had something in it of a phil osophical calmness of an Epicurean character . The common objects of men s ambition to him were not worth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apathetic , and unimpassioned in the society of men struggling for wealth , glory , or exalted dignities . He smiled serenely at the inordinate trouble they gave themselves , at all their great cares for little ends , at all the great weaknesses of little men of large desires . And yet this pococurante gentleman had many difficulties to en counter to secure for himself " les douceurs d une vie privee et oisive , " and many little harmless vanities and weaknesses of his own to make him singular and eccentric , of which , how ever , he was entirely unconscious . All his tastes were of a literary and artistic turn , and all were of a refined , scholar-like , and some of them rather of a Sybaritic kind . Like Sir William Temple , " he loved painting , and mu sic , and statuary , and gardening , " and embellishing buildings . Health , and ease , and fine weather were the constituents of his happiness : Temple wrote , " Le seul homme que j envie dans le monde c est @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ si beau climat , ou il va goutcr tous les charmes /z/ attaches aux delicates et spirituelles conversations d ltalie . II trouvera les jours et les esprits egalemens purs et brillants . " Though a martyr to gout , Sir " William Gell s natural gayety and good humor were little affected by his natural sufferings ; and with the most profound knowledge and information he com bined the utmost simplicity and playfulness . Some of his topographical books were illustrated by himself , as , for instance , his Pompeii , Greece , and other descriptive pro ductions of an antiquarian kind works acknowledged to be the best of their several sorts and classes . In June , 1834 , referring to a conversation at Lady Blessington s , Willis , in his " Pencilings by the Way , " 3d edition , Lon don , 1849 , refers to some valuable notices of Sir William Gcll , illustrative of an interesting portion of the latter part of Sir Walter Scott s career : " She ( Lady B. ) had received from Sir William Of ell , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last days of Sir Wal ter Scott . It was a melancholy chronicle of weakened intellect and ruined health , and the book was suppressed ; but there were two or three circumstances narrated in its pages which were interesting . Soon after his arrival at Naples , Sir AY alter went with his physician and one or two friends to the great museum . It happened that on the same day a large collection of students and Italian literati were assembled in one of the rooms to dis cuss some newly-discovered manuscripts . It was soon known that the Wizard of the North was there , and a deputation was sent immediately to request him to honor them by presiding at their session . At this time Scott was a wreck , with a memory that retained nothing for a moment , and limbs almost as help less as an infant s . He was dragging about among the relics of Pompeii , taking no interest in any thing lie saw , when their request was made known to him through his physician . No , no , said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not well enough to come . He loitered on , and in about half an hour after he turned to Dr. II . arid said , Who was that you said wanted to see me ? The doctor explained . I ll go , said he ; they shall see mo , if they wish it ; and , against the advice of /z/ his friends , who feared it would be too much for his strength , he mounted the staircase , and made his appearance at the door . A burst of enthusiastic cheers welcomed him on the threshold ; and forming in two lines , many of them on their knees , they seized his hands as he passed , kissed them , thanked him in their passionate language for the delight with which he had fill ed the world , and placed him in the chair with the most fervent expressions of gratitude for his condescension . The discussion went on , but , not understanding a syllable of their language , Scott was soon wearied , and his friends , observing it , pleaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rose to take his leave . These enthusiastic children of the South crowded once more around him , and , with exclamations of affection and even tears , kissed his hands once more , assisted his tottering steps , and sent after him a confused murmur of blessings as the door closed on his retiring form . " The scene is described by Sir W. Gell as one of the most affecting he had ever witnessed His career of authorship commenced so early as 1804 , when he published " The Topography of Troy , " folio . Subsequently appeared " The Geography and Antiquities of Ithaca , " 4to , 1808 , " The Itinerary of Greece " " Travels in the Morea " " The Topography of Rome " and , finally , his " Pompeiana , " the most interesting and extensively known of all his works . Sir William resided in Italy since 1820 ; occasionally at Rome , but chiefly at his beautifully situated and elegantly arranged villa in Naples , in the society of his erudite friend , Sir William Drummond , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keppel Craven . After the death of Sir William Drum mond at Ilome in 1828 , his friendship with Craven appeared to have become more closely cemented than ever , and it went on increasing in strength to the period of his death . Gell s notions of authorship were of a very aristocratic nature . All his works were brought out on so large and extensive a scale as to be out of the reach of that class of readers for whom his topographical and antiquarian researches would have been espe cially useful for travelers in those countries whose remains /z/ were described by him . But it was the misfortune of this en lightened and accomplished man to be an aristocrat in all things , and to mar his attainments by hankering after great people " patricians born to greatness , " or parvenus having " greatness thrust upon them " thrust on " good society , " and admitted there par droit de richesses ou lieu do naissance . Sir William Gell , it must be admitted , frittered away his time and talents for upward of twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English traveling aristocracy that customarily wintered in Rome , and passed the spring or autumn in Naples or its vicinity Every one delighted in his society ; in his conversation and correspondence he was equally amusing and agreeable . " When . Sir William Gell died , Lady Blessington might have truly said , " J ai perdu en lui mon rneilleur causeur . " There is an admirable sketch of Gell in a letter of James Ramsay , Esq. , a resident merchant of Naples , an old and valued friend of mine , addressed to the Hon. Richard Kcppel Craven in the spring of 1836 , soon after the death of Sir William Gell , urg ing 011 Mr. Craven the task of composing a biographical sketch of his deceased friend , and eventually signifying his intention of writing such a memoir : " I frequently urged , " says Mr. Ramsay , " our inestimable friend to compose his biographical memoirs ; to bequeath to posterity the personal narrative of a career in which the pur suits of science were so happily blended with the lighter occu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be a great pity if the rich fund of observation and anec dote which he had accumulated should be lost with him , and that it might be screened from public view until the writer should be removed beyond the reach of criticism or of ridicule . He sometimes appeared to be half inclined to adopt my sugges tion , and owned that he possessed materials sufficiently piquant , if he should determine to employ them . Will you forgive me for insinuating that the task which he failed , or rather neglected to accomplish , seems naturally and gracefully , when time shall have in some degree moderated the more poignant emotions of /z/ regret , to devolve upon you ? upon you , his juvenile companion , the friend and fellow-traveler of raaturer years , the depositary of his inmost sentiments , and probably of many of a series of letters in which events and opinions have been faithfully re corded . " Though enjoying Sir William s acquaintance and intimacy during a considerable period , I can not presume to hope that I could furnish any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be most ready to co-operate with those who are so much better qualified . His correspondents would , I dare say , willingly communicate his letters , or extracts from them , and the names of these correspondents are doubtless known to you . " There is a peculiar charm in the unguarded effusions of emi nent persons , when , casting off the artificial garb with which rank or other adventitious circumstances may have invested them , they paint their natural character and feelings without any other reserve or restraint than those which discretion pre scribes . Hume and Gibbon have left us interesting , though very dif ferent memorials of this description , and the familiar letters of Munro , of Collingwood , of Mackintosh , and of such as resemble them , will be fondly cherished when their public achievements are perused with historical indifference . But I beg pardon for detaining you with remarks so obvious . " If , on the one hand , it is to be regretted that Sir William did not finish his novel of Julia di Gonzaga , it may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how far such a work would have added to his literary fame . Of his powers of imagi nation and invention I had 110 adequate opportunity of judging ; but , though the novel might have contained some lively scenes , some striking descriptions , some sparkling dialogue , I should be inclined to question yet by no means conclusively whether a profound knowledge of the human heart , of the intricate mazes arid complicated workings of passion , and feeling , and sentiment , were among his distinguishing attributes . " He had not made a study of composition , and , in the confu- /z/ sion of foreign languages , the purity of his own had still become considerably impaired . These observations , dictated by an af fectionate and jealous attachment to his memory , are hazarded with diffidence , as they are with deference submitted to your taste and judgment . " I am aware that the scope of the memoir would be chiefly limited to private circulation ; and at a time when the novel and the romance usurp , if not the honors , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek and find his reward in another disinterested offering on the altar of friend ship . I am , &c.; J. R. " /z/ " The merits of Sir William Gell as an author , chiefly 011 sub jects of anti cjuity and topography , are already sufficiently known and appreciated by the public . The fruits of much patient research , of ingenious conjecture , of great personal activity and industry , with admirable graphic illustrations , his works are valuable helps to the student , and an accurate guide for the traveler . In attempting the more difficult task of delineating his general and private character , as deduced from an inter course of many years , if I am conscious of any bias , it must be in favor of one w r ith whom I have spent so many delightful hours , unalloyed by the recollection of even a passing cloud ; for to me he was uniformly kind and attentive . Yet I will endeavor to be impartial , though at the hazard of incurring the reproach of being rather severe . " Sir William started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fine , open , placid countenance of a prepos sessing manner of a remote ancestry , and of an extensive con nection with the best society , lie traveled at a period when travelers were rare , and thus early acquired a distinction which he continued to maintain . Possessing general , though superfi cial information , both literary and scientific , including some ac quaintance with the Oriental languages and hieroglyphics , he sketched beautifully , had a taste for and some knowledge of mu- /z/ sic , and excelled as an easy , off-hand , unaffected correspondent ; indifferent , indeed insensible , to the graces of composition , yet universally courted for a style of naivete beyond the reach of art . Although , however , led by the course of his studies into classical inquiry and reference , the character of a profound scholar will not be assigned to him , notwithstanding his general reading ; he had little taste for literature , and never seemed to feel the beauties of poetry . I should say , indeed , that , in other respects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception of the beau tiful was far from being refined , and that that defect was ap parent in all , even his personal decorations , by a preference for gay , gaudy colors , striking contrasts , and meretricious ornament . " To depth of thought Sir William would have no just pre tensions . He rarely made a general reflection or observation ; all his conclusions were particular . On many of the important questions by which the world is now agitated , he had no steady , fixed opinions ; he had neither the boldness to form , nor the courage to avow his sentiments , which were very liable to be temporarily influenced by the last speaker , the last writer . " In his political principles he was decidedly aristocratical , with a strong predilection for rank , fortune , and fashion , our besetting sin ! " But it is in a companionable , sociable point of view that the memory of Sir " William Gell will be most fondly cherished , his loss most deeply lamented by his surviving friends and acquaint ances ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm pecul iarly his own . To a considerable share of wit and humor to a natural tact and penetration , improved by a long intercourse with the great world , to the habits and bearing of a high-bred gentleman , Sir William added an unceasing flow of lively , play ful language , sparkling dialogue , and brilliant repartee upon ev ery topic which formed the subject of conversation , and this , his great forte both in company and tete-a-tete , was endless . Plac ing people of all classes on a footing of easy familiarity , and thus unlocking their confidence , he drew from them a perpetual sup ply of materials for his own combination toujours variees toujours renaissantes his house became the resort of all ranks , /z/ ages , and sexes , and his mornings one continued levee . The equanimity of his temper under the pressure of bodily infirmity , often of acute suffering , enhanced the value of a cheerful , hu mane , benevolent , charitable disposition , and even the shafts of sarcasm and of ridicule , in which he occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were the offspring of no malignant spirit . " With all his resources , however , Sir William languished in solitude ; he breathed only in the atmosphere of society ; even his literary and other occupations were sometimes carried on in company , while conversing with those around him . " He was fond of being looked up to as a patron and protector , and somewhat jealous of the ascendency which he thus sought to preserve . " It has been said that , as in thinking , so in feeling , he was a stranger to any great depth ; and certainly he seldom betrayed much emotion , or even expressed much interest in the fate of others . It is a remark of his friend , Lady Blessington , in one of her books , that persons the most remarkable for general kindness are those who have the least feeling . " Emulous of fame , he aspired after notoriety and display ; and the latter was sometimes evinced by introducing subjects with which his auditors were very imperfectly conversant , in order , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ com mand their applause . " Tn an argument he was easily vanquished ; in a forward remark as easily checked ; by superior powers painfully eclipsed . Sir William liked to be the presiding genius . In his acquaint ances , visitors , guests , with a few exceptions , he preferred va riety , novelty ; and when these had lost the power of pleasing , he willingly resigned them , like the last month s magazine , for others more attractive . " Hence he was deemed by some people rather selfish , not quite sincere , and not sufficiently mindful of past favors ; but in endeavoring to exhibit the various traits of a distinguished character , we ought always to bear in mind that they include many from which no human being is entirely exempt . " Amid a boundless acquaintance , it may be questioned wheth- /z/ er Sir William Gell had many really and truly attached friends . his affections were infinitely subdivided , frittered away ; but he was a kind and indulgent master . " He seemed to be a great favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they confided in they confessed to they consulted him as a superior being ! Yet all the youth , beauty , grace , accomplishments , whose homage he was constant ly receiving , did rarely , in my hearing , call forth an admiring , never one enthusiastic , one impassioned sentiment . They might be * well-looking , * well-mannered , a pleasing person , that was all . I often asked him who was the most beautiful woman he remembered to have met with ? He replied that he thought he should say Lady Blessington . Still , his behavior , attentions to , correspondence with ladies , were excellent , polite , and kind . In estimating character , we judge , partly from what people do and say , and , which frequently escapes them , from what they do not do and say !

" Mr DEAR LADY BLESSINGTON , A most horrid affair has taken place a t Psestum , Mr. Hunt and his wife having been murdered by robbers . Three /z/ parties were at Psestum Mrs. Benzon and daughter , the Hunts , and a party of officers from The Revenge . Mrs. Benzon was returning to Naples , and about two miles from Paestum met four robbers , who with threats demanded and took all their money . They seem not to have ill treated them otherwise . Mrs. Benzon gave the alarm at Salerno , and sent gens d armcs . About a quarter of an hour after came Mr. and Mrs. Hunt by the same place . They tore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were ill treating the ser vant for having no more money while Mr. Hunt was descending from the car riage .

Mr. Hunt seems to have continued , and to have said he dared not shoot him : this the enraged thief did with two balls , both of which passed through his body , and he fell from the step . One of the balls took a side slant , and went through the body and lungs of Mrs. Hunt also . The thieves , seeing what they had done , im mediately fled without any booty . The husband and wife , the first almost in sensible , were carried back to Prestum . The husband died at half past seven o clock of the same day . The act took place about one .

When , at length , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a bill of one hundred and fifty dollars against me for protect ing useless lemon-trees against the frost of the winter , which , added to the expense of the new horse and the old one , have ever since caused the horrors of a jail to interpose themselves between me and every enjoyment , and so much for the ugly side of the question . " In other respects I am in very good health and spirits , and go out every day to dinners , of which the chief givers have hitherto been Lady Mary Deer- /z/ hurst , Mr. Morritt , of Rokeby , Lord Dudley , Lord Kinnaird , Torlonia , Mrs. Beaumont and Co. , and others , besides the same company , Mr. Irving or Ir vine , Mr. and Lady Selina Robinson , Lord C. Fitzroy , Lord Ashley , Captain Southill , His Highness the Prince of Mecklenburgh , Dr. Wilson , a most agreeable Scot , fresh from Egypt , Jerusalem , and all the East , and very talk ative , Mr. Hare , Mr. Dodwell , and your humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. Quin . Do not , therefore , imagine that in dinners or dinner company we are at all behind you at Naples , though all the strangers are supposed to have left this place , the Lord rest their souls . Since my arrival we have had nothing but misfortunes ; first , the sad affair of Miss Bathurst , * and , secondly , the death of the Duchess of Devonshire . Miss Bathurst s death really made every body unhappy , having been one of the principal delights of the society here while living , and really beloved by every body . Lord Aylmer does not appear to be recovered yet as to spirits , and it seems that the idea still recurs to him every instant : at first his ex ertions in the water , and the agitation he underwent , seemed to threaten his senses for some days . " Mr. Mills has been of the greatest use to him , having at length succeed ed in persuading him to talk about the fatal business till he acquired by de grees a little calmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desires your ladyship may be informed of the circumstance , adding , he will give you a breakfast at the Vigna Palatina , as he has done to Lord and Lady Aylmer almost every morning for the last fortnight . They go away in a day or two to meet the unhappy Mr. Bathurst at Genoa . " The poor duchess had every possible consolation at her death . By the most lucky chance , the duke and Mrs. Ellis were here , and Dr. Quin , coming here for a frolic , sat up with her eight nights , so as to have hurt his own health . He describes her as dying in the most calm and amiable manner pos sible , and the physicians having permitted her to see her friends when they had no longer any hope , the duke , Mr. Ellis , the Due de Laval , and Mr. Artaud went to see her , to take leave of her , as well as Dr. Nott or Knott , who had a conversation with her very satisfactory to him on matters of religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have taken the sacrament , but the doctors would not permit it on account of her weakness . Dr. Quin had been desired by the Duke of Devonshire to be present at the embalming of the body , which is to go by land to England . It was discovered that an ossification of the arteries had commenced , so that in a short time she would probably have died from that cause , had not an accidental cold , neglected by herself for too long a period , thus destroyed her . And now I will give you no more of the miseries of this life . I hope you have at length had better weather . Mr. Morritt says that for two months the thermometer has been seven degrees higher in London than Rome this winter .

I found two letters from Lady Westmoreland , who has already got at Malta 300 worth of things prepared for her voyage to and in Egypt , where she will probably never go . I have answered her with my own pro jects , but do not build much on the negotiation . " In the mean time , they say the Pacha of Egypt has declared himself in dependent ; and others state that he is going in person to attack the Morea , which last is a folly he never will be guilty of , as the government of Constan tinople would then catch him in a trap . If he quits the country , adieu to traveling there , and so says Mr. Wilkinson at Cairo , from whom I have an other letter , saying the pasha has now 30.000 men armed and disciplined in the European manner , with which certainly he might bid defiance to the Porte , if the opinion or religion of the multitude be sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down their arms before the standard of the Prophet .

I have al ready been on one , and I intend to &lt;&gt; ; o on several excursions to different parts of the country , where I make observations for the making of a map of the neighborhood . Every body seems inclined to go on these excursions , so my researches appear as if they would become the fashion in the shape of morn ing rides and drives , with cold dinners brought to the point of rendezvous .

" 1 was going on in much too flourishing a state of health and jack-ass riding when I received an unlucky letter from Dr. Watson , congratulating me on the same , and singing the praises of Dr. Neiker , who he says has cured him of his infamous headache .

In the mean time I have really very little pain , though I have been so bewildered that I could not even sit up for two days a great inconvenience , as it deprives one of so many amusements . At present I am better , or the scene is shifting , which it makes no scruple of doing between both feet , both knees , and a dozen or two of the elbows and fingers ; and thus you have had a long and dull account of my enemy and myself . I have been , since I wrote last to your ladyship , doing nothing but living in the country houses of the Romans . We had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after we returned from Bracciano . We next borrowed the palace of the Duke of Tagerolo of that ilk , and thought that though the thieves were already strong in the field , a population of four or five thousand souls , with the ducal palace in the centre , would render the neighborhood safer for us ; and indeed so we found it , having the good fortune to assify all over the country in all directions unassailed . Lady Mary Deerhurst , who is the lady of the castle on all these excursions , carries the whole household , children , tutor , governess , dogs , and the rest of the royal familv , so that we made some show even in the largest of these mansions , that at Zagarolo being really a magnificent pile , and the place where the pope of those days sent the learned men to consult on the best Catholic edition of the Bible , since published , and called the Vulgate . Here we were joined for some days by Lords Kinnaird and Dudley , and Mr. Hare , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bacon and Mr. Stevenson , whom Lady Mary found out one day bv chance /z/ as she was riding through Valmontone , the whole party and I believe three carriages having only mistaken their way a little , and traveled through the whole territory of the thieves by Monte Casino , thinking they were going by the Terracina road , much as the lovely Bess Caldwell went halfway to Vienna in her way from Brussels to Paris . " When we had seen every thing in that country we returned again to Rome , whence we fitted out several little expeditions for the day , and discov ered several cities with good old Greek-looking walls of large blocks , which the wags and antiquaries had no idea of . " Probably the lost cities taken by Romulus and the Tar quins will all be found in time , if we all live and are well , which , as you very wisely observe , is doubtful . " I shall only give you one more of our tours in search of Cures , the ancient city of the Sabines , whence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Quirites to Rome . We found the place , though there are but few remains , near the modern village and river Correse , a charming trout stream , running through the most beautiful country we had ever seen . Between the high range of Monte Gennaro ( Lucretili according to Mathews ) and the Tiber is a country perhaps eight miles in width , interspersed with villages at short distances , perched on the most romantic spots , perfectly defended by nature , but beautifully picturesque , with the remains of the ancient fortifications of the baronial houses . We had the palace of Prince Sierra at Monte Libretti , one of those villages , and though we had it not enough to ourselves to be very comfortable , we managed to make our excursions with effect . Nothing can give you an idea of the infinite beauty of the country , which , generally speak ing , seems an eternal forest of oaks and spina Christi ; yet every now and then , and just when you wish it , opening into a little cultivation , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile , in crossing the direction of the great mountains which bound the whole , you have a descent by a precipice into a deep woody dell , with its little stream , sometimes with a patch of cultivation , and forcing its way through the rocks ; but I will say no more , lest you should think the gout is got into my head . How sorry you will all have been for Lord Byron . We have a little medal here of him , but it might as well have been of Caesar , to my eye . They should have sent to Count D Orsay for a profile . It is really a sad loss to literature , and an immense deficit of interest from the Greek cause . I am afraid the said cause is not very flourishing , as we begin to receive letters from ruined families of the Greeks , saying that , having lost almost all they had by the revolution , and no law existing , they fled with the little remainder , and now solicit your excellency s support .

Craven writes from /z/ the Lake of Wallensee on the 16th , and Munich the 17th of June . He finds no attempt at pease , or even salad . At Wallensee several patches of snow down to the water s edge . The elder flowers not come out . The apple-trees yet in early bloom , and a sharp frost every evening . Two days before , he was eating over-ripe cherries in Italy .

When that is spent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get well by the time they begin to infest the road , I must really take the liberty to escape by sea , for to be beaten to death because I can not walk into the mountains , or , being taken on an ass , to have to pay the greater part of my fortune for a ransom , would neither of them be advisable cases . I hope , at least , the earl now likes the Belvidere better than in the winter , when the window curtains sometimes insisted on becoming part of the dinner company at the table . Speaking of a gun , do any of you want a groom , named Crispin , who has been all over this country with Lady Mary , but which Lady Mary is now gone to Leghorn with only an English groom for her riding-horses , and , in consequence , the man is left in my hands to dispose of 1 Now for a description .

I hope you will be able to read my writing , as it has only just occurred to me that I am obliged to sit in a posture which I can not do myself , with my feet in the air . I have no news from England .

Don t laugh . Miss Power . The fact is , that all those feelings which I had for two days at your house most kindly contrived to re solve themselves into a fit of the gout on the very morning of my departure , so that I got into the carriage in torture , and was obliged to be borne out by two porters at Capua , since which time till to-day I have never put a foot to the ground . I considered , at Capua , that if I let Sir W. Drummond turn back , as he wanted to do , it was most probable he would fall ill before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tour , so I was carried again to the coach , and , after a drive of thirty-five miles to San Germano with the same horses , through a most beautiful country , and not very bad road , we found ourselves compelled at sunset to mount two wretched asses , and climb by a steep zigzag road for an hour and a half to the monastery of Monte Casino . All this , with a fit of the gout , was certainly rather an undertaking , but I was carried by some very good people of the jackasses up five hundred steps and forty corridors , and laid upon a bed , where the holy fathers , the very nicest of Thingumbcrrys in the world , were so kind to me that I could have been no where better . They gave us a fine supper in the next room , as I found by the number of good plates they brought , and tried to persuade me to eat . Sir William Drummond seemed quite pleased with them , and talked till a late hour , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next morning , Tuesday , they took him to see their library , which is very good , and their archivio , or room of manuscripts ; and finding I was not in a movable state , they were so kind as to send five or six of their most curious MSS. to me . Among them was the MS . Virgil , which has all the lines filled up ( by the Lord knows who ) which Yirgil had left unfinished in his hurry to die . We remained there till Saturday , when I descended the mountain in a sedan chair , and we renewed our journey . On Friday , the fathers insisted on my seeing their wonders in the said sedan ; and I went into the church to hear the celebrated organ , which , in the shattered state of my nerves , only served to make me cry . The church is really the most beautiful thing ever seen . It is entirely incrusted with the finest marbles , and neither stone nor mortar appears in any part of it . The pilasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serpentino ; and the whole so clean , so new , and o polished , that , till I had seen it , I had no idea of the effect which might be produced by colored marbles . The floor is also equally beautiful and simple , /z/ and the ceiling gilt and painted in the gayest and most elegant manner . Un der the dome is the abbot s throne , and in the chancel the stalls are of carved oak , of the most elaborate and astonishing workmanship . When the first effect of the organ had passed off , I found it was really more like an orchestra than any thing I had ever heard , and the organist was never tired of playing , and of setting it off to the best advantage . These people are really learned monks , and we found , out of ten , three or four who were good scholars , and had even got as far as the Hebrew . In former times they had great revenues , and more than one hundred residents . They have now 16,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed their kindness to us , and we did our best to repay it , by showing them the sextant , camera lucida , and ali we possessed , which might be new to them in science or literature . Quitting these good souls , we began our adventures , intending to go to Rome by the nearest way . We set out , therefore , with a vetturino for Ceprano , the first town in the Roman States . We found , near St. Gcrmano , the remains of an amphitheatre ; and we spun along a fine new road , past Aquino to below ilocca Secca , for two hours or more , with the greatest success , and there met with the River Melfa , almost dry , but at the bottom of a deep , rocky dell , over which a bridge is building to get over the stream ; it was therefore neces sary to diverge to the right , and in about twenty minutes we regained the good road , only to quit it forever on the left , and wander for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any fixed direction . It ap pears that , if ever five miles of the road be made , there will be no difficulty in reaching Ceprano in a direct line . As it is , however , the fine road rnns to the right to Sara , and we were condemned to hunt our fortune in a large coach and four , and at last to make nine or ten miles out of the five . There were few absolute dangers , particularly as the weather had been dry , but it began to rain in the afternoon , and we passed a sort of devil s bridge between two precipices of slippery earth , which was not quite agreeable . We reached at length the little village of Isolatta , and soon after got into the Roman States , where we found a road , and a very good new bridge over the Liris , by which we entered the little town of Ceprano . Here we lodged at the house of a surgeon , to whom our friends of Monte Casino had recommended us , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof , we could expect . In the morning of Sunday we set out again , and , passing by a very decent but tire some road , eternally mounting and descending , but in a well-cultivated and pretty country , through Frosinone , Ferentino , and Anagni , cities of Latium , with great remains of antiquity , we arrived at night at Valmontane , having gone forty-four miles with the same horses from Ceprano . As we came late , though the inn is very large , it was occupied , and , after a good deal of waiting and trouble , we got two corn-chambers , with damp bods to sleep in . Sir Will iam could not sleep , but in the morning we proceeded to the Holy City , twentyfive miles , and arrived at two o clock , having performed our journey through the whole of the thieves country without any sinister accident . Lord Kin- /z/ naird we saw on our arrival , and Mr. Mills came the same day . Mr. Millingen was also here , and is gone on to Paris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in my garden every minute . Craven arrives to-mor row , and the margravine is hourly expected : a most wonderful coincidence of travelers . My companion voted me too crazy to accompany him to Albano , where he thinks he is going to ride about on the mountain , so I am sent to grass for a few days at my own casino on the Quirinal . I expect in less than a week to be summoned to Albano , and so to return to Naples , when , as I already begin to hobble , I expect to be quite well in my way , and where I hope to hear of you on my arrival ; for I will not let you write , as I am most uncertain in my motions . I think I am the only person who sets out at the beginning of a fit of the gout on a party of pleasure , but I think it has suc ceeded , as I should not have been well any where ; and I can say that , except starting , the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , or to have been conquered by Dr. Neiker . You will know poor Miss Bathurst s body was found the day we arrived . A flood seems to have removed the sand bank which had covered it , near the scene of the accident . Having been al ways under water , the flesh had become like spermaceti , and the hat , veil , &c.,; were perfect ; even the mouth was recognizable .

Was discharged by the princess in 1817 for saying something which was , in fact , untrue . Did not go into other service , because in Switzerland she had funds of her own sufficient to live upon . A letter of hers , after her departure , was read to her sister , another servant of the princess , named Marictte , dated 8th Feb. , 1818 , in which this passage occurs : " You can not think , Marictte , what a noise my little journal lias made . " In this letter she says she spoke in her journal in the highest terms of the princess .

I shall therefore bring Pau sanias on Sunday and hope you will not have company who will prevent my lesson . With kindest regards to the count and Lady Julia , /z/ In a letter of Sir William Gell s , addressed to Lady Blessington , 1824 , at the Villa Belvidere , the following observations on mythological emblems , ornaments , instruments , and vesture are inserted , in the hand-writing , I think , of Mr. Craven , probably transmitted in compliance with the wishes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were peculiarly given as rewards to the winners in par ticular games . Wild olive was the recompense in the Olympic games , laurel in the Pythian , parsley in the Nemean , and pine twigs in the Isthmic games . The diadem or fillet , called Credemnon , was among the gods reserved for Ju piter , Neptune , Apollo , and Bacchus , and among men it was regarded as the peculiar mark of royalty . The radiated crown , formed of long sharp spikes , emblematic of the sun , and represented as issuing from the head of that deity , was first worn only on the tiaras of the Armenian and Parthian kings , and afterward became adopted by the Greek sovereigns of Egypt and of Syria . A wreath of olive-branches was worn by ordinary men at the birth of a son , and a garland of flowers at weddings , on festivals , and at feasts ; in order that the scent might be more fully enjoyed , the wreath was often worn round the neck . As a symbol of power , gods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terminated by the representation of some animal or flower instead of a point . As the emblem of their mission , Mercury and all messen gers bore the caduceus twined round the serpent . " The car of each Grecian deity was drawn by some peculiar kind of animal or bird : that of Juno by peacocks , of Apollo by griflins , of Diana by stags , of Venus by swans or turtle-doves , of Mercury by rams , of Minerva by owls , of Cybele by lions , of Bacchus by panthers , of Neptune by sea-horses . The Gor gon s head , with its round chaps , wide mouth , and tongue drawn out , emble matic of the full moon , was regarded as an amulet against incantations and spells , and is for that reason found not only on the formidable aegis of Jupiter and of Minerva , as well as on cinerary urns and in tombs , but on Grecian shields and breast-plates , at the pole-ends of chariots , and in the most conspic uous parts of every other instrument of defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prows of Greek galleys or ships of war were ornamented with /z/ the cheniscus , frequently formed like the head and neck of an aquatic bird , and the poop with the aplustrum , shaped like a sort of honeysuckle . Two large eyes were generally represented near the prow , as if to make the vessel like a fish , to see its way through the waves . In religious processions of the Greeks , masks were used as well as in their theatres , and in order to repre sent the attendants of the god who was worshiped . Thus , in Bacchanalian processions ( the endless subjects of ancient bas-reliefs and paintings ) , the fauns , satyrs , and other monstrous beings are only human individuals mask ed ; and in initiations and mysteries , the winged genii are in the same predic ament ; and the deception must have been the greater , as the ancient masks were made to cover the whole head . Of these masks , which , together with all else that belonged to the theatre , were consecrated to Bacchus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or characters , such as joy , grief , laughter , dignity , vulgarity , masked in the comic , tragic , and satyric masks , others offered portraits of real individuals , living or dead . The thyrsus , so frequently introduced , was only a spear , of which the point was stuck in a pine cone , or wound round with ivy leaves . Afterward , to render the blows given with it during drunkenness harmless , it was made of the reed called ferula . " Of musical instruments , the phorminx , or large lyre , was dedicated to Apollo , and was played upon with an ivory instrument called plectrum . It was usually fastened to a belt hung across the shoulder , and sometimes sus pended from the wrist of the left hand , while played upon with the right . The cithara , or smaller lyre , was dedicated to Mercury , and when the body was formed of tortoise-shell , and the arms composed of a goat s horns , it was call ed chelys . This was played upon by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emitted a graver sound . The trigonium , or triangle , an instrument borrowed by the Greeks from Eastern nations , much resem bled the harp . Besides these instruments with chords , the Greeks had several wind instruments , principally the double flute and the syrinx , or Pan s flute . To these may be added a certain instrument for producing noise , the tympanon , or tambourine , chiefly used in the festival of Bacchus and of Cybele : the crembala , or cymbals , formed of metal cups , and the crolals , or castanets , formed of wood , shaped like shells . " In attire , the chlamys , a short cloak , was a garment of gods and heroes , fastened over the shoulder or upon the chest . Such is the mantle of the Apollo Belvidere , and many of the statues of Mercury . Wreaths of oak leaves were consecrated to Jupiter , laurel leaves to Apollo , ivy and vine to Bacchus , pop lar to Hercules , wheat ears to Ceres , gold or myrtle to Venus , fir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river gods . " The pcplum was a sort of mantle worn by the Greeks ; the tunic a loose robe . Venus is the only one of the goddesses that is represented without a peplum , and Diana is generally represented with hers furled , and drawn tight over the shoulders and round the waist , forming a girdle , with the end fall- /z/ ing down in front . The peplum had small metal points attached to its cor ners , in order to make them hang more straight and even . " " Rome , 23d March , 1825 .

I continued to mend in my hobbling as I approached the Holy City , and for some days after my arrival ; but , as fate would have it , all my friends lived up one hundred and fifty stairs , and I ruined myself by my premature activity so effectually , that , though without pain , I have been forced to be car ried by tw T o people , one of whom is the great Pasquale , till three days ago .

Moreover , I wrote to his lordship again to say that , as he told me , I had , through Torlonia , made a sort of draft on Messrs . Ransom at a long date I think three months as the map was almost finished . I have put down in the title at once that his munificence was the cause of the publication , for it seems better to write the real truth . So it begins , Munificentia Exc .

" It was very silly of me not to ask one of you to send me one line from Flor ence , as I have been thinking ever since of the displeasure I should receive from losing a letter to you . However , I will proceed on the supposition that you are really gone on to Venice , unseduced by the wiles of Messrs . Strangways and Co. to detain you at Florence . Oh , what pens and paper one meets with in Dodwell s house ! but I have mended it , for there I am waiting for dinner at four o clock on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in great tribulation at your departure , and the next day it seemed as if you had been gone a week , so heavily did the time pass . I im mediately fell to map-making with great vigor , and it is positively engraving on a great plate of copper weighing thirty-six pounds , and costing the Lord knows what . The said plate arrived when I was out , and Squintibus , to whom I had mentioned my wish to put a metal plate behind the fire , mistook it for that , and was on the point of sacrificing my new copper to that purpose . I made the tour proposed with Messrs . Dodwell and Nibby , and the Conte di Monte Vecchio , last Monday ; but , having wisely selected the only rainy day ever seen , we did nothing but fence off the bad weather with umbrellas , and after getting up at five to set out at seven , we dined at twelve in a cottage , at a place called Buccea , twelve miles from Rome , and returned without being much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we set out for Antiuin that is , Dodwell , Mills , and I , in two carriages ; as Mills goes on a plant expedition only , and we go to flatter ourselves in vain , we shall find Corrioli with Caius Marcius and John Kemble on the wall .

Manetho , or Eratosthenes , I forget which , says the name Nitocris meant the victorious Minerva ; so Champollion s queen begins with the signs of Neith , the goddess answering to Minerva , and of the rest of the char acters after Neit or Neith he makes the word victory in Coptic , of which I be lieve every word ( like a goose , you will say ) , and quite worship the knowl edge united with the talent he possesses . He says he will come here on the 15th of May , and certainly will be a great acquisition to me " The Strabo informs us .

This has long been a fashion able amusement at Rome ; but they have now got up , with splendid scenery and dresses , Iphigenie in Tauris , and other heroic pieces , which are said to be very entertaining , particularly when the machinery goes wrong , and the he roes , instead of striking a blow with their swords , thrust them through the train of their own robes . This operation is so long deferred on account of their journey to Antiurn , about which you have heard so much , and probably care so little .

The world is grown very wide I mean , there is quite room enough for those remaining in Rome and to-day I have seen no one but Dr. Watson , Nibby , Mr. Petre , /z/ and Mr. Sykes , the first bound for Naples , and the latter for England , where Pussey will wend for the sake of buying horses .

Pray let me hear from you ere long , not a letter , but a line to say how you all are , and whither bound . Dr. Robertson came a day or two after you went , and seemed sorry not to have caught you .

" I am gone to bed at nine , having a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every other species of agreeable sensation . It rained yesterday furiously , on account of which Lady Westmoreland gave a fete in a villa at Rome . Now I had no idea that Lord B was with the rest of the family , imagining that he had departed some fortnight ago for the purpose of appearing in Parliament ; and , on this supposition , I ventured to ask the count whether the mention of the map would be an imprudence or not . His lordship has solved my doubts in a very agreeable manner ; so I shall , accord ing to his order , consider him as the Mecsenas of my map , and he must figure away with arms , coronet , and supporters , with a sort , I think , of Latin dedi cation in one corner , according to the custom of the modern Medes and Per sians , which altereth not . Depend upon it I will contrive the thing in a few words , saying the truth , that his lordship is the cause of its appearance , by his munificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is to tell the Ransoms to answer my drafts for a sum not exceeding 400 dollars ( and I hope not 300 ) , which was the way settled with Lord Kinnaird by his own desire ; and let me beg of him not to think of dying as he did , for it puts me in a fright , now the map is nearly engraved , quite indescribable . The next thing is the business of the 1000 . Last year I was in high quest of a per son to whom I might lend on annuity that or somewhat a larger sum ; but it was disposed of to a certain Signore Pietro , lord of the manor of Porto , and , after Torlonia , the greatest proprietor here , who pays one twelve per cent , for the same ; and 500 more I lent to a friend on the same terms , that is , when I die , adieu to my rent . Now I have another 1000 in London , settled on houses for three lives at ten per cent. , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the owner of the houses has delayed payment ever since the Fauntleroy affair that is , he owes me 300 at this moment , and my lawyer has ordered the rents to be paid to him instead of to the said proprietor , and it is probable I am to expect my arrears and my principal soon . " All the people here pay on the first of every month , which is very con venient , and they pawn their lands and houses . Moreover , there is an office in which you examine whether the said houses and lands have been pawned before ; and if the thing be not registered there , the engagement would be the last to be discharged . If the money should be forthcoming , I will immediate ly let his lordship know ; and as Craven is in London , ; t is not impossible that I should hear something shortly . It is true we talked about Mr. Gait , and Lord B thought that at his instigation he might be able to dispose of the work on the Alhambra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by what I hear , the trade of bookselling and making , except in novels and plays , is quite finished in London . As to lithography , I am told no publisher can afford any thing else , and that nothing else appears . Lord B s belle , the margravine , goes to Naples to-morrow , and Lady D is retired to the Villa Ricciardi , in spite of Sir William , who wrote to her not to come because it was so dull , The rest of the Neapolitan world are gone to Castelamare . " Rocca Romano is , I believe , constant , but has made up matters with . He lives a good deal in the country . Caserano is still at Palermo . Mrs. Dodwell not quite so handsome , but more severe ; and having heard of what that book contained against her , vowed she would never again enter an English house .

First , I have caused his excel lency s name to be inscribed on the map in a way that can not offend his mod esty , being only the simple truth in classical language , which runs somehow thus : /z/ Comitis Blessington , Hoc Tentamen Geographicum , Exhibens Latium Vetus Et Hodiernum , &c.,; &c.,; &c.; Romse Kal . Sexti Anno . MDCCCXXVII. , showing that his lordship s munificence is the cause of the production of the map . Please to tell Messrs . Ransom about it as soon as you can , so that when I draw through Torlonia , it may be all right . Now for the second proposition about the 1000 and the annuity . I have no money at this mo ment not disposed of , but I expect 1000 to be paid me by a certain Mr. Bax ter , settled on houses in Carmarthen Street .

" I am resolved to write to you , though my hand refuse its office , and will probably be shared by its less practiced fellow before I have filled my sheet . I have been attacked with an abominable rheumatism , beginning in the shoul der , and , having well established itself in the neck , so as to produce the most excruciating pains , sending a colony to establish itself in the elbow , wrist , and hand in the shape of the gout , that I have passed an entire week in purga tory , whence I am now only beginning to escape , with the loss of the little remaining hair , known by its couleur mouchicide , as the count used to say of it .

" So I have stolen from myself , therefore , the necessary money for the jour ney , and in wishing to lend my house to a most excellent person and friend of mine , Miss Whyte , in my absence , have found a tenant who insists upon pay ing rent whether I will or not , and with whom I can leave my goods and chattels all at sixes and sevens , just as they are , without any trouble or prep aration .

I fear I shall lose my said friend at Rome , and then Lord Blessington will not have the trouble of being civil , though , if you continue to repeat the kind things the groom has said of Lord B , that may perhaps effect a change .

My nephew is , I find , arrived at Rome , and I conclude will be in scrapes , if he can not get some body to take care of him .

" I have put off writing to you so long , day after day , that I almost feel ashamed at last of addressing you . One of the causes was the delay of my unfaithful spouse , who has been for six months in my debt a letter ; and an other , that where no good can be done , one feels averse to mentioning the many subjects you must have encountered of an unpleasant and afflicting na ture . I beg only to assure you that , though absent and distant , I have never ceased to think of you with regard and affection , and to have most anxious- /z/ ly inquired of all travelers from France concerning your welfare and proceed ings . " Nevertheless , till the unexpected arrival of Colonel Stewart , I had never been able to make out any thing satisfactory about you ; for , though Mills seems to have known , yet a tour which he made to England seemed to put an end to his power of writing ; and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him , heard no more . Lately , I have an account of you from Mr. Hamilton , who sent me a Mr. Chester , to whom I was to give certain intro ductions to persons in Egypt . Since I saw you , I have , I think , written two or three books , none of which have as yet appeared in public . One is a little treatise on the walls and military architecture of the Greeks , with a view to the question about Cyclopean walls , with about thirty plates , which I have dedicated and given to the Royal Society of Berlin , out of gratitude for their unsought protection and election of myself when I was as yet young and unknown . " This , I believe , they are publishing at Berlin . The other is a second series of Pompeiana , which was thought of when you were in Italy , but which is now enlarged to more than eighty plates , and is in the hands of Mr. Jen nings , a bookseller in London , who begins to publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recommended to him the propriety of sending me .500 , which he says he was very glad to do , and which I regret is now in a fair way of dissipation , having , however , stopped in its progress the mouths of my credit ors , occasioned by Mr. Fauntleroy . I shall request that you will accept a copy of the new work on Pompeii , as a companion to that which used to be on your table . " I suppose we shall soon hear some advertisement on the subject , so pray do not send for it if you feel so disposed , as I will order you to be served with one of my own copies . I did not much like the account I sent Count D Orsay about his Sicilian money . The people are such thorough-bred cheats , that they have made a roundabout plot to throw it upon the shoulders of the o-overnment , who are not troubled with a propensity to payment . We have fewer milords than usual this year , and at Rome there is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make that place the favored residence . Here we have the Langford , Brookes , and Townley Parkers of Cheshire , very admirable people , and I don t know that I ever remember the society so pleasant as it has been for the last two years . Bess Caldwell was at Rome last year , and she seemed very much taken up with going every day to examine the Duke of Buckingham s exhalations . It is supposed she meant excavations . When she heard of poor Sir William Drummond s death , she asked whether that was not the man that died writing a history of oranges ; by which she meant Origines . She is a great loss , but I suppose you will have her at Paris this year . I was pleased and displeased to see by the pa pers that the count had won a race . I am always in a fright at all sorts of sporting for money ; and often one small sum won causes the loss of thou sands . /z/ " I fear you will none of you ever come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin yourselves . The Roman disturbances arc ended , and even Lady Sandwich has been to dine with Lady Mary . What geese people are , to say no worse of the trying to pull all one s neighbors down to get into their places . The poor archbishop is by no means right ; he has lost his favorite Annette , which is a severe blow to him , poor man ! in his eighty-sixth year . Other wise , I don t think he was more changed than his age would warrant . He always asks very kindly about you all . " I saw the Filangiere the other night ; he told me his wounds were break ing out afresh , and giving him pain . The Ricciardis spend their lives in get ting up plays , but as it has rained three months , and now begins to snow , who can go to them " ? I must apologize for my horrid paper , the baseness of which I did not detect till it was too late to retract . Do you know old Le Chevalier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was formerly a great friend of mine , as was Barbia de Bocage , the Barber of the Grove , but he is dead , and , I fear , Le Chevalier is by this time grown old ; but he is a very good man , and of the old school . " My health is , I think , much the same , or perhaps , on the whole , improved . Pray let me hear all about yourself , and remember me most kindly to the fat doctor , Sir Manly , and the count most kindly , poor little souls ! to those two children . W. GELL . " " Sir William Drummond s book goes on slowly , on account of the writing . As to such drawings as you are kind enough to admire , they cost but little trouble , and have no value ; but being taken from the antique , or being of places difficult of access , as you say , we shall be bound in calf together , with great eclat . Speaking of art , M. Ternite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and says of that of Achilles and Briseis , Ah , c est unique . Moreover , he swears that , compared to it , all that modern painters have ever done are , in comparison , daubs . I really believe I shall be old fool enough to sec it before I go to Rome , which must take place , whether I will or no . I fear the poor abbo has lost .500 by the failure of B and Company . /z/ " Naples , March 20th , 1832 . " You have been on my conscience for at least the last six months , that is , I have been purposing to myself to write to you for at least so long a time ; but I have been so much occupied in writing like a steam-engine for my bread , that I have been obliged to neglect every thing else , till I could finish a work on the Roman Topography , in which there is nothing about Rome , but a great deal about the country , and which the Society of Dilettanti are undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain , at least 500 , to satisfy thn claims of the Torlonias , who give one enough of credit to be one s ruin . " Among the misfortunes of the age , cholera , reform , and rebellion , tho poor /z/ dear old CountcsH Ricciardi , of Camaldoli , has boon a terrible loss to hor fam ily and friondH ; H ! IO h ; ul tho measles ( which tho Italian doctors do not know how to treat , when of the kind called confluent ) ; and just an tho poor Princess of Hutera died a year ago , our poor friend wan killed , by the disease being thrown inward by Homo imprudent exposure to air , and tho total want of knowledge of the doctors . She died about two days ago . The unhappy IIUH band left the house , and retired to that of Coriali , whoHe daughter married one of the Ricciardi s HOIIS. 1 ean not tell you any more of the consequences , but every body wan Horry for her , poor soul ! and regretted her IOHS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachment to her , and they have , continued great friendever Hincc , and seen one another often , as ho liven at the Uclvidero . He is only yesterday returned from Persano , whore ho was pretending to shoot , by way of getting over the fetes of tins Carnival . Wo have had a very bad winter that is , it lian never been very cold , but always too cold , and it has rained much more than UHiial . Even now it in not at all the climate for en joyment , and the spring in three weeks later than it in in general . I hopo you got , and continue to fret , tho new worlc on Pompeii ; if not , let me know , i beg , that 1 may arm you with full powers against the publisher , Mr. Jennings . " The world here is much altered since you loll it . I should say , tho socie ty last year was better than ever , but I was prevented , by tho probability of the Trastovcrini sacking Rome , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they do not get up another riot between the French and Austrian* , which seems not unlikely . In tho mean time , the world is grown much more luxu rious and expensive , for one is asked every day to dinners of sixteen arid twenty , instead often and twelve , and then ; seem to bo a ball , even in Lent , nearly every night , only not with fiddles . " Yesterday I was invited to three dinners , Lord Hertford , Lady Dmminond , and Sir ( ieorgo Talbot , and to an assembly at tho two first , and another at Count Lebrettern s , tho Austrian minister , HO that tho world hen ? is really going on swimmingly . We are to have an omnibus expedition to Pompeii on Monday next , under the auspices of Lord Hertford . It carries twentyfour , and 1 think so great will be its fall , that I intend going in a carriage of my own , if 1 ean . You know we have Sir Walter , and he is in much better health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all tho bettor sineo his arrival here . I took him to Miss Whyte s , in the way to Piestum , and I see him al most every day , and dine with him to-morrow . Ho is very agreeable in a drive or tttic-d-t ( . to , but lost in parties of twenty , to which he is invited . I took him to tho archbishop s* to dine , and am to go ngain this week . The arch bishop is quite well , except an inflamed eye , which Dr. Hogg says they are treating ill , and which might be cured in a few hours ; but he has recommend ed a proper cure to tho canonico , who will , I hope , persuade the Neapolitan doctor to apply it . Sir ( jlranvillo Temple told ino last night Champollion was dead . It is a great loss , as I believe he has no successor , unless Roeellini of /z/ Pisa may be so called . Our last accounts of your London cholera are alarm ing , but I trust untrue . Pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are faithful to you to your sister of the long eyelashes , the Contessa , for I never can remember the name , pray also remember me . On the whole , Italy is quiet and uncholeric for the present , and I can not but think you would be at least as happy here as among the turbulencies of Lord Grey and Co. /z/ p.S . Among the curiosities , I was delighted to see Miss Skeene , who is the Miss Pratt of the novel called Inheritance . You remember , she comes to Lord s house in a hearse . I asked Sir Walter , before I saw her , if the character was like . He said , Well , I believe it may be , with a little ill nature added to her . She seems the very person . I was near calling her Miss Pratt twenty times . " /z/ " Naples , October 26th , 1832 . " I am become so much of a coffee-house , that I really have been two days beginning to write to you , and even now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is not likely I should indite any thing coherent . You are right in saying I have been long obeying your order to write . The besetting vice , after vanity of this world , is putting off , just as hell is said to be paved with good intentions . I have certainly put off writing for the last three months , having all the time suffered my duty to sit as an incubus upon my conscience . I have now , however , received your kind present and your beautiful picture . Without compliment , it is a most lovely portrait , and , except the expression , is like you ; there is something about the mouth which is not you ; and what is singular is , that most of the people who see it on my table exclaim at the likeness to Lady Augusta Coventry , who is grown up into a beautiful girl , and makes many conquests among the heathen . The picture by Mr. Uwins is , I think , like me , but it is a little more unhappy than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melancholy cast of countenance , for a Mr. Uwins , at Rome , has taken a small waxen profile of me , which has the same character ; and it would not be extraordinary , after thirty-two years of illness , if some twinges had taken a permanent lodging in some of my features . I am , how ever , except the loss of most of my hair , not so much worse than when you quitted Italy as might have been expected , and Lord Hertford s plan has saved me for the last eighteen months from the same degree of torment which I have suffered for the last ten years . I was in hopes your letter would have told me when you intended to revisit these countries ; but your house , as Craven tells me , is so exquisite in all respects , that he thinks it impossible any thing can ever tempt you to move again . Mr. Powell , who seems a /z/ most agreeable person , I have already seen twice , and am to meet to-morrow at dinner at Craven s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that the affairs of Count Alfred will soon be arranged to his satisfaction . I am delighted to see that the spirit of order which you always possessed , and which has done so much good on other occasions , has enabled you to take care of such of your friends as have less foresight than yourself . My preach ing has the peculiar advantage of coming from a person who is always in debt , and always in the last stage of poverty himself . Either the cholera or the reform has so fettered the booksellers in London , that , though the Dilet tanti Society have engraved a map for me at their own expense , yet .300 , which I want to get for the book accompanying it , from a bookseller , do not seem at the moment to be easily forthcoming . You say Mr. Uwins has given you my picture . Do you mean that you have not got my last Pompeiana , second series 1 If not , it is not my fault , but your own , for decidedly Messrs . Chaplin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down your name as one of my copies sent . Pray send immediately about it , for I dare say all the booksellers will fail on the first opportunity . I am sure I sent you the order very long ago . By-the-by , I wish there were any means of seeing your Byroniana here , where nothing ever arrives till five years after its birth . You are probably , by this time , an arbiter of the fate of more than one bookseller . Jennings told Craven that nothing sold but what would go into one of the annuals . It is very disagreeable to a poor author to write without a certain way of disposing of his works . I have at present about seventy paintings from Pompeii , &c.,; which are colored from the originals , and form a very beautiful and useful history of the art among the ancients . I wish I could find a bookseller to undertake it . Should you see any means of furthering my interest with your man of books , pray nail the said bookseller , if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make an interesting work on the Arabs of Spain , interspersed with translations of some of their poetry , which would suit one or any of the annuals , but I must have intro duced some views of the Alhambra , to make it more interesting . " If I ever come of age , and am not obliged to write for money , I shall cer tainly , at all events , give the public an account of the Moors , with the Alham bra as an embellishment , as the last and most exquisite of their works . I have got notes without end on the subject , which I think would make a very interesting book . Our mountain goes on burning , and , I think , seems inclined to continue ejecting lava , till a little cone , which has grown out of the centre of the crater , you remember , shall be as high as the highest peak of the hill . " November 2d . I dined at Craven s with Mr. Powell and his companion , Mr. Harcourt . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Cumae , on Saturday , and I was asked to meet them at dinner on their return . In short , they go about sight-seeing , and they seem to have little occasion for any assistance from me . I shall try to get them a footing at Lady Coventry s , who keeps open house every evening both here and at /z/ Rome , and under whose auspices they may see all the world without trouble . I have already told you Lady Augusta is grown up one of the prettiest girls possible , and one of the best-educated and well-informed , and mamma has taken her to court ; and , in short , she is come out , and the house is on a bet ter footing , and has more company in consequence . We have Lord Ponsonby arrived as minister , but Mr. Hill is yet at the Belvidere on the Vomero , for Lord Berwick is expected not to survive twenty-four hours . It is true he rallies perpetually , but by the time this reaches you , you may consider Mr. Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in remembering my servants , and they were very much struck with your goodness when I told them , and desired to kiss your hand . Craven desires also a thousand kind remembrances . He is in bad humor , as he thinks he is more deaf than usual , but I think it only imagination . Nevertheless , he would soon become a sort of hermit if he had not some one to keep him always in agitation . The young captain seems disposed to keep him in hot water every now and then ; but it is a very agreeable , genteel youth , and he acts quite without a rival both in French and English . We are to have private theatricals this winter , and I dare say shall do very well for company , though the characters supposed to be coming from England are , as yet , not named . A family of Colonel Vyse have settled in the Palazzo Paterno , one of the most agreeable that ever came to Naples , in my opinion . They are numerous , but seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is said many are come to Rome , but I can learn no names . The Torlonias go on just as usual . You would scarcely know the father was defunct , except that you don t hear his tremendous cough when you go there . I suspect my finances are , however , arrived at that state which will render my visits to Rome more rare and more difficult . Mrs. Dodwell is at last by no means so ill off as we feared ; in short , every thing con sidered , I hope she will be in a better state of finance than nine tenths of the Roman nobility . Mr. Mills , who is gone to Sicily , and myself , were left her trustees , and I think , between coaxing and scolding , her affairs are in a fair way of being settled , insomuch that we have relinquished the business , our agency being no longer required . Pray remember me most kindly to Colonel Stewart , who has been expected here for the last three years by many . For my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naples , will not bring him here again . I hear of the ex-Lady Cell , La Comtessa di St. Marsault , * sitting with a disdainful air in a high fly-cap in a corner of the room . My blessing upon her . The archbishop , who has got your picture , and is delighted , with it , has been ill , but is now flourishing , aged ninety . Matthias is younger than ever , and more discontented . " The Ricciardis I will see or send your message to , with all speed . They have not recovered their loss . My dog family consists of Ticati , who is my companion , his son and heir , Monsu Qua , a youth of promising talents . I /z/ have also a white terrier , Monsu Bo , of Craven breed . My house is really become quite pretty at the expense of 100 two years ago , and when finish ed , and I called for the account , I found it had been paid by Lord de Ros ; Sir Charles Monck also gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . My kind regards to Count Alfred , and pray continue to believe me very affec tionately yours , W. G. " P.S. Ladies are so used to writing criss-cross , that perhaps you will not be displeased at this for your Byronian , and may put it in your own terms if my short note suits you . Lord Byron had once a vis-a-vis ; I used frequent ly to drive out with him in it . One day , passing the Alfred Club , he asked if I were a member . I said some one had put me down , but as I had never been there , I was going to take my name out . Oh , says he , on no account take out your name . Why V said I. Because there are nine hundred can didates waiting for admission , and I should have taken out my own name , but that I found it would make one of these expectants happy . Only imagine , said he , if you took yours off also , there would be two of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . He then , as we had no auditors , laughed at his own affected misanthropy , which was only put on for the pur pose of making the world in general believe there was something extraordi nary about him , and which he found for many years a great recommendation in that sort of highly-refined society , which is in perpetual want of new and extraordinary excitation . I believe I mean excitement . Adieu . W. G. " I fear my letter is stupid , and has too much parish business , but I hope my next will be more entertaining . " " Naples , April 4th , 1833 . " I scarcely know why I have been so long in answering your amiable let ter , and thanking you for your kind attention about books and booksellers ; for , though I have been frequently ill , and have passed the winter , which has been here remarkably cold , rather comfortably , I have somehow or other writ ten a great deal , and when your letter arrived had just been employing myself , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same memoirs of Sir Walter Scott s residence in Italy which you recommended to my attention . I have made use of the letter from the bookseller you had spoken to so far as to di rect Mr. Hamilton s attention to him with regard to the disposal of my Ro man Topography , but I have not as yet heard the result . Not that I have , indeed , any great hopes of any thing favorable , for he writes that the book sellers are absolutely ruined , and that even has been twice in danger of bankruptcy . M , however , offers to print my book , and to give me half the profits , which is not what I want , as such profits , though guaranteed by the Society of Dilettanti , arc never likely to be great to an author abroad . The odd circumstance is , that though the book was written at the desire of the said society , and they profess high satisfaction at its execution , they do not offer me the 300 which I want , and take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , by the desire of Mr. Lockhart , to beg I /z/ would send him my reminiscences of Sir Walter , because I was the last of his friends . The fact is , that I had generally the care of him while he was in Italy , and though I thought I was going to write only a page or two , I soon found myself writing my twentieth and thirtieth pages , without approaching the end of my materials , which finally reached a fiftieth page , and , considerin &; all circumstances , the whole is by no means so barren of interest as I thought it would have been when I begun the narrative . It contains , even to a certain degree , information as to his future literary projects , which could not have been recorded , I believe , by any other means . " I shall send you a little bit of it with regard to Lord Byron , which I for got to send you before , and you can mention it or not , as it suits your pur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacant by the retreat of Lord Berwick , who is going to England . He wishes to buy it , and the price is only about 3000 , so it is quite wonderful it is not already sold , as the win dows have been renewed . The dowager queen has bought and beautifully fitted up your Villa Gallo , and the Duke of Gallo himself died some two months ago , having left his family not ill provided for . It is hoped Diego Pignatelli will marry the widow . Of the Ricciardis , there is nothing new ; they are well , and always ask most kindly about you . Naples has the advantage of Rome this year in point of company ; but after the Holy Week we are to change sets . To-day is the holy Thursday , when carriages are not permitted in Naples , so I am going on an ass to dine with Lord Hertford at the next house to the Paterna , and I hear he has either juggles or phantasmagoria at night . My pension as vice-chamberlain seems about to be granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would seem so , for the claim is established , and he promises his assistance ; but I am not to be deluded by appearances , and Lady Charlotte Lindsay , who says she backed her applica tion with a roasted turkey and a bottle of well-iced champagne , says she is aware , like Lord Duberley , that fine words butter no parsnips . The ac knowledgment of rny claim proves that I ought to have arrears , and if they did not acknowledge my claims , it might in the end be worse for their own people , and would serve as a precedent to cut them off . Nevertheless , I shall only believe in my pension when I see it . I have written all this while obliged to talk to company , who sit upon me , a penance to which I am very much subjected ; and my house is really become so pretty by the expenditure of only 100 upon it , which has built a portico , and made all the rooms com municate in a suite , besides a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am become a sort of coffee-house for the idle and the nothmg-to-doarians of the place . I believe I shall not get to Rome this year , as my journey de pended on the 300 for my book arriving , and that seems cut off . " Now for Sir Walter : I accompanied him to the convent of La Trinita della Cava , and in going he repeated to me the poem or ballad of Jock of Hazledean . In returning I desired him to let me hear it again , and on express ing my surprise at the clearness of his recollection , he told me he had a most /z/ remarkable memory , and had astonished many by it . On his first introduc tion to Lord Byron , some one ( whose name I forget ) was looking on with wonder at the apparent correctness with which he spoke , and the singular changes in Lord Byron s countenance as he proceeded . He was repeating to the great poet the whole of the poem of Hardyknute , which he then knew by heart , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also refer to a conversation I had with Sir Walter as to why he had left off writ ing poetry . When I asked this question , he said , Because I found Byron beat me ; but I shall now try again . These anecdotes , which may amuse some , are all found in my contribution , which I have sent to Hamilton to give to Mr. Lockhart ; for as the family had requested them of me , I could not well dispose of them to my own advantage , which I was told I might easily do . " I keep a copy , however ; and if Mr. Lockhart does not use my materials , which I think he can hardly reject , as I have taken care to give due honor to his hero , they may appear hereafter separately . I have lately been very idle as to writing ; for the penny magazines afford no encouragement to booksell ers , nor they , in consequence , to me . I hear I am made a member of the French Institute , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sends his best respects to you . I hear of Count Alfred in the newspapers as hunting in Leicestershire : pray give my kindest regards to him . I have also lately seen a print of him on horseback , which is good . Lady Augusta Cov entry and Henry Fox are to be united in the holy bands of matrimony imme diately , at Florence , whence they proceed northward . She is become a very pretty girl , and he has at present a very bad fit of the gout at Rome . The houses at Castelamare are already taken for the summer . Lord Ponsonby was on the point of embarking for Constantinople in the Action , when , the day before yesterday , so violent a storm arose that he is yet on shore . " My servants , who all cherish your memory , hearing me ask about the means of sending this letter to you , desire to kiss your hands , according to the custom of the country . My dogs , horses , and every thing else , remain just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s landau , which is more convenient for my disabled legs . My kind regards to the Contessa de St. M , whom I have heard of sitting silent in a corner in a high cap . /z/ " Naples , Nov. 19th , 1833 . " Your friend , Mr. Bulwer , I have received safe , with his friends ; but not so your book , which , in a box with several things of their own , they have contrived to lose on the way ; so I must put off the gratification I should have had in reading it till somebody here gets it , which may not be for months to come , for books are ages before they arrive in this country . Mr. Bulwer seems , indeed , all you have described ; for , though he has only been here some three or four days , yet we have contrived to get very well acquainted in a very short time . I asked them to breakfast the morning after I received your /z/ letter , and they brought me one at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found they were fond of dogs ; so that the first thing I heard in my outer room , and before I saw any person , was the exclamation , Oh , you dear creature ! addressed to my dog , who went to see who was come . We got on very well , and they ate maccaroni with great success , and positively bought a dog of the same species as mine before they went home , of a black color , which they christened Lusio , and carried off to their lodgings . I have had a note from each of them since , and on Sunday I am to meet them at dinner at Mr. Craven s , for whom I believe you gave them also a letter . I have also told Lady Drummond to invite them to dinner , which she has prom ised to do ; and thus , so far , I hope they will feel satisfied with my little at tentions , bestowed according to your order . " I have made every inquiry as to the sale of books by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertions , I have employed such of my friends as are most fitted for the purpose . There is nothing in the shape of bookgelling in this town ; the libraries are only just tolerated , and their owners can hardly exist . No bookseller here has a correspondent in London , that I can find ; nor do I hear of any purchase of such a book as yours , except the Duke of Cassorano , in the whole city . He immediately thought of making such a book himself , and filling it with princesses of Centola , Tre Cose , Monte Yago , &c.,; &c.; ; but he could give me no assistance , and certainly Naples is not a place for the advancement of literature , so I am unable to execute your commands . You had heard that I was in bad health , and so I am certainly ; but I think not much worse than when you were in Italy , only that my hair is fallen off , and I shall be reduced to baldness or a wig in the course of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Terrick Hamilton just arrived , but going shortly to Koine . He is well and merry ; but when I meet him at dinners , where I die of cold , he is always complaining of heat , and is very amiable . Here , also , is Dr. M G , author of the last novel I read , called The Par son s Daughter . At this moment I received a little work of a few pages from the archbishop upon cats , on the occasion of a cat s mummy brought for him from Egypt by a friend of mine , Dr. Hogg , who is just come from that coun try . The good old soul is really very little altered since you saw him , though he is now ninety-two ; but I can not imagine how the machine is to go on much longer . He desires one thousand loves to you , and I am to take the Bulvver to dine with him shortly , though I fear , if he is not quick at Italian , he will scarcely become very intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it out very well together , for the archbishop will not take the trouble to talk much or long together in French . By-the-by , I ob served to you that my life of Walter Scott in Italy , which I wrote by the desire of Miss Scott , was very entertaining in its way , and I sent it to Mr. L. by Mr. Hamilton . He has never , however , thanked me for it , nor even acknowl edged the receipt of it , nor sent me Sir Walter s works , which he ordered for mo with almost the b.st sentence he uttered that vas intelligible ; and if it /z/ does not appear in the work , it will be really worth publishing , and I shall send it to you . " November 27th . I went with the Bulwer to the archbishop s to dine yes terday . The good old man would be very polite , which I told him to submit to . He showed us several curiosities , and put oft the dinner till four by so doing . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , as he seemed with Bulwer . There was nobody but Cavaliere Venorio , the chief of the botanists here ; and he seemed , also , to get on very well with the Bul wer , who is this day gone to Pompeii , luckily with fine weather . At this moment , in comes the Baron de Billing , the French secretary of embassy , who wishes to know Mr. Bulwer , and I have given him a note of introduction , as I promised . The Baron de Billing has been ten years in London , and is a very clever person , and I think it probable you know him . The Craven s mother has bought and fitted up beautifully your old Villa Gallo , but your oth er house , the Belvidere , remains untenanted since Lord Berwick departed , and will want repairs , as I hear , before it can be habitable again . It is to be sold for only 3000 , and Lady Drummond has given over 10,000 for the villa , or cake house , of Mr. Dupont , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four of the Yacht Club here , with their ships , which help to enliven the scene , and we expect Lord Anglesey with his . I have seen Lady Harriet and her sister , as also , another day , her aunt ; she is so altered since I knew her as a girl that I really should not have known her . They live at Brettagna , but in such retirement that I have never seen any of them out . The Acton Palace is so far finished that they receive company , and give dinners and balls with great success . It is quite astonishing how many people come to Na ples , and how the people , whom I knew when I was a young man in London , appear yet unexhausted , so that I have very often my whole morning taken up by visitors . Matthias , aged eighty-one , is rather younger than ever , but complains that he sees nobody .

Cariati and Casarano desire mille choses to you . /z/ " Naples , January 22 , 1834 . " I am now roasting myself close to a large fire in my own house , waiting dinner for Dr. Hogg , a portentous name , you will say , but belonging to an ex ceedingly benevolent and amiable physician , who , after residing here for some years , is just returned from a tour in Syria and Egypt , with your friend Mr. Baillie . Though I am roasting , the necessity for it is only produced by my own cold nature , for a finer summer s day was never seen than this has been , and Doctor Watson , who is just arrived from Paris , where he has been five or six years , says he had no idea of the difference till he found himself again in Italy . He says that , except the three glorious days , lie has never seen /z/ the weather so fine since he left Naples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . My first object was to tell you that my man , Gennarino , who is only just saved by the English doctors from death , has been twice to see the boy in question , and that he is quite well and happy . He has fine , light-colored hair , which could scarcely be seen for the magnificent cap , made ornamental , which he wore on his head . He appears about six or seven years old , and is very lively , and they say very clever , and learns every thing with quickness . He is , moreover , remarkably clean and well clothed , and , as Gen narino says , is treated quite like a signore di gualita e parla Francese , and is so well satisfied with his present treatment , and with those who have the care of him , that he ran away and hid himself when he found the inquiries were made for himself , for fear that my man might be sem to take him away . There is always a drawback to every story , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defect in one leg , which may be perhaps in the hip joint , but is called in the foot , and it is said that Ischia waters will cure him . I confess , from the account , the cure seems to me doubtful , but in the mean time the boy is perfectly well in health , and by means of a shoe with a thicker sole , fatto dal meglio scarpayo di Napoli con molta cura , he runs about just as well as any other boy of his age . As far as care goes , therefore , he has all you can wish , and his health is perfect . A letter is just arrived for his moth er from the family , which I shall direct and send , as the letters sent before had probably failed from want of superscription . " So much , therefore , for your commission , which I hope you will find sat isfactory . I have consulted Casarano about the sale of your book here , and I find any attempt would be quite useless , as nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor will any one buy a book of any kind . I have heard only of four persons any where who read or buy . Two live in the mountains of the frontier , and thus smuggle into the state the few books they can ob tain ; the third is a Neapolitan cavalierc , who receives books of classic learn ing from Germany ; and the fourth is the prefect of a provincial town , who longs in vain for books , but is forced to go without them . I shall keep a sharp look-out for Colonel Hughes , who , I suppose , is one of Lord Dinorben s family . " You have done me a great kindness by sending me the Conversations , of which I have hitherto seen only detached portions , which , by-the-by , are so full of talent and of shrewd observation , that I can not help congratulating the memory of Lord Byron on the fortunate circumstance which left his ideas in such good keeping , that they have been matured and perfected before they saw the light . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no Homer to celebrate them . The truth is , you see things in a much better , and fairer , and juster light yourself than Byron ; you know more of the world than he did ; and , moreover , it is not part of your system to make yourself seem in ill humor when you are not so . " I beg to observe that , in The Conversations , I reverence you infinitely /z/ more than the poet ; indeed , as I have more respect for Homer than for Aga memnon , I have had this in my mind whensoever I have read the extracts from your work , but you have probably had the same feeling repeated many times , and better explained by a hundred literary admirers . As to Mr. L , I fear much that he is not good for much , and I am certain he got the work , for I sent it to Mr. William Hamilton , who gave it with a request that he would not omit a word of it in printing . I kept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to you . There are no remarks except such as tend to explain away and ren der less ridiculous the total want of classical taste and knowledge of the hero , in a situation full of classical recollections , and which I have added , that I might not seem insensible to his real merits . They were written for the fam ily , and by the desire of Miss Scott herself , and therefore nothing offensive could have been inserted ; and when I had finished the anecdotes , I was sur prised myself at the number of circumstances I had recollected , and perceived that the account of the last days of so distinguished a person was really inter esting , when told with strict regard to truth . The circumstances of his ill ness having changed his mind , or deprived it of its consistency , which I my self much doubt , might be judged of from his way of treating the subjects of conversation which presented themselves , and this alone would be of conse quence to his numerous friends . " I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be displeased at my manner of representing him , and , at all events , I have re peated what he said , and related what he did in Italy , in a way that satisfied every one here who was the witness of his sayings and doings . However , I shall send the copy to you , and if the Life is published by the said L , without use and acknowledgment of my papers , the best way will be to sell it to the bookseller , and to let it come before the public . I will affix , or rather prefix , Miss S s request that I would write it , and will suppose that the original has been lost or mislaid , in consequence of her premature de cease . In this case , I shall beg of you to make the most advantageous bar gain you can for a poor author under your protection . " My book on Roman Topography , which will , I am persuaded , if it ever sees the light , gain me credit , still continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton and Co. and Vyse are interesting them selves , and the University of Cambridge offers to take one hundred copies , but I hear of no results at present . Mr. Bulwer has written to his man of book selling in London , after having read my work , to recommend it , but the an swer is not yet returned . The times are bad , or , as my royal mistress would have expressed it , O trumpery , Moses , for O tempora , &c.; I go on scribbling at you to the end of my paper , which you must rejoice to see ar rived . " I dine with the archbishop to-day , who is well and merry , and sends his love . Lady H is leaving Naples for Rome immediately . I suppose , at the end of March , I shall see her again at Rome .

She will now have a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the latter part of his life . " " Naples , 30th January , 1834 . " I have scarcely had time to overlook a copy of my Scottiana before Mr. Bulwer sets out for England . It is written by the Sticchini mentioned there in , who does not understand English , and therefore I fear blunders may have escaped me and him . I have an abominable headache , so that I can scarcely sit up to write , and I can say little more than what occurs to me as right . " With regard to the MS. , if Mr. L has got the original , and has used it entirely in his Life of Sir Walter , nothing is to be done , I suppose ; but if he has not got it , has lost it , and does not publish it instanter , I am for selling it to the highest bidder . In my own copy I have the portrait , most luckily like , in a good sense , and two Roman caricatures mentioned . " The Galera , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castle of Bracciano , which I took while sitting talking with Lord Blessington ; a view from the window of the lake , which I took while talking with Sir Walter ; and the stair-case in the court , which I did for him : but these I do not send , as I hear London booksellers can no longer deal with plates . " I am too headachy to write more . WILLIAM GELL . " Lady Harriet is gone to Rome . " " Naples , March 9th , 1834 . " I feel as if I were going to write you a long letter , and to become very troublesome . Since you wrote to me on the 17th of February , you will have received from Mr. Bulwer the MS. of the notes on Sir AValter Scott , and may have , perhaps , disposed of it to some bookseller in London , so that it no long er rests with me to decide on what should bo its fate . I was asked , on the day I sent the original , why I sent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S had asked me to write it ; but that I was totally unacquainted with the gentleman , or he with me , and we had no friend in common . " The truth is , that he ought to have been thankful for the information , and as the conversations chiefly took place in a carriage , these circumstances can not possibly have been learned from any other quarter . I dare say he thanked Mr. Hamilton , but as he thinks he has better information elsewhere , it is doing him no harm to keep my information for my own use ; and when I consider that the whole about Rhodes can only have been said to me , and that I am the only person who could hAve given Sir Walter the information he wanted on that subject , I must think that interesting , and I could mention many other tilings in the MS. that could only be related by myself . " However , I will beg of you to make a few changes , which I will write on a separate sheet , for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to wafer /z/ into the MS. at the proper places the few words about the publication at the beginning and end , and a few anecdotes which have recurred to my memory since the notes were written . I can not but imagine that you will be disap pointed on reading the work , because it will be found so much shorter than you expected , the whole being purposely as much condensed as possible . You will therefore not be surprised if it does not produce in the market the respectable sum you have imagined as its value . I am not at all surprised at the wish to print it as if from another supposed hand , for I have seldom , out of the sixteen or seventeen publications I have made of maps and books , suc ceeded in securing to myself the fame of any merit they may possess . " You would be surprised at the catalogue of literary thefts by which I have suffered . Yet , per grazia del cielo , I find myself very frequently cited , both in England and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched upon ; and so much for that business . One shall be a great man among the little boys some years after one s death . " Mr. Craven , with whom and the Patcrno , and the Satriano Filangieris , &c.,; I have been to dine with Miss Whyte to-day at Portici , says he will get ready for you by the time appointed a story for your Book of Beauty . Pray tell me whether a translation of a very queer old Portuguese book , The Travels of the Infante Don Pedro to the Seven Quarters of the Globe , would not do for your work 1 It is very strange , and quite original , and the prince goes , among other places , to the court of Prester John of Abyssinia . It might be divided , perhaps , into two or three parts , if it be too long , which I really think it is . Would you like some of the old Spanish Moorish ballads translated 1 for example , any addressed to the beautiful Zayda , as yours is a Book of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things when I was younger and more romantic , before age and infirmity had put an end to all poetic illusions . " Mr. Rothwell , by-the-by , the great painter who was sent to me by Lord S , and whom I have sent in a letter to you this morning , says , on look ing over my book of the Alhambra , that a Moorish Annual or Album would be one of the prettiest things in the world , and might , with good engravings , become a successful work ; and in such a case , the Moorish ballads would come in well . Nothing , certainly , would be half so picturesque or so beautiful ; but , like every thing of the kind , it could not be carried on with interest for more than two or three years . I shall see , in your Book of Beauty , what sorts of subjects are fitted for it , and hope to be able to do something in some way or other to suit it . A little bit of an adventure , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but we shall see . I don t think myself capable of exciting much interest without having recourse to the pencil to aid my muse , whether poetic or historic . Lady H is gone , but it is possible I may see her at Rome , where I think of being on the 1st of April , and of re maining till the 1st of June . My house there is let to the 25th of March to Mr. Brooke Greville , who is perhaps known to you . We have floods of com- /z/ pany , and sometimes , between Lady Strachan and Lady Acton , two private plays in a week . We had three Italian comedies , like the French vaudevilles , last nio-ht at Lady Acton s , and they were got up by Neapolitans with very great success . " The young Duke of St. Theodore , as a shy lover , won great applause , and Donna Olympia Colonna , and the mistress of the house , the Duchess of Mi randa , and the Duchess of Cajanello , with many others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only Englishman engaged , but his son is expected soon . The family of La Feronays , as usual , form the heroes and heroines of all the French pieces , and sing and act in perfection . " The king and all the court generally come to all these great entertainments , and , besides being very expensive , they last till about two hours after midnight . Besides those amusements , we have tremendous dinners at Lady Drummond s and Lord Hertford s , with assemblies in the evening , to most of which I go in my wheeling chair , by way of seeing the world in my old age , and must say I find every one as kind and compassionate as one can have either right or hopes to expect in these hard times . Craven , as you know , has bought a large convent in the mountains , near Salerno , which he has fitted up with every sort of convenience , and where he receives in the summer all comers , four or five ladies at a time , with gentlemen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers and natives . If you ever return to this country , you will be amused by a trip to his valley . " I have sent you , as I said before , Mr. Rothwell , the new Sir Thomas Lawrence , and I think a very clever person ; so much so , that he is quite big enough to help himself in the world . But I mean to send you a most benevo lent and good sort of person , not much known to fame , with the ugly name of Dr. Hogg , who has been here some years , and is just returned from Egypt and the Holy Land , where saints did live and die . He makes the most won derful faces , and has the strongest action with his hands you ever saw , and Mr. Hill used to ask him to dinner to witness them ; but he will tell you how the world goes on here better than most people , and as you have round you many men of rank and fashion , you will , not dislike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose merit consists in a kind heart , and a very benevolent deposition to do all lie can for the benefit of his fellow-creatures . Speaking of which , ( Jennarino is become a great friend of the family , and the child in Strada di Chiaja , and sees them almost every day . He says they are all very well , and hecm pleased at his coining to see how well the boy is taken care of . I forgot to say that Doctor Hogg will not torment you much , as ho is only going to England for a short time on business . Our Duke of Derby shire is in Sicily , and very much recovered from his lameness . He is very kind-hearted , and in the only person I have seen for years who knows any thing of my family , which I don t believe flourishing .

So , with kind regards to the count , and thanks to Lord Durham , &c.,; /z/ " Lady Blessington is requested to insert in my MS. , after the last of the notes on Rhodes , the following record of a conversation with Sir Walter re specting the Stone of Odin : " On our return to the Palazzo Caramanico , we passed Mr. Laing Mason in the street , and this brought to Sir Walter s mind the refutation of the antiquity of Macpherson s Ossian by Mr. Laing , who had shown that the names of the heroes were taken from the map , I think , of the channel between the Isle of Skye and the main land . One of these names . said he , happens to have been given in the last century , and the date of that is well known . Mr. Laing knew those countries well , and his proof was striking : and satisfactory . I think he said Mr. Laing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once went to see him , and carried over in my boat a fagot of sticks for the peas in his garden , which were reckoned there a great curiosity . He said , however , that elders would grow , and that the face of the country might be improved by them . From this he was led to compare the once flourishing state of those islands with their present forlorn appearance , and observed that , to a people from the farthest north , these might perhaps have seemed the abodes of the blessed . They were certainly , said he , esteemed holy , and there was a great circular building like Stonehenge not far from Kirkwall . which proved the importance of the place . Saying this , he searched for and presented to me a pencil draw ing of the temple , which I preserve , and highly value . It is entitled , Stand ing Stones of Stenhouse in Orkney , and has on the back inscribed the name of J. Keene . Esq .. by whom it was probably drawn . Sir Walter mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perforated , and afterward descanted on the ordeal by which persons accused of crime were deemed in nocent if capable of passing through this species of aperture in very remote ages . " Lady B. is requested to insert the following passage where Sir Walter has been speaking of his acquaintance here : " Before Sir Walter Scott quitted Naples , he made the acquaintance of Mr. Ball , a gentleman advantageously known to the society of that city as the au thor of two poems , of which the baronet was pleased to express his approba tion . His amiable feeling , on every occasion , led him to assist and encourage all younsjer authors , and he seemed totally devoid of every spark of that little ness and jealousy which sometimes actuates even the most illustrious and es tablished literati . " " March 10 ( 1S34 ) . " I have just received a letter from Mr. Bulwer. who writes that his first visit in London was to Ottley and Saunders , booksellers , and that he has suc ceeded in selling them my work , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have attended to my wants before he had settled himself , and rested from the fatigues of his journey . He writes me a kind letter to thank me for my little attentions at Naples . I did for him what you ordered that is , set him a going , by presenting him to the best people , or praising him as he deserved ; after which he made his own way , of course , with success . I wish my means permitted me to be more useful . By-the-by , a Mr. Rey nolds sent by you seems very angry with me , but I can not help it . I have no legs to go a visiting , and never go out but borne by two servants . So , if you send me any one in a letter , pray tell them that I am a cripple , and can only be useful to them if they will take the trouble of coming to my house , as I can not make calls . It only makes enemies , if the people will not recollect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , I think , ought not to be omitted , about Sir Walter , and don t be angry at all the trouble I give you . I believe I can say that Craven has already begun something in verse for your work . He will , I have no doubt , do it well as to execution , and as to story , he knows the history of all the odd things which have happened in Italy from the most remote period of the darkest ages . I have just discovered that I must have a little separate slip of paper for my last Scott anecdote , as the list about Odin s Stone does not come at the end . " March 12 . Your maid s child is well and merry , but is to be taken to Ischia in the summer for this defect in the joints ; he is very well taken care of , and delighted to see Gennaro . The archbishop is quite well , and not a day older than when you left him . W. G. " " Naples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just returned from Rome , and agreeably surprised to find a long letter from you , which I expected the less , as I had not answered that which Messrs . Errington and Lyne Stevens , or Stephens , brought for me to the Holy City ; for there 1 have done all that could be done under the ex isting circumstances , when all the milords and my ladies were disappear ing , and leaving Rome and the Colosseum to their own resources . The best thing I could do for them was to sell them to Lady Coventry , with a request that they might be treated on a par with the most favored nations , and to see that she executed her part of the treaty . I believe they will tell you I was as good as a grandmother to them , and I think it ended by their becoming guests at Coventry almost every day in the week . Moreover , I dare say Lady Goodwin will arrive at Naples in a few days , and take them again under her protection here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find her a very useful and a very agreeable acquaintance . " I told you it had not rained for three months at Rome , and till the last few days I spent there , every thing was as yellow and burned up as if it had been August instead of May . " I find this kingdom quite green , and every thing in a most flourishing con dition , after that worn-out , misgoverned , unfortunate representative of the /z/ mistress of the world . I found here Craven , on the point of setting out for his convent of Penta ; and I have scarcely seen any of my acquaintance yet , though Mr. Temple invited me for to-day , and I shall dine with the archbishop to-morrow . I have been so perpetually ill at Rome , that I am inclined to de sert it , and as books will no longer sell in my line , it will be quite as well for my finances . " You have had a great deal of trouble in fishing for a decent escape from the business of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not wish myself to do any thing disagreeable to the family , but I think it very ill-judged of them not to place every thing in its true light , especially when I had suppressed every thing which might have been put in a ludicrous light , out of respect and regard to Sir Walter . They can not revoke his two last novels , so it will be out of their power to get rid of the facts , while they lose all the merit they might claim for stating the case as it was . Besides , the whole philosophy of the business becomes tainted by that want of candor which spoils their book , without hiding the truth . They have shown the man as he was in his glory ( we will suppose ) ; it was equally their duty to the public and to posterity to show him in his decline . The whole is a dull piece of affected piety , which vitiates whatever they may publish of him ; but , as far as I am concerned , I only care about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was so little worth recollecting or writing , except as the sequel to some thing of more consequence , and the winding up of the story . I believe I dis covered , during the time I was writing , that any biography of any contempo rary must be amusing . And this brings to my mind your recommendation to write an autobiography of Sir William Gell . There is no doubt , if one dared to write all one knew and all one had witnessed , the book would indeed sell , and be a great favorite for a time ; but I doubt whether the author would find himself in a very agreeable position in society after the publication . By liv ing partly in London and partly abroad , I have certainly met with , and have known a great variety of personages , not to mention Dr. Parr , and the queen , of whose life and manners I could certainly make very good fun and much amusement ; but I must treat them in a very different manner to that which I measured my account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a neighbor who often desires me , and urges me , to write my life , but I really do not see the possibility of making it true and entertaining without commit ting half my acquaintance . I have some sixty or seventy letters of her most gracious majesty , Queen Caroline ; and , Mein Gott ! what curious things they are , and how rightly it would serve the royal family , supposing they had not quarreled with her , to publish their wife and cousin s correspondence , as they have cheated me out of my pension . By no means , however , publish my Scottiana , as you seem to think that L is inclined to behave well about it , though his reasoning is poor , and false , and inconclusive , as a history of Rome would be which finished at the Antonius s , or one of Bonaparte which ended at the taking of Berlin . Speaking of which , I dined in company with /z/ the Prince of Musignano , at Rome , the other day , who married a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull as the prince himself seemed an imated and interested in every subject . And so my paper is ending before I have finished my story . I will find a Spanish , or Arabian-Moorish historicoromantic ballad for you , and I will set about Matthias to-morrow , who will dis claim all knowledge of poetry in Italian , but who will most probably end by sending you what you want . I forgot to tell you that Mr. Errington and Co. are here , for they overtook me at Mola , as they traveled post , and I with my own horses . So we dined together , and set out together the next morning ; but as my said horses had only been at Naples some twelve hours before , they have been indulged in rest , and I have not seen your friends here yet . Mr. Errington said he had written to you . Lady H I saw at Rome with Lord B s aunt .

I don t know whether you knew poor Mr. Coote , a young man of Wiltshire , and son of Sir Eyre . He had a yacht here , and is just returned from a voyage to Greece . After this , he would steer his ship in a storm of rain to Paestum , and then dine in his wet clothes ; the consequence of which was , that he died in a few days . " " Naples , July , 1834 . " Your two books of Byron and of Beauty arc at length arrived , and I re turn you my most hearty thanks for the kind present . " I see by the book that the ladies are sometimes only very slenderly attach ed to the letter-press , like the unpaid attaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , one of my Arab or Spanish ballads may be attached to the next lady you have in an Oriental costume , who may be called Zayda , as well as by any other name equally sweet-smelling . This reflection gives me some hopes that what I have written may be of use to you , though it is terribly prosaic , because I want to prove that the world is deceived in calling the whole of that a romance which is in great part true , and of which the circumstances are very peculiar . I think I have proved what I wished , and that , as it all ends in specimens of Spanish and Arab poetry , it is not too heavy for your work . It is also very poor in style ; but if you knew how many people that have nothing to do call upon me in a day , so that the prose is all written in talkative company , and the verse with a pencil , as one takes an evening drive in a carriage on the Strada Nuova , you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" If I had thought it sufficiently serious , I would have terminated by a par allel passage in my own life which I suggested . I received a letter thus : Dear Gell , I send you my friend Mr. ; you will find him the greatest bore and the most disputatious brute you ever knew . Pray ask him to din ner , and get any one you know of the same character to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , and I found him in every way answer ing to the character . Pray add or subtract any thing you like from what I send you . I see plainly that it is not quite right , though the intention is good , and I have given a full proportion of love , mixed with a proper degree of blood shed , which the genius of the time requires . Pray also correct in the verse , according to the fashion of the day , the words opprest or oppress d , and such like words , to your taste , and if you think it all a bore , as very likely you may find it , you may put it in the fire altogether , with my compliments . " I have no doubt , however , Craven will send you some sort of Italian story of the Middle Ages worth having . He is at Penta , his country house , and can have nothing else to do , when tired of gardening . I have written to him to have it ready , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post , is , that you may know that you are sure of some thirty pages of my little scribble , and something from Craven also .

Young Craven vows a contribution from himself or his wife , Mdlle . Pauline la Feronays , but he is so much engaged in making love that I dare say he will write nothing .

" " Naples , August 6 , 1834 . " I have written to you so often lately that you will begin to think me a nuisance . But I now write on business , to introduce to you my little Essay on the Romantic History of Spain , which will , I believe , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his excursion to the summit of Mont Blanc , and as much celebrated for the interesting and unaffected account which he has published of his ascent and descent , which makes you think you know the mountain as well as he does . He will give you an account of all that is going on at Naples , what we are doing , and who is going to be married . The Ricciardi send their loves to you . I saw the two girls at old mother R s , at the Villa Rugina , on the Vomero , the other night , where they sang , and two nights ago I saw them again , and had a long conversation with their fa ther at a ball , concert , and supper , given by Dominico Catalano , the great law yer , on St. Dominic s day , at which all Naples was present . There Madame Nicolas , who yet seemed to retain all her beauty , sang , but with perhaps less voice than formerly . The other sister has become a regular large dowager , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has departed like a mist on the hills of Morveri . The whole world came from Palermo the other day the St. Theodoros , Actons , kings , princes , and queen ; so that Naples , which had been deserted , begins to be inhabited again ; and at Catalano s there seemed to be between three and four hundred persons , many of whom jigged away just as if the thermometer had not been up to eighty , and afterward ate as if there had been no fear of an hereafter . Coriali , Pepe , Filangieri , are well and merry . " Torlonia , now Duca di Ceri , was to have been married to a granddaugh ter of the Paterno , a Mdllc. de Moncada , but they quarreled , and broke off the match . Craven is living at Penta , and receiving company , having estab lished a house with twenty beds , stables , and all that tends to reception . I have been there once this summer , and am going again with Lady Coventry . The archbishop is very well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and desires loves to you . I go and dine there about once in ten days . " The Actons have finished their house , and live very hospitably and agree ably in it , and give balls , dinners , and plays . Young Craven marries Mdlle. /z/ Pauline la Feronays on the 28th of August . The happy couple have each a rent-roll of trois mille francs , but K. Craven will give 600 a year , so they will have about 900 to begin with , and I hope they will contrive and be pru dent with it . Your old Belvidere is to be sold , and the queen will , if you like also , sell you the Villa Gallo : the Belvidere for about 3000 . I could find no earlier method of sending you the Spanish Arabic article , but I hope it will be in time .

Mr. Auldjo has in his Constantinople journal a beauty or two of that country , whose faces he copied with an instrument , and they are not only good in themselves , but very different from any thing European , and might consequently be very useful in your book , and prevent a sort of nationality that will be observed when all the artists are from one country .

" Gennaro sees your maid s child very often , and he is well/ " Penta , June 23d , 1835 . " It was not so much because I had been ill myself , as because I had heard that you were ill , that I have delayed writing so long . I trusted that I should get some fresh intelligence about you , and from day to day put off writing ac cordingly . I conclude , from your silence on the subject , that you have not been much indisposed ; though it is not for me , who have been six months laid up , to glory in the strength of my constitution , which broke up , like the ice on the Neva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a prey to all the diseases into which gout has been known to resolve itself when it is fair ly tired out with the common symptoms and pains . Among these , dropsy is generally the most prominent and the most fatal ; and the next is asthma , with which two agreeable companions I have , since November , passed my time ; sometimes suffering from one , and often both the complaints united . " I found my talent for sleeping in company much inflproved , and I can give you no better specimen of it than these two last lines , where you will observe the words united and very much disguised by having fallen asleep three /z/ times while I was writing the following sentence : I had turned up the shortest road to Penta . " I will let it stand as it is , for it will explain to you why I could not write before , and why I might as well not have written now . I cease writing , or write nonsense , or the pen goes on scribbling , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , three hours later . Well , the symptoms of asthma and drop sy continued , and I could not lie down horizontally for fear of suffocation . Nevertheless , with four doctors Dr. Strange , Dr. Heath , Dr. Knight , and Dr. Watson I am alive , and one might almost say recovering , as fast as possible , from the physic and the disease . The most curious symptoms are the going dead asleep all at once , and the dreaming , when wide awake , about eating , and helping my friends to eatables . I gave Lord Aberdeen a large slice of cold ham this morning about five o clock , but when I came to repeat it , I found he had no plate . I rung the bell , and by the time the servant really came , I was sensible there was neither ham nor any other eatable in the bed . This sort of thing happens twenty times in the twenty-four hours , and sometimes produces the most ridiculous combinations . However , the other day I was alone at Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some prints in a book , when , falling asleep , I pulled over my chair in trying to save myself , and fell on the pavement in a manner which makes the idea of a repetition of my gambols frightful . Not having had time to save myself with my hands , I fell with my weight on the floor a most abominable crash and the hip-bone , of course , and all that side , suffered most severely ; nor am I well of that accident , which has much retarded the cure of the original illness . The only wonder was that it was no worse . " I was ordered to move about a little , which I do with grief and pain ; and am now at Craven s , at Penta , thirty-five miles from Naples , to which place I came on a sort of trading voyage , beginning with a visit of four clays to Lady Barbara , who is at Castelamare . I stay here four days , and then take two more with the Ponsonbys , and then , after some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , changing Lady F. Barbara for Mrs. Locke or her daugh ter , perhaps at Castelamare . I give you the history of my life , as it is a good way of letting you judge of my health . You see that I might do tol erably well were my one hundred and forty diseases curable . Dr. Heath , who is with the Ponsonbys , seems , I think , to be satisfied that I shall shortly be better , and possibly much better than usual ; and that my grand climacteric , which usually falls at the age of sixty-three , has been hastened by length of illness , and fallen upon me at fifty-eight instead , after which the constitution might change for the better . I thought , till now , that the age of sixty-three was required for the change , but he says no . So you see , my dear Lady Blcssington , I have given you a long statement of my case , and the results , as far as we know them You tell me of your bad weather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to be in Siberia , for I have at this moment a tolerable fire , by which I am too cold ; and without , it is raining cats and dogs , /z/ and seems likely to continue to do so . The consequence is , the most wonder ful verdure I ever beheld , the vines in unusually large leaf , and the Indian corn , flax , and hemp shooting into thickets below them . I never saw any thing so verdant as the world is here , whenever we have an hour or two of sun to enjoy so green and beautiful a scene . What is become of the English I know not ; the spring was forgotten , the season for summer is half over , and the winter yet remains , and the milords seem to have forgotten to come to Italy . There may be three families of no note at Sorrento , and about as many threaten to come to Castelamare for the month of July , so that the houses are for the present empty . The Salsa has , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ; and as far as her own account of things goes , she finds no difference , but all goes on well ; at all events , she is not the person to cry stinking fish , and would say that harmony existed as long as possible . " We have at Craven s a tremendous large old convent , with cells for as many as can be got to fill them ; and Craven himself , out of perverseness , is as hospitable and as open to all comers here , as he sometimes appears the contrary at Naples , where society might be had without the trouble or expense of maintaining it . I am glad you have seen Dr. Hogg ; he writes remarka bly well , and will , I doubt not , make a pretty book from very scanty materi als . When he was here he used to go crazy on the subject , which , I hope , will not be the case in London .

" As to that ugly old abbot , I suppose he had imbibed a false impression , and never could get rid of it. * " My romance has not advanced a step . I thought , during my illness , I could at least have written that ; but that is kistoria , and requires facts and dates- ; and I never could guide my pen , as you will have said many times be fore you get to the end of this long and dull letter . A thousand kindnesses to Count Alfred , and the young lady , your sister . I hope your young friend will return pleased with Naples . Faithfully yours , W. GELL .

B. M. s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plen ipotentiary to the King of the Two Sicilies , and subsequently at the Ottoman Porte , died at Rome the 29th of March , 1828 . His first work was published in 1794 , " A Review of the Gov ernments of Sparta and Athens , " 8vo . In 1798 he published " The Satires of Persius , " translated ; in 1805 , " Academical Questions , " 4to ; in 1810 , in conjunction with Robert Walpole , " Herculanensia , " &c.,; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 4to , " An Essay on a Punic Inscription found in the Isl and of Malta ; " in 1818 , in 4to , " Odin , " a Poem ; and in 1824 , " Origines , or Remarks on the Origin of several Empires , States , and Cities , " 2 vols. 8vo . He also printed , but not for sale , a re markable work , entitled " ( Edipus Judaicus , " of very anti-Chris tian tendencies , reducing Scriptural histories to mere astronom ical allegories . In 1811 , Byron , in a letter to his friend Hodgson , says : " I have gotten a book by Sir William Drummond , printed but not /z/ published , entitled ( Edipus Judaicus , in which he attempts to prove the greater part of the Old Testament an allegory , particu larly Genesis and Joshua . He professes himself a Theist in the preface , and handles the literal interpretation very roughly . " * Byron was then in his twenty-third year , and no doubt the veteran Theist s erudition was not thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much unhappiness may not the author of the erudite infidel work of this accomplished writer have to answer for , even in the single instance I refer to ? Lady Blessington makes frequent mention in her letters and diaries of Sir " William Drummond as a profound scholar , whose classical lore was united with scientific knowledge of various kinds in modern literature , mineralogy , chemistry , and astron omy . His conversation was not only erudite , but brilliant and playful . He had the imagination of a man of original poetical genius ; a capacity fit for a philosopher , a statesman , or a meta physician . He was a polished , high-minded gentleman , more over , with all the politcssc de la viellc cour . Sir William Drummond and his lady were of very opposite tastes . He passed his days , and the greater portion of his nights , in reading or writing . The tables , chairs , sofas , and even the floors were loaded with books . " He seldom saw Lady Drum mond except at dinner , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She passed , as she passes still , her time in the duties of an elaborate toilet , paying or receiving visits , and play ing with her lap-dog . A strange wife for one of the most in tellectual men of his day ! and yet this dissimilarity produced no discord between them ; for she was proud of his acquire ments , and he was indulgent to her less spirit ucllc tastes . " f It might be a question difficult to answer whether " the most intellectual man of Europe " benefited his species more by eru dition turned against Christianity , than the lady " of less spirituelle tastes , " though occupied occasionally with the duties of an elaborate toilet , but habitually devoted to works of charity , pro fuse in her liberality , and making use of her vast wealth , as she /z/ did in Naples , for the relief of the poor and the distressed , served her fellow-creatures . " When Lady Blessington met Sir " William for the last time at Rome , he was then evidently verging fast toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , he carne to see her at her hotel . His death-stricken , pallid features , the utter feebleness and extraordinary emaciation of his frame , shocked her . Pie was taken from his carriage in a chair by his servants ; and as he was thus conveyed into her salon , she was forcibly reminded of the sitting statue of Voltaire , executed shortly before his death , which is placed in the vestibule of the Theatre Frangais at Paris . His mental faculties remained unimpaired . His con versation was the same as ever delightful to listen to . " He is conscious , " says her ladyship , " that the King of Ter rors is fast approaching , and awaits his presence with all the dig nified composure of a philosopher of old . He spoke to me of his approaching end with calmness ; said he should have liked to have had time to finish the work in which he is engaged ; and observed that it was a blessing for which he was penetrated with gratitude to the Most High , that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled him to bear , if not to forget , the physical sufferings entailed by disease . " Speaking of his approaching end , he said , There is some thing in Rome , with its ruins , and the recollections with which it is fraught , that reconciles one to decay and death . The in evitable lot of all things seems here so strongly brought before one , that the destiny of an individual is merged in that of the scene around him . " It was not long before Lady Blessington s fears for her friend were realized . In May , 1828 , she visited his grave in the En glish burying-ground in Rome . The massive pyramid of Caius Sextus cast its shadows over the resting-places of Shelley , Keats , and Drummond ; but the remains of Drummond were to be re moved to Scotland in the course of a few months . The fair pil grim who visited his grave thought of the happy hours passed in his society , the brilliant conversation of that highly-gifted /z/ man , the deep reflections she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ " The English in Italy , " from 1820 to 1829 , acquainted with Naples , the resident Inglesi of Naples especially , can not fail to remember the celebrated abbatc , an ecclesiastic not renowned for his learning , remarkable for amenity of manners , or agreeableness of appearance or address ; not venerated much for sanctity , or sought after for the excellence of his example , the purity of his morals , and the influence of his life and conversation before men in his spiritual character , but distinguished for a sort of mysterious prestige an apprehension of his power over people in high places , in several courts , and in various Continental cap itals a nondescript influence seldom exercised for any good-na tured purpose , and courted even in the best society on account of the fear with which the unbridled license of his tongue in spired it . The abbe had to be petted , caressed , abundantly fed , and propitiated with good dinners by all new-comers of distinc tion and of discretion . In Naples particularly , and in some other Continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among parvenus and hangers-on of great men in power or authority . There was nothing in his education , his natural position , his antecedents , or his habits , to conciliate men s favorable opinion of his companionable qualities . In the latter part of 1821 , when I first met him , he was , I think , upward of sixty-eight years of age , low of stature , exceedingly bulky , unwieldy , and ungainly in his movements . His features were large and heavy , coarse and vulgar ; his complexion was of an obfuscated , lurid red , with a predominance of the purple of the grape in it . The ex pression of his face was all animal . His look was cunning , and there was a leering , frolicksome twinkle always in it after din ner , that contrasted unpleasantly with his age and dilapidated appearance . His head was enormously large ; and his neck , extremely short and thick , was always buried in a profuse quan tity of cravat of a dingy hue . The head and trunk merging into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded one of the con formation of some of the larger lizards . His clothes , generally bedaubed with snuff , hung on his large person as if they had been pitched about him casually and carelessly by an old serv ant of his Pococurante , as great an oddity as his master . In Naples , his intimate relations of friendship with the min ister Medici , and the terms of acquaintance on which he was with the old king Ferdinand , gave an importance to his " unde fined and undefinable position in society , " which contributed very much to an influence exercised over it by him that was certainly one more of fear than love . The abbe was said to have a pension from the Neapolitan government , and an annual stipend also from some official source in England , and for some public services that were of a very private nature . He had been , at a very early age , a chaplain to a Neapolitan embassador in London about the time of the marriage of the Prince Regent with Mrs. Fitzherbert , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage ceremony to the young chaplain of the Neapolitan embassador . I have heard this rumor mentioned in the presence of the abbe , and it remained not only uncontradicted by him , but so far acquiesced in , at least , as to leave an impression that he knew the priest by whom the marriage was celebrated. * In the second volume of " The Memorials and Correspondence of Charles James Fox , " by Lord John Russell , we have the prin principal circumstances related of the Prince of Wales s marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert . First comes a letter of Mr. Fox to the prince , in the strongest terms dissuading him from the rumored intention of the marriage , dated Dec. 10 , 1785 ; next follows a reply of " the true prince " and truth-loving heir-apparent , dated the 19th of the same month , solemnly denying the rumor that " there not only is , but never was , any ground for these reports lohich have of late been so maliciously circulated . " Then comes Lord John Russell s statement , that ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had married Mrs. Fitzherbert. /z/ The marriage , it is stated by Lord John , was performed in. private by a clergyman of the Church of England , in the man ner prescribed by the Book of Common Prayer , and the certifi cate , dated December 21 , 1785 , was attested by two witnesses . This is only half the truth . It would have been no satisfaction to Mrs. Fitzherbert s scruples to have had the marriage cere mony performed by a clergyman not belonging to her church , unless the ceremony had been previously performed by a Roman Catholic clergyman ; and I have been assured by the late Mr. Thomas Savory , of Sussex Place , Regent s Park , the confiden tial and long-loved friend of the Duke of Sussex , that he knew of a certainty that the ceremony had been performed by a Ro man Catholic priest who was connected with one of the foreign embassies in London , and who thought it prudent to fly the country after the marriage ceremony had been performed . Lord Brougham , in his : Historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Fitzherbert was a Roman Catholic ; sincerely at tached to the religion of her forefathers , she refused to purchase a crown by conforming to any other ; and the law declared that whoever married a Catholic should forfeit all right to the crown of these realms , as if he were naturally dead . This law , how ever , was unknown to her , and , blinded by various pretenses , she was induced to consent to a clandestine marriage , which is supposed to have been solemnized between her and the prince beyond the limits of the English dominions , in the silly belief , perhaps , entertained by him , that he escaped the penalty to which his reckless conduct exposed him , and that the forfeiture of his succession to the crown was only denounced against such a marriage if contracted within the realm . " And his lordship adds , in a note , " Some affirm that it was performed in London at the house of her uncle . " * The abbe s recollections were no less vivid than entertaining , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ham ilton , of his social intercourse with the latter , and of the admi rable old port ( rarely to be met with in Naples ) , which gave a particular charm to her dinners , the pleasures of which were /z/ generally of a prolonged description , and extended sometimes far into the night . The abbe was at Naples at the time of the execution of Carraccioli and his associates , and was cognizant of many of the cir cumstances relating to that infamy the court intrigues , the connection with them of Lady Hamilton , and the unhappy in fluence that lady brought to bear on Nelson. * The abbe stated that some days after the execution ( which he spoke of , to his credit , with reprehension , though all his sym pathies were with Cardinal Huffo and his party ) , the body of one of the persons executed , said to have been that of Carraccioli , was found floating under the stern of Nelson s frigate , and was visible to the admiral from his cabin windows . On one occasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew for a certainty that Nelson had seen one of the bodies of the exe cuted men , some days after the execution , floating near the stern of his ship , with the face upward , and he knew that Nelson was shocked at the spectacle , and well he might be . The abbe was on terms of close intimacy with the late King of Hanover and with the Duke of Cumberland , and seldom vis ited England that he did not enjoy the duke s hospitality . It was something more than amusing to hear this old man , of an obscure origin and humble rank , of no very prepossessing appearance or courtly manners , vaunting of his intimacy and terms of familiar intercourse with kings , and princes , and min isters of state : " My friend Cumberland ; " " My old acquaint ance , the King of Sardinia ; " " Mio Caro Amico Medici , " &c.; In Naples , after the abortive attempts at revolution in 1821 , there was a very strict surveillance of the police over foreign ers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were opened * " The 20th of April , 1799 , Cardinal Ruffo , at the head of the Neapolitan Roy alists and some Russian auxiliaries , entered Naples . Soon after , a confederate force of English , Russians , Italians , Portuguese , and Turks , entered the port undc3r a convoy of Lord Nelson , and invested the Castle of St. Elmo ; Capua and Gaeta were afterward taken by the assistance of the English . A severe ven geance was afterward inflicted , in contravention of a solemn treaty , on the Nea politan patriots , with the culpable connivance of Nelson , acting under the influ ence of the- profligate wife of the English embassador , Sir William Hamilton .

The services of an Englishman , or of some one well acquainted with the English language , were required for this private duty of foreign corre spondence examination , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the performance of this duty . Secrets became known to him which could only be obtained from this source of information . They might certainly have been com municated to him by his confidential friend Medici , and the direct duty of opening the letters might have been performed by some other person . My own opinion is that such was the case . Sir William Gell for some time adopted a formula for the more speedy transmission of his letters through the post-office ; the following words , in larger characters than the rest , were usually written at the top of the page of every letter of his : " When the Abbe Campbell has read this private communication , and replaced the broken seal , lie is requested to send on the letter to its destina tion . " This was a dear joke to Gell ; it was the cause of a deadly feud in English society in Naples , a feud in which , on one side , was ranged the redoubtable abbe , and occasionally , and at a convenient distance , an ally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-known surgeon of the Chiaga ; and , on the other , Sir William Drummond , Sir William Gell , Keppel Craven , the Count D Orsay , Dr. Watson , the celebrated linguist , and , on the confines of the field of battle , Ridgcway , the secretary of Sir William , and " the Master of the Horse " of Lady Drurnmond . Ridge way was a man of worth and integrity , of a remarkably staid and solemn aspect . He had the soul of a " gentleman usher of the time of Elizabeth , " penetrated with solemn convic tion of the grave importance of old ceremonials , and set formu las , and stately etiquettes . In flinging dirt , the Abbe Campbell was an incomparable bel ligerent . There was nothing in the shape of an offensive mis sile too foul or too heavy for his hands . The abbe was a fero cious hater , savagely sarcastic , and strangely jocular in his furibond movements . There was something terrible in his rancor /z/ when he was drunk with passion , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " wont to be of an afternoon , " with wine . Few people could tell the place of birth , parentage , or ante cedents of the abbe . He passed for an Englishman with En glishmen , a Scotchman with Scotchmen , and any thing but an Irishman with Irishmen in general . To Reilly and myself , Dr. duin , and one or two more , he was known to be an Irishman , a native of the north of Ireland . He was pleased to promise me , on divers occasions , when in " the superior condition , " the inheritance of his papers , and , among the rest , some fragments of a Memoir of his Life , which he had written some years previously , and had condemned to the flames no doubt very judiciously , when the Carbonari had got the upper hand in Naples . In attempting to destroy the MS. in a place suitable enough for it , a sudden puff of wind scattered the burning papers about the abbe , and , according to his humorous account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suffering death by his own life . The few pages that were unconsumed the abbe was obliged to carry off , and to take beyond the frontier with his own valu able person . Lady Blessington observes , " It is not easy to imagine how the abbe s influence is acquired , for his talents are of a very mediocre kind , his manners coarse , and his reputation not hon orable ; mais n importe , he preserves his ground , and is received , though abused , in every great house in Naples . " This is one of the many extraordinary instances one often witnesses of a man rising from a low station without one qual ity to justify his ascent or maintain it , yet whose presence is tolerated by those who decry him . " * The " German prince , " Puckler Muskau , whose travels in Germany , Holland , and England were published in 1831 , makes mention of a celebrated wit of a sarcastic turn , " once a patentee of puns , " whom he had met in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , whose every word was extravagantly ad mired and extolled , though the liking for the facetious cynic was feigned and pretended to , out of fear of the waspish tongue of the sarcastic humorist . " I have a mortal hate , " says the prince , " for the whole tribe of such wits , especially when , like this per son , they combine a repulsive exterior with gall and sarcasm un redeemed by grace of any kind . In human society they appear as poisonous insects , whom people , out of a pitiful weakness , help to nourish with the blood of others to save their own . " * The abbe s head-quarters at Naples , in the latter years of his life , were on an eminence called Capo di Monte , and occasion ally at the Albergo di Crocelle , in the Chiatamone . He made yearly journeys to England , and sometimes more frequently vis ited London , and during his stay there ( often a very prolonged one ) installed himself in the house of my old friend , Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On one occasion of a visitation there he had dined out , and done ample justice to the viands and the wines of his entertainer . He sallied forth at a late hour , after some imsuccessful attempts to procure a hackney-coach for him . He had ordered a vehicle , which was not to be found . There was a large party at a house adjoining his entertainer s , and there was a long line of carriages in front of the house , and among them a solitary sedan chair , of large dimensions . The drivers of the coaches and the bearers of the sedan chair were probably regaling themselves . It was a wet night in every sense of the term . The unfortunate abbe no sooner espied the sedan chair than some unaccountable impulse sent his great bulk of body bundling into the ancient vehicle , and no sooner had he plopped down and was seated than he fell fast asleep , snoring loudly . The bearers , on their return , found a fat snoring gentleman in the sedan , whom it was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs or efforts of their arms . A crowd col lected : among them , some mischievously-minded individual , an anticipator of the hydropathic system , pointed to a spout , from which torrents of water were pouring down from the roof of a /z/ neighboring house . In an instant the poles were thrust into their places ; the sedan chair , with its enormous burden , was up lifted , borne to the spot , and placed under the spout ; the head was then lifted , and the abbe was suddenly awakened , drench ed , bewildered , and dismayed , imagining the end of the world was come , and another deluge was taking place . A compassionate jarvey , seeing the prospect of getting a good fare , contrived to elicit from the thoroughly-soaked gentleman his address . He was conveyed home , cool , but not comfortable , and not in a very seraphic state of mind . The abbe , on various occasions , had given Savory to under stand that nearly all he possessed should go to him ( Savory ) at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephew of that gentleman , Mr. John Savory , that he would find his name had not been forgotten in the disposition of the property of Henry Campbell . He broke all his promises to the elder Savory , to whom , for many years , he had given a vast deal of trouble about his pe cuniary and other private affairs ; but he kept faith with Mr. John Savory ( the present head of the firm of Savory and Moore , of Bond Street ) . A short time before he left London for the last time , and about three or four months previous to his death , in the early part of 1830 , having made some arrangement of his affairs , he called on Mrs. Savory , and with some signs of emotion , and marked solemnity of mariner , placed a small pack age in her hands , and spoke of his tender regards for her hus band . He went away very much affected , and never was seen more by his kind friends . The small but precious package was opened with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards of old Mechlin lace were taken from the paper and laid on the table . The next news from Naples brought the intelligence of the abbe s death ; and a very lamentable account it was of the close of a career that was in keeping with the whole of its bad course . While the wealthy , friendless , dying man was still conscious of what was passing around him , his servants were plundering his house , ransacking the room , even where he lay dying , for ob jects of any value that he kept there . /z/ At his death , his money was found lodged in several hands , with bankers and others . He had left no regular account , show ing how his property was placed . Mr. Thomas Field Savory dis covered that there were several thousand pounds of his lodged in the bank of Messrs . Wright , of Henrietta Street , which his rep resentatives had no knowledge of . A young gentleman who had been acknowledged by the abbe to be his nephew inherited the whole of his property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe , to get through the greater portion of it . /z/ OF all the medical men in Naples of the forestieri , Charles Reillv , a native of Ireland , a retired medical surgeon , who had accompanied the Oxford family to Naples in the capacity of traveling medical attendant , and had settled down in practice in that city in the time of King Joachim , was in the highest repute when I was there , in the latter part of 1821 , 1822 , and 1823 , and the spring of 1824 . Reilly was , in every sense of the term but one , a thorough Irishman . He was full of humor , jocose , good natured , with something of a lachrymose expression in his serious , business like , corrugated features , till some odd fancy would flash across his mind , or some ridiculous object present itself to his eye , or droll expression meet his car , and then that lugubrious physi ognomy , with all its deep traces of worldliness , would brighten up as if by magic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face glow with joyousness . Reilly s hu mor and gayety were peculiarly Irish , and as ; racy of the soil " he had abandoned some twenty or thirty years previously to the period I refer to as if he had only quitted it the day be fore . Reilly was not only funny himself , but he was the cause of fun in others . He was as essential to the jollity of the old Abbe ( - ampbell as the jolly abbe was indispensable to Reilly when- /z/ ever he exercised the rights of hospitality , which was seldom less , than twice a week . On these festive occasions , Reilly was to the abbe what Boswell was to Johnson , in some respects . He tickled the great bear , and jumped with his humor . He bore with an odd growl from him , and an occasional cuff of his big paw , as if he was complimented by the notice of the great animal he had the care of . The abbe loved Reilly as much as it was in his nature to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambols at those weekly entertainments . Gulosity and gayety went hand in hand at them . Some years before Reilly s arrival in Naples with Lady Ox ford s family , while serving as assistant surgeon on board a ves sel of war at Lisbon , an adventure occurred in the vicinity of that city of a very profligate nature , which was attended with calamitous results . A first lieutenant , of the name of S , and the surgeon of the ship , made the acquaintance of two ladies in a convent at Belem , adjoining the city , who consented to leave their nunnery , the means of escape having previously been de vised and prepared for them . The first lady , who descended from a window by a rope lad der to the street beneath , reached the ground without accident , and was carried off by the lieutenant . That lady I was in com pany with about ten years later , at a ball in Naples , the wife of the officer just referred to then a post-captain in the navy ; and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or four children , bore the character of a most exemplary wife and mother . But the other lady , who attempted escape on the same night , had fallen from the frail ladder to the ground from a consider able height and broken her leg . The cries of the unfortunate person were heard in the convent ; people came to the spot ; she was discovered , and carried back to the convent . The gen tlemen who had occasioned this disaster fled to the boat that was in waiting for them , a little way below the convent , and effected their escape , leaving the wretched victim to her doom , what ever it might be . Reilly s acquaintance with Naples in the time of Murat , when /z/ Lady Oxford and her lovely daughters* were the bright stars round which revolved , not only the fashion , but the political in trigues of King Joachim s court , was fraught with reminiscences highly interesting , and was a never-failing subject of conversa tion with him . Having ceased to be the traveling medical attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and proved so eminently successful in it as to have realized a very large for tune so early even as 1821 . He had married in Naples an English woman in affluent cir cumstances , a very thrifty and money-making person , but with al amiable and kindly disposed , the widow of the maitre d ho tel of the Duke de Gallo . This lady , far advanced in years , had two children a son named Marzio , a young man of good tal ents , a fiery temperament , and ungovernable disposition , and a daughter , an amiable and pretty girl , who grew up to woman hood a highly-accomplished and attractive person ( the belle of the Chiaja ) , who eventually became the bride of a young English surgeon , the successor of Reilly in his professional business . Reilly and his wife ( and his daughter , I believe ) , a second wife also , whom he had married about ten years ago , all have passed away ; and of the English , Irish , and Scotch not a few remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of frequenting that pleasant and hospitable house of his , with two exceptions those of Dr. Ciuin , now established in his pro fession in London , and my worthy old friend , Mr. Ramsay , living in Mordaunt College , Blackheath none , I believe , are in being . * The Right Hon.

He was then a young , rising medical practitioner , in great vogue with all fashionable English visitors and sojourners in Naples , full of life and spirits , of excellent address , with a keen perception of the ridiculous , and a great zest for merri ment . But Q , uin had solid worth and good sound sense to bring to the aid of his professional talents , though some of the inva lids of Naples , accustomed to grave , lugubrious doctors , seemed to think the philosophy of Heraclitus was more becoming phy sicians than that of Democritus . We are told by old Burton , that when Hippocrates came to Abdera , he found Democritus " busy in cutting up several beasts to find out the cause of mad ness and melancholy . " And while he pursued his studies , he laughed ever and anon , and the public thought he was mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a great deal of philosophy in his laughter . And he told the Abderites , though the little man laughed more profusely than other people , " that Abdera had not a wiser , a more learned , a more honest man , and they were much deceived to say that he was mad . " " Thus Democritus was esteemed ( drolly ) of the world in his time ; and this was the cause of his laughter , and good cause he had . " Olim jure quidem , nunc plus Democrite , ride Quin rides uita haec nunc mage ridicula est. " * Three-and-thirty years have had little effect in subduing Dr. Gtuin s high spirits , or making inroads on his vigor of body or vivacity of mind . The same quickness of apprehension and observation , unfailing humor , ready wit and repartee , charac terize the most eminent homeopathic physician of London of the present day , that distinguished the young traveling physi cian of the Duchess of Devonshire in those early days of his and mine , which I look back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminiscences of times and scenes the most agreeable of my life . In his profession Dr. Q , uin is zealous and discreet , mindful of the sanctity of the sick chamber , and of the obligations it im poses on the physician . In private life he wins and retains the confidence and esteem of those with whom he becomes acquaint ed . His practice is chiefly among the aristocracy . The present King of the Belgians reposed the highest confidence in his skill . The late Duke of Cambridge left no means untried to induce him to accept the post of physician to his family on allopathic principles , but those efforts were in vain . Yet I remember when the doctor made a burla of Hahnemann and the infini tesimal dose system . At an early period of his career in Na ples , professing to write against homceopathy , he went to Ger many to inquire into the system ; and he who went to scoff re mained to study , and to become a convert to the new theory of medicine .

He died in Paris , aged thirty-five , in January , 1837. /z/ Those who were acquainted with Naples about thirty years * General Wade , in all probability , was a member of a Westmeath family of that name , which gave a field marshal to the British army in the reign of King William . That distinguished officer had gained his first military honors at the battle of Aughrim , in 1691 , and commanded in the Highlands , as a general officer , from 1726 to 1737 , during which period he had caused roads to be made through mountainous districts previously impassable for troops , for which works he was immortalized by a Scotch poet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were made , You d lift up your hands and bless General Wade .

The field marshal of Meath , who died in 1852 , rests , after the labors of eighty-four years , in St. Paul s. /z/ ago will remember an Irish gentleman , tall- and portly , a fine specimen of one of the old school of Hibernian gentility , of pre possessing appearance and elegant mariners , dcgagees et dcbotinaires , and free from all restraint ; who was exceedingly poor , and might have been extremely rich ; who lived from day to day by borrowing from all his friends , and yet made an appear ance in society ; dined out a great deal , and passed for an Irish landlord ever on the brink of prosperity , sure to get rents which never came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always coming , but , alas ! which came not . Sir Frederick Faulkner was this unhappy gentleman a person abounding in anecdote , most agreeable in society , and singularly inconsistent in his character . Gell talked of founding a hospital at Rome for genteel per sons of decayed purses , and discontented , disappointed , agree able people . Sir Frederick would have been a most agreeable inmate of such an institution . Nothing could induce Sir Frederick to violate his public prin ciples , but in private life his principles were violated every day ; his poverty , but not his will , consented to the violation . He borrowed daily , without any prospect of being able to pay what was lent him . He made solemn promises day after day , which were invariably broken by him .

Sir Frederick married , in 1798 , Miss Anne Frances Gardiner , daughter of Sackville Gardiner , second son of the Right Hon. Luke Gardiner , the grandfather of the late Earl of Blessington. /z/ This antique remnant of the ancient aristocracy of France was embassador at the court of Ptome in 1825 , when Lady Blessington had taken up her abode in the Palazzo Negrone . The duke , whom I had subsequently met in Rome , on several occa sions , at their abode , was a remarkable person in society . Oc casionally lively and spiritual , frequently and suddenly somno lent , and always , when awake , extremely gallant and compli mentary to the ladies . But his compliments and eulogies were generally mal-apropos . All his senses , and a few of his facul ties , were defective ; some impaired by age , one naturally im perfect . In these particulars he resembled an old Chancery bar rister , Bell , whom Lord Eldon used to commend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or write like any other man . The duke s talent for diplomacy was said to have outlived all his other capabilities . He was respected , however , by all who knew him , for his sterling worth and his generous conduct , es pecially to Pius VII . when in France , whose wants were liber ally supplied by him . The name of this gentleman is connected with a very melan choly occurrence , frequently referred to in Lady Blessington s Journal and Correspondence , which took place in Rome in the month of February , 1824. /z/ Miss Bathurst was a granddaughter of the late venerable and excellent Bishop of Norwich . Her father , some years previous ly to the calamity above referred to , in his travels in Germany , unaccompanied by his family , had disappeared , and was never more heard of by them , leaving a young widow and two infant daughters to deplore his loss . Miss Bathurst , the subject of this brief notice , grew up to womanhood a lovely girl , strikingly beautiful . She was traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with her uncle and aunt , Lord and Lady Aylmer . She had gone out , on one occasion , on horseback , escorted by Lord and Lady Aylmer and the French ernbassador , the Duke de /z/ Laval Montmorenci . The groom of Miss Bathurst had been sent back to Lord Aylmer s on some message , and when they approached the Pont Motte , over the Tiber , the Duke de Laval took them by a path he was in the habit of riding along on the banks of the Tiber . Finding this path difficult , the party were in the act of retracing their steps , when Miss Bathurst , in turn ing her horse , approached too near the edge of the bank , and , in an instant , horse and rider were plunged into the river . Lord Aylmer made two ineffectual attempts , though unable to swim , to rescue the young lady. * The Duke de Laval was incapable of affording any assistance . Miss Bathurst managed to keep her seat after the horse fell into the river till his violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lost her seat and sunk , but rose once more to the surface , and then disappeared to rise no more . The remains were not discovered for months ; they were interred in the English place of burial in Rome , where the ashes of Shelley and of Keats are deposited . The vast sepulchral pile that stands there in honor of the memory of Caius Cestius excites less interest than the small marble mon ument , of snowy whiteness , well fitted to recall the purity of that fair creature , whose melancholy fate it commemorates . The monument erected to the memory of Miss Bathurst is the work of Sir Richard Westmacott , and alike worthy of the mourn ful subject and of the skillful sculptor . From W. S. Landor , in relation to the death of Miss Bathurst : " DEAR LADY BLESSIXGTON , I have just requested Mrs. Paynter to let me send your ladyship what Lord Aylmer says about the drowning of Miss Ba thurst , which shows that Mills is not quite correct .

The eldest child , Sir Augustus D Este , entered the army , and obtained a commission in the Iloyal Fusileers ; he served at New Orleans in 1814 , and at length obtained the rank of colo nel . He retired on half pay in 1824 . In 1830 he was appoint ed Knight Commander of the Bath by King William , and in the same year he claimed succession to the titles and honors of his father , the Duke of Sussex . He had previously memorialized the king on the subject . The matter was brought before the House of Lords , and a judicial committee finally decided against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in 1828 was sojourning in Florence , in very impaired health , where I had the honor of making his acquaintance . He died , unmarried , in 1849 . His sister , Miss Ellen Augusta D Este , married Sergeant Wilde in 1845. /z/ The following account is given by Lady Blessington of a young military officer , of much notoriety in Naples , as a man of gal lantry and extraordinary adventures in royal circles , at the pe riod of my residence there some thirty years ago . This account is taken verbatim from one of the commonplace books of Lady Blessington , entitled " Night Thoughts , " which I have had occasion already to refer to . It may be well to observe that Captain Hesse was one of the gentlemen attached to the household of ( olueen Caroline , who left her majesty s service and remained in Naples after the de departure of the queen in 1820 . " Captain Hesse , " says Lady Blessington , " was the son of a Prussian merchant , who acquired great wealth by various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army . " When a youth he was sent to England , to be educated un der the auspices of the Margrave of Anspach , then residing in this country . Being a good-looking , lively youth , he was taken much notice of by the margrave and margravine ( formerly the /z/ celebrated Lady Craven ) , and was invited to pass his short vaca tion with them . His education being completed , he returned to Berlin , where his father , then become a banker , lived in consid erable splendor , and was expected to leave his son a large for tune . Napoleon s campaign against Prussia blighted these pros pects ; for the banker Hesse having contracted to clothe the Prussian army , their defeat , and its consequent result , precluded the king from paying Hesse , and occasioned his ruin . Under these circumstances , young Hesse was sent to England , in the hope that , through the influence of the margravine ( the mar grave was then dead ) , some situation or provision could be ob tained for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entreating the commiseration of the margravine , was dispatched to her ; and , with great good-nature , she received young Hesse beneath her roof , and so successfully used her influence in his favor , that the Duke of York granted him a cornetcy in a dra goon regiment ( I think the 18th ) , and the margravine and her son , the Honorable Keppel Craven , fitted him out for joining his regiment in a suitable manner . " The Duchess of York , herself a Prussian , and knowing his family , felt interested for her youthful countryman , and spoke in his favor to her kind-hearted husband . Meeting , at the mar gravine s , the most distinguished persons , young Hesse was re ceived into good society . Gay , amusing , good-looking , a good horseman , and with an easy address and manner , he soon ren dered himself conspicuous by a certain coxcombry in dress , orig inating in his besetting and only sin vanity . This weakness induced him , when scandalous reports assisted to account for his good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was the son of the margrave and the margravine previous to their marriage , rather to encourage than discountenance the rumors . The calibre of his mind could not be better proved than by his preferring to have it believed that he was the illegitimate child of persons of high rank rather than the legitimate son of a re spectable banker at Berlin . His dashing appearance , and his desire to attract the attention of the fair sex , drew him into no tice ; and when sent with a portion of his regiment to the neigh- /z/ horhood of Bognor , where the Princess Charlotte of Wales was then staying , he attracted her attention by riding constantly in front of her window , until the youthful and self-willed girl , cap tivated by his appearance and horsemanship , condescended first to bow to him , and then to write to him . The correspondence was supposed to be carried on through the medium of the Count ess de F , then Miss M. E. , though afterward several letters were conveyed to the princess through General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe they were from the mother of the princess . Portraits were exchanged , and young Hesse , vain and elevated , was perhaps less cautious than he ought to have been , and the matter got talked of , and reached the ears of the royal family . " The princess was scolded , watched , and guarded . Hesse was sent to Spain with his regiment , where he was wounded ; and it being discovered that he still possessed the letters and portrait of the princess , an awkward thing , when her marriage with some princely suitor might soon be looked for , the mar gravine and Mr. Keppel Craven were applied to to use their in fluence with Mr. Hesse to have the letters and portrait return ed : the application came from the princess . The margravine and Mr. Keppel Craven , justly offended at Hesse s having en couraged the false reports of his being the son of the former a report which their great kindness had given a color to had marked their displeasure to him , and more especially as the romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prince and an English countess had greatly influenced the girlish fancy of the Princess Charlotte in his favor . Hesse , when applied to , was very reluctant to return the letters and portrait , but at length yielded to the representation of Mr. Keppel Craven on the impropriety of retaining letters which the writer reclaim ed ; he sent Mr. Craven an order to have the sealed box con taining them ( which had been left with a friend , with injunc tions that , should Hesse die , the box and its contents , unopened , should be consigned to the flames ) delivered to Mr. Craven . The latter gentleman living out of England , the box was trans ferred to the Countess de F , in whose possession the letters still are , as that lady assured Mr. K. Craven a year ago . /z/ " Gratified by Hesse s surrender of the letters , the margravine and Mr. K. Craven , when he returned from Spain , overlooked his former folly , and received him into favor . The Princess Charlotte , at a ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K. Craven , whom she had never previously met , and walk ing up close to her , said , I am glad of an opportunity of seeing you , and I request you will tell your brother , Mr. Keppel Craven , how truly obliged I feel to him . He will know to what my ob ligation refers . " This , with Hesse s after-scrapes at Naples in royal circles , was told me at my house , on the evening of the 31st of August , 1846 , by the Honorable Keppel Craven . M. B. " /z/ General Garth , the father of Captain Thomas Garth , Colonel of the 1st or Royal Regiment of Dragoons , was a grand-nephew of the celebrated Sir Samuel Garth , physician in ordinary to George the First . Some unfortunate circumstances , about thirty years ago , made the marriage of General Garth with a royal , princess of the house of Hanover a matter of notoriety . The issue of that marriage was Captain Thomas Garth . The general died in London in 1830 , in his eighty-fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Naples about 1821 and 1822 , and made his sojourn there sufficiently remarkable . /z/ MR . R. K. CRAVEN was the third son of William , sixth Baron Craven , by his marriage , on the 18th of May , 1767 , with Eliz abeth , daughter of Augustus , fourth Earl of Berkeley ( born in 1750 ) , by whom he had issue several children . Lady Craven separated from her husband in 1781 . In the " Dictionary of Living Authors , " published in 1816 , it is stated /z/ that Lady Craven had been so cruelly treated by her husband that her friends were obliged to interfere to effect a separation . This event took place in 1781 . The succeeding ten years were spent by Lady Craven on the Continent and in the Levant . In 1789 she published , in 4to , " A Journey through the Crimea to C onstantinople . " Horace Walpole , in November , 1786 , wrote to Lady Craven , then scouring the Continent and the Levant , skurrying over Italy , Germany , Poland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ficulties she had occasioned her friends by the rapidity of her movements , and the impossibility of finding out " in what quar ter of the known or unknown world she might be resident or existent at any particular time . " On receiving a note from her at Strawberry Hill , offering to call on her for a moment , he tells her , " A whirlwind , I suppose , was waiting at your door to carry you to Japan , and as balloons have not yet any settled post-office in the air , you could not , at least did not , give me any direction where to address you , though you did kindly reproach me with *rny silence . " In his justification he observes , " I heard from you from Venice , then from Poland , and then , having whisked through Tartary , from Petersburg ! ! , but still no directions . 1 said to myself , I will write to Constantinople , which will prob ably be her next stage .

How could I sup pose that so many despotic infidels would part with your charms ? " Shortly after Lord Craven s decease , his lady , in 1791 , married the Margravine of Anspach and Bayreuth . This prince , some years after he had gained the hand of the English lady , disposed of his German principality to the King of Prussia , and retired to England , where he died in 1806 , at Brandenburg House , Ham mersmith . The festivities and fashionable diver tisseme n s follatres /z/ of Brandenburg House attracted no little notice in their day. * A private theatre was fitted up in this palace of pleasure , and many dramatic pieces , written by the margravine , were produced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her separation from Lord Craven . " The Sleepwalker , " a comedy , printed at the Strawberry Hill press in 1778 , and " The Miniature Picture , " a comedy , written in 1781 . " Nourjad , " a French comedy , was written by her ladyship during her residence in Anspach , and printed there in 1787 . She published a translation of Gibber s comedy of " She would and she would not . " Also a very singular com position , a satirical piece , in 1779 , in 12mo , entitled " Modern Anecdotes of the Family of **34;30;TOOLONG , " a tale . The letters of Lady Craven addressed to her son , translated into French , are noticed in Grimm s Memoirs ( of the year 1788. ) f Grimm observes that " a superior intelligence , and sentiments the most just and delicate , are obvious in the lessons which this enlightened mother gave to her son , with regard to the consider ation due to the sensibility of the sex . " In 1802 she published also " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8vo . Boswell speaks of Johnson s " dining with the beautiful , gay , and fascinating Lady Craven . " Ah ! if the admiring lexicog rapher could have looked at the same lady through a telescope of sixty years power of looking into futurity , how he would have been astounded at the haggard old woman , wrinkled and with ered as she was in her latter days , retaining nothing of the for mer belle but the sprightliness of her nature , and that vivacity contrasting very painfully with the wreck of pristine beauty and comeliness . During the latter years of her life the margravine resided altogether in Naples . * The margravine , in her Autobiography , alluding to the magnificence of her establishment at Brandenburg House , says , " We had thirty servants in livery , with grooms , and a set of sixty horses . Our expenses were enormous , though I curtailed them with all possible economy . " t Memoires par le Baron le Grimm , vol. iv. , p. 164 , 8vo , London , 1813. /z/ Her well-known villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was furnished with taste and elegance ; the grounds were laid out with great care under the immediate direction of the margravine . I have seen her , a few years before her death , working in her garden , spade in hand , in very coarse and singular attire , a desiccated , antiquated piece of mortality , remarkable for vivacity , realizing the idea of a galvanized Egyptian mummy , or one of the weird sisters working at " a charm of powerful trouble . " She died in Naples in June , 1828 , in the seventy-ninth year of her age . Lord Charles Murray , who had known the margravine in En gland , was in Naples in 1822 . A short time previously to my first acquaintance with him in that year , he had been seized with fever in Sicily , which malady was followed by temporary insanity . He was brought to Naples , and there a great im provement took place in his health of mind and body . When his lordship was beginning to recover , he was in the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city . Lord Charles , on one occasion , had begged me to accompany him to the residence of the Margravine of Anspach , as he was desirous of paying his respects to the old lady , whom he had formerly known in London . Unfortunately , the margravine did not receive us in her house , or in such costume as ladies usual ly receive visits in . Indeed , her costume and appearance would have suited admirably for the character of one of the weird sis ters in the scene of Macbeth , where the witches are introduced performing incantations dire . We were conducted to her in the garden , where she was- in the act of digging , and we found her attired in a manner not calculated to encourage gravity , or keep an excited person s mind long in an undisturbed condition . For a few minutes aft er introduction and recognition , things went on very agreeably . The margravine made many inquiries after old friends , and Lord Charles answered them with all possible courtesy . But at length a cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor old lady , in her singular costume , from head /z/ to foot . I endeavored to hasten our departure for Naples , but all my efforts were in vain ; Lord Charles burst out into a per fect hurricane of reprehension , calling up reminiscences of a dis agreeable nature , rumors of strange occurrences in various quar ters of the globe , on which he enlarged with extraordinary ve hemence and volubility , to the great amazement of the margra vine , till such time as I found an opportunity of explaining the unhappy illness under which his lordship had been lately labor ing . It was with no small difficulty I brought the unpleasant interview , at length , to a termination . The margravine accompanied us to the gate of the villa , and there a new scene was in store for her . Lord Charles insisted on showing her a new mode of entering a carriage , vhich he recommended her particularly to adopt ; he then made a rush toward the carriage door , and , putting his hand on the window frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clowns are wont to make in pantomimes , through panels representing clocks , and fairly launched the upper part of his body through the window , leaving his long legs on the outside , kicking furi ously in all directions . The consternation and astonishment of the margravine was beyond description . I succeeded , with a great deal of trouble , by opening the opposite door of the carriage , to get his lordship s legs dragged in where the rest of his person was sprawling ; and , not without a great deal of violence on his part , ending in the demolition of all the glass in the vehicle , managed to get him back to Naples . That access of mania appeared to me to have been produced mainly by the margravine s strange aspect and apparel . 1 thought I could read Banquo s inquiry in poor Lord Charles s searching gaze when he first set his eyes on her : " What are these , so withered , and so wild in their attire , That look not like the inhabitants of earth , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you aught That man may question 1 You seem to understand me By each at once her chapping fingers lying Upon her skinny lips . " * /z/ The present Dowager Duchess of Athol was the mother of two children , Lady Catherine , who died young , and Lord Charles Murray , who , having volunteered in the cause of Greek inde pendence , died at Gastonini , in Greece , August llth , 1824 , aged twenty-five . The circumstances of his decease are recorded in vol. xciv. , p. 465 , of the " New Monthly Magazine . " The fol lowing particulars are taken from a later number of the same periodical . " Lord Charles Murray , an amiable and benevolent young man , who had been bred up in luxury and ease , underwent ev ery species of fatigue , and submitted to every possible privation , in order to encourage the Greeks by his example , and to be able to furnish them with means from his far too limited income .

An Englishman , who had arrived just in time to close his eyes , on taking an in ventory of his effects , found them to consist of nothing more than two old shirts , a pair or two of stockings , a brace of pis tols , a sabre , and a Bible . Every thing had gone to assist the impoverished Greeks and the distressed Frank volunteers in their ranks .

" met him at Marseilles , quite restored . He was then about to embark for Greece where he died a little later . /z/ " When Keppel Craven was about three years old , his father took leave of Lady Craven , never to see her more ; and when she shortly afterward returned to France , she was allowed to take Keppel ( being her youngest child ) with . her , but it was under a promise to return him to his father when he was eight years of age . This condition was not fulfilled ; but she after*-ward placed him at Harrow , under a feigned name . " While Keppel was at Harrow , says his mother , a lady saw him in the master s private library , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master who the boy was . He answered , " A German . " " It is the image of Lady Craven , " she said . Keppel , who at this time was about thirteen years old , spoke English perfectly , without any accent , although he had been so much abroad . The lady s remark struck the mas ter forcibly , who went back to the child immediately , and told him he suspected he was Lord Craven s son , and it was better that his uncle , Lord Berkeley , who was left to direct his brother , then at Eton , should know where he was ; and , after his first confusion was over , the child consented to it . In consequence , Keppel passed the next vacation with his brother Berkeley , in Dorsetshire . " Mr. Keppel Craven , however , was not , by this incident , per manently estranged from his mother , who shortly after came to reside in this country with the Margrave of Anspach , to whom she had been married in 1799 . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residence with her at Naples . " * When her royal highness , the Princess of Wales , set out in 1814 on her foreign tour , she was accompanied by several En glish gentlemen and two English ladies in her suite . The prin cess quitted Naples in March , 1815 ; her two chamberlains , Sir William Gell and Mr. Craven , and her only remaining maid of honor , Lady Elizabeth Forbes , stayed behind , as did likewise her royal highness s equerry , Captain Hesse . Mr. Craven , in his examination on the queen s trial in 1820 , said he was in the queen s service as one of her chamberlains in 1814 , but left it at the expiration of six months , in conformity /z/ with previous arrangements ; was aware of the presence of a spy from England , whose business it was to watch the conduct of the queen . He saw no impropriety in the conduct of the queen at Milan or Naples , or improper familiarity on the part of Bergami . He ( witness ) left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having fixed his abode in Naples , became inti mately acquainted with Sir William Gell . Their tastes , habits , pursuits , and inclinations were identical . There never were friends more united in sentiment and affection . Mr. Craven was a good classical scholar , had an excellent taste for drawing , was a great lover of books , and had all the feelings , refined manners , and the gentle , winning , easy address of an accomplished gentleman . One of the earliest and most highly-esteemed acquaintances made by Lady Blessington on her arrival in Naples in July , 1823 , was the Honorable R. Keppel Craven . Mr. Craven ( says Lady Blessington ) possesses a highly-culti vated mind , manners at once dignified and graceful , and exer cises an elegant hospitality , that renders his house the most at tractive here . She speaks of him in her letters and diaries of 1823 and 1824 as " one of the most agreeable persons in Naples , " " a person of the greatest versatility of knowledge , " " a scholar , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much merit , " " a comic actor of con siderable ability . " In 1821 , Mr. Craven published in 4to , " A Tour through the Southern Provinces of the Kingdom of Naples , " to which is sub joined an Account of the Revolution . This work is embellish ed with views from his own sketches . Mr. Craven s principal work is " Excursions in the Abruzzi and the Northern Provinces of Naples , " in 2 vols. , published in 1837 . In that excellent work , worthy of the taste for art and antiquarian lore of his old friend and companion , Sir William Gell , there is one description , which alone would render the " Excursions " of no ordinary value ; the detailed and most in teresting account of the Benedictine monastery of Monte Casino /z/ ( the original foundation of St. Benedict ) , and its valuable library , and precious archives , diplomas , chronicles , and monastic rec ords , and its innumerable documents illustrative of the early history in those regions of the Lombards and Normans ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as rare manuscripts of the works of Homer , Virgil , and Dante ; and , lastly , the celebrated vision of Alberica , a monk of this fraternity , from which that poet is supposed to have taken the first idea of the " Divina Commedia . " Mr. Craven died at Naples in June , 1851 , aged seventy-two , the last of a triumvirate of English literati , scholars , and gen tlemen of refined taste in art and excellence in antiquarian pur suits , who resided for so many years in Naples in the closest bonds of friendship Drummond , Gell , and Craven . The respect and affectionate care paid by Mr. Craven through out his whole life to his mother was one of the most remarka ble and amiable traits in his character . No amount of eccen tricity , or waywardness , or restlessness on the part of the mar gravine made the slightest difference in the undeviating and uniform dutifulness and tender devotion to her of this favorite child of hers . She was fully sensible of this kindness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never observed , except in a single instance that of the filial homage , affectionate regard , and dutifulness of Sir Moses Montefiore to his venerable mother the same deference , honor , and child-like love shown by a man advanced in years to a parent , as was exhibited by Keppel Craven to his mother . And in this particular case the merit of the son s conduct was certainly enhanced by a great deal of eccentricity on the part of her whose happiness and comfort were the chief objects of his care . Mr. Augustus Craven , the only son of the Honorable R. Kep pel Craven , was attached to the mission at Naples in the latter part of 1830 , and to that at Frankfort in 1833 ; was appointed paid attache at Lisbon in 1836 , at Brussels in 1839 ; was made secretary of legation at Stuttgardt in 1843. * He acted , for a /z/ short time , as private secretary to the Marquis of Normanby at Paris in 1846 , and resigned his post at Stuttgardt in 1852 .

Then , indeed , his state of health was such as to excite considerable alarm , but about the beginning of August a crisis appears to have taken place , and a considerable improvement has been the consequence ; he is now here , where he has been staying a week ; but that would prove nothing in favor of his amended condition , as even at its worst period his courage and activity of mind never drooped , and he went out just as usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am free from all apprehension ; but as long as a tendency to somnolency continues , the only symptom which has not disappeared , I feel uneasy .

In addition to this fund of uneasiness , I have had some oc cupations of an annoying nature in the uncertainty which arose and hung over my son s departure , who , with his wife , is gone to France for some months . This had been decided some time back , but the approach of the cholera southward urged them to anticipate their intended departure , for fear of finding themselves shut into the north of Italy , and surrounded on all sides with sanitary cordons .

With regard to the malady itself , there seems no doubt that it has declared itself at Nice , Genoa , Corsi , and Leghorn , but it has not been very violent , and seems just now to be suspended . Measures are taking in this kingdom to present obstacles ( if that is possible ) to its approach , and to attend to it in the most effectual manner if it does come ; but the panic it had caused at first appears to have subsided , and its effects seem confined to the inn keepers and laquais de places , who foresee a sterile winter for them , as it is not probable that , as long as any lurking remains of the malady are supposed to exist in any part of Italy , strangers will voluntarily select it for their next /z/ winter s residence ; at present there are very few , who will most likely soon depart .

The summer has been variable , therefore , for this climate , cool ; and now , heavy rains and thunder-storms seem to give us a foretaste of the equinox a month before its natural time . " I ought before this to have thanked you for your offer of assistance with regard to the publication of my last journey , a proposal which I should most gratefully avail myself of should circumstances favor its appearance ; it is now completed , and copied out in a fair , legible hand , therefore accessible to the inspection of any bookseller , who , of course , will choose to examine it be fore any stipulations are made .

The whole would form a quarto vol ume about the size of the last I published relative to the South , and , as far as I can judge , written in the same manner that is , in that of an Itinerary , prin cipally useful to such as are inclined to examine those regions , but not arriv ing at any details of science or statistics .

" I hope you will not judge of the impression your last kind letter produced upon me by the tardiness I have observed in replying to it ; but for this I shall offer no apology ; acquiescing in all your friendly expressions regarding the loss I have sustained* is but a poor way of denoting my thanks , and I deferred offering them till I could at the same time inform you with , some cer tainty of my intended movements for the summer , which I now can do , hav- /z/ ng determined to leave this very early in the ensuing month , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robust state of health will allow me , resting only a few weeks at Paris , so that I hope to be in London in the first week of June , when I need not say you will be very shortly apprised of my arrival . I have been very busy in arranging the memorials I preserve of our excellent friend , so as to have them constantly under my inspection . You know that there are various ways of finding relief , which differ according to the disposition and habits of the sufferer in similar cases , and I own that flyino-from , or destroying every record which recalls the person lamented , does not appear ( to me at least ) an efficacious mode of obtaining consolation ; for surely it does not require such tangible mementoes of departed excellence to remind one of an irreparable loss , the conviction of which will intrude itself at all times , and through every circumstance of social or solitary life . I have , therefore , amalgamated the books of which I have possession with my own , in a manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve to adorn , and give additional value to , the apartment I always inhabit .

There could not be a better selection , and I have no doubt he will find it so ; but he is still at the inn , the house not being yet ready for him . The king is at present enjoying the honors of a camp composed of about a third of his forces , near Salerno ; this is an amusement he was much inclined to in his early days of celibacy , but latterly his growing attachment to his poor young wife appeared to have absorbed his attention ; however , after three months mourning , he has had recourse to this object , either to resume hist bachelor s avocations , or perhaps by way only of a little dissipation . There are already reports of his having the intention of traveling to seek a wor thy successor of the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questions you put , and which appear to me but too natural , respecting Cell s last days , or rather weeks , I find it rather difficult to return a positive answer , more especially as to his own feelings respecting his state . I think /z/ that at times he was quite aware that his system had received a blow from which it could never recover , and that as far back as this time twelvemonth ; but he had continued so many months under the impression of repeated som nolence , of somnolence totally free from bodily suffering , that I don t appre hend he considered himself worse at the end of the year than last spring . He was not aware of his increasing debility ; and as the functions of his stomach continued unimpaired until within but two days before the sad event , when a general and rapid decay of all the vital functions occurred , I don t think that his reflections dwelt upon his dissolution as being very near . Nevertheless , his last will , about which he was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his decease , and occasionally he would allude to the event itself in an indirect manner ; for on receiving some books about a month before it happened , and my asking him to lend some to me , he said , You had better read them when they are your own and you are not likely to wait long . I lind in his daily journal , in which he noted observations on his health , about Christmas , these words May consider myself well He had rallied to what appeared a very improved condition about three weeks before the catastro phe ; but it was principally in the suspension of the lethargic affections which had so long oppressed him that this was evident , and the consequence was , that , having much longer intervals of clear consciousness and reflection , he was undoubtedly more awake to his situation , both morally and physically ; for he then complained of bodily ailings much more than during his whole malady , though to all appearance they had ceased . He never ceased , I don t say for an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him ; and though he sometimes could not fix his eyes for two minutes at a time on its contents , he nevertheless understood it , and could afterward talk of the work in a man ner which proved that , while his mental powers were awake , they were as strong as ever more especially his memory ; but the state he was in caused much confusion in his ideas of time and distance , of which he was aware , and complained of . " I can not end my letter without thanking you for your very kind offer of receiving me at Gore House , and conferring on me the many advantages such a residence must insure ; but I fear my stay in England will be too short to allow me to accept them more extendedly than in as frequent visits as it will allow me to pay , owa-rd these I look forward with real satisfaction and an ticipated gratitude .

MATTHIAS took the degree of B.A. in Trinity College , Cambridge , in 1774 . The following year he gained the mem bers prize for the best dissertation in Latin prose ; the next year he gained one of the prizes as senior bachelor .

In 1781 he published " Runic Odes , " imitated from the Norse tongue , in 4to . In the controversy concerning the authenticity of the Rowley poems , assisted by Dr. Glynn , he espoused the cause of Chatterton , and expended a great deal of energy in vindicating the young literary impostor in a brochure " On the Evidences , in ternal and external , relating to the Poems attributed to Thomas Rowley , " in 8vo , in 1783 . In 1794 he published the first part of an anonymous poem , " The Pursuits of Literature , " which was eventually compiled in four parts . This work attracted universal notice , chiefly on account of the extensive arid erudite notes , which abounded with evidences of varied learning and scholastic attainments , combined with a bit ter spirit of sarcastic criticism , arrayed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guise of a constitutional and Christian zeal against revolutionary principles , and infidel or unorthodox opinions . The leading Whigs of the times were castigated by Mr. Mat- /z/ thias with merciless rancor , but with signal ability . The chiefs of Toryism , 011 the other hand , were incensed , till the atmos phere around them reeked with eulogistic vapor , and the swing of the censer became monotonously wearisome and ennuyant . Several other works appeared in succession from 1794 to 1832. * Matthias had some peculiarities of an amusing character , or petits ridicules , - which Lady Blessington has duly recorded in her Italian diaries . His memory was peculiarly tenacious at din ner-time in regard to dates , of early productions of vegetables , the first appearance of certain meats in the season ; he was re minded , at the first sight of green peas on the table , of the par ticular day on which he had partaken of them the preceding year . It was the same with spring fowl , game , asparagus ; and as each entremet was offered to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! what a delicious dish ! God bless my soul ! " Another of poor Mr. Matthias s peculiarities was a terror that had got possession of his mind of being driven over by the corricolos which dash along the streets of Naples . He has been often seen posted at the corners of streets for a considerable time , anxiously looking out for a favorable oppor tunity to make a dart across the street with security to his per son , trying to muster courage to make the dreaded rush , or wait ing for some charitable passenger to give an arm to him ; and frequently , when half across , he has been known to make a sud- * In 1794 he published anonymously , " The Imperial Epistle from Kien Long to George the Third ; " in 1795 , " The Political Dramatist of the House of Com mons ; " in 1796 , " Letter to the Marquis of Buckingham , chiefly on the subject of the numerous French Emigrant Priests , " by a Layman ; in 1798 , " The Shade of Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satirical poem , occasioned chiefly , but not wholly , by the residence there of the Right Honorable Henry Grattan ; in 1798 , " Odes , English and Latin " ( new edition ) ; in 1802 , " Componimenti lyrici di piu illustri Poetici d ltalia , " in 3 vols. 12mo ; in 1802 , " Commentari intorno all Istoria della Pocsia Italiani , " per Crescimbeni , 3 vols. 12mo ; in 1805 , " Canzoni e prosa Toscane ; " in 1808 , " Agguinta al componimenti lyrici de pue illus tri Poeti d ltalia , " 3 vols. small 8vo ; in 1809 , " Saffa Drama lyrica tradotto delP Inglese de Mason , " in 8vo ; in 1812 , " Licidi , de Giovanni Milton , tradotta dal Inglese , " in 8vo .

The lady who presented me took the privilege of intimate friend ship to call at an unusual hour , and we found the old church man in his slippers , over his breakfast , with two immense tor toise-shell cats , upon stools , watching his hand for bits of bread , and purring most affectionately . He looks like one of Titian s pictures . His face is a wreck of commanding features , and his eye seems less to have lost its fire than to slumber in its deep socket .

" Napoli , li 16 Maggio , 1825. " /z/ COUNT MATUSCHEWITZ played an important part in the great diplomatic performances of the northern powers some thirty years ago . He was a brother actor of Count Pozzo di Borgo , Prince Paul Esterhazy , Metternich , and the Baron Bulow , on some memorable occasions at a later period . On the accomplishment of the French Revolution of 1830 , which came like a thunder-clap on the courts of Europe , the capital of England became the head-quarters of the councils of the diplomatic representations of the principal great powers With a view to the restoration of the balance of power , or the regulation at least of the recent disturbance of the European system , Talleyrand , Pozzo di Borgo , Esterhazy , Matuschewitz , and others , occasionally met at Baron Bulow s , whose opinions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which a little later took the title of the Hollando-Belgian Conferences . Count Matuschewitz was a native of Poland , of noble birth , who had been educated in France , and was a distinguished pupil of the Polytechnic School . When the Emperor Alexander and Napoleon were on terms of amity , the former requested the services of two of the pupils of the Polytechnic of most merit . /z/ Matuschewitz was one of the two pupils chosen by Napoleon to correspond to the wishes of the autocrat . In the Russian civil service he bore out fully the high repu tation he had gained at the Polytechnic , not only as a distin guished scholar and proficient especially in the abstract sciences , but in diplomacy . But he was a lover of pleasure , and his rul ing passion is said to have been for the chase . He sometimes , at the seat even of diplomatic conferences , made his appear ance on horseback , uniting in his costume and character the modern Nimrod with the Russian Nestor of diplomacy . In the diplomatic career which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia at the court of Stockholm , his reputation for astuteness , penetration , tact , and ability stood ex tremely high with the other European ministers . He had spent much time in England , and acquired the tastes , habits , and man ners of an Englishman . He is said to have largely enjoyed the confidence of the Emperor of Russia , to have been deeply versed in the secrets of Russian policy , and in all great emergencies of state in which relations with foreign powers were concerned to have been consulted by the autocrat . Bearing in mind the po sition he occupied , and the advantages it bestowed on him , his letters will be read with interest . The high character of the count for honorable principles and integrity , his easy manners and gentlemanlike deportment , his cultivated mind and tastes , made him a welcome guest in the best society of every country he visited . /z/ " Stockholm , Nov. 5 , 1839 .

" I will not allow Mr. Keppel Craven to leave Naples for good old England without availing myself of his kind offer to take over a letter to you . Indeed , I can not mention his name , and not return you once more my most sincere thanks for the way in which you have been so kind as to recommend me to him . He is no less agreeable than well-informed , no less obliging and indul gent than interesting and instructive in his conversation . You will have un doubtedly the greatest pleasure in seeing him in England , but we can not well spare him here ; and as you abound in resources of pleasant society , which are extremely scanty at Naples , I trust you will not charge me with egotistical cant and unfriendly feelings if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give you satisfaction gives me unfeigned regret . I have found Naples in mourning for the young queen , without any thing like social amusements , or even social spirit without even St. Charles s Theatre , which is shut up , or the usual mildness and beauty of the climate ; added to which , my bankers here have failed , and stripped me of a good sum of money ; part of my establishment has been shipwrecked , and at the moment I am writing to you , reminiscences of yours come again upon me . It is not consistent , therefore , with human nature that I should feel the least prepossessed in favor of Na ples . Still , I have experienced considerable pleasure in admiring its beautiful situation , in visiting its very picturesque environs , and especially in examin ing those wonderful monuments of antiquity , which , independent of their mag- /z/ nificence and exquisite taste , carry one two thousand years back so complete ly and so magically as to make one fancy one s self a contemporary of the most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall always maintain a journey to Naples to be a delightful one , and some stay in that country not only to be pleasant , but necessary to complete one s classical edu cation , and one s notions of former grandeur with all its peculiarities , cus toms , and usages . But , much as I esteem and delight in Craven , I could not , like him , fix myself at Naples . There is no native society to be found ; one is therefore thrown back forcibly upon foreigners , and too often obliged to live , as it were , in a sort of anteroom to London , Paris , Vienna , or Petersburgh . Even in the best years , good society is but transient ; and it stands to reason , that when one has to associate with strangers to the country , it is next to im possible to form long friendships or durable connections . Under these cir cumstances , you will not be surprised to hear of my not intending to take root among the Lazarones , and though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , I feel much more inclined to shorten than to protract my sojourn in the south . With you the Whigs seem to have it all their own way ; I could never un derstand upon what foundations the Conservative papers had foretold , about three months ago , the present administration s immediate downfall ; and I verily think the Conservatives , since they can not upset it , had much better try , by a timely coalition , to rescue the ministers from the necessity of looking for occasional support to the Radicals , and of framing some measure for that purpose . Every danger might be averted from the country by such a course ; too disinterested , perhaps , to be expected from any political party , but still , in my humble opinion , the safest and wisest to follow . There is a great deal of natural conservatism growing out from the possession of power , and growing the more as that possession is lengthened and confirmed . Besides which , ex cept upon one question , the real differences of opinion do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can not help thinking the min isters would not hesitate between Peel and O Connell , Stanley and Hume , and feel much more inclined to come to a rational compromise with the former , than to endanger perpetually their own authority by yielding to the destruct ive impulses of the latter . However , you will perhaps consider my observa tions as the mere effect of the distance at which I am writing , and not the least applicable to the actual state of affairs . I shall therefore drop the sub ject , not without begging you to remember me to E.

He was almost the only man fitted to uphold the dignity of the state . But the prince , according to the " Times , " was of an overbearing and arrogant temper , and he relied , to an absurd extent , on military force as the mainspring of his government . /z/ Another writer , perhaps more intimately acquainted with German state matters ( Mr. " VV .

" /z/ MONSIEUR EUGENE SUE , a native of Paris , the author of " Les Mysteres de Paris , " " Mathilde , " " Le Juif Errant , " " Memoircs d un Valet-de-Charnbre , " " L Art dc Plaire , " " Deleytar , " " La Vegre de Hoat-ven , " " Therese Dunoycr , " " L Institutrice , " &c.,; is a strange compound of credulity and imposition ; a man of strong Republican principles , united with the most luxurious tastes . His manners in society , like those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally retiring . His sentiments are , for the most part , generous , and , in many cases , his judg ments are just , but , like many of his order , not guided by fixed principles of religion and morality . He sees clearly , and de scribes graphically , the evils and disorders of a corrupt state of society , without being able to discern the true cause of the evil , or to indicate a remedy for them . He ever dallies , however , with some new political theory , that is ultimately found to be impracticable and Utopian . To human will and human wisdom alone he looks for the removal of all the ills that belong to poor /z/ humanity . For some years he held the first place in public opinion among the novel-writers of his day and nation . His " Mysteres de Paris " and " Juif Errant " abound with evidences of genius , but , unfortunately , with evidences also of another kind ; the first-mentioned work with ample proofs of tendencies to in flame and to excite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform , social and administrative ; while the obvious aim and settled purpose of the other produc tion is to foster the prevailing opinions of two large classes of his countrymen , the literary and philosophical Radicals and the Socialists , against religion and its members generally , and the members of one of the religious orders in particular . Though still in the prime of life , his latter works , strange to say , are below mediocrity . The character and peculiarities of the Count D Orsay furnished the author with the idea of the hero of his production , " Le Viscomte de Letocere , ou L Art de Plaire . " He has entirely abandoned Paris , where he formerly resided with great extravagance , and now lives wholly retired from the world , in the territory called La Soligne , near the Lake d Annesy . The descriptions in Sue s " Mysteres de Paris , " like the scenes in " The Monk , " by Lewis , " ought to have been written by Tiberius , at Caprea ; they are forced the filtered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced the metier of a literary social reformer substituting sensualismc effrenee for liberty of conscience , and the rant of an infidel philosophy for religion Monsieur Sue wrote some stupid books , which no one read or bought ; and among these , a " History of the French Navy , " which nearly ruined his bookseller . The Socialists , in 1848 and 1849 , fool ishly imagined they had found a powerful ally , and sincere ad herent to their cause , in the author of " The Mysteries of Paris " and " The Wandering Jew . " Some clap-trap passages in those works in favor of Communist doctrines procured him a seat , in 1849 , in the French National Assembly . Universal suffrage was at once dishonored and deceived by the selection of the sensualist literati in the domino of a Socialist . Monsieur Sue /z/ had promulgated a doctrine which rendered him extremely pop ular : " No one had any right to superfluity while any one was in want of necessaries . " A theory so plausible and so plainly enunciated it was imag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propounder in the frugal simplicity of his mode of life . The poor Socialists were deceived by the author of " Les Mysteres de Paris . " The sensualist had mystified the Socialists . Monsieur Auguste Johanet , in a brochure entitled " Verites Sociales , Inconnues ou Meconnues , " has given us a description of Eugene Sue s mode of living , and of his mansion in the man or and park of Des Bordes : " It is impossible to convey an idea of this luxury , of the sumptuousness of those caprices , of those whims of all kinds : here a dining-room , where the sideboards display plate , porce lain , and crystal , with pictures and flowers , to add to the pleas ures of the table all the pleasures of the eyes ; then an inner gallery , where pictures , statuettes , drawings , and engravings reproduce subjects the most calculated to excite the imagination . Here is a library full of antiquities , whose book-cases contain works bound with unheard-of luxury , where objects of art are multiplied with an absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say they came there naturally . A day light , shaded by the painted glass windows , and curtains of the richest stuff , gives to this place an air of mystery , invites to si lence and to study , and produces those eccentric inspirations which M. Sue gives to the public . A desk , richly carved , re ceives sundry manuscripts of the romance-writer , . the numerous homages sent to Monsieur , as the valet expresses himself , from all the corners of the globe , and which the faithful servant enu merates with the most scrupulous care . Every where may be seen gold , silver , silk , velvet , and soft carpets . Every where taste and art tax their ingenuity in a thousand ways to produce effect , ornament , and domestic enjoyments . A vast drawingroom , furnished and decorated with all imaginable care , exact ly reproduces that of one of the heroines of romance of Mon sieur Eugene Sue ; and there have been carved on the wood- /z/ work of a Gothic mantel-piece medallions representing the Mad eleine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that her sins will be forgiven her because her love has been strong . An immense looking-glass connects this salon with a green house , filled with exotic shrubs and trees , and it is lighted at night with magnificent lustres . The walls are highly decorated , and gold and silver fish are seen swimming in marble basins . In addition to the lustres , there are candelabra for bougies , mixed with the foliage of the trees and plants , to increase the effect when the place is lighted up . A small gallery , lined with odo riferous plants , leads to a circular walk , which surrounds a gar den cultivated in the most expensive manner , and there is a fine piece of water , with numerous swans on it . " The walk is a chefd ozuvre of comfort , for it is alike protect ed from the wind and the rain , being covered with a dome . It is inclosed with balustrades , covered with creeping plants of the choicest nature . It is a sort of a terrestrial paradise in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park , admirably laid out with kiosques , rustic cottages , elegant bridges , and a pre serve for pheasants , which secures myriads of birds for the shooting excursions of the illustrious communist , whose keepers exercise a severe look-out to prevent any person from touching the game . The out-buildings show the same elegance . There is a splendid court-yard leading to the stables for carriage-horses , one of which has his name , Paradox , marked over his stall . The woodwork is richly painted and varnished , with an infinity of brass ornaments . Near this place is a box , exclusively de voted to the favorite mare of citizen Eugene Sue , the famous Good Lady ; it is furnished with even more elegance . The harness is kept in the finest order , and there is a communication from the harness-room to the green-houses . The dog-kennels are in the same luxurious style as the stables . Many workmen would think themselves happy to have such habitations . In a walk round the reserved grounds , we convinced ourselves that the walks were carefully kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author to repose upon in his meditations ; but the tenants of the environs do not appear to derive any advantage /z/ from the vicinity of the great apostle of progress and ameliora tion . Several of the houses are badly roofed , and the walls are cracked , and the houses are on a level with the marshy soil , covered with manure , which gives the inhabitants the ague during two thirds of the year . On the other hand , however , there is a profuse distribution of little books , such as the Berger de Kravan , and other Socialist publications . " * Madame de Stael s observation to a lady on visiting her in a villa very much decorated , and rather too sumptuously furnish ed , " Ma chere , vous avez trop de luxe , " might have been ad dressed to Eugene Sue on entering his splendid mansion , and likewise to Lady Blessington in every abode of hers , from the period of her second marriage to the time of the break-up at Gore House . The poor Socialists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene Sue , " No one had any right to superfluity while any one was in want of necessa ries , " might well say to their theoretical champion , " Mon cher Sue , vous avez trop de luxe : donnez nous qui sont en la misere , de ces superfluites , a lesquelles vous n avez aucurie titre.

His father , Charles ( Fermier General ) , perished on the scaffold , as did like wise his grandfather , Adrian , in 1794 . They had lent the enor mous sum of four millions of francs to the royal family in 1792 : a million and a half to the aunts of Louis the Sixteenth , then in Rome ; half a million to the brothers of the king , emigrants in Germany ; and two millions to the king himself , previously to the disastrous 10th of August . The present viscount commenced his literary career in 1818 , by the publication of his poem , " La Caroleide , " of which Char lemagne is the hero . " Le Solitaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1822 ; " Ibsibo , " in 1823 ; " L Etrangere , " in 1825 ; " Le Siege de Paris , " in 1826 , which was performed thirty nights consecutively at the Theatre Frangais ; " Les Ptebelles sous Charles V. , " in 1831 , a romance in verse ; " Les Ecorcheurs , ou 1 Usurpation et la Peste , " published in 1833 ; " Le Brasseur Roi , " in 1834 ; " Le Double Regne , " in 1835 ; " L Herbagere , " in 1836 ; " Les trois Chateaux , " in 1840 ; " Ida , " in 1841 ; " Le Pelerin , " in 1842 ; " L Etoile Polaire , " in 1843 ; and his great work ( if the author s opinion of its merits be well founded ) , " Les Trois Royaurnes , " of a later date . The Viscount D Arlincourt made a starring tour of Europe in 1840 , 1841 , 1842 , providing for the translation of his works , and attributing to his success " les @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viscount has traveled much over Europe , and wherever he has been , his position in society , in literature , and the political cal affairs of the elder branch of the French Bourbons has ob tained for him a flattering reception . He was much about the court ( and in the councils , he gives us to understand ) of Louis the Eighteenth and Charles the Tenth . Their dynasty went down , but the attachment to it of the viscount remained un changed , and the light of his loyalty he has not allowed to re main hid under a bushel , or , indeed , any of the shining lights /z/ which adorn his intellectual character . The viscount has writ ten many works , feeling impelled to write by the cravings of an appetite quite insatiable for praise . He is the author of several ephemeral articles , literary and political , and some dramas , which are dead and d d . In principles the viscount is an uncompromising legitimist ; in literature he is a sort of La Bruyere . He mingles the charac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possesses considerable shrewdness and finesse , sarcastic wit , and a natural penchant for romantic incidents . The intensity of his vanity , personal and literary , does not prevent his according praise lib erally , or rather profusely , to others in the upper regions of lit erary society . His works have a certain interest , derived , per haps , to a great extent , from the combination of a taste for im aginative fiction and romance , remarkable astuteness , and wis dom of a worldly kind , advantageously exhibited in them . This was particularly the case in his earlier productions , at a time when light and imaginative literature in France was much rarer than it now is , and possessed also less vigor than at present . His works generally , if they made their appearance now , would hardly obtain the character they have acquired . The viscount , however , it must be admitted , is a graceful writer , with a great facility of expression , and an epigrammatic turn that gives a terseness to his descriptions and observations . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks , polished at the same time in his delivery and manner . He possesses an im mense fund of anecdote , and relates well . Altogether , the vis count is looked upon by those intimately acquainted with him as a good and rare specimen of the accomplished gentleman of the old French school , of amenity dignified by mental culture and enlightened by liberal pursuits .
