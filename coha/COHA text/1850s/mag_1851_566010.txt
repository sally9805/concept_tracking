SAMUEL HARRIS , Con way , Mass . The Mission of the Church ; or , AS*gstematic Benevolence . By Rev. EDWARD A. LAWRENCE , Marblehead , Mass . All published by the American Tract Society , 150 Nassau street , New York . THE American Board has recently published the forty-first nunal report of its missionary operations . Prom the table of receipts which is annexed , we can ascertain by a glance what has been the actual increase of contributions for the support of this great Christian enterprise during the whole period of its existence . Dividing the time in which this Society has been erriloyed in the work of Missions into periods of ten years , it appears that in the second and third of these periods , there was an increase of two hundred and of two hundred and fifty per cent . In 1830 , the contributions were double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two and a half times greater than those of 1830 . But the next ten years exhibit no corresponding advance so far from it , the contributions of the three successive years , 1841 , 1842 , and 1843 , furnish a larger sum than those of the last three years . The natural inference from these facts is , that these ten years evince a diminution of interest in the missionary cause among those who sustain this Society . Before assenting to this conclusion , however , it might be proper to enquire , whether the number of contributors has diminished , or other causes have operated to divert the charities of the Congregational and Presbyterian churches , once connected with the Board , into other channels . Without the means at hand of authenticating our statements , we feel warranted in saying that the number of churches and individuals who now contribute to the funds of the Board is // not less than in any preceding year of its history . The " slavery agitation " has undoubtedly diverted the charities of churches in New England and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevails . But with a few exceptions , the contributors who withhold their funds from the Board for this reason are not of the class which had become deeply interested in Missionary operations . We may safely assume that the places of those who have *vithdrawn to unite with other organizations have been supplied by the additions to the churches that sustain the Board , aud by the accession of new pat roris . The diminution of patrons will not , we think , explain the facts before us . We are also confident that there is no lack of resources to carry forward all the enterprises of Christian benevolence that now claim the pecuniary aid of the churches . New objects have arisen , and existing societies have been asking larger donations but these claims have not multiplied as rapidly as the ability ta meet them . The increase of wealth in the older states , and especially in New York and Massachusetts , has been almost without precedent . The returns of the state valuation of Massachusetts show an annual increase of about twelve per cent . since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fall much short of this ratio . The members of our churches have participated in this prosperity ; so that the actual ability of the churches in the most favored states must have doubled , and in all the states there must be an approximation to this condition . No computations are required to show that there has been no corresponding increase in the number of objects of Christian benevo* lence , or in the amount contributed to sustain them . An exact estimate of all the monies which they have received in this period would riot exceed two hundred thotisand dollars . We must , therefore , assent to the conclusions of the Secretaries of the Board , when they say , " that the new objects which have arisen have by no means exhausted the resources of the churches . " An examination of the history of other societies-stich as the Bible , rrract and Home Missionary Societies-which enjoy the confidence of the Christian community , and by actual experiment have shown themselves well adapted to the several departments of Christian efforts in which they labor , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abtindant ability on the part of those who are , and of those who ought to be , their patrons . Still the directors of these institutions are frequently embarrassed by the want of funds to carry on the work and meet the demand for more enlarged operations . these embarrassments are often greatly aggravated by the fluctuations in their receipts . To remedy the evils resulting from this cause , recourse has been had to special efforts . As might be anticipated , the frequency vith which these efforts have been made , has impaired their effect ; so // that the utility of them has become exceedingly doubtful . This forcing system is attended by a twofold disadvantage ; by a dis astrous reaction on the part of those who endeavor to answer the application , and by great practical inconvenience to all whose charities are regulated by a definite and predetermined plan . These objections are so serious that we are persuaded the direc* tors of our benevolent institutions will soon decide , that retrenchment is preferable to this method of sustaining their operations . Shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of missionary and kindred institutions , that the Christian public is less interested in them than at a former period ? No direct answer to this question could correspond with the actual facts that meet our observation . An opinion formed from a compari* son of the receipts of these societies with the actual ability of the churches , must lead any one to feel tliat Christians are riot becoming more benevolent . Many of the proposed plans of re* trenchment , such as the reduction of salaries , and the relinquishment of the services of agents , seem to confirm this opinion . On the other hand , if we consider the increased attention which these several departments of Christian effort now secure , as appears from the immense numbers that attend the anniversary meetings , and the very general knowledge of their operations which is disseminated gratuitously by secular as well as religious newspapers , we should decide that the objects never occupied a higher place in the public esteem . In general , the members of churches are better acquainted with the design and operations of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , the reports of these societies are securing a more extensive circulation . It must , however , be admitted that this increase of intelligence has not been attended by a corresponding increase in the depth and earnestness of the missionary spirit . Christians know more about the religious destitution of our country and the w*ants of the heathen world , but they are not correspondingly intent on supplying those necessities . This may in part be accounted for on the well known principle that familiarity with great evils diminishes the impression of their serious nature . rphe romance of missions , as has been said , is passed away . We know much better than ever before what is involved in the labors of missionary life . Our friends and members of our own churches are engaged in the work . It consequently has less of the sacredness of a peculiar consecration in our minds . The mode of planting churches in the newly settled states is redticed to a system . We can compute the time arid labor and money requisite to translate and print the Bible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a sailor to be a temperate or a pious man . The field of missionary effort has to a great extent been actually surveyed , and the magnitude of the work has in many of its aspects // become more exact and definite . The practicability of Christian* izing heathen nations is now well established . The necessary consequence of this knowledge is to diminish the curiosity and the intense interest with which the earliest labors in these enterprises were regarded . There may not be less need of faith at the present stage of the missionary work than at the outset , but this faith must be occupied with a different aspect of the subject . Again , it is worthy of notice in this connection that the attention of Christians has been very much engrossed with absorbing ques* tions of a political and moral nature , and these still continue to agitate and distract their minds . The discussion of such topics as war and slavery , especially in the practical form which they assume in our country , must always be attended with great warmth of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the time , other questions of duty are disregarded , and the cahn tone demanded in the adjustment of personal obligations to the Savior in other relations , is lost . Whatever opinion may be entertained concerning the necessity of discussing these exciting themes , it can not be denied that the debate has been conducted at the sacrifice of much feeling that might otherwise have been concentrated on the enterprises of benevolence . In some instances , churches and other ecclesiastical bodies have been rent asunder by the violence of the controversy ; and the contest for the right has made men forgetful of what is charitable . Another cause that has operated to the disadvanta e of our benevolent societies will be found in the peculiar financial condition of the country . Within the last ten years , immense sums have been invested in the construction of railroads , and public works of similar character . rphe capital required in building these roads has not been furnished alone by the wealthiest of our citizens . The stock in the first instance was not taken merely by capitalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who constitute the working classes of our inland towns . The ready and large incomes realized on the roads that were first constructed , made this an eminently popular mode of investment with those who could lay aside small sums at a time from their earnings . Money was also withdrawn from savings banks , private loans were refused , and all available resources were converted into stocks . Before the roads were completed , or the means of their completion were furnished , the loans required by the government to carry on the Mexican war , produced an unexpected stringency in the money market of our cities . Capitalists preferred government securities to the bonds of private corporations , so that great difficulty was experienced in raising the means of paying railroad installments and meeting the ordinary demands of business , it is unnecessary to present in detail the consequences of the financial crisis , which in the end has fallen most severely on the inhabitants of our XOL 1K 3 // country towns . It is sufficient for our purpose to show , that these enterprises which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all the available capih I of our citizens . This expenditure in connection with the loans above mentioned and the drafts that have been made in the sudden and hurried outfits of the numbers who have rushed upon the gold regions of California , left very little money in circulation in the to*vns of the country . Men of business and others who were in easy circumstances have been constantly straitened . Disappointed in the returns of their investments now rendered unproductive because incomplete , they have been obliged to pay high rates of interest to keep themselves from bankruptcy . In this state of affairs , the annual collections in the separate congregations would be small because the contributors , however wealthy , had no money to spare . This has been the condition of multitudes who might otherwise have given liberally to forward the cause of the Redeemer . Having invested all their previous earnings , they were comparatively poor , when deprived of the income of their investrnents . As most persons are in the habit of giving in charity without much forethought , and as applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donations as may be convenient at . the time . The amount bestowed is no true criterion of their prosperity , perhaps , not of their benevolent feeling ; for the times when capital is most occupied , or , in other words , when business is flourishing , they are most likely to have no money on hand . In a new country where great enterprises are yet in progress and capital is scarce , the rapid development of natural and manufactured products requires that a large business be managed with a small currency . This statement will sufficiently explain what has probably been true of many thriving New England towns within a twelve month , that while its inhabitants might own property to the amount of three or five hundred thousand dollars , the ready money in their hands would be less than one . We have not adduced these facts to furnish any defence for the indifference and remissness with which the claims of benevolence are dismissed by a majority of professed Christians . We desire most emphatically to express the conviction , that God will hold men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth as of any talent whatever . Our aim in the precedin* considerations has been to illustrate the necessity of introducing a systematic plan into the efforts of our benevolence . Something , that shall relieve the directors of our missionary and kindred societies from the painful embarrasments attending the present disastrous fluctuations in their receipts . Something , that will develop and strengthen the principles of benevolence in the hearts of Christians . Something , which shall secure the adoption of such methods as will impart // to their charities the regularity and system that prevail in the transactions of business . It was to meet this necessity and induce the friends of the Redeemer to act upon system in their religious charities , that the prize was offered which called forth the treatises that are named at the head of this article . We most heartily commend the forecast arid generosity which proposed it . It evinced a true perception of the real deficiency in the habits and views of professed Christians . And in future years , we doubt not , this appropriation xviii l ) produce an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same design , we propose to offer some thoughts on the contents of these volumes , without , however , confining our remarks to the exact limits of a connected review . We regard it as a peculiar merit of these publications , that they set the duties of benevolence before our churches in a practical light . They assert with distinctness , what the history of our benevolent operations fully illustrates , that Christians must be educated to the work of sustaining missions and other enterprises for the conversion of men . A large proportion of the members of our churches are living without any suitable impression of their obligations to use their property as stewards of God . The subject has not been discussed with much frequency in the pulpit . To many pastors , the positions illustrated in these volumes will seem strange ; if they are not regarded as tintrustwormhy . An enquiry into the sources of the contributions which are made in the most intelligent of our New England congregations , would show , that large numbers do not acknowledge the obligations of Christian benevolence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship ; while , in some districts , the xv hole subject is neglected , unless the congregations are visited by agents in behalf of the established charities . We have painful evidence of the truth of our assertions , when we say , that a majority of church members are yet uniustructed in the duty of systematic charity . Indeed any other supposition xvonld , in view of their practice , constitute an impeachment of their piety . On the scriptural rule , enforced in these essays , that God has imposed upon Christians the obligation to contribute statedly for purposes oJ benevolence and in proportion as they are prospered , the conductors of the religions press and the pastors of churches should direct their efforts to the work of training the disciples of Christ in the right use of their property . Hitherto this duty has been very generally overlooked . A few years ago , and the public profession of faith in Christ and of devotion to his service was not supposed to include a virtual consecration of one 's property to the same master . In giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this important subject , and especially in reducing these precepts into habitual practice , these publications of the Tract // Society will do valuable service . They are pervaded with a genial and earnest temper , and written with a direct and businesslike tone . The principles of the Gospel are stated with clearness and concisely illustrated , and their practical application in the conduct of life exposed with unsparing fidelity . No person can read these treatises without an enlargement of his knowledge and a quickening of his religious sensibilities . The treatise of Mr. Lawrence , entitled " the Mission of the Church , " is the largest and most elaborate performance . It embraces a wider field than the others , and to minds unfamiliar with the designs and operations of modern Evangelism , will prove an instructive work . The treatises of Rev. Messrs . Harris and Cook , the one on " the Scriptural Plan of Benevolence , " the other on " the Divine iaxv of Beneficence , " are more simple and direct both in style and arrangement . The authors assume that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and proceed at once to the subject in hand . This is an admirable feature in books designed for general circulation ; especially , if they are to gain the attention of men of business . If we desired to persuade an enterprising merchant or mechanic , who admitted the obligation of honoring *od in his business , to adopt some plan of systematic benevolence , the tract of Mr. Harris would suit our purpose . We are confident that the vi , , orous style and the healthy religions tone of its successive chapters would awakeii the conviction , that such a plan is adapted to promote every valuable end of his existence ; to relieve the cares and perplexities of business from the debasing influences of transactions that have no higher aim than pecuniary advantage ; and to impart to all the labors of the sales room , the exchange and the workshop , the dignity of a service performed for God . If our endeavors were directed to secure a like result with persons of less active habits , less familiar with the claims of our benevolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their operations , we should select " the Divine law of Beneficence " or " the Mission of the Qhnrch . " As these commence with the more common views of this duty , a prejudiced or reluctant mind would be less likely to reject the conclusion to which the argument must conduct it . The mode of approach is more gradual , but the rules at which they arrive are equally elevated and scriptural . In this view of these publications , we think , the public will approve the decision of the Committee to whom the essays were submitted , in dividing the premium among the three w iters , instead of giving the preference to one . The original premium of three hundred dollars was subsequently increased by its author to four hundred , and the sum divided equally by the committee of award among four of the competitors . As the fourth essay was published separately , and in different style , it had not come to harxd when this article was writtew // The question has occurred to us in reading these volumes , whether by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accomplish a greater good than a single work upon a more comprehensive plan . It is clearly a great advantage , that the price of these hooks is such that a copy might be placed in every family of a congregation without a burdensome outlay . We hope that pastors , church officers and wealthy individuals will provide the means to place one or more of these publications in every habitation within the limits of the towns in which they reside . The dissemination of the views presented in these essays will do much towards correcting the evils of which we have previously spoken . While we commend these volumes with confidence in their adaptation to meet an existing and serious want of the Christian community , it will we think occur to ninny readers that a single work , having a broader plan , might be written of greater perrnanent value than these can be . We could wish that Mr. harris had attempted to produce an essay which in its completeness and adaptation to the condition of American Christians , should correspond with the admirable treatise of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that ought to be reproduced in the form of an appeal to wealthy Christians in America . In saying this , however , we can easily see how the modesty of these authors would naturally deter them from entering on a field so ably occupied . But , still , we hope that either they or others will be guided in the preparation of a work which shalt cover the whole ground of Christian obligation in the tise of property . Such a discussion is needed to elucidate the just and practicable method of sustaining the Gospel . The practice of churches and the decisions of ecclesiastical bodies differ both in regard to the principles of this duty and the mode of their application . In many instances the Gospel is very inadequately sustained , because there is no common rule respecting the mode of supporting the ministry . The burden is distributed very unequally . Where the expenses incident to the support of the institutions of religion are defrayed by a tax on the pews , there is no l ) ractical recognition of the New rllestamerit rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gospel , the work of sustaining the ministry , in common with other religious appropriations , requires that the strong aid the xveak . This is the ground of every effective appeal in behalf of Home Missions ; but the principle that binds a church in Connecticut to aid a feeble body of disciples in Iowa , ought surely to have a practical influence on the several members of this stronger church in their treatment of each other . But the attempt to enforce the execution of a more equal systemn has in most cases been unsuccessful . With the increase of their means men often lose the disposition // to use them liberally . This point is well presented by Mr. Cook , and we make the quotation as a fair specimen of his style and a good illustration of our position . " We have often seen those who , when in comparative poverty , were generous with their little , but who have become penurious in becoming rich . While their means were small , their outgoes trod close on the heels of their incomes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion to that of receiving , and the passion for accumulating had not room to spread its roots . But when the gains began sensibly to advance beyond the outgoes , a habit was formed of calculating how long it would take to reach such and such a sum ; and with no active principle of benevolence proportionally counterworking the growing passion for gains , every little increase served to feed the passion , and every call for charities was resisted , because it postponed the time of reaching the proposed amount to be laid in . Aware of this principle of human nature , divine wisdom has given the caution , If riches increase , set not your heart upon them ; ' hinting to us that the setting of the heart upon them ' is a common result of increase . " I-low many thousands have said in their hearts , 0 if I were as rich as such a one , how would I multiply the streams of roy bounty ; I would do nothing else than employ my wealth in doing good . But all such talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expose you to the fiercer heats of temptation , con*uining all benevolent affections . The process of increasing wealth , without the outgoes of benevolence , is a process of confirming a feeling of poverty , a grasping desire for more , which like the grave will be ever crying , Give , give . A case has been known of a man at the age of threescore and ten with his hundred thousand doll* rs , free from debt , and well invested , and yet crying like a child in apprehension of a possible experience of poverty . And this state of feeling was induced by a most n* tural process , by a mind given up to the passion of accumulating , without the counter-process of disjibutin* . This is an invariable result of human experience in like circumstances , and it shows the importance of some law of conduct to keep our benevolent activities in use . Our condition is like that of a leaky vessel , which needs the conatant labor of the pump in throwing out , to prevent its being sebmerged. " - DiVnie Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting in the church , of persons who have become avaricious by this very process . And when with the accumulation of property , they become less ready to sustain the institutions of religion , there ought to be power in the church to correct so palpable and injurions a dereliction of duty . The offense , however , will seldom be made the subject of discipline , because the opinions of Christians are so at variance respecting the nature and extent of their obligations in the use of property . The cause of Christ in iuinny of our congregations is suffering reproach because of the tolerance of these offenses ; in others , they are the occasion of strife and divisions . To remove these offenses , we need such a discussion as will settle the leading principles of religious obligation  --  a discussion which will secure substantial agreement among the members of our churches in respect to what may rightfully be required of professors of religion . Let this subject be fairly edjusted according to the instructions of the Nev Testament , and the united sentiments of the churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be glad to see a more full and comprehensive work on this subject , because of the very intimate relation between the proper use of wealth and the future *e11*io us prosperity of our country . If no extraordinary hindrances shall arise to obstruct the increase of our wealth , it is plain , that the people of this laud will soon attain an unprecedented rank , both in the amount and the general diffusion of property . Every day opens new and lucrative field , of enterprise , while all the established modes of gain furnish an average return of profits unknown in other parts of the world . Of course wealth becomes a powerlid incentive to industry , and furnishes the foundation of dis tinctious in society . What then shall prevent a passion so con* genial to the habits and spirit of our countrymen from becoming the prevailing au ' *bition of all ? What shall hinder it from invading the enclosures of the church ud secretly corroding the vitaL of her piety ? The grandeur of our enterprises and the rapidity of our accumulation , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor it , by the inculcation of economy and indus* try . No one needs to be told , that the economical lessons of our fathers have often nurtured parsimony and covetousness in the bosoms of their sons . Now what shall check this tendency and convert a debasing because penurious toil into the exercise of a munificent and ennobling course of action ? Nothing less than the liberalizing and benevolent reachinas of the New Testament . rIle love of accumulation , always strong , is fostered by peculiar influences among professing Christians . they are not expected to lead in the fashions of wciety , they are sheltered from most of the temptations to extravagance , and in this condition they will assuredly hoard their gains with an idolatrous affection , unless the passion be counteracted by the constant operation of an enlargi n g beneficence . Unless our benevolent enterprises shall furnish an outlet for our superfluous wealth , and the church shall cordially and promptly second the expenditures that will send the missionary and the Bible , with the means of Christianizing the nations , to the ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be choked in the deluge of cares that accompany covetousness . From this danger , so insidious in its operation and fatal in its consequences , we know of no deliverance , except through the inculcation of systematic and large beneficence . If Christians shall learn to honor God in the distribution of their wealth , through the various channels which divine l ) rovidence may open for enlightening and Christianizing the families of men ; if they shall learn the benignant uses , the spiritual growth , the joy and peace that attend a life of practical benevolence , we know not the limits which shall define the extent of their religious prosperity . Such a course of Christian activity would at once remove some of the most serious obstacles to the success of the Cospel // in our own congregations . It would promote the spirituality of our churches . The cares and labor of business would no longer be regarded as hostile to the interests of religion , if the proceeds of that business were employed as a sacred trust wherewith to honor God . The claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ . The practical antagonism of the two would cease to exist , and the followers of Christ would not regard the labors of their respective callings as a hindrance to their religious progress . When this difficulty shall be removed , the temptations of worldliness will be shorn of half their strength . Mr. Harris has very clearly exhibited the influence of systematic benevolence in securing this end . " Systematic benevolence is a moSt important and an indispensable agency in making business a helper and not a foe to the religious growth . Whm a man acts on this principle , his place of business becomes a Bethel ; every transaction becomes like a renewal of his consecration to God ; money and bills and labor are associated with his obligations to his Master , and fragrant with the memory of the cross ; and like the attraction drawing every part of the earth and binding it to the sun , divine love fastens its attraction on every possession , on every toil , and every gain , and binds him with all that he has to God the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intimate with God not less on the exchange or the farm , than in the closet . Then his whole course of life becomes a help and not a hindrance to his spiritual progress ; and like a healthy child , he grows steadily and unconsciously amid the ceaseless activity of life . " Normand Smith , when roused to a more entire consecration to God , falling in with the common notion that a life of secular business is incompatible with a life of eminent usefulness and piety , seriously purposed to abandon it . But more scriptural views led him to continue in business , consecrating it to God . He put on record the purpose to engage in my business , that I may serve God in it , and with the expectation of getting to give . ' His biographer says , From that time it was observable by all who knew him , that he made rapid progress in religion . There was a fervor and en agedness of spirit , a purity and elevation of aim , that could not be misunderstood or concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . ' From that time lie found no tendency in his worldly engagements to chill his piety , or to enchain his aflbctions to the earth . His business became to him a means of grace , and helped him forward in the divine life , just as truly as reading the Scriptures and prayer . ' " - Scriptural Plan of Benevolence , pp. 67-69 . The benefit is not confined to the heart of the believer ; its fruit will be manifest in removing the objection most frequently alleged against the reality of his piety which is furnished by his worldliness . " No argument , " says the same author , " is oftener urged against religion than that founded on the alleged inconsistencies of its professors . The chief foundation for this plea , so far as it has any , is the conformity of Christians to the world in all the aims , the maxims , and the manner of getting and spending money , so that too commonly , Christians , away from their devotions , can scarce* ly be distinguished from the better sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually obeyed ; let the world behold Christians actuated by the sublime desire to do good in all their gettings and their expenditures , and consecrating spontaneously to the Lord as he bath prospered them ; let it be seen , when men become Christians , by the chance in their pursuit of // earthly* treasure , that they have found a better portion , and now have their hearts and their treasure in heaven ; and the church will stand up before the world with a consistency and elevation of piety which will prove that gainsaying springs only from opposition to goodness-with a triumphant power which will compel the exclamation , " God is in the midst of her ; she shall not be ved ' - with a manifest and practical renunciation of the world , like that which iP the apostles ' days compelled both Jews ahd Gentiles to confess the reality and feel the power of religion , and which , reappearing in the church , Will go far towards restoring the like rapidity and glory to her conquests. " - Jb. , pp. 71 , 72 . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its avowed friends , those living epistles known and read of all men , we may expect large and rapid accessions to their numbers* Coming into the church under the influences of a more harmonious and complete development of Christianity , we may expect the converts of another generation to exhibit a symmetry of character and a power of achievement more in keeping with the design of the Gospel and the fields of usefulness that we are invited to occupy . In such a work as we have proposed we should expect a discussioji of the practical hearings of the principles of Christiati beneficence on the general prosperity of a nation . The salutary influence of Protestantisni in its general operation on the health , industry , and political interests of a country , can hardly be called in question . The statistics furnished by e cry census of England , Scotland , and the states of this Union , are crowded with arguments in favor of the general inculc* tion of the doctrine* of the Bible . We believe the argument may be carried much farther . We believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the history of the Hebrew commonwealth and of Christian states since , would supply the data of some important inferences respecting God 's dealings with nations , that ought not to be overlooked-*-inferences to which politicians and statesmen may well give heed , and which might dispose worldly and irreligious men to regard the institutions , of Christianity in a more favorable light . In this age when the systems of paganism are evidently losing their hold upon the nations , when Oriental researches and scientific investigations are constantly bringing new facts within our knowledge which corroborate the truths of the Bible ; when oppressed nations are groping and struggling unsuccessfully for liberty and discerning minds are enquiring into the causes of our freedom ; when multitudes are entertaining the half-formed conviction that Christianity is identified with national as well as personal prosperity , we ought to take ad antage of the results of those great experiments , which God has permitted the nations to make , to elucidate the application of the truth of His word to the social and political relations of men . In this day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 we should like // to see a more distinct recognition of the operation of the truths of the Bible in promoting the happiness and wealth of nations . It seems to us an interesting fact that the successful competitors for the premium to which we have alluded , are all ministers resident in the same state  --  a state pre*Sminent for the number of its charitable institutions and the magnificence of their endow* ments  --  a state distinguished for the liberality with which the institutions of education and religion are sustained  --  a state that has hitherto been foremost in the amount of her charities for the carrying on of missions and other efforts of evangelism . We have no doubt that these things have had their influence in directing the minds of these authors to the subject which they have treated with such good judgment and success . These publications could not have been written amidst the superstitions sanctioned by Catholicism . They are the products of a Christian* itv which has been illustrated by the practical workings of benev* olence-an instance of that reproductive power by which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the advancement preparing the way for a purer and more complete development of the precepts which Christ taught us . A volume written on the plan which we propose , might trace the effects of appropriations the cause of learning and generous to piety , as they are seen in the character of the population , and in the returns of their industry . We should auticil ) ate that such an enquiry would bring to light new duties for the church to perform , as well as reforms to be executed by the state . We are not of the number who hope to accomplish any great moral good without self-denial ; still we have long thought that the Gospel con* tains the germs of all salutary and permanent reforms ; that more or less directly every successful endeavor to cure or remove the miseries of sin might be traced to that source ; that the sacrifices required by religion are not the appropriate fruit of her benignant nature , but the sufferings incidental to the works she must per form . We do not suppose that any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ucid demonstration of this identity between the principles of Christianity and his own present as well as future interest . But such a demonstration might disabuse many minds of prejudice and groundless objections , while a conviction of this truth would make the followers of Christ more hopeful and hearty in their endeavors to enter every new field of Christian effort , and to improve every opportunity of fulfilling the Savior 's commandments . Why should the church always act in her encounters with the enemies of the Gospel , as if the God of providence was not the God of the Bible , or as if fidelity to the one forbade our profiting or taking courage in the aids that are furnished by the other ? The lessons of the Old Testament history give us the key by which to interpret the developments of all subse // quent history . And in the conflicts of the present life we need the instruction which would attend a similar recognition of the hand of God in the events of later times . In how many instances might the spiritual desolations over which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prevalence of a covetousness that has robbed Jehovah in tithes and offerings . We have no desire to countenance any hasty inferences on a subject so serious . But an induction founded on a wide scale of careful observations , would afford confirmation of many declarations of Scripture more worthy of confidence than many of the things accredited as facts of science . We rejoice in the indications that pastors and churches are recognizing more clearly the intimate connection between the religio us use of property and the spiritual prosperity of its possessors . We thank God that , here and there in cities and towns , are found individuals who , like Normand Smith , are endeavoring to manage their business in conformity with the rules of the New Testament . We hail this knowledge as the promise of a purer al ) d more aggressive Christianity . To those who have not given mtich attention to this subject , we urgently recommend these volumes . If any one is doubtful as to the correctness of our positions , especially if any minister is hesitating about pressing the claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask him to read the third chapter of Mr. Lawrence 's essay , from which we make the subjoined extracts . " Too much may have been presumed on the knowledge of Christians respecting the use which God requires them to make of their property , and consequently , in the prosecution of their husiness , they have , through ignorance , been exposed to the growth of a covetous spirit , with the increase of their possessions . From motives of delicacy , religious teachers who receive their support from the voluntary suhscriptions of their people , may have shrunk from the same degree of explicitness upon this subject which they have felt to be necessary in respect to other Christian duties . And the difficulty which some pastors have experienced in securing the full amount of their support , or the consciousness that when received it was inaddquate for this purpose , has increased the embarrassment . " And many hearers , who have been ready to applaud the clearest and fullest exposition of dogmatic truth , have sometimes evinced a remarkable sensitiveness to any direct application of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accredited orthodoxy , and lend their approval to the rebukes of all heresy , except that of believing that their money is their own , and that they may expend it as they please , without let or hindrance . That such has been the feeling of not a few hearers , and such the condition of some pastors , is quite certain ; and as a natural consequence , many churches that have been thoroughly taught in respect to other Christian doctrines and duties , have failed to receive due instruction upon the subject of Christian beneficence " - Systematic Beneficence , pp. 116 , 117 . " The specific for a pastor to starve himself away from his people , is to decline instructing them in the duty of benmfcence , and to withhold from them a knowledge of the wants of a perishing world . By such a comirse , he injures both them and himself , and dishonors his Master . his people are entitled to // instruction . It is his duty to give it to them . This should enter as an important element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will be covetous , let them know that no " covetou man , who is an idolater , hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God . " If they refuse to deny themselves , they should u derstand that self-denial is the condition of disciple hip , and that they have turned away from the cross , sorrowf 1 , , it may be-* -- yet they HAVE turned away .
