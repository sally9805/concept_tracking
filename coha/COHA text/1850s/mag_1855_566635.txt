txt ART . VJLJ. - OIIIO CONGREGATLONALISM . WHAT shall be the forms assumed , what the spirit manifested , and what the doctrines held by the religious bodies at the West , are questions of great interest to Christians , both East and West . In what reputation we shall be held by our brethren , whom we have left at home , is a question in which we at the // West feel much solicitude . We left the land of our birth , *s we trusted , by call of Providence and the Spirit of God ; some of us to lay the foundations of many generations , some to be tossed hither and thither by the winds and currents , which always occur in a period of transition . And now as we anticipate revisiting the scenes of our childhood , we want to know whether we shall receive a brother 's warm embrace , or be looked at over the left shoulder and elbowed out of good company as men who have forsaken the old paths . In other words , whether , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Congregational name and privileges , and have not become Presbyterian , we are to be regarded as a daughter who had wandered from home and raised up a family without change of name , and our churches as her children ? Especially is this true in respect to us in Ohio , where stands Oberlin College , and into whose ranks are admitted many of her students , where also we are told that all the New England Congregationalism is in Presbytery , and that we of the State Conference can pretend to no such thing . We wish , then , to tell our brethren , what has been our past condition , what we have done , what we are doing , what is our hope for the future , and the grounds for that hope . The Western Reserve was settled about the year 1800 , by emigrants from New England , mingled especially along the southern and eastern borders with emigrants from Pennsylvania . The first ministers were principally Presbyterian , who organized strictly Presbyterian churches , some of which , after the formation of Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Congregational ministers , who came soon after , organized Congregational churches , and it is believed a consociation , after the manner of Connecticut . In 1814 , Grand River Presbytery was formed upon a plan of union , differing somewhat from that between the General Assembly and the General Association of Connecticut , by which Congregational churches were admitted to presbytery as component parts thereof , as truly as the presbyterian . The Congregational churches were also accommodated with a standing committee , which , in some instances did the business of the church like a session , so that they became Presbyterian in fact , except that the decisions of presbytery were to be regarded as advice , and the Congregational churches had the privilege of making use of a council , instead of the presbytery . This organization was designed by its originators to be permanent , but by the churches generally was understood to be // temporary ; whence they derived their understanding we are not aware . It is not strange that in looking for the Congregational portions of the plan , they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolished the standing committees , or limited their powers and transacted their business congregationally . The plan was adopted to enable Congregational and Presbyterian ministers to act together ; but in the character of the population there was , over wide regions , no more reason for a presbytery than in Massachusetts or Connecticut . The population was all , or nearly all , Congregational , and several of the presbyteries had not for a long season any Presbyterian church ; some never had any , and another only one . Ecclesiasticism must have a wide and imposing organization , and something to make it of . Upon the necessity or wisdom of the plan we pass no judgment . That it was formed by good men , in the integrity of their hearts , we have no doubt . At an early day some of the churches began to think it time that the season of pupilage was past , and that they ought to assume the forms which their name indicated , and be divorced from presbytery . But the thing was to get away . It was understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted the part of an importunate host , and said stay a little longer , and negotiated by letters and committees for the continuance , and it was a tedious process to get away . And when the church had withdrawn , the minister remained , and this was another subj*ct of agitation by which some churches were divided . In our case , the church withdrew from presbytery and the minister united with it at the same session . Soon after this movement began , Oberlin College was founded . Most of its founders were ministers of the Presbyterian church , having some peculiar views of theology , but earnest , religious men , seeking a higher spiritual life . One was an Armenian , another held a philosophy among whose dogmas was the simplicity of moral acts , and they developed , what is believed to be an unscriptural theory of perfectionism . The object aimed at in the foundation of Oberlin College , was to found an institution of learning , in which all the influences should be as favorable as possible to piety . For this purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of devoted Christians , and to make a society which should be a pattern for others ; and to make it and the college as entirely one as the nature of the case would admit . For this , among other reasons , a large part of the ancient classics were excluded from the course of study . An attempt was made to unite it with the then recently founded college at hudson , which failed . // The men connected with Oberlin were abolitionists , and had other theories of reform , usually denominated ultra . There doubtless was among them a leaven of asceticism manifest in their abstinence from meat and other things . lludson took the ground of orthodoxy , of conservatism , of the plan of union ; Oberlin of perfectionism , of reform , and of Congregationalism . This complicated matters still more ; for while on the one hand there was , in many individuals , and in many churches , a strong inclination towards congregationalism , they were held back by fear of Oberlinism. " iMionstrum horrendum , informe , ingeus , cui lumen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them from moving ; and it availed to frighten the timid and the conservative , and to make the most judicious and zealous for sound doctrine hesitate . Still the movenient went on , slowly , but continually gathering force . The disruption of the General Assembly in 1837 , and the controversies which led to it , helped it much . Various unsuccessful attempts were made at organization , some of them failed because they embraced ministers and churches connected with presbytery , and therefore the Congregational organization was made subordinate and left to die . Ministers all united with presbytery , or if they did not , the fact was the occasion of suspicion ; but such a union was a certificate of orthodoxy . It was natural that niinisters should desire their churches to go with them , and use an influence , very quietly indeed , to bring them to do so . It came to pass , therefore , that those wishing to withdraw from presbytery could obtain little counsel and little sympathy from any ministers , unless they were in sympathy with Oberlin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any other , did withdraw notwithstanding that terror , shows how strong was the congregational element , and the opposition to slavery , which everywhere united with it . But what should they do when they were out ? Isolated , suspicious , suspected , without a ministry of reputed orthodoxy , except in presbytery , when some were exanimo Presbyterian and others such by constraint of circumstances , some of whom would of necessity be building up a Presbyterian , and others a Congregational party in the same church ? It is no marvel that such churches should in the struggle be weakened , distracted , divided , and that this fact should be used to retain others . And as all such movements necessarily do , this , along with those who acted from principle , deep seated and well understood , gathered the fearless , the restless , the factious and the discontented from whatever cause , but it also embraced a large // share of the aggressive force of the church . Sail and ballast parted company to the hazard of both . Oberlin men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in where they could , sometimes in corners and in connection with a dissatisfied portion of a church , where they made the most of these peculiarites and produced divisions . The doctrinal conflict , though earnest on both sides , was not so severe as that which related to policy . Oberlin had its own way of doing things , its own views of policy and duty , and the character of the men and the circumstances in which they were placed , produced a manner in public and private exceedingly repulsive to some and taking to others . Many came to feel a personal antipathy to whatever savored of Oberlin on the one hand , or of I-Iudson and presbytery on the other ; and it can not be denied that many of the graduates of Oberlin became sharp and censorious , and that feelings not very charitable were exhibited on both sides . But the fruits of the controversy were developing in divided churches , and the theory of perfectionism ripening in individual instances , into antinomianism , a law in the conscience above the written law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of men have been more ready to apply Scriptural texts and abide the issue , than the leading men at Oberlin , and their teachings have been modified . We do not know that the professor of theology has renounced his philosophy . We do not know that it is possible for a man of mature years to change his modes of thought and adopt new ones . We do know that the Armenian saw reason to withdraw from the college , and that now for a long season , we have heard nothing of their peculiar theory of perfectionism , although we suppose they are seeking after a higher spiritual life , and the spirit of Oberlin has very naturally changed . In 1850 , about one half the Congregational churches were found to be unconnected with presbytery . An effort was made in divers parts , without any connection with each other , to organize the scattered churches for the purpose of enabling them to co5perate with each other , having in view the wants of the immediate neighborhood , and without any view to a wider organiza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marietta consociation in 1851 ; " to such Congregational churches as adopt the Westminster Cathechism . " In accordance with the call thus issued , a convention of about one hundred Ministers and delegates assembled at Mansfield , on the third Tuesday of June , 1852 , and after full and free discussion , adopted a constitution and confession of faith // Nov. as a basis of union for Christian conference and cooperation , which were submitted to the churches and local conferences , and subsequently adopted . The form and principles of our organization resemble those of the State of Maine . The State body is a conference having no ecclesiastical power . It enables brethren to take counsel together , to become acquainted with each other 's persons and opinions , and to . form plans for promoting the common cause . The local bodies represented in the general conference are called conferences , associations , or consociations . They differ little in fact , for an association , properly so called , can have no representation . We have adopted the principle that a minister has no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither , except as a representation of ' a church , and by admitting both on equal terms as correspondents . The confession of faith adopted , was that of Marietta consociation unaltered . It is a brief but comprehensive document , and contains a distinct recognition of the primary doctrines of the Gospel in Calvanistic form ; such as the fall and entire sinfulness of mankind ; the Trinity ; the atonement by Jesus Christ ; the renewal of all Christians by the power of the Holy Ghost ; the sovereignty of grace ; the perseverance of the saints , and a future eternal state of reward or punishment ; and all the minor statements of doctrine usually embraced in such a document . This was adopted without demur and without much discussion . Concerning the conference , a Presbyterian friend is said to have remarked , " that he had no fault to find with it , except that it adopted an orthodox basis , which it had no right to do . " Others have said that some would adopt any creed by interpreting it to suit their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Such remarks as these and others before alluded to , constrain us to give this account of ourselves to our brethren . The writer has been for some nine years a member of our Old School Presbytery , and in the habit of attendance upon its , judicatories ; lie has been for some ten years a member of the New School Presbytery ; he has attended every meeting of the State Conference of Ohio ; has heard every discussion , every address , and every sermon , save one , and has no hesitation in saying that he has heard no doctrine advanced , that would not be recognized as orthodox in either body . The principal difference between us and other bodies of a similar character , consists in the greater freedom with which we discuss all subjects , especially the subject of slavery . Our // committee of business is enjoined to present all subjects which may be put into their hands ; their duty is to arrange the subjects and recommend the order in which they shall come before the conference , and may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We hear the representations of all national benevolent societies without censure or commendation . We speak right out on the subject of slavery , having no entangling alliances which should lead us to speak with a sotto voce . This seems to be the head and front of our offending . But why should it be regarded as heterodox in us to spend almost as much time on this subject as the N. S. General Assembly , or the A. B. C. F. M. , or the Synod of the Western Reserve ? Many of us united with the Conference with much hesitancy . Our state of mind is best symbolized by a picture in which a gentleman is represented holding a rabbit and a little child , timidly putting his hand towards it , saying , " will he bite ? , And still some , who have not been very near , will insist that it is not a rabbit but a lion , that he will bite , and there is no holding him . In every conference we have found evidence that we had misapprehended each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has not yet been found .. That was the reason for the spending an unreasonable amount of time on the subject of slavery this year-almost three-fourths of a day . Many thought they had got into the very nest of " old fogyism , " to use a western phrase , and they meant to exercise it effectually ; and then have its men like bottles of new wine . But every meeting has contributed to remove misapprehension and to create confidence . We find our brethren more sound in the faith than we expected ; they find us more anti-slavery than they expected , and these two facts are symbols of many other things . Our organization , especially in so far as respects local conferences , has had a very happy influence on the churches . It has united , encouraged , and strengthened them . This is true with not more than a single exception within our knowledge . In that instance some ultra men seem determined to know nothing about us , but to oppose everything . Our churches and conferences differ from similar bodies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The population is not yet compacted into society . The commingling of heterogeneous materials , everywhere in nature , produces , after a while , fermentation , which sends out crude exhalations ; and for a long time after this fermentation begins to subside , each new increment renews it . This is our state . For a while after the first settlement all was quiet , and men thought there would be // Nov. no effervessence , but it came in due time . In some places it is now at its maximum , in others there is a subsidence , and christallization has commenced , and we expect to present to the world forms more perfect , colors more beautiful than have been witnessed heretofore . In other words , we expect to improve upon the state of society in New England , as they improve upon that of the mother country ; that instead of deteriorating we shall develop a state of society built indeed upon old foundations , but in form and spirit superior to those which have preceded it . This is what we both hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , some of which it will be important to illustrate . 1 . We have the material set free from the hands , which bind an older society to maipractices and false principles , and to dull routine . Other things being equal , it is the most earnest , enterprising , fearless men who emigrate , and the process of emigration , and the new circumstances into which they are thrown , awakens new thoughts , and a more vigorous life , even in the most sluggish natures . In such a state of society there will be great mistakes , irregularities and instability ; but that very instability has much of hope in it . Nothing but the polar sea , where all is barrenness and death , is frozen into shape . Older societies bear to this the same relation that the old man does to the young . The old man is more prudent and consistent , but whatever he is , that we expect he will continue to be till he dies . The young man 's mistakes may be corrected , his defects supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , through the influence of good men and the grace of God ; and there , after all , is our hope both for individuals and society . 2 . Personal intercourse with good men will do much to form the character . That intercourse will be much increased now that our citizens are increased in wealth , and it takes but twenty-four hours , instead of twenty-four days , to make the journey to Connecticut or Massachusetts . Western Congregationalists are very solicitous in respect to their reputation among their brethren at the East , and will weigh well their statements of doctrine before they will differ from them . At the same time we may make use of their experience to guide us , and of their mistakes to correct us . One of the most important helps our brethren can afford us is to send their delegates to confer with us at our State Conference . 3 . The literature of a people has a great influence in forming society . The standard theological literature of the Congregational and presbyterian churches is ours , it is acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is // published by the Congregational board , and this will bind to sound doctrine , with bands stronger than brass . 4 . Organic connection , historical affinities , and old remembrances , exert great influence upon individuals and societies . It will be important to remark more largely on this topic , inasmuch as it will throw light upon the probable future of other bodies besides our own . There is an organic life in bodies as well as individuals , which is transmitted from one to another , and so passes on from age to age , perpetuating peculiarities , as may be seen in old English halls , that the countenance of some remote ancestor is reproduced in a descendant after hundreds of years . Not the doctrines only , but the tone*s of John Wesley are heard to this day in the Methodist pulpit . The history of the past is a living power in the present , acting both upon individuals and communities . The Episcopal church , asher writers claim , is connected organically and historically with the papacy . This will account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tendency to accumulate power in their hands , and the tendency of bishops and people to return to Rome . Their history teaches us to expect these things ; they are drawn together by orgauic affinity , and the fact that all do not return , shows that there is in the ministry and membership of that church , a firmness of protestant principle which they do not always have credit for . The Presbyterian and Congregational churches are in like manner connected with the early churches ; and with whatever others have in any age protested against the usurpations of the hierarchy , as the Waldenses and Wickliffites . They have been agreed in cardinal doctrines , in the principles of Christian duty , and in the defense of liberty of thought , worship and action . They have stood together for the same rights , suffered in the same fires , shed their blood in the same battle-fields of freedom . Through their whole history they have cooperated in many ways to promote the common cause , and have often gone over from one family to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we hence conclude they will do so still , and that no partisan feeling ought to prevent it , or can avail to separate them so that they shall not thus intermingle . For similar reasons we conclude they will never coalesce , so as to form an organic unity . For though they have in time past contended as if one soul animated both , when the conflict was one , each turned to his own again . The effort to unite them in one body in the days of Cromwell and the Westminster sssembly signally failed . Again in the early history of this // Nov. country an effort was made to unite them in the synods *f Pennsylvania and New York , which included Long Island and New Jersey , which were in part settled by Congregationalists ; but the part which was strictly presbyterian soon separated from that which was leavened with the free and liberal ( or lax as it was then and still , is called ) spirit of Congregationalism . After a few years ' separation , a union was again formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of union " between the General Assembly and the Connecticut General Association , with a view to the formation of churches under a mixed polity in the new settlements of Western New York and the Western Reserve in Ohio . Each of these plans worked well when the pressure of a present necessity was upon the churches , but as soon as it began to be removed , it was found that the branches had not knit together , and soon the rigid Presbyterian part excluded the Congregational , and that part of the Presbyterian body which did partially coalesce with it . " The thing that hath been it is that which shall be ; " for now again we are learning that the union is like the graft of the pear upon the apple tree , which though exceeding fruitful for a time , is short lived . The hope of an organic union between Congregationalists and Presbyterians , if not demonstrably impossible , is historically improbable . The New School Presbyterians are fast developing the tendencies which history shows to be inherent in the system . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolent enterprises . Its correspondence with the Home Missionary Society , its committees on education and church extension , its ( lebates in the assembly show it , and show a feeling not o'enerally acknowledged even to themselves , that voluntary societies are not in harmony with the system , but are " rags of Congregationahism , " and are fast preparing the way for ecclesiastical houses . These tendencies of the system may for a time be retarded by means of intercourse with Congregationalists , and by the influence of such men as Barnes and I3eman , and others who rise above their system ; but the final result is sure to be reached in due time ; it can only be avoided by abandoning the system . Men are few who make and control systems ; the multitudes are made what they are by the systems under which they live . The movement of Congregationalists to carry their system of church polity with them in their migrations , had its origin in the historic associations and deep convictions of the people . Its strongest impulse was given by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disruption of 1837 , and it is augmented by the discussions in those bodies from year to year . These things do not make us love our New School brethren less , but our own system more and more dislike and distrust theirs . We prefer , therefore , to return to the polity of the fathers , and to sustain our own system , rather than make farther attempts to unite with a system which differs from it in its fundamental principles . Congregationalisin will be sustained wherever New England or Welsh or English dissenting population are found . Where the Scotch , *irish and Dutch are found there will be Presbyterianism . The objections made against us and our polity are the same , mutatis mutandis , which were made 200 years ago in time of the Westminster Assembly . It is proclaimed that it is unadapted to the populations of the West , that it has no power to correct disorders which may arise . Now these are among the important reasons why we prefer it ; that it has superior adaptation to the state of things at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorders ; and we appeal to history and ask what system has done better in reducing heterogeneous materials to order , and promoting purity and peace than this ? And what disorder has occurred in the whole history of Congregationalism equal to the frequent disruptions in the Presbyterian churches in Scotland and the United States ? As to the disturbances at the west , we ask if a man throws himself across my breast , and I strive to rise , who is responsible for the struggle that ensues ? he om ' I ? The disorders , which are real , have arisen from the natural effervescence of heterogeneous materials commingling , and the efforts to be first in a system foreign to the historical associations of nine-tenths of the population ; to substitute for the polity of the fathers , a system which is a waste of the most defective parts of Congregationalisin , with the most objectionable parts of Presbyterianism , and which satisfies neither party . The order , peace and harmony of the churches connected with the State Conference , give pretty decisive evidence of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine . This has been objected against Congregationalists from the beginning ; it is in certain quarters as strenuously objected to our New England brethren as to ourselves . The defense or attack of any doctrine is not the purpose of this paper . But it may be maintained that the primary doctrines of the reformation , as held and taught in New England , are held and taught among us . We have no evidence that there is an exception among us . We do not intend to assert that the controversies of past years were // Nov. about mere words . We do not intend to assert that no erroneous doctrine has been broached . We have never become i*amiliar with those doctrines . But we do claim to know what is taught in the Bible and by the divines of New England , and we do assert that we have not evidence that other doctrines are taught among us . They are exhibited in different degrees of fulness , and it may be sometimes with explanations which in view of some would neutralize their power . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false doctrine , might not be deduced from theories held among us , but when the advocates of the theory deny the inference , we have no right to charge it upon them . Our belief is that errors have never been so extensively embraced as some have supposed ; that past discussions have modified the views of many , and if error remains it is undergoing an eliminating process , by which it will be wholly removed . Congregational churches have in time past held firmly to the great principles of Calvinism , but have allowed large liberty in explaining them . If these explanations have developed tendencies to error , fraternal discussion , the conservative influence of the body , its literature , and its history , have brought back the wanderer to the truth . So we believe it will do in this case . While Oberlin was outcast and rejected , it could not do otherwise than make the most of its peculiarities and stand in a position of antagonism . Tyros in theology did proclaim and enlarge those peculiarities , and attempted depths where all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a place to work in . Fraternal sympathies and historic and organic affinities will resume their play and exert their power to leaven the mass . They will then begin calmly to re*xaniine their theories , to modify their conclusions , and xvill in a little time be undistinguished from the great brotherhood to which they belong . Indeed this process has begun and has made large progress . But it will be finally found that Oberlin was and is the embodiment of ideas and principles which had been forgotten or neglected by others , principles which will live and get themselves acknowledged as true and important , and when that which is incidental , factitious , false , has rotted away like the pulp of a peach , a seed will be left which will live and grow and bear fruit to the glory of God . Among other ideas which they embody , the true notion of freedom and progress is probably held by them as vital forces more fully than by others . The mistake of many lies in supposing that all truth has been discovered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there also we must look for the highest // examples of piety . So if they advance at all , it is with their faces behind them , and they walking backward . Hence they would bind all to these formulas , and if any venture to think outside of them , suspect them of heresy . Many practically adopt the dogma who reject it when stated in words . Rejecting this , Oberlin at first swung to the other extreme , which is as fatal to progress as the former , that in assuming that little or nothing had been discovered and fixed in the past ; that no doctrine was settled beyond question , or if settled , the terms in which it was set forth were not perfected , so they must lay the foundations anew . And they made about as much progress as a mathematician would make if he should start with the same assumption and undertake to invent a new nomenclature for algebra and geometry , without help from his predecessors . No wonder if they did make mistakes . And now when with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we expect good results . We adopt the language of John Robinson in his farewell address to the Pilgrims at Leyden , as still applicable and as expressive of the true spirit of Congregation-alism " He charged them before God and his blessed angels , to follow him no farther than he followed Christ . And if God should reveal anything to him , by any other instru ? ment of his , to be as ready to receive it , as ever they were to receive any truth by his ministry , for he was very confident the Lord had more truth and light yet to break out of his Holy Word . He took occasion , also , miserably to bewail the state of the IReformed Churches , who were come to a period in religion , and would go no further than the instruments of the Reformation . As-for example , the Lutherans could not be drawn to go beyond what Luther saw ; for whatever of God 's Word he had further revealed to Calvin , they had rather die than embrace it ; and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also stick where he left them , a misery much to be lamented . For , though they were precious shining lights in their times , yet God had not revealed his whole will to them . And were they now alive they would be as ready to embrace farther light as any they have received . " - Oheever ' 8 Journal of Pilgrim8 , &amp;c. , p. 165 . We are among those who believe that much is yet to be done in the development , statement and application of divine truth ; that Christian character is very defective , and that a far higher piety is yet to bless the world , than it has hitherto seen , and that the embracing these men in the State Conference of Ohio , will contribute to bring about both these desirable results . But they are not in it by sufferance , but by right , as // good a right as any of us , having adopted our basis so far as we can see with honesty of purpose . The alternative to that which we have done and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them ; to renw and increase twofold the violence of past controversies , which would result in the division of churches and build up another distinct denomination to curse the country with its rivalries . For we neither put them out of existence , nor drive them from the field , nor diminish their influence by so doing . They have their publications and hands to sustain them , and a college which has over a thousand students of both sexes , some of whom remain seven or eight years , but most of them are exchanged every year or two and sent home . Let it then be distinctly understood that the alternative is to raise up another distinct denomination , which will bear the same relation to the Congregational and Presbyterian churches which Methodism does to Episcopacy , like our Presbyterian 1 ) rethren who have in the State five or six bodies distinguished by some prefix or suffix , as the Heformed Presbyterians , the Old School Presbyterians , the New School Presbyterians , the Free Presbyterians , the Cumberland Presbyterians , and how many more your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , brethren , we prefer to receive what is good and true from them , to communicate what they lack , if possessed by us , to correct each other by fraternal conference , and to go up to the battle of the Lord of Hosts in communion with all who bear the same name throughout the world . And if against our protest others affix to us the naiue of Oberlin , to bear it with what meekness we can , and by the grace of God , transmit it to coining time , a tittle of glory and of power , like that of Christian of the apostolic age , or Puritan of the reformation .
