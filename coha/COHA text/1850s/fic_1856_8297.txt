Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : " CONSIDER THE LILIES . " Footnote : 1Kb from " Consider the lilies " , in The lily of the valley ( 1856 ) Oh , Garden Lily fair , Like dame of high degree , Who never ' neath the bronzing sun With taming toil hath wrought or spun , Beauty and grace to thee ! Thou speakest of His care , Who in our mortal path doth strew alway Bright , loving things with sweet control To shape and fit the pilgrim soul For perfect day . Meek Lily of the Vale , Hiding behind a veil of green Thy petals pale ,  --  In vain !  --  a tide of fragrance shows Thy shaded cell , And the young child undoubting knows Where thou dost dwell . The queenly dahlia towers High with her gorgeous flowers , Yet is thy lowly lot approved , Humility serene By Heaven and Earth is loved . Cold Lily of the Lake !  --  Who called thee forth From the incumbent waters ? Who maintained Life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to hopeful birth The marvel of thy floating cup ? Hast thou a solace , in thy night of grief , Save troubled waters , and thine own chill leaf ? Yet there thou dwell'st in sanctity divine , Lifting thine incense up , ' mid Nature 's temple shrine ; Pale Levite among flowers ,  --  No heritage hast thou , no cultured bowers , No curtained tent to shield thy stainless breast ,  --  Still doth the Almighty Father hold thee up , And give thee rest . Oh , Lily of the Field !  --  Hide not thy speckled breast Nor be ashamed to stand Amid the queenly of the land , So elegantly dressed ;  --  The bee admireth thee : Say ,  --  doth he warmly pour A buzzing strain of flattery in thine ear , And for his wooing pay himself too free , By rifling all thy store ? The butterfly in golden vest Flaunting doth visit thee , Brief child of vanity , By summer 's smile carressed . Man ,  --  full of green-house pride ,  --  Perchance regards thee not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Lord and Teacher  --  He who died That man might live ,  --  From thy plain petals , as a text-book , taught . Great honor was it thus a theme to give To Him who reads each secret thought , The Judge of Quick and Dead ,  --  His glorious eye was bent Upon thy modest head  --  Field Lily !  --  be content . Hartford , Aug. 1 , 1855.
