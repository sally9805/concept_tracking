WE have placed the titles of these several works at the head of some remarks we wish to make on the subject of Revivals of Religion , not so much with the intent of criticism , as to commend our theme , and as an acknowledgment of our indebtedness to their several authors . // We have a deep and growing conviction that it would be fraught with many and great blessings , if the Christian world were to make renewed inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some years past they have either been passing away entirely , or have been largely withheld . Some churches and communities have continued to be blessed from time to time , but these have been exceptions , and their power , in most cases , has not been what it formerly was . To which of two conclusions shall we come ? Thatth e churches and society have really outgrown their necessity , and have cast them off as an old garment , no longer needed , or that the declension of vital piety has so found its way into the churches that God does not deign to visit them with his reviving grace and power ? It is important to have before us the various opinions and feelings now existing in regard to revivals . Many who have hitherto been considered as competent judges in such things , claim that there is now a lamentable degree of worldliness and spiritual dearth in most of the churches in this land . Such , too , is the recent public complaint , against their own church , of many ministers and laymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sentiment has assed beyond a mere coiiviction with some , even within the useyite branch of the Church of England , and God is there apparently reviving his work despite all creeds and forms against it , and justification by faith alone , within certain limits , is again iii the ascendant . This complaint is not the language of mere croakers . It comes from those who gratefully acknowledge many encouraging features and prospects in Zion , who believe that on the whole , taking a considerable number of successive years into account , a reliable and cheering progress is making towards the millennium . But this they hold is much the result of the revivals of religion now occasionally occurring , and of those so generally and frequently experienced iii years long past . They think that to retain the advantages and the holiness now possessed , and make them efficient for continual progress , revivals of religion are as necessary , in the present state of the church , as the falling rain , and dew , and the shining sun to the growth and life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among whom are many of the children of professed Christians , are growing up to manhood , and hastening on to the grave and eternity without having witnessed the great revolutionary power of a revival of religion . They know that the number of men in // middle life and old age , who trust to the deeds of the law for justification , is increasing in almost every community where revivals have not recently been en*joyed . They believe that if these things continue , crowds of human beings in this Christian land and from Christian families , will sink down to the region of the lost , and many of their own posterity , they fear , must be of the number . And this low estimate of the present state of religion is shared by many who have no sympathy with modern revivals . On the other hand , there are abroad many objections and queries in regard to these same revivals on which so many are depending as a means of salvation to the world . Not a few regard them as seasons of mere animal excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in religion , but little or no increase of piety , and greater evil than good results . Many an impenitent person has sai d* that he wished to be converted , but not in a time of religions excitement . It would be well worth while for these and other persons to inquire whether , in times of declension and coldness in the church , they are not the very la8t to give serious and effectual attention to the salvation of their own souls or that of others . Objections , , doubts , skepticism , prejudices , are not confined to the impenitent . Professed Christians there are in protestant churches , and some perhaps in almost every denomination , who disbelieve in what are called revivals . Some would not be counted as their opposers who yet lack confidence in their nature and results ; others make no secret of their opposition , and sometimes proclaim them fanatical excitements , ebulhitions of animal feeling , enthusiasm and wildfire , instead of manifestations of the power of the Holy Spirit to convince men of sin and turn them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sidewise , doubting glance , and talk suspiciously of any general religious awakening accompanied with special means for the salvation of souls . But such are ignorant whereof they speak ; they catch hold of some incidental though unnecessary evils of revivals , or evils existing sometimes in connection with them , and make these their exponents and the criteria of j udgment . But between these two classes of decided friends and oppos ers of Revivals stands another , a far larger portion of the Protestant Church , who are alike well nigh indifferent to their nature , their history and their necessity . If revivals of rehi*ion are of God , it might almost be better , were those who might justly be expected to be their friends , and yet are so lukewarm toward them , to become declared and decided enemies . Then // 93 they who believe and hope so much from them would know on whom to rely for strength , and where to find their forces ; they would be relieved from the adverse influence of those who are supposed by the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are known to regard them with so light esteem . There are some that , in theory , are the friends of revivals , and that mean to be their friends in practice , who , nevertheless , are so much afraid of an excess of religious excitement as often to prevent or quench the first kindling and glow of any special religious awakening which if judiciously fanned and fed , would rise and spread to a glorious issue . With some ministers , is it not sadly true , that if there are appearances of a revival among their own people or in a neighboring parish , their fears of fanaticism are so strong , that they begin *t once to preach and guard against inimal feeling and excesses , and thus in their attempts to prevent the evil rather than to nourish and develop the good , effectually put an extinguisher upon all proper awakened aspirations and feelings on the subject . And though they be honest men , and Christians , yet either revivals are evil or they , on this point , are emphatically " blind guides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , but we ask , is there not such a thing as being so fearful of religious excesses , that dread of these shall be an effectual preventive of all legitimate religious awakening ? There are those who seem to suppose that souls can be converted in great numbers , or individually , without any mental excitement whatever ; whereas , must not conviction of sin of itself be excitement of mind to a greater or less degree , and is not this absolutel es sential to conversion to God ? y There are some who really intend to be the friends of revivals , who , when you come to te8t their views by an actual case of practice , are found to be much opposed to some or all those methods and means which have always , in some degree , attended these seasons of religious interest . And their prejudices against means and instrumentalities are proved to be stronger , it would seem , than their love for the religious awakening itself . It is a fact in connection with these men , to be accounted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with revivals , except to talk about them until the depth of their feeling concerning means and measures is all swept away , and their cry is , " only let God work , by whomever and however He will . " But perhaps the most chilling and really the most injurious influence which revivals encounter , we sometimes find much in // this form : " Revivals are not the highest type of religion ; their are real ; they should not be wholly condemned , and yet it is better to do without them . And he who is laboring for that hi her and more satisfactory state is really the nearer right . " This voice of objection is so magisterial and apparently discriminating , it savors so much of experience and goodness , that its force is very sweeping with the unwary . The source whence is issues is no doubt sincere and of good intention , but the reflective inquirer feels inclined to put two simple questions . First , are our churches now in the higher and better state ? And secondly , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inviting condition without being revived so much as certainly to have revivals ? All these varied impressions and sentiments in reo'ard to revivals of religion plainly indicate the importance fl7lat Christians , if possible , should come to some more common and really correct opinions on the subject . If these manifestations are evil , then are some now ignorantly subserving them who ought to know it ; if good , absolutely and relatively , they are very good and ought to have more support . It will help the investigation to ascertain our historical position on this subject . In modern times , revivals of religion have been more or less peculiar to the churches of the United States . The pilgrims and puritans came to America in circumstances and with a spirit and doctrines calculated to result in them . They were then loosened from many of the bands which confined them in the old world , tending to check and restrain religious aspirations and the natural and free development of Christian character . Accordin oly we find that " awakenings , " as revivals of religion were t*hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlements in New England . The presbyterians from the north of Ireland and the west of Scotland , who settled to a limited extent in some of the more southern states , had suffered persecutions and trials in their native land like those that had tried and disciplined the puritans . They came with the same spirit and principles to America , they were prepared to pray for and expect the outpourings of the Holy Spirit from the loved memory of some remarkable works of grace among their people in the old world , and they too enjoyed revivals of religion in their early history here . But these works of grace were generally isolated in their character ; the principle of extension had not been adopted . And under the halfway covenant system , impenitent persons were finding their way into the communion of the Church . But with the year // 1735 there began , originating in Northampton , Mass. , a new epoch in their history . Then occurred those remarkable cases of which we have an account in President Edward 's " Narrative of surprising conversions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five months , and spread with much interest and power into neighboring towns in that state . It commenced with the same feature of extension in Windsor , Conn. , nearly at the same time as in Northampton , and soon after in New Jersey , particularly under the labors of the Tennents . In less than a year , it had so extended that ten towns in Massachusetts , seventeen in Connecticut , and several places in other states , though sparsely settled , had become large sharers in these great blessings of salvation . In 1740 , we find the work recommencing with still greater power , or with more of the principle or extension . " Northampton , Boston , and many other places were visited at about the same time , and in one year and a half the revival had spread thoughout all the English colonies . " " An eye-witness states , under date of May , 1741 , that from Philadelphia to the remotest settlements beyond Boston , a distance of nearly five hundred miles , there was , in mo8t places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of revivals continued until the year 1743 . New Englan di then had only three hundred thousand inhabitants . It was estimated by competent judges that thirty thousand of this number proved , by their subsequent lives , that they were converted in these revivals . Many thousands were also savingly changed in New York , Nexv Jersey , Pennsylvania , and the more southern states . But the intemperate zeal and various excesses on the p art of some of its friends and the opposition of its enemies , led to such dissensions and strife that the Holy Spirit was grieve*l and the work ended . Jonathan Edwards appeared as its historian and defender , supported by one hundred and sixty of the ablest and best ministers in New , the revivals . To meet and remedy these errors , Edwards wrote his book on the religious affections . And it is believed that , conviction and repentance becoming very extensive , these gracious manifestations would have soon returned , but for that strife of twenty years between the English and French , for the possession of the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation of the " Federal Government , " which drew off the public attention and intent so much to other things than the kingdom of heaven . A whole half century passed ; two generations had nearly // gone into eternity before the shock and detriment from the*se adverse causes could be overcome . God did deign in this time to pour out his spirit in some places , but not until about the year 1797 , do we find any general outpouring of the spirit in the land . It is well to notice the apparent reason that led God to rant that era of precious , powerful , extensive revivals . The lirench , who came to help our fathers fight their battles , brought with them , beside their arms and amunition , their French infidelity . And at the close of the war , when such as were left alive departed to their own side of the Atlantic , they left , thickly strewn in this land , the seeds of their irreligion and unbelief . War had eminently prepared the soil to give them root , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth had been such that not a few of the young and old , descendants of the puritans and of the Irish and Scotch Presbyterians , had come to regard the Christian religion as well nigh an exploded system . This brought the people of God to the throne of grace . Long continued and most earnest prayer was offered to the Most High-prayer that never makes an end of its petitions till the blessing is granted . When the windows of heaven were opened , the spirit was poured out in a sudden and unexpected manner , and even many ministers knew not what to make of it . It is related in the biography of the late Dr. Alexander , of Princeton , that when Dr. Strong , of Hartford , found the revival commencing among his people , he was alarmed and went to Chief Justice Ellsworth , of Windsor , for counsel . He received in reply , Go on , manage judiciously , and trust in God . ' The advice was taken and the blessing was great . Taught by wisdom from the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the ill-directed zeal and undue excesses of the previous epoch of revivals might be avoided . Caution , consultation and prayer sufficed for the exigency , and the revivals that followed , extending into upwards of one hundred towns in Massachusetts and Connecticut , and into a still greater number of places in the newer settlements of New England and New York , were , in calmness and purity , munch in advance of those of the preceding epoch , and freer from all incidental evils than almost any others ever witnessed . They also extended far and wide to the South and West , with great power and excellent results , though not always unattended by some irregularities . In 1801 , this especial work commuenced in Kentucky , and , in that and the two years following , spread north and south through a region of country six hundred miles in length . In 1802 , occurred a noted revival in Yale // College , which resulted in the hopeful conversion of one-third of the two hundred and thirty students then in the institution . Some of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and able ministers this country has produced . From that date onward , for more than twenty years , frequent , powerful , and extensive revivals were enjoyed by most of the evangelical churches throughout the land . But in 1825-0 , unhappilv there arose some unwise measures , excesses , opposition , an*i a consequent revulsion . A certain feature of the Hopkinsian theology , held by some ministers , led them to adopt a style of preaching , and a rigidity and sternness with the impenitent , fitted to provoke and call out the enmity of the unregenerate heart against God . It was supposed that in this way the sinner would be emptied somewhat of his bitterness , the more readily and effectually convicted of his sins , and the sooner led to Christ . This course did certainly create opposition from the impenitent , and unfortunately led to some divisions of sentiment and discussions among Christiaus , which tended to divert attention from the one great object , to diminish prayer , and to grieve the Spirit . Besides this , there was with some a denunciatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vulgarity , too great familiarity in addressing God in prayer , too hasty and confident decisions as to the conversion of sinners and offensive personalities in calling the names of prominent impenitent persons in public assemblies , either in prayer or in requests for prayer , or , in so describing them that they were readily identified . These errors were not always met by other Christians with the right spirit , nor with the wisdom of quiet correction and of not over much notice . Yet , not all these evils were so great as those incidental to that great era of revivals from 1735 to 1743 . The year 1831 brought another era of pure , delightful revivals , when some fourteen hundred of the Congregational and Presbyterian churches in this country enjoyed remarkable outpourings of the Holy Spirit , and some of the first fruits were the hopeful conversion of sixty thousand souls . The addition to other Evangelical denominations were doubtless more than enough to make one hundred thousand converts in all . Seventeen Colleges enjoyed the special visitation from God . Succeeding years brought more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1836 is memorable for its pecuniary and commercial distress , and not until 1843 did the full tide of business return . Then appetite was sharpened ; men were invigorated ; all were up and equipped for the world . With great eagerness they plunged into the strife for money , some for support , some // for wealth . Christians compromised with the church by giving gold , not themselves . Parents could give money for the spread of the Gospel ; not so well their children . Each did what was convenient , not so much what was needed for a perishing world . For twelve years the churches have been too busy , with some exceptions , to save souls by " pulling them out of the fire . " What would be saved easily they have gladl*y taken with them ; others they have left to perish . Paul s great heaviness and continual sorrow for sinners we have seldom seen , and if ministers have endeavored to save the people from the inclined plane of worldliness , too often , it is feared , the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During this time , new worldly amusements have grown up and old ones have been invigorated . Theatres of all sorts have multiplied . Swarms of fiction have emulated the locusts of Egypt , only , instead of devouring , they have been devoured . Some of these pernicious novels have been so exciting and able as to command much of the unsanctified , educated mind . Cardplaying and dancing have entered the social gatherings in many of the higher walks of society . The tendency has been to a fashionable and easy religion . Christians have fallen into the current and been borne whither it would . Men 's Bibles seem not to read as of old , when they sail , " Whoso will be the friend of the world is the enemy of God . " With this state of things , where could be the place for revivals ? What wonder that some begin to think of doing without them ; that many do without them ? If there is a higher type of religion that obviates their necessity , why should it want for advocates ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that there is a class of Christians in some parts of the country , formerly the active friends of revivals , now indifferent or opposed ? Some of these are the very persons who ran into excesses and intemperate zeal and now suffer a reaction . here is one who tells us his religion is all intellectual ; once , doubtless , it was all emotion without intellect . Let him remember the " Advocate with the Father . " Another says , he has no evidence that God answers prayer . Once , doubtless , he prayed blindly , without understanding the true requisites for faith , and thought that a man was bound to offer every petition in faith which the human language could possibly frame . Ai*d some of these indifferent or opposing ones , once active friends in the day of many revivals , have , since that time , in these years of worldliness , been guilty of inconsistencies and wrong , and now have not grace enough to make " confession unto salvation . " // So , too , the strangeness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned and interested in the work of salvation than the church , and often conversions occur among the young while older classes and men of business are unmoved . And this , with some exceptions , is our p resent state . What do we learn from this historical view ? - That revivals are real and great blessings from heaven in any state of society the world has ever seen , else the wisest and best in the American churches for two centuries past have been egregiously deceived . That they are the great conservators of human society ; without them in some form the gravitation is so downward that the depths of destruction must in time be reached . That they were the instruments of our moral preservation from the long wars known in our history , and lifted us out of French infidelity at their close . That they were the salvation of the churches when unregenerate men in large numbers had found their way into their communion . That large additions have never been made to the churches without them , and many have with them , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches that have prayed against them have incidentally been blessed by them . That when not frequently enjoyed lukewarmness has prevailed with the mass of Christians , or growth in grace has been slow . That every revival has given light and an impetus never afterward lost by some true disciples , and that the way to a higher state of piety has never been made without revivals . *L'hat the errors and excesses attendant upon revivals are only incidental , not necessary , nor always experienced . That for more than a century revivals have , on the whole , been growinoP purer , and give confidence that they may be as free from impurities as any work of human instrumentality , and of equal magnitude . That real converts in revivals become as much , or more devoted and usefnl than those brought into the kingdom at other times . Four eminent clergymen of New England , one of whom , Dr. Kettleton , is deceased , once deliberated on the q*uestion whether the hopeful converts in well-conducted New England revivals were any more likely to be deceived than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negative ; they even gave the former the advantage . But the defense of revivals need not depend upon historical facts or deductions . Analysis and philosophical principles , strictly adhered to , compel us to a judgment in their favor . // What in their nature are revivals of religion ? We begin with this statement : there is such a thing as conversion from sin and enmity , unto obedience and love towards God . That the Scriptures everywhere assert this doctrine , none can deny , who have the slightest acquaintance with the divine word . " Ye must be born again . " " Repent and be converted . " " Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ , and thou shalt be saved , " and many like expressions , are as familiar to most in Gospel lands as their common household words . The necessity of this change is declared , its duty is commanded , its desirableness is urged , argument , expostulation and entreaty for it are loaded upon human ears by the God of the Bible from one end of that book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality . We know that men have undergone a total change on the su*ject of religion . No matter how sceptical some may be in regard to the change professedly experienced by many , it does not touch our argument ; with 80me the change has occurred , and this has been manifest to all . We have seen the lips of profanity converted and attuned to the voice of prayer and the song of praise . We have seen the Sabbath-breaker reformed and studiously reinembering to keep the Lord 's day holy , and not forgetting the as sembling of the saints for worship during its sacred hours . The inebriate , the slave of passion and lust , we have known to be born again , and then to emulate even Paul the Apostle in keeping the body under and bringing it into subjection . At one time we have heard men say t7hat their religion was as good as anybody 's , that their life was as moral as that of Church members , that they had no fears of their salvation . At another time we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief of sinners , " " what shall we do to be saved ? " " pray for us that we perish not . " And then we have seen them at the foot of the cross , themselves begging for mercy ; and rising thence , their faces beaming with hope and peace , we have seen them sitting with the true disciples , " clothed and in their right mind . " Can any one object to this change ? Is there anything in its nature that is deleterious to the individual or society ? On the contrary , is it not fraught with many blessings ? Who will speak evil of it , " lest haply he be found even to light against God ? " But what if we have instead of one , many such changes within a few days , or a few weeks , or months ? Does the extension and repetition of the blessing diminish its value ? If perchance any evils arise in connection with it , do those evils become a // part of the blessing , or make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an enemy 's hand ? Even as when the sons of God came together , Satan came also . And shall the sons of God refuse to assemble because of Satan 's coining ? Shall we cease to desire salvation because the powers of darkness rise up to seek and hold their own and oppose themselves to him whose right it is to reign ? No , a conquest over Satan can not be made while he has retired for sleep and inaction ; nor will it avail to ask his leave to do good . But when this change from sin unto God , of which we have been speaking , becomes frequent in any community , it is a revival of religion , in respect to the unconverted , or , so far as they are concerned , it is the beginning of religion and not the revival of it . It never occurs however without certain antecedents among Christians , more or less , in the same community . Christians themselves were once young converts . Then they were delighted with this change . Their affections toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have others come and taste of the goodness ot God . They had faith iu labor and prayer for the conversion of their friends , and like Melancthon often thought that they wanted only access to men , to convert them . Undoubtedly they were then reapers in the harvest . But , alas , how true with many , that their love waxes cold , their faith o'rows faint and at the best they are but poor , sickly Christians ! all Christian converts retained all the ardor of theirfirst love and went on to grow in grace , there would , properly speaking , be no need of revivals . The church would not need them . Conversion with the impenitent would not be a revival . But there are times in the life of every Christian who departs from God , when he awakes from his stupor and experiences the joy , life and comfort of a soul newly born into the kingdom . He then mourns over his blackslidings ; his zeal and faith are renewed as with the freshness of youth . Before this awakening he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian , but now that the scales of his bliiidness have fallen from his eyes , he sees how shamefully he lived , how many reproaches he heaped upon his Master 's cause . Formerly he had some faint desires for the salvation of the ungodly ; now he sees them in the broad road . Like the prophet ILlabakkuk , he trembles for their fearful course ; like that prophet , he prays the Lord for their sakes , to revive his work . He offers no formal prayers ; he has a burden on his heart and goes to God for relief . He pleads with sinners . His desires speak from the eye , and the earnest expression is felt before the voice gives utterance . We have supposed that this work commences with a single // Christian , as is often the case . Now see the fire of sacred lov'e , kindled on one altar , flaming up brigLtly till the blaze catches and infolds many hearts , and there ensues a general church offering of godly sorrow . Then on all the altars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the praying circle , in the house of worship , sacrifices are burning , incense is rising , a service well pleasing to the Ma*jesty on high . Now let the objector come forward and tell us what evil there is in all this : let us put to him the question , whether the angels in heaven , rejoicing over one penitent sinner , do not delight in it all ? And can their sympathies be opposed to the heart of the God they worship ? What now are the producing cause and means of revivals ? First and chief , it is the work of the Holy Spirit . The utter and absolute dependence upon God for its accomplishment , we can hardly enough acknowledge . The revival of Christian graces , as well as the birth of souls , is " not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God . " Conversion by the Spirit , what Bible reader can deny ? And it would be an utter anomaly , shocking to reason as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spiritual growth and life to be other than that which is absolutely essential in the life 's origin . Is it said to Christians , " ye have purified your souls ? " It is always " through the Spirit . " Is it said , " the love of God is shed abroad in their hearts ? " it is always " by the Holy Ghost . " Do they walk in God 's statutes ? It is because he has " put his spirit within them . " Is it " Paul that planteth , and Apollos that watereth ? " It is " God alone that giveth the increase , " and that to the end . But with this tribute of justice and honor to God have we said all ? Are the change and the reviving or growth , physical and independent of man 's agency ? If merely physical , then it is not moral , or spiritual . If miraculous$ then how made man 's duty ? Or , if you disagree with this , can we not come upon common , acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of the holy Spirit in conversion and sanctification , man has a work to perform . And has not God appointed human instrumentality for his accepted servants in their mission with others ? We come then to this in-quiryWhat are the human means of revivals ? Here is one or many Christians not in that state of piety which is attended by sweet peace of mind and the confirming witness of the spirit . They are at best obnoxious to that one sad charge brought // against the Church of Ephesus- " they have left their first love. ** They do not realize in their own souls the " no condemnation of those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit . " How shall they be revived ? They must consider their ways . Reflection upon their state will produce conviction of sin . Then they must confess their sins , repent of them and make an entire consecration of themselves and their all to God . Their fallowground must be broken up . The plough must not turn aside or any rough or hardened spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . This will be obedience to the conimand , " repent and do thy first works . " If still the sensibilities seem frozen and unyielding , holding themselves to the consecration , they must pray more for the holy Spirit . They have an unfailing promise if they ask aright . This course followed , not for experiment , but for obedience to the most high , will among Christians result in a revived state . And this is the way to realize the higher type of piety . There is no royal road to it unless it be this . We have then a revival begu*i . What can these Christians do that the blessed work of grace may extend ? They can offer prayer . We have abundant reason to believe that the effectual fervent prayer of the revived Christian , for this end , will be answered . Not that every individual for whom he may have a benevolent desire will certainly be converted or revived . Casting himself upon the promises and crying , " Lord , what wilt thou have me to do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longing and expectation for every individual . Nor , if such be the case , after thorough self-examination and attempt at prayer , need he reproach himself for it . God does not require faith for everything . The questions should be , " can a special or generic promise be found applicable to the case ? If not , in the effort to pray sufficiently repeated , is the soul drawn out in desire and expectation for that object ? Is there any success in the attempt to lay hold of the arm of the Lord for it ! If not , and the heart of the petitioner is filled with the spirit , he may turn to something else where God will lead him forth to prevalence . Let him give full and free scope to his prayers , and be willing that God may glorify himself just as he will . His heart will fasten on something . Where declension prevails or the impenitent have not recently decided against God in full blaze of the truth ; he will generally , perhaps always , obtain the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A minister looks upon his people and is impressed with the great need of an especial outpouring of the spirit . He goes before God himself , in the appointed way , and is revived . // Then he begins to pray for the souls more especially within the scope of his labors . His own sensibilities , from time to time , grow more deeply moved . His yearnings increase . At length an assurance of a blessing dawns . The light increases . And by and by , seeking divine directions in his labors , and quenching not the Spirit , the Sun of righteousness arises upon that Church and community with healing in his wings . Prayer and study of the word of God will show that this is a divine prescription for a revival . It appears that that great epoch of revivals whose origin dates in 1735 , commenced with that distinguished woman , the wife of Pres. Edwards . She became deeplTy affected with a sense of her want of conformity to the full requirements of God . She deeply felt that she " needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thirsting for righteousness . She devoted days to fasting and prayer and a renewal of her covenant with God . This resulted , first , in a wonderful refreshing to her own soul , and in such views and feelings as were often almost overpowering to her physical frame . Then , others were similarly affected , the unrenewed were reached , and the work went on through towns and states to its glorious issue . Go where we will and search the history of such otitpourings of the spirit , and we shall find that they have invariably been preceded by the effectual , fervent prayer . True , cases have been where a large portion , and even almost an entire Church with their minister , have been greatly astonished by a sudden and unexpected coming of the reviving and converting influences of the Holy Spirit , and they have inferred that God had granted the wonderful blessing out of some special regard or in sovereign mercy , while *hey were in declension , without even being inquired of for such things . But by and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , sometimes , a humble , unnoticed person in the Church , had been wrestling with God for a revival of his work . And let it be noticed that this kind of prayer is not for generalities ; it is not for all good causes alike ; one thing is greatly desired and that is sought . And it is prayer so importunate , that it will be perseverino* , not for the sake of it , but because it can not rest without it . *Look at the man who wishes to accomplish some great worldly obif ect ; as Bonaparte , who thirsted to be conqueror of e is a man in earnest . His mind is intent on compassing tVmis one end . He gives himself no rest from it . He wakes and thinks and plans , while the untroubled world is all asleep . Look at the man whom God uses as his agent in effecting a revival of his work . His argum emits and pleas with men are unwearying , for with them would he prevail . His prayer is habitual desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // 1855 . Revivals of Religion . 105 thrice a day to the throne of grace for the desired object . Give his mind a moment 's respite from his daily business , and he presses his suit with God . His countenance shows that his soul is burdened with 1ongin* desire for something he does not possess . It was not fanaticism in Paul when he said , " My little children of whom I travail in birth . " Brainard so agonized in prayer for his " poor Indians , " that he " sweat through and through , " and " nature seemed exhausted . " The great work of salvation at the Kirk of Shotts in Scotland , in 1630 , when five hundred souls were hopefully converted under one sermon , was preceded by such strong desire , that Christians continued in prayer the whole previous night . Whitfield speaks of a similar spirit of prayer as attending the great revival in connection with his labors in Scotland , and remarks on one occasion that " he could scarcely walk out in any direction , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some one in prayer . " These things are not strange to those who know what it is to offer prevailing prayer for the outpouring of the Spirit . The first great era of revivals under the new dispensation opened thus : the apostles and many women , the mother of Jesus , and his brethren , one hundred and twenty in all , after the ascension of our Lord , went up into an upper room , perhaps the very place where the sacramental supper was instituted , and there spent ten days together in prayer , and then came the outpouring of the Spirit at the Pentecost , when three thousand souls were converted in a few hours . Revived Christians can present divine truth to the minds of others us a means of revivals of religion . To this they are appointed by the command " to preach the gospel . " By believing the word , are men converted and sanctified . To saints it is said , " Ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth . " Christ 's prayer was , " Sanctify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ye are my witnesses , saith the Lord . " It is the business of Christians then to testify to one another and to the world for God . When declension has existed , what order of presenting the truth should be observed , with a view to a revival of religion ? The great foundation doctrines of the gospel must ever be made prominent . The witness for God can find no firm , safe standing anywhere else . He can erect impregnable walls and fortresses for both defense and aggression on no other ground . Here is the arsenal for all the implements and stores of warfare . The cross of Christ must be #he great sun of his system of divine truth . All the other saving doctrines of the gospel must take their places as brilliant stars around it . If a revived // minister would lay a basis for an especial work of grace , he must have recourse to these , or presuppose , and not falsely , that this foundation is laid . Then he must look for his witnesses , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacefully compact together , of one mind as to the campaign , and braced in heart for perplexity , and stern trials , within and without , during all the warfare ? Have they all enlisted , not on trial , but for life ? Are there no useless hangers-on that must be brought into the ranks , not by force but by grace , or be disowned ? Alas ! that the Christian general must in these times ordinarily expend so much labor with his soldiery . But this must be done . There is no way to avoid it . It is a weighty testimony when Christians are found to obey that new commandment , to love one another . So thought the apostate Julian , when , attempting to restore pagan worship in Rome , he declared that the heathen religion could never prosper until its devotees possessed that " sin*nlar love " and " exciuplary kindness " toward each other which characterized the early Christians . Are any members of a church deficient here ? The difficulties must be settled , or the persevering sinners cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its stead . And this will tax human wisdom , kindness , patience , and perseverance . The same process must be observed in the case of difficulties between church members and non-communicants . The church must be right . It is only justice to the truth that where wrong has been done , humble , penitent confession should be made . *JIt is an unrepealable law that all sin should be confessed to those before whom it is committed ; hence all sin to God and much to men . Christians must confess their faults one to another and then to the unconverted . This is preaching the gospel at a rapid rate . When all this is thoroughly done , and the preacher turns to those out of Christ , in a community where the unrenewed have not of late glaringly rejected the Saviour , he will find that the work of conviction has far advanced , and he may soon turn to the persuasions of the gospel . Indeed the church will not thus have completed preparing the way for the coming of the lord , before sinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps rejoicing in the forgiveness of sins in advance of some of the church , and comino ' like the clouds of heaven and as doves to their windows . The object now is to preach the gospel the most effectively and savingly . Christians will do it from door to door , and from heart to heart . The pulpit at this stage can not expend // too much wisdom or strength . Great care must be taken to adjust the various doctrines of the gospel according to the scriptures . The divine truths , for the best effect , must be arranged and set with the exactness and judgment that gems are set in a diadem . Here is opportunity for the highest ekercise of Christian art , though the gospel even distorted and feebly preached will in the circumstances accomplish wonders ; showing the great inherent power of the word when endued with the Holy Ghost . The preacher must study the minds of his hearers . He must know the set time for the multiform and various truths to meet the peculiar states and the highest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , heaven and hell . He should avoid making a compound of truths , either in one or many successive sermons . Those who preach with most success at such times will be found to excel in concentration . Each sermon has its subject , and that chosen for a definite end , and that end for a definite case . And his sermons , for weeks or months together , are not chosen as though by haphazard from a large collection , but the subject is taken and the sermon shaped with all the care and attention that a sculptor places his chisel , and applies the strokes of the mallet . He begins his efforts to save souls by placing his feet in a firm and secure place , and then treads forward , by design , not by chance , for one certain object iu the future , an object which none but the eye of faith can perceive . Now Sinai must peal forth her awful thunders , with no false tenderness , no reserve . Then the cross must send out its melting invitations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned when they need to be persuaded , nor persuaded when they need to be warned . Love will not answer for terror , nor terror for love . It does not suffice to show a sinner the way to repent when he needs to be convicted , and the gospel does not torture him with conviction when he is ready to embrace an offered Saviour . There is need of something more than reasoning and argument when he acknowledges all the truth ; and his sensibilities should be touched . And sensibility is not intellect or conscience , and the preacher should know , as well as he can , when to make his address to each one in its time , and when to roll up an avalanche for them all . When God has come and set apart a special season for himself to work , man should not be idle . And truly , if there are any real and just principles of our nature that can then be brought into action for the divine glory , they should not fail of being used . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature and knowledge and feelings of their audi- // Feb. ence help on the power of the truth . And are there no pAnciples of our nature that at such a season may be to the gospel wh at the combinations of the three simple , mechanical powers are to the great , labor-saving structures of machinery ? Are there not such , and as much from God in the moral world as the lever , the inclined plane , and the pulley are in the mechanical ? If so , should not revivals of religion be hailed as especial blessings for the reason that they give an hdvantao*e , a great increase of power , in effectively preachin* the gospe*f ? Look at that principle of human nature which gives us a common substratum of interests and feelings , of affections and inclinations , of hopes and fears , denominated by a single word , sympathy . This principle and similar ones have received the attention of others , particularly of the third author on the subject referred to at the head of these pages ; but we hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new light . Man was made for society . In the beginning God declared that it was not good for the man to be alone . On this fact , as a basis , he originated an institution for his welfare and happiness which shall last , with the seal of the divine sanction upon it , until the resurrection morning . The same blood courses the life-currents of our bodies . The same air we inhale for our vitality and health . The same food we partake for nourishment and strength . In general , the same thoughts , from day to day , and year to year , employ and engross our minds . The same feelings of joy and sorrow , of happiness and pain , of hopes and fears , exalt or depress , agitate or calm our breasts . We are wont to mingle our tears together and share with each other our joys . We call into action this principle of sympathy in triumph and security , in danger and defeat . It is this which separates men into clans and tribes and circles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alliances and kingdoms . Satan employs this principle . It is by the great law of sympathy , as the mighty lever of his plans and movements , that he carries on his vast system of temptation and sin through the flesh and the world . He associates men into circles , groups , clubs , bands , mobs , societies , communities , and then moving one or few , he easily carries the whole , and sweeps away the barriers of virtue and religion for whole generations and centuries . And shall not holy men be at liberty to employ the same principle in all their benevolent measures and toils for the change and development of the fallen and lost ? Every harmless and useful principle in man 's nature , the righteous // and good have a heaven-endowed right to use for the amelioration and welfare of their fellow-men . We are likely to believe what others believe around us . One sinner convicted of his sins convicts another sinner . One man believing unto life throws an influence over another to make him believe . Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend to the things that concern their immortal interests . One person , serious and thoughtful , arrests the attention of another . His impressions deepening , deepen the feelings of conviction or sadness with his friend . When one turns unto God a strong argument is brought forth or another to turn . God has himself sanctioned the use of sympathy in religion . It is by this law and upon it that he has enjoined the assembling of ourselves together for his worship . Jesus Christ appeals to us with encouragement and hope to bear up under the strongest temptations and trials because he has felt and borne the same , and mare . Without this principle of sympathy we could hardly find reasons sufficient for his taking upon himself our nature and making an atonement in human flesh . The great tragic scene might then have been enacted in heaven and witness of it only sent down to men . Why then shall we be suspicious and afraid of employing this common , useful , essential principle of our nature for the service of God in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which begins and ends only in sympathy . But we believe that the obligations of God are upon us to employ , encourage , and foster this principle to effect true conviction of sin and real conversion to God . Sympathy is a mighty engine for the publication of divine truth . Let God 's enginery be employed with no fear as to its results . Look at that principle of the human mind , which must everywhere exist as the basis of all affection and action , to which appeal is made in every case of inducement to evil or good , a principle capable of perversion , but which God has constituted for human happiness in hi gh and holy pursuits ; we mean , animated , awakened desire . It is first an involuntary emotion and constituent of our nature . It becoijies sinful or holy according as we lend to it the action of the will with holy or sinful intention . Awakened or excited desire is that which is just on the point of taking to itself the potency of the will and leading the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of temptation to sin ; for good , it is the drawing , moving influence toward the right . The Apostle Paul denominates the state of all men before conversion as // one of spiritual death . The desires in the direction of hdly things are all slumbering . If now and then they are aroused , it is only that their lazy voice may be heard , saying , " yet a little sleep , a little slumber , a little folding of the hands to sleep . " Bring then every electrifying power for their resurrection . In a revival of religion first one Christian is awakened . He repents , he prays , the Spirit is granted according to the promise , lie is revived , and joy and peace pour in their delicious waves upon his soul . The sacred fire will not be inclosed . It breaks out of that breast , it catches the heart of a companion , a child , a neighbor , a friend . All who perceive it and judge sincerely , discover it to be a good , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bosoms . If the heart is hard and stupid in sin , the rising , kindling feeling is put down , or kept imprisoned as a criminal , an outlaw . If otherwise , the slightest thing fosters and fans the flame . Awakened desire with Christians prompts to prayer and labor . The blessing of God 's approving face received in prayer reacts upon the desire , kindling it into ardor and zeal , and more importunate prayer . The duty of warning and exhortation to sinners performed with awakened desire for their salvation , whether met with encouragement or repulse , is sure to send a reflex quickening influence upon the praying , believing spirit , and the Importance of labor with sinners and prayer unto God is increased manifold in the mind 's estimate of both . When sinners themselves begin to share in the awakening of the religious community , many hearts seem to be united as by electric bonds and awakened desire to be passing over them all as the electricity itself . When Christians show forth that they have found the pearl of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impenitent to share also in the treasure . When sinners themselves are found rejoicing in hope , their companions in sin are sure to feel the inducements to seek the Lord while he may be found . Let a revival commence in a neighboring town or church , and how soon the awakened desire is more or less expressed to enjoy the same blessing in the communities around . On this principle it is , in part , that when the tithes are all brought into the storehouse , and the windows of heaven are opened , a blessing is poured out , so great that one church and congregation are not able to receive it . It is sure to overpass their bounds , and others are made partakers in the gift . Another principle of our nature brought into requisition in revivals of religion  --  and much depend upon its right cultiva // tion and use-is that of expectation . It is a fact with mankind , that when one uncommon event takes place , they look for others in its train . It may be explained somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its cause leads to the expectation that the same or similar causes are in operation to produce like effects . Besides , the mind surprised by one thing intuitively prepares itself for surprise in another ; and this is expectation . According to our faith , we receive ; even if it be only natural instead of religious faith we are likely to obtain and accomplish what we attempt in sincerity and hope . This fact in our nature and history is necessary to our efficiency and happiness . What should we effect if always desponding and wanting in ambition to execute ? How heavily would every thing hang upon our hands , how destitute of energy our mental powers , how undeveloped our faculties ! Religion is not against our nature , but in consonance with it . The Holy Spirit recognizes and acts in accordance with the laws of mind . A converted soul can not hide its light under a bushel . Its conversion becoming known , creates some expectation of other conversions . And some will even begin to expect it of themselves . Conversions increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon on the wing , and takes her course not in vain . It is in the philosophy of this expectation that the declaration of Christ has , in part , its basis , when he says : " Whoever therefore shall be ashamed of me , and of my words , in this adulterous and sinful generation , of him also shall the son of man be ashamed , when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy Angels . " Christ 's servants are appointed to be witnesses for him and to confess him before men , that , as one effect , by the principle of expectation others may be led to repentance for their sins and to eternal life . When it is heard that God is in the midst of a people , how expectation begins to rise and quicken with all who have any interest in jr affection for these things . At first , perhaps , some who have no hope begin to flee to their amusements or business for diversi oii or quiet in sin , but expectation even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth to the soul . Many such often return to the house of God and to the means of grace to be deeply convicted of sin and converted to Christ . It was true with Dr. Nettleton , and has been with others , that on his reaching a village or town to hold a series of meetings , one third or half of the impenitent part of the community would at once be struck with conviction of sin , which , with a large number would deepen and lead to // conversion . And this was only agreeable to the natural law of expectation , since it is becoming that the Holy Spirit should employ this principle of the mind as one instrument in his holy mission to the unregenerate . One reason why some churches and communities are more , and more frequently , blessed with revivals than others , is found in the fact that some expect them more , and hence are led to pray and strive for them more . And here lies one cause of the great difference in respect to the frequency and power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evangelical churches of Europe . In the early history of New England , ministers and people founded their institutions and many of their chief hopes of permanent and devoted piety in revivals . And the expectation of them has more or less been handed down from one generation to another . In England it has been far different . To a great extent there , churches and ministers have been without the expectation , and equally without the blessing . These illustrations may suffice as showing the many servants of God , stationed in our very nature , which the wise laborer will endeavor to employ for his master in the salvation of men and which , for the opportunity to use them , highly increase the value of revivals of religion . And naturally upon this arises the question , shall the pastor of a church at such seasons go single-handed with his lay brethren to the work , or call in other ministers for assistance . The time is most important . Doubtless some souls *vi11 now turn to go to God or never be turned . Rapidly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death unto death The minister who knows the importance of this state of things could almost wish to do six days work in one . And in one , may then often be done what long years afterward may fail to accomplish . Often two , if wise and filled with the Spirit , can do more than one . And who shall come to his assistance , if opportunity of choice be o4ven ? One who has a people of his own and can tarry but as*ort time ? Or one that can govern his stay by the actual prospect of his nsefulness ? Who shall come ? One whose soul must be divided-half with his own people-half with the other ? and help at such a time needs to be with all the soul and strength that any one man ever had . Would not the vote of the General Association of Connecticut many years ago , have been better , if , instead of affirming that they would not employ evangelists in revivals , they had endeavored to correct all abuses and made some discriminations , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there left it : // 113 or had done as ministerial bodies did in the revivals of the las of the preceding and the beginning of the present century , who appointed the fittest men of their own number to go ont , two by two , on preaching tours among the neighboring churches . Then some of the present day would not suffer precious victories to glide away from their reach through a lack or a fear to call for efficient help by employing so-called evangelists , and then there might be more evangelists to be called . We are aware that it requires men of much piety and extraordinary powers to fill this office , that some have thrust themselves into it , or been unduly elated by it , and that on these general grounds the Association took their action . But was the remedy appropriate to the disease ? And are there not tokens of a reaction from that opposition to this class of laborers , which so generally existed in that day and since , when the Southern Presbyterian and a growing number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that the dependence must be placed upon them , or that they should receive honor belonging to God . This is great wickedness , When ministers or p eople begin to rely upon the introduction of foreign human help , not upon God , it is high time that they have no help except that he who comes should first of all endeavor to lead them to repentance for the sin of not preparing the way for time coming of the Lord before desiring the coming of man . But what if it be said , " as soon as the evangelist leaves , the interest ceases ? " This is not true when the work is genuine . " Still , is there not always a decline ? " No : If the pastor declines , many of the people will ; otherwise many will hold on with zeal and faith . Who can show that the human mind admits of a precise evenness and glow of sensibility , even with constant growth in grace ? Who knows that the Lord requires it ? And would there be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evangelist remained ? Was there never any declension without evangelists ? And just as much and as often as with them , where there was the same revived state from which to decline ? In that first great revival under Edwards ' labors without evangelists , why was there a decline after five months ? And is there never spiritual dearth with those who have no evangelists and no revivals ? Those churches are most spiritual that enjoy true revivals most frequently . Wherever there is a declension in real piety there should revivals be repeated until Christians learn to abide constantly in Christ . And at such seasons of religious interest , how often may the gospel be preached ? What harm if every day ? We have // never known healthy people that could not bear the hearing of the pure word pretty often . And may not all the garnered wisdom of the past and present be sufficient to restrain from intemperate zeal and all kinds of excess ? The six divinely appointed festivals of the Jews , aside from the Sabbath , furnish some authority for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a ground for the appropriateness of seasons of more frequent convocations than the Sabbath affords . Even our brethren of the Episcopal Church have a protracted meeting every year , often no doubt a spiritual blessing , and which might be made much more so , somewhat differently conducted , with more effectual prayer , expectation , closer preaching , personal effort , and not necessarily always at the time of Lent , but more as the providence and spirit of God might direct . But those who desire evangelists and protracted meetings that they may complete their religion for the year are never in a revival state until they repent in dust and ashes of this mournful , heart-sickening sin . The Christian who is truly revived means never again to backslide . A true revival presupposes a heart in its subjects never to need another in its limited sense . Therefore every true revival of religion is the highest type of religion we have yet attained in this world . There is nothing that goes beyond it . And every revival , instead of preparing the way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some . Many a Christian is then put upon a high and upward way of unwonted holiness which he loses not again for eternity . Discrimination is especially necessary in revivals as to the different states of the sensibilities . No person enjoys spiritual emotion always the same . Like the human body , emotion must be fed ; it must eat , it must act , it must rest . And the last is of equal importance with the others ; the others will not long be without the last . The Christian heart rejoicing in the return of prodigals as the clouds and as doves to their windows , has a joy , if the blessing were permanently continued , that could not last in its glow . If at any time the blessing is withheld and he is disciplined under other skies , he should know that his peace , like a gentle , placid stream , may continue though his emotions do not kindle and burn as in other days , that his real holiness is to be estimated not by emotion but by the consecrated willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , have come to revivals from not recognizing this simple truth . And though Christians should always be filled with the spirit , and ready in heart for any work of the Lord , it need not be expected nor required that they always // maintain a precise evenness in amount of labor or activity , and gasp of faitL To attempt it is a waste of precious strength . It would lead to weariness , dullness , and inefficiency . Christians should and practically may always be in the revived state , so that strictly there should be no more need of the work of revival with them ; yet , from this it does not follow that no special , sanctifying , sealing power would at times be given to themselves , nor that the conversion of sinners , though frequent , would always be with the same rate and steadiness of movement ; and the churches should not waste their energies to drill themselves to such a state of things . When the work of God is well advanced in any community , . the minds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they come to a decision for the present ; some deciding anew against Christ under the pressure of such divine influence that perhaps that choice will never be changed . Men will not remain under deep conviction of sin very long , so that if society be not changing , there is , not opportunity for precise steadiness in the work . Thus it was in primitive times . Three thousand were converted in one day , hut not the same number the next . Two thousand at another time , but this was not the rate of additions to the church of such as should be saved . From this review and discussion of the subject , what shall we couclude ? That revivals have had their day , are worn out and must give way to something else ? How the lips of the prophets are unsealed and touched with holy fire when they speak of a millenial day on the earth . Isaiah , enraptured by the vision , breaks forth : - " Drop down ye heavens from above , . and let the skies pour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them bring forth salvation , and let righteousness spring up together . " It requires pentecostal effusions , such as occurred in primitive days , and in some joyous years and lands since that era , and such as are still more *loriously yet to take place , to fill up the fullness and joy of this language . No image can better express the nature , influences , and effects of a revival of religion , than the picture of Spring , evidently in the prophet 's vision . The rains then come and melt away the snows and ice which a iong period of cold atmosphere and freezing winds has acc*ulated .. The sun climbs up the zenith and pours down his more direct and warming beams . The earth expeLs the frosts and cold from her bosom , and opens her furrows to receive the seed .. The joint influences and nourishing power of sun , earth , rains , and dews , together with the care and labors of the husbandman of the soil , unite together to nurture and cultivate all the germinating treasures // that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that has life , or that with all these favoring circumstances and inIluences can be endued with the power of growth , springs up and smiles and sparkles in the face of the bright sunshine , and the ten thousand drops of dew , and nods and waves with gladness before the balmy breeze . Everything then gives assurance of ripe fruits and golden harvests . As in the seasons of the rolling year there always comes a necessity of spring-time and seed-time , when old things passing away , the earth all be renewed and reclothed in fresh verdure , so in the spiritual history of man , the absolute necessity of spring-time is sure to come . In the unregenerate , unsauctifled state , all men are as the winter of the year , when earth is clothed with snows , the trees are stript of verdure and fruit , and the fields and streams are bound up with the frosts and ice of biting , blasting cold . When the command to make a new heart and a new spirit , and to repent and be converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . And thereafter , just so often as declension and sin separate the poor guilty soul from God , the source and fountain of heat and life , and drive it into the frosts and snows of winter , just so frequently returns the absolute necessity of the renewing , reclothing power of a spiritual spring . The morning of a millennium , then , is yet to come , an&amp;revivals of religion , pentecostal effusions , are to be its harbinger. " 0 Zion , arise and shine , thy light being come . God is now plainly interposing to give a check to worldly aspirations and hopes . Revivals began to dwindle and disappear when this secular prosperity of a half score of years commenced . The **ear 1743 is sadly marked in the'history of Zion , by the fading away of heaven 's peculiar light of salvation . Just one century afterward , in 1843 , apparently for another reason we see the spiritual heavens again begin to darken . The idol Mammon , which has drawn away the hearts of his people , God is breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel of old . Shall not the thought of this sin and the drinking of its bitterness be sufficient to bring Israel , now prostrate before the Lord , to deep penitence and renewal of covenant vows ? May many hearts all over this land join together before the Lord in saying : " For Zion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake will I not rest , until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness , and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth ! "
