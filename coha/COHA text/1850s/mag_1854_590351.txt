UNITED STATES REVIEW . AUGUST , 1854 . ABOLITION AND SECTARIAN MOBS . THOSE who have learned from history that popular licentiousness is the legitimate parent of despotism as well as its best apology , must feel a deep apprehension as to the future destinies of the United States , when they see and hear almost every day the lawless and violent proceedings of tumultuous assemblages of people in our gteat Northern cities , This apprehension will become greatly strengthened , when they take into consideration that these excesses are not the result of sudden and temporary excitements which subside as rapidly as they arise , but of extensive organizations , founded on an obstinate and permanent opposition to the Constitution and laws of the country , and pleading the sanction , not only of the law of nature , but the law of God , in justification of their outrages . In such cases the evil is much deeper seated and the danger far more imminent . Instead of an acute , it becomes a chronic disease of the body politic ; instead of a mere matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dignity of a great principle of action , a conscientious duty-in the performance of which , we are not responsible for the consequences , howevei* mischievous or deplorable . " It is not my fault , " exclaims the misguided fanatic or enthusiast , " it is not my fault that the peace of communities is des-1 // troyed , and the lives of people placed in jeopardy . It is the fault of the Constitution which is a compact with hell , ' and of the laws , which , being in direct opposition to my conscience , I am not only bound not to obey , but to oppose by force if necessary . " Wh*i men arrive at this decision , and act accordingly , it is vain to reason with them , and no resource is left but to repeal the law , enforce its authority , or submit to see all authority set at naught by a succession of mobs , governed exclusively by interests and passions , dignifled with the name of scruples of conscience . Among the many serious evils arising from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of our towns and cities , we may mention two that are greatly to be deprecated . These indications of a licentious and ungovernable spirit , are placed by the enemies of freedom to the account of the laxity of our laws and institutions , and specious arguments drawn from them to prove that men , however enlightened or however fortunately situated , are under no circumstances capable of self-government , since they are thus perpetually placing themselves in a position in which either force must be used to restrain them , or they themselves be left without any restraint whatever . The second result is still more fatal to the interests of freedom . By overwhelming or overawing the civil power , and rendering it incapable of preserving internal tranquility and order , they not only invite , but render the interposition of a military force indispensable to the peace of society and the safety of person and property . When such excesses are of frequent occurrence , the people become accustomed to be governed only by the bayonet , until by degrees they are brought to that degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . Such is the process of the downfall of liberty in every age and country . The comparatively innocent multitude , for the most part instigated by these cunning and malignant spirits which are found like serpents in the grass , lurking in the bosom of every community , first by their excesses alarmed the more sober , rational and peaceful portion for the safety of their persons and property , and rather than submit to the pleasure of a mob , they acquiesced in the discretion of a despot . It was natural they should resort to this alternative , since the prime object of all government is protection ; and if this can not be secured by bestowing liberty on a people , there is no other resource but that of investing them with chains . If they can not // be governed by reason nor law , they must be governed by force , or all government cease , and " chaos come again . " In the first installation of the Government of the United States , there were two great parties , both , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in its application , would conduce most to the peace , prosperity , and happiness of the people . Each of these parties , as will appear by the debates of the great Constitutional convention , were more or less jealous of the people . They were about trying a new experiment , and most of them had serious doubts of the capacity of mankind for self-government . Alexander Hamilton openly maintained that the British Government was the most perfect that ever existed , an-I that without its abuses and imperfections it would be impracticable , These abuses and imperfections were , according to his theory , indispensable to its perfection , since , without the patronage of the crown , in other words , its means of corruption , the equilibrium of the different parts could not be preserved , and there would be no great cohesive power in the system , This gentleman was , and still is. though in his grave , the oracle and leader of that Monarchical Federal Party which still exists in the United States , though it has not , like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in favor of a monarchical government is clear from the plan of a constitution which he presented to the convention , on the final rejection of which , he seems to have retired from that body as his name does not again occur in its discussions . It ought not , however , to be forgotten that he had the magnanimity to wield his pen , in conjunction with Mr Madison , in behalf of that constitution which differed so greatly from his own favorite plan , and that not one of all his co-terdporaries was a more able and eloquent defender . His enemies - may , perhaps , ascribe thi* course , to his perceiving in the new constitution , what Patrick Henry called " an awful squinting towards monarchy " ; but we ourselves are willing to believe he was governed by higher and more patriotic motives , He was a bold , honest leader ; but as a scholar , philosopher , politician , and we may add patriot , he was far inferior to his great rival and co-temporary , Mr Jefferson . He took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , the first Treasury Report which laid the basis of the funding and financial system of the Federal Party , contains not a single new idea or original proposition . It is a servile copy of the British system of political economy and finance . 1* // Opposed to General Hamilton in the convention , was James Madison , a man who has left the mark of his foot-print as deeply in the soil of this country as any that went before , or will probably come after him ; a man , whose name will be found in the past history * the United States , identified with almost every great measure of foreign and domestic policy , and who thought more , and condensed more in a given time or space , than any writer or speaker among all his co-temporaries . He may be justly called the father of the Constitution , and certainly no parent ever more ably and gallantly defended his offspring . But Mr Madison too was a little shy of the people . The spirit of Democracy , such as it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Histories of Greece , Rome , Florence , and England , loomed before him , and his imagination was somewhat appalled by the portentous spectre . Indeed , it is curious to see these indications of a deep seated suspicion of the people , and the freedom with which it was expressed , not only by Mr Madison , but George Mason , Roger Sherman , Franklin , and others of the staunchest advocates of popular soverei* nty . They hesitated least they should bestow too much power on the new sovereign , who like all other despots , might abuse that power , and we see this latent jealousy peeping forth , in restraining the majority within the limits of a written constitution ; in coupling the states and the people together as the residuary legatees of reserved rights ; and placing it beyond the power of the latter in their collective capacity , to make any alteration whatever in that instrument . Whether this jealousy was well or ill grounded , may become , ere long , a most interesting question , and one that can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content ourselves with briefly discussing the subject in its application to the caption of this article . The great difficulty in every system of government , is the preservation of a proper equilibrium in the different powers of which it is composed . In the government of the United States , though all power emanates from the people , its exercise is practically committed to three distinct branches , the Executive , Legislative , and Judicial . These powers are defined by the Constitution as explicitly and distinctly as is possible by any language , and are exercised in a great measure by each one independently of the others . To prevent encroachments on the part of either , is the great desideratum , since *ve*y approach to a concentration of power in any one // branch of government , whether executive , legislative , or judicial , by removing the restraints indispensable to its due exercise , inevitably tends to the downfall of that great system of equality , which is as indispensable to the different branches of the government as to the *eedom of the people . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this government emanates from the people , and they being the sovereigns , there is no necessity for placing them under any restraint , if such a thing were possible . But this a dangerous and impracticable theory , destructive to all government . There must be a power somewhere to restrain the vices and passions of man , for without it , no society could exist , since , though we believe that every rational being is imbued by his Creator with a distinct sense of right and wrong , in other words , an innate perception of the principles of reason afid justice , still experience has shown us that these are not of themselves sufficient barriers to the temptations of interest or the excesses of the passions . The progress of the human mind has , therefore , been invariably exemplified in the formation of a social compact  --  a union of all , for the preservation of the rights of all equally ; and that mankind have thus voluntarily consented to place themselves under such a system of restraints , is to our minds , unequivocal proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prefer the unrestrained indulgence of their passions to the wholesome restrictions of the laws . The government of the United States is one of laws enacted by representatives chosen by the people for that purpose , and when these laws are in conformity with the Constitution , sovereign as the people may be , they are bound to obey them until repealed by the same sovereign authority by which they were enacted . The laws govern the people , not the people the laws ; and to take upon themselves the power of forcibly arresting their operation by tumultuous assemblages arrayed in opposition to the civil authorities is just as much a usurpation of power , as if a single despot should attempt the same outrages by a mere exercise of his sovereign will . We freely admit that when a whole nation with one accord rises in opposition to a law , or system of laws , it exercises a natural unquestionable right ; but for every individual member of the great body politic , or any portion of a community to claim such a right would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government , there are two antagonist parties , the governor and the governed . Each of these is // governed by different motives of action . Those who exercise the power are impelled by what may be called a natu'i*a1 instinct to extend it as far as practicab ! e , and those on whom powcr operates , to keep it from transgressing its authorised limitsf This contest is **rpetual1y going on in all governments , and the almost uniform result has been in favor of the governing party . The invarible tendency has been to a concentration of power in one person , or one class , to the utter exclusion of all others , and the consequent gradual depression and deterioration of the great masses . To this there is one , and we believe only one great exception , namely , the United States . Since the adoption of the Constitution , it can not , we think , be doubted that the democratic principle of self-government has acquired new strength , and that the jealousy of the people , to which we previously referred as pervading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in some measure subsided . The right of suffrage has been so far extended as to have become almost universal except in some of the New England States , where it is restricted by the discretionary powers of what are called the Selectmen of the different towns . The direct influence of the people in consequence of more frequent appeals to the popular feeling , and most especially by that great system of organisation denominated *Party discipline , " has become more concentrated and powerful , and the practical operation of their sovereignty is unquestionably becoming every day more intensely felt , as well as extensively recognized in our political system . Add to this , that under this sovereignty the progress of public prosperity , and the general diffusion of individual happiness , has been so uniform , so rapid , and so almost miraculous , as to have given to the system all the weight and authorii y derived from a long series of uninterrupted experience . In this state of things a most important point of discussion presents itself . It requires to be touched gently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deem it proper on this occasion to state most explicitly that we are , always have been , and we trust always will be , democrats of the strictest sect ; and that if , on the present occasion , we venture to speak a little freely to our legitimate sovereign , the People , it is as a faithful , loyal subject , whose only object is , not to question their legitimate authority , but to caution them against that abuse of power which , whether in kings or people , invariably leads to its ultimate downfall . // That the freedom of the people , especially where congregated in large masses , is rapidly degenerating into wayward licentiousness , is , we think , undeniable . Scarcely a weekwe might almost say-scarcely a day passes without presenting examples , in some quart* or other , of wanton and gross violations of the public peace in direct opposition to the law of the land . These are not confined to those remote regions of our frontiers where the bold and somewhat reckless pioneers of civilization , in the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of taking the law into their own hands , for self-preservation , They occur in those very communities , which , from their boasted intelligence and refinement , and their pretended attachment to law and order , should set a better example . From Boston  --  the head quarters of mobbery  --  to Syracuse , the extreme tail which always wags sympathetically with its great exemplar , there seems little else than a succession of tumultuous assemblages of men , women , and children , of all classes , collected together for unlawful or mischievous purposes . Sometimes it is a runaway negro or a barrel of whisky ; at others , a fanatical street preacher either half mad with sectarian zeal , or instigated by the more dangerous hypocrisy of cunning abettors behind the curtain . At others , it is a battle royal of firemen breaking each others heads and stabbing each others hearts , for no earthly reason , or , at least , none conceivable by common sense ; and now and then a mob of strong-minded women asserting the rights of the gentler sex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearding valiant peace officers . And here we will take occasion to hint our suspicions that it is quite possible it may be partly owing to these strong minded women , that their weak minded husbands are so prone to seek consolation at the tavern ; and that if . these petticoated reformers were to devote themselves a little more to making them comfortable at home , they would not be so fond of seeking it abroad . We have devoted some attention to this interesting enquiry , and the result has been that not a few of these unlucky tipplers occasionally seek consolation in the bottle for those crying evils , smoky chimneys and scolding wives . Every man is not a Socrates , and therefore can not resort to teaching philosophy out of doors , as an antidote to the lectures of the Xantippe within . We respectfully recommend the strongminded women to try the experiment just suggested ; and if it does not prove successful , we hereby surrender these refractory iticurable topers to their discretion . Our divine country women-for such // they are beyond all doubt-will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands are a sort of aristocracy among wild animals , and can not easily be tamed either by curtain-lectures , or lectures on woman 's rights , coming even from the lips of those awful myst*ous oracles , Lucretia Mott , Lucy Stone , or Abby Folsom , who , beyond all doubt , if properly investigated , would be found to be no more women , than the good old man in the moon . But be this as it may , the atmosphere of our great cities , most especially in the north , is becoming so inflammable of late , that it is only to apply a spark and it explodes like a jug of camphine , setting the community in a flame . A mad field-preacher lecturing in the streets ; a fanatical , or hypocritical enthusiast ; a temperance lecturer , or a strongminded woman , can , at a moment 's warning , call together a tumultuous assemblage of the people , too strong for the civil power , and set the stormy wave of the multitude raging and rolling over all the barriers erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety of peaceable citizens . If this ywocess of mob law goes on much further , every great city of the north , and some in the west , will necessarily by degrees become a military camp , and the ' soldiers , instead of being occupied in defending their country from foreign enemies , be employed in shooting down , or overawing the wild two-legged animals , who listen to no arguments but powder and ball , and know no authority but that of the bayonet . All civil government will be at an end ; all civil rights be merged in the absolute necessity of preserving internal tranquility and order , and protecting the person and property of the citizen . This , to be sure is an extreme view of the case ; but it should not be forgotten , that the invariable tendency of all abuses is to extremes , and that unless arrested in time , they never fail to reach the climax of atrocity . Until of late years , the people of the United States have been distinguished above all others , for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-government , by a voluntary subjection to self-imposed restraints . The early history of our independence , presents but two prominent examples of opposition to the laws carried to the extent of rebellion or insurrection , and these were merely local in their causes as well as their consequences . They were rare exceptions ; they originated in temporary excitements , and were not like our abolition or sectarian mobs , based on principles which constitute permanent motives of action , and are therefore // permanent sources of disorder and contention . Rarely indeed , a squabble might occur at a contested election in some one of our great cities ; but such occurrences were rare and died away with the occasion . The paroxysm might be acul e for the moment , but the *sease had not become chronic , as seems now the case ; and if we compare the conduct of the people of the United States during the past , with that of those of Europe for the same period , we shall have good reason to bo proud that the wildest excesses of their freedom have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either in struggling for liberty or abusing its enjoyment . But the period seems approaching when they will be no longer entitled to this distinction . They appear to be rapidly approaching the most dangerous of all precipices to a free people , by substituting licentiousness for liberty , and opposition to the Constitution and laws for a patriotic devotion to their duties as free citizens of a free State . As there is no effect without a cause , it may not be without its uses to trace these increasing infractions of public la*w and public order , which are daily becoming more daring and pernicious to the fountain head . We charge them in the first place to the abolitionists , and their associates and abettors the apostles of the HigherLaw , whose avowed doctrines go to the utter annihil ation of all human laws and institutions as they exist in the United States . We charge them in a great degree to these mischievous agitators , who , in the pursuit of one single object , have denounced all laws and institutions , sacred as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing have taught no inconsiderable portion of the people of the United States , that they are performing a duty equally acceptable to God and man when they flout the Constitution " as a compact with Hell , " and fly in the face of the laws which it sanctions . Thus ferocious mobs and tumultuous assemblages , become the chosen instruments of the Higher-Law ; and thus we find among the foremost instigators to outrage and bloodshed , to violations of the Constitution and Law , men sitting in the Senate of the United States , under the solemn obligation to maintain and support that very Constitution . From their seats in the Senate they utter speeches , and issue inflammatory addresses , with the open and avowed object of stimulating the people to active , violent opposition to the laws passed by a majority of that very body of which they are members . Is it any wonder that thus sanctioned by the example , and stimulated by the precepts of these base birds who // befoul their own nests , the popular feeling wherever their influence extends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and outrages upon the peace of society ? Are we surprised that the ignorant runaway negroes , who have sought refuge in the North , shor*il stand ready with pistol and dirk , to bid defiance to the laws of the land , when they are thus told by Senators and Legislators , makers of these laws , that they are no better than " a compact with hell , " and that it is both their right and their duty to resist them at the cost of the blood of those whose function it is to carry them into execution ? Was there ever higher stimulants to violence and bloodshed offered to a people ; and we repeat , is it a subject of wonder that they should be so often successful where these incendiary Senators and Legislators are most influential ? Unquestionably , any member of either House of Congress , has a right to oppose with all his personal influence , and all his powers of argument , any measure u*der discussion which he may deem injurious to the honor and interests of the country , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him to vote in opposition to his opinions or principles , except perhaps the explicit instructions of his constituents , and even in that case he has the alternative of resigning his station rather than act against his deliberate convictions of right . But , we apprehend that the case is radically different when the measure has become a law of the land , and received the sanction not only of the Executive , but of the body of which he is a member . In that case , decency and a proper regard to the constitutional rights of the majority , require that the law should meet his acquiescence if not his approval , so long as it remains unrepealed . He may advocate its repeal by all his powers of reason and argument , but in our opinion* he is bound by every obligation of a citizen , and most especially a legislator , to abstain from all inflammatory appeals to the passions of the people , calculated and intended to produce any violent or illegal opposition to an obnoxious measure . Such a course is in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , where the rights and interests of a whole people are staked on the issue . But there is another question connected with this subject of equal importance , and still greater delicacy-involving a point of conscience , and carrying with it conflicting duties as a legislator . Every member of both houses of Congress , is obliged , in accordance with the organic law , to make oath that he will maintain and support the Constitution , before he can enter on the exercise of his legislative functions . Now // we would respectfully ask of Messrs . Seward , Sumner , Chase , and Wade , by what ingenious system of consientious logic they are directed in the performance of their legislative duties . We would ask them how they manage to reconcile their oath to maintain and support the Constitution , with their allegiance to a higher law , which it seems governs them in their legislative capacity , and with their perpetual denunciations of some of its most important principles and provisions* By what subtle process of sophistry , by what sly insidious appeals to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after calling God to witness their devotion to the constitution , join in a hue and cry against that constitution with Garrison , Parker , Phillips , and Quincy , as " a compact with hell , " , a gross violation of the law of God and the rights of nature ? " How can they conscientiously swear to sustain that which they are using all their efforts to pull down ? And with what face , except that of the most hardened hypocrisy , can they take their stations as legislators among men whose highest , most sacred obligation is a devoted obedience to that instrument they and their abettors denounce in language with which nothing but an imperious. sense of duty could induce us to pollute our paper . If this is conscience , this the higher law of our sublimated reformers , we will venture most respectfully to suggest , as a very delicate point for their consideration , whether in their devoted allegiance to one single scruple of conscience they are not violating every other , and committing something very like perjury , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we recollect that these conscientious gentlemen have actually volunteei'ed the acceptance of a seat in the senate involving a perpetual conflict of these delicate conscientious scruples , it can not but be a subject of surprise to those who are not adapts in reconciling such opposite principles of action . But this surprise must be quickened into absolute wonder , when it is known to all conversant with the history of their elevation to the senate , that it was brought about by corrupt coalitions , disgraceful bargains , involving the treacherous desertion of friends as well as the abandonment of the most important politreal principles ; and that these very men who pretend to be governed by conscientious motives , became parties in the intrigue of which they reaped the greater portion of the fruits . Thus they labored zealously and incessantly to attain a position , in which their conscience is in perpetual conflict with their oath , and the only alternative is to violate either // one or the other . Yet in the face of these notorious scenes of bargaining and corruption through which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most honourable stations in the government , these devotees to conscientious scruples and the higher law , *t long since gravely and piously assured the senate that they had not the slightest personal agency in the business . They were the innocent victims of the conspiracy . They were not parties in the fraud , and only consented to accept the booty from the most conscientious motives . They became the receivers of stolen goods with a pious determination of converting them to beneficent purposes . Let us anticipate for a moment what may easily happen without the interposition of a miracle . Let us suppose that by a succession of corrupt coalitions , secret bargains , and mutual sacrifices of principle , such as have proved so successful in Ohio , Massachusetts , Connecticut , and NewYork , that piebald party , which is now openly marshalled under abolition banners , should eventually succeed in gaining , if not a majo .. rity in the senate , at least sufficient power to hold the balance between the two conflicting parties , in that body , and thus become the umpire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplation We should behold a body of men , the peculiar guardians of the rights of the states , and the sanctity of the Constitution , denying the existence of one , and the authority of the other ; acting systematically and conscientiously in open defiance of both , and living in the daily violation of an obligation which all honest men hold sacred , under pretence of being governed by a higher law of their own creation , a law which every man makes for himself , and can modify at pleasure to suit his purposes . In such a state of things all must see that the Constitution would at once be annihilated , the bonds of our union severed to atoms , and the ship of state set adrift without rudder compass , or pilot . It is high time for the good sense and patriotism of the people to rally in a combined opposition to this conspiracy to undermine and overthrow that great fabric of freedom erected by the labours , and cemented by the blo'od of'their forefathers . The fundamental principles and uniform practice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence are the leaders , are at war with the Bible the Constitution , and the Laws . Bothby their precepts and their acts they have placed themselves in direct and violent opposition to all these . They are not content with denoun // cing the Constitution , the great conservator of peace and order , as a gross violation of the law of God and the rights of nature , but they oppose the enforcement of its provisions , by inflammatory appeals to the demon of fanaticism ; by their personal interposition ; &amp;*d by instigating others to follow their example . They do not confine themselves to words but resort to action ; they not only speak but act treason . Nay , they have blasphemously attempted to enlist that God , whose precepts they scorn , and whose very existence many of them deny , in their crusade against the Constitution and the laws , and invoked to their aid that religion which they impiously tread under foot at the moment they affect to plead the sanction of its authority . Let us briefly trace the origin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union , which is now one of the principal sources of these frequent violations of law and order that disturb the peace of society and disgrace the country . rVhe first avatar of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia was a prelude to that long succession of public disturbances which are gradually becoming more frequent and dangerous . The address issued by that body was fraught with every principle of disorganization , and struck at the roots of our social and political system . it was a firebrand cast into that fold where the people had garnered their dearest hopes , and centred all their anticipations of temporal prosperity . Hitherto they had thought themselves reposing in safety under the guardianship of a political decalogue embodying every principle best calculated to protect their rights and prescribe their political duties . They spoke and thought of it as an inestimable legacy , bequeathed to them by their wise and virtuous forefathers , * be cherished in their hearts and protected by their arms . They contemplated it with respectful reverence ; they loved it as children love their protectors and benefactors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposited the vital spark which gave life and being to that union to which they traced the source of their peace , prosperity , and happiness . All at once they were told in a solemn address of the American Anti-Slavery Society , given , like all the edicts of fanaticism , under the sanction of divine authority , and like the protest of the three thousand priests of New England , signed at least by some whose names carried weight with themthey were told that this cherished compact was " a gross violation of the law of God and the rights of nature , " and that instead of meriting their respect or obedience , was // totally unworthy either . So far from this-so far from being bound by any obligation as individuals or members of the body politic to adhere to the principles of that compact , they were told almost in express words , that their duty to God and their fellow creatures noonly justified , but made it obligatory on them to abolish it altogether , as a gross violation of the law of God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the winds , they proceeded to make short work with the laws by laying down certain principles which made all others nugatory . They proceeded to declare that the condition of slavery absolved us from all the obligations of mankind ; and of course gave every slave a natural indefeasible right to make war on the rest of his fellow-creatures . Furthermore , they set up a dogma in virtue of which every citizen of the United States , was in duty bound to denounce all laws , and oppose all constitutional provisions which in any way conflicted with this inspired doctrine which comprised all the law and the prophets . In such a cause , neither law nor gospel was permitted to stand in the way . The end sanctified the means , and the violation of oaths , followed by sedition , outrage , and murder , so far from calling down the vengeance of the law entitled them to the honours of martyrdom . The American Anli-Slavery Society , in thus echoing and enforcing the principles of their British preceptors and coadjutors , did not stop here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the fires of red-hot fanaticism , exhorting the people of the United States to perpetual hostility to that constitution which presented an insuperable barrier toab ohtion and amal*amation ; and again in the name of the living God called oi*them to join in the crusade against the great compact of union . This declaration of war against the Constitution was followed up by a regular system of organization to carry it into punctual operation . Societies were instituted ; periodicals and newspapers established ; itinerant lecturers employed to disseminate and enforce these disorganising principles ; and finally the pulpit was enlisted as the most powerful of all auxiliaries in the cause of abolition . Everywhere the people were called upon by sermons , harangues , and inflammatory pubhications , to despise and abhor that Constitution which had hitherto been the object of their veneration ; and now nothing is more common than to see it denounced as a compact founded on the basis of injustice and iniquity , not only from the pulpit , but in those very halls of legislation , occu // pied by men pledged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preachers of the gospel have turned their backs on religion , and taken to beating " the pulpit drum ecclesiastic " to raise recruits for sedition , violence , and bloodshed ; and abolition*nobs have become the chosen instruments in propagating and enforcing the great principles of universal philanthrophy and the higher law . Thus all respect for the great charter of our liberties , and the laws enacted in conformity with its provisions , has been undermined , and both are in a fair way of becoming the footballs of hypocritical politicians and fanatical enthusiasts , standing ready to sacrifice the peace and union of their country to one single stupendous dogma which they have substituted in place of all the duties of citizens , and all the obligations of patriotism . Is it a subject of surprise that , thus appealed to by preachers of the gospel , newspapers and periodicals , itinerant lecturers , members of the House of Representatives , and grave dignified senators , and assailed by every device of hypocrisy and fanaticism , a large portion of the people of the north , should by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort to violent opposition on any occasion of excitement ? Is it not greatly to be feared that this habit of opposition to one class of laws will gradually extend to all others , and that under the auspices of universal philanthropy and the higher law , the constitutionality or expediency of all law , will be finally settled , not by a decision of the Supreme Court , or a verdict of the grand inquest of the States , but by mobs of runaway negroes , and run-mad fanatics , marshalled under the banners of those eminent constitutional oracles , Messrs , Garrison , Parker , Philips , Sumner Chase , Wade , and Giddings , not forgetting those inscrutable indefinable hybrids Abby Folsom , Lucy Stone , and the restof the . strong-minded women . It is with most unfeigned reluctance we approach another portion of our subject , . and refer to another species of mobs originating from a different source , but if possible still more dangerous to the peace of society and the supremacy of the laws . We speak of sectarian mobs in which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might say , religious antipathies , or motives of worldly rivalry , takes upon itself to nullify that great principle of freedom of conscience which guarantees to each and all sects , equally , its unlimited exercise , so long as it does not lead to gross violations of the principles of morality or the duties of citizens . // We would willingly avoid this topic . But the period has come when the truth should be told without favour and without fear . The peace of the country , the rights of individuals , and the true interests of the Christian church demand the arraignment of those p*achers of the gospel , the ambassadors of the Prince of peace , who are incessantly occupied in piling up the ingredients of . discord and hatred , and stimulating their followers to violations of the peace of society and the rights of conscience , even from that sacred desk where nothing should be heard but the enunciation of the divine doctrine of peace on earth and good will to all mankind . Instead of this , we grieve to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their pens to polemical discussions proverbial for their violence and the absence of all gentlemanly courtesy ; to topics only calculated to irritate and inflame those sectarian antipathies , which in past ages have been such fruitful sources of persecution and massacre . In this way they convert the Trumpet of Zion into an instrument , not for calling Christians to come together and nestle in the fold of the Great shepherd , but for marshalling them under hostile banners , and instilling into their hearts that spirit of polemical rancour which causes men to look upon each other as creatures , if not of a different species , at least as aliens , destitute of all claim to social brotherhood here , and all hope of salvation hereafter . Thus , that benign principle of universal toleration implanted in our political system and intended to ensure the rights of conscience to all equally , is practically nullified ; and it is thus that persecution , though forbidden by the laws , operates through the medium of popular , feeling , and illegal assemblages of the peoples instigated to violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom make politics an accessory to religion , the other religion a tool of politics . Stern relentless bigotry is now but too often.substituted for a pious zeal in the propagation of the gospel ; and the most opproved mode of converting sinners , is to demolish their churches , interfere with their religious rites , and provoke them to violence by insult or opposition . In short , it would seem impossible to be a sincere Christian without violating some of the most impressive and important precepts of Christianity . At the present moment the emigrant Irish catholics appear to be the peculiar objects of sectarian antipathy , and alLappearances seem to indicate that their destiny in the old world is about to follow them in the new . Instead // of finding political and religions equality and freedom in the land where they have sought refuge , they have been singled out as the peculiar objects of civil and religious persecution . The blinking spirit of know-nothingism has been invoked against them in our great nortl*rn and western cities , and it has been shown in various instances that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set aside the general laws of the land , which give equal civil and religic'us rights to adopted , as well as native citizens , by secret combinations or open violence in order to render them practically nugatory . Party spirit and sectarian zeal , have apparently combined against one of the most numerous as well as useful of all classes of emigrants , and a perpetual war of races thus provoked , which , if it once becomes chronic by transmission to succeeding generations , will , in the end , create two antagonist factions , and place the Irish and their posterity , in the same hostile position towards the so-called native Americans , they have , from the same causes , for ages occupied in relation to their English oppressors . They will become a marked and persecuted race , as they have been for many generations past in their own country ; they will remain aliens among us fretting with perpetual discontent ; and instead of amalgamating as one race and one people united together by the indissoluble tie of liberty and equality , growing with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be only increasing elements of *iational weakness , disaffection , and dissension . It seems to us that nothing can keep this vast confederation together in peace and harmony but this indissoluble bond of liberty and equality which makes no distinction between native and adopted citizens either in civil or religious rights ; and in our opinion there never was a more mischievous or wicked plot devised for breaking it into inveterate , irreconcilable factions , always and forever arrayed against each other , than that of thus establishing distinctions irritating to the feelings , as well as incompatible with the equal rights of millions of men invited hither with the assurance that they should share equally in our inheritance . Have we not already enough of the elements of disunion among us ? If it is wished to destroy all identity of feelings or purposes in the people of the United States ; to distract the union by the infusion of a farrago of discords ; and place the different races of man , of which it is composed in a state of permanent hostility to each other , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , than this dark conspiracy , of Abolitionism , Know-nothingism , and 2 // Whiggery ; which la*t , is in fact , the basis and cement of the entire fabric , as well as the grand laboratory in which all these combustible materials of mobs and tumultuous assemblages of the city populace are fabricated . Without the alliance and support o* this party which seems daily undergoing a process of degradation , these various shreds and patches of faction , would be ' comparatively harmless . But it would seem that the more it becomes conscious of its weakness , the lower it stoops to obtain auxiliaries , It rakes in the puddles of standing pools and filthy gutters ; it gropes its way into caves and dungeons where the secret agents of know nothingism practice their incantations , to invoke them to its aid . Nothing is too low  --  and alas ! nothing too high for their unholy aspirations . They ascend from the lowest depths of abolition to the sacred precints of the pulpit . and while courting an alliance with those who scoff at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its doctrines , in the complicated net of these discord** ant materials of faction , fanaticism and infidelity . Unhappily for the great interests , both of liberty and religion , they have succeeded to a lamentable extent in converting a portion of the ministersof the gospel of peace into little better than instruments of contention , violence , and bloodshed . Let us not be accused of being disaffected to the church , when , in obedience to what we believe to be our highest duty at this moment , we speak freely , and without disguise , of some at least , of those who have degraded religion into a brawling , political partisan . We charge them , that instead of leading their flocks to the peaceful pastures , they are inciting them to mingle in contests of violence and bloodshed ; that instead of labouriug to soothe and mitigate these sectarian antipathies which everywhere spring up like baleful weeds in the fold of the shepherd , many , too many of them are employed not in preaching peace and good will to all men , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inculcating those sublime principles of faith and morality embodied in that great decalogue declared by the Saviour of mankind to contain all the law and the prophets , much of their time and labour is devoted to the establishment of obscure metaphysical dogmas ; to abortive attempts at elucidating points beyond the comprehension of the wise as well as the ignorant , and whichever way they may be interpreted can have no influence on human conduct . These are made the test of our piety , the sole standard of our faith ; and every diversity in their interpretation used as a pretext for // denouncing our fellow creatures in this world , and excluding them from all the blessings of that to come . Surely this is not the way to preach the g*pel of peace , or bring about the anticipated union of a universal Christian church . Shall it be said with truth that the ancient worshippers of many gods lived together in peace , and that persecution is the offspring of that religion which recognizes but one God and one Saviour ? But wc will pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to apologize for thus mingling religion and politictogether . We can only urge in excuse , that the course purs sued by the abolitionists , and most especially the three thousand protesting clergy of New England , ' has brought about this incestuous union , and rendered it almost impossible to separate what ought never to have been joined . Religion is a pure white dove descending like flakes of snow from the skies , and can not touch anything earthly without being defiled . When prostituted to party purposes , or degraded at the footstool of ambition and avarice , it becomes the most dangerous of all hypocrites , and is only a sanctified impostor preying on the credulity of mankind . In its purity it is divine , in its corruption little else than a demon . The greatest of all the benefactions of the Creator in its unpolluted virgin excellence , it may be , and has too often been made , an instrument of fraud , oppression , and cruelty . Like every other blessing it may be perverted to a curse when it becomes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wise framers of the Constitution did all they could to prevent religion from being defiled by an association with politics . They separated it from the government , and as far as possible , placed an impassable barrier between church and state , believing , as they did that a union of the two was equally fatal to the purity of one and the freedom of the other . But if we are not greatly mistaken , there is a plan in embryo , but not yet openly avowed , to bring about something very like a sort of left handed union , not however without benefit of clergy , but with an omission of certain legal forms hitherto deemed essential in all orthodox countries . Ever since the advent of abolition , religion and politics are bone of one bone , and flesh of one flesh . Not a few of the preachers of the gospel have become preachers of sedition , and are employing all their inflated eloquence in propagating political heresies under the cloak of religious orthodoxy . Their favorite text is disunion , and their sermons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2* // violations of the law and breaches of the public peace . Their most sacred law is mob-law , and if we may judge from those of their writings which have *ome under our observation , many , too many . of these preac*ers of the gospel have become preachers of sedition and anarchy , exerting all the influence of their talents and station in propagating sectional antipathies , disseminating sectarian prejudices , and stimulating weak misguided enthusiasts to the most dangerous excesses . Far be it from us to commit the injustice of involving the entire body of ministers of the gospel , or even a majority of them , in these censures . We believe , nay , we know , that generally speaking , they are better employed ; and have only most earnestly and respectfully to conjure them , one and all , to use their high and holy efforts in arresting this incestuous union of religion and politics . If it should be ever consummated , they may rest assured that so far from conducing to the interests of the Christiaia church or the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the enemies of both , and go far to justify the oft repeated slander that the preachers of the gospel have two gods , one above , theother below , and that the latter has by far the greater number of worshippers among them . Impressions of this kind sink deeper than all the sarcasms or arguments of the keenest assailants of the Christian faith . Mankind are prone to judge of the tree by its fruits , and there is no such potent enemy to the church as its own abuses and corruptions . It is difficult to believe that the fountain can be pure when nothing but the waters of bitterness flow from its bosom , or to realize what is undoubtedly true , that the greatest blessing ever bestowed on man by his Maker , may be perverted to the greatest of curses , by becoming the football of human interests and passions . The examples of Christian ministers are far more efficacious than their precepts . They are most emphatically the pillars of the church , and if the holy temple should ever fall , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Sampson , only to perish in its ruins . If they are really ambassadors of the Prince of peace , they come on a mission of peace , and should devote themselves to that divine vocation , instead of sowing dragons ' teeth to spring up armed men in battle array against each other , only because they happen to differ on some incomprehensible mystery , which has not the slightest connexion with their duty to God or each other . The first victim to religious bigotry was // the author of our faith . Let them bene fit by his example , and never forget that in the utmost extremity of his agonies of mind and body , when the punishment of the trangressions of Adam and all his posterity , were concentrated on him , and when the earth and the heavens sympathised in his sufferings , he pardoned his persecuto* , and cried out " Lord , Lord , forgive them for they know not what they do ! " Let the ministers of His gospel ever bear this in mind . Let them remember that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of patience and forbearance in dealing with the alleged errors of their fellow creatures . All can not think alike , but all may tolerate a difference of opinion on mysteries that can never be realized here , and can only be known hereafter . This midnight foray of the Know-Nothings against a numerous class of adopted citizens , which must inevitably awaken and exasperate feelings that can only lead to sectarian mobs , and disturbances of the public peace , is unquestionably based on a union of religious bigotry and political interests . It is apparently directed against the Irish , because a great portion of them are Catholics and Democrats . having tasted the bitter cup of religious intolerance and political oppression , in the land of their birth , they naturally incline to that party in the land of their adoption , which is most favorable to civil rights and the freedom of conscience ; and consequently a great portion of them array themselves on the side of democracy . Hence , though occasionally on the eve of a contested election , the Whig leaders condescend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of that party has always been opposed to that system of naturalization laws under which emigrants are admitted to the enjoyment of the rights of citizens . The Alien and Sedition laws of the administration of the elder Adams , were levelled exclusively at the Irish , who at that time constituted a great majority of emigrants , and the Whig party will never forgive nor ever forget that these demonstrations of hostility were among the main causes of its overthrow . However that party may for temporary purposes affect a hollow sympathy in behalf of Irish or any other class of emigrants , its uniform policy has been that of discouragement and opposition ; nor can it be doubted that if it ever stands in a position to dare to undertake the experiment , an attempt will be made to revive the old Alien and Sedition Laws , against adopted citizens . But despairing of being able to attain their purpose under the direct sanction of legislation , they are now resorting to dark and secret combinations to // render those laws nugatory which they can not abrogate directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws an instrument in undermining the rights of emigrant citizens , they exact from every petty municipal officer , a pledge for their violation , and thus the general law is in effect nullified by the mere*ill of a man who is himself only a servant of the laws . In this way some of the most important rights of the naturalized citizen , conceded by the laws , are filched from him by secret combinations , whose great object is to render them all equally nugatory in practice . This dark and dangerous conspiracy , whose purpose so far as developed , is to propagate and perpetuate a war of religion and races in a country whose prosperity and peace so imperatively require that these distinctions should be obliterated and our whole people become homogeneous at least in the second generation-this revival of the old policy of Whiggery under a new name , is as before stated , the joint product of religious bigotry and political ambition . Either of these powerful influences is sufficient to engender the most violent prejudices and antipathies among men ; but when combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is not to be wondered at , that we almost every day see the consequences exemplified in tumultuous assemblages of the people of our towns and cities violating the laws , interrupting the ordinances of religion , insulting its professors , overawing the civil authorities , and calling for the dangerous interposition of military power to arrest their excesses . We do not profess to be the advocates or defenders of the Irish catholics , or any other class of emigrants , and only stand forth in vindication of the general rights of all , equally , as conceded by our naturalization laws , founded in a policy as old as the Declaration of Independence , which among other charges of oppression and misgovernment brought against the King of England , has the following : " He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these states ; for that purpo*e obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners ; refusing to pass others to encourage their emigration hither ; and raising the conditions of new appropriation of lands . " But having been , from the first establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equal rights with native bern citizens on certain conditions , we hold it to be a gross violation of public faith , as well as national hospitality , to attempt thus to degrade any portion below the level // of equality . The pledge has been repeatedly given by the constituted authorities of the country and must be held inviolable , or millions of men , now deeply attached to our native soil and our free institutions , will once more become aliens and enemies , cherishi* in their secret hearts those festering discontents which will for ever prevent their becoming one and the same people . As respects the Irish emigrant catholics against whom the secret shafts of the " know nothings " appear to be principally aimed , we know something of them . We have lived with them for years , under the same roof , and no small portion of our domestic happiness has been derived from their good offices and fidelity . They are neither infidels nor socialists ; and that bigotry with which they are charged is without doubt greatly owing to a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union of church and state . Persecution make bigots , and bigots make persecution . Neither one or the other is peculiar to any sect , if we can place any reliance in history . Toleration has been always advocated exclusively by the weaker party . The Irish are a people of strongly marked character . They are easily provoked , bat neither cruel or revengeful except in the first paroxysms of anger . They are easily offended , but not difficult to conciliate ; aid if tenacious in remembering injuries , they are as equally apt in dwelling on the recollection of benefits . If we may judge from our own experience they are always ready to repay kindness with gratitude . A large portion of those who come hither are marked by one great and noble characteristic which in itself alone is sufficient to redeem all the faults ever laid to their charge . We speak of what we know from our own personal observation is to save money to transmit to their relatives , either to relieve their necessities , or enable them to come and share in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriated in small amounts to this noble purpose eannot be estimated with any certainty , but we are assured by commercial men , through whose hands a portion of these remittances pass , that many hundreds of thousands of dollars are thus transmitted every year . Thus parents and children , sisters and mothers , dispersed by poverty , hardship , and oppression , are once more brought together in a free and plenteous land , where-until the advent of know nothingism-they might reasonably hope to enjoy the blessings of civil and religious liberty . // Even if the charge of ignorance , turbulence , and brutality , so often urged against them by those who have done their best to make them so , were true , in its utmost extent , we might ask where is there , where was there ever a nation on whom a long series of oppression *d misgovernment failed in produc** ing similar results ? For centuries , Ireland has been crushed under the iron heel of England , and in carrying out the long tedious process , she has at length broken her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exiles . She has succeeded not only in destroying the people as a nation , but at the same time employed a prejudiced and corrupt press in ruining their character , and representing them as devoid of the attributes of humanity , in order to justify her in treating them like brutes . Where , we may ask , is there a people , that under such circumstances , could possibly bear up for centuries against a process , so calculated to crush the very stamina of a high spirited race ? Yet , under every disadvantage , in spite of every obstacle , the Irish still retain and cherish many of the highest characteristics of a noble people . Though gasping in the throes of a long and desperate struggle with a giant oppressor , Ireland has continued to exhibit the highest examples of eminence in arms , in science , arts , and literature . Her soldiers have tiiumphed in the field , her orators have swayed in the senate , her poets occupy the high places of Parnassus ; in every department of literature she has asserted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have triumphed every where . Even among the lowest , most ignorant of the people , the intellectual lamp is not extinguished . The spirit , the wit , and natural intelligence of the poor Irishman still survives , and we every day see examples to prove that his genius only requires to be quickened in the sunwy ray of liberty , to take its flight to regions as high as it ever reached before . The tree which bore such fruits is now being transplanted to the United States . May it take deep root and floarish for many ages to come in the genial soil of their new Eden in the west , and banished Ireland be richly compensated in the new world for the wrongs inflicted on her in the old . Let it never be said that America , the predestined fold of th*'persecutcd and oppressed , the house of refuge for the disinherited children of the world , has closed her doors and shut her heart against the exiled wanderers she herself invited hither , and broken the pledge of a welcome , a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ..
