CONGRESSIONAL SUMMARY . THE Senate having under consideration the resolutions of Mr. BELL , of Tennessee , and the motion of Mr. FOOTE to refer them to a select committee of thirteen , Mr. BALDWIN spoke as follows : He had listened to the discussions in the Senate on these subjects with deep interest . He had seen in their tone much to admire , much to reg ret , and it had been his endeavor to preserve his own mind from nny undue excitement or bias , so as to be governed alone by the spirit of the Constitution in any legislative act he might be called upon to take a part . That sacred instrument dealt in no sectional language . The voices of the whole American people spoke there harmoniously . It was adopted , in a spirit of liberality to conflicting interests and sentiments ; tolerating , no doubt , some institutions then thought temporary , and some compromises now regretted . But they are there ; and he could speak with authority , in the name of the people of his own State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the spirit of these compromises . I Such , Sir , said Mr. BALDWIN , are the instructions of the State of Connecticut , passed by a nearly unanimous vote of both Houses of the Legislature . But they have also instructed their Senators and requested their representatives in Congress , to oppose in all constitutional ways , every measure of compromise which shall yield any portion of free territory to the encroachments of slavery , or by which the people of the United States shall be made responsible for its continuance . He did not believe in the principle of instructions , but these instructions fully concorded with his own judgment , and he should rea*lily and gladly conform to them . The resolutions now before the Senate , and the proposition to refer them to a committee of compromise , did not meet with his approba .. tion . The question of California , in his opinion , should be connected with no other question whatever . The people of the State are here claiming a right ; a right guarantied by treaty . The question of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , biased by no motives but that of justice . These propositions also assumed an antagonism in the interests of the North and the South , which was unwarranted by fact , unsound in principle , and unconstitutional if carried into legislation . The Constitution knew no North or South or East or West ; it proceeded from the people of the United States , and it was to their collective interests that as legislators they were called upon to attend . This body should acknowledge no antagonism , no divided interests ; they should know of only one constituency , and that was the whole of their common country . He did not sustain the admission of California from any supposed advantage to the people of his own portion of the country . He saw no such advantage . He saw no way in which the introduction of her Senators and Representatives in Congress . could conduce more to the promotion of the interests of his constituents than to the interests of any other section . It was on the score of justice to the people of California that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these territories , we pledged ourselves to protect and maintain the inha*bitants in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property , and the full exercise of their civil rights . This pledge we have failed to keep . it is true , the old Mexican and departmental laws continued in force , but these laws were notoriously insufficient in the altered circumstances of the country , to shield them from disorganization and private wrong . " Had California continued as it was , composed of a few sparse settlements , the laws in force at the time of the cession would have been ample for their protection . Their inter* ests were small ; their transactions with each other were comparatively few ; their temptations to crime were slight ; but under our authority , by our invitation , a vast influx of population from all parts of the world have migrated to California . Ships from Europe and Asia and Western America , as well as from our own coast have entered their magnificent harbors , richly laden with the products of every climate . Mines of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurers of every description , and given a new impulse to labor in all the departments of industry . Towns and cities have arisen among them , as by magic ; thousands of people are clustered together from different nations , of di , similar habits , differing in their usages , and the systems ? * law to which they had been accustomed in the places from which they migrated-differing not merely from those of the Mexican inhabitants but of each other . We all know that , in a remote country like that thus newly settled by those who are strangers to each other , who come with habits thus dissimilar , the ordinary restraints of society , which stand in the place of law in older countries , have but a feeble hold upon the population . What , then , was the necessary result 3 That liberty and property were in a great measure unprotected . Crimes were committed , and there were no adequate tribunals to try and punish the offender . Contracts were made and broken , and there were none to administer justice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for all this I The old Mexican laws , the old departmental officers , were entirely inadeqnate to the purposes for which Government was now needed . What , then , should be done 3 They appealed to Congress . Congress representing the supreme power of this Government , to whose dominion they had been transferred by Mexico , refused to interfere-refused to aid them with a system of laws adequate to the circumstances in which they were placed . Even the writ of habeas corpus and the right of trial by jury were vainly attempted in this body , at the last session , to be conferred upon this distant people . Mexico had relinquished her dominion to a power that re*ised to exercise it efficiently for their protection . The greater portion of the people were our own citizens , our owa kindred , our sons . " Driven thus by necessity , they have framed laws and a Constitution for themselves , and it is not for us to cavil at any irregularities in their formation , irregularities forced upon them by ourselves , but to inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the time has come for her admission as a State . If we can not deny that these requisites are fulfilled , what right have we to allow sectional feelings and questions to be mixed up with and delay her admissi*n 3 These resolutions , the Senator continued , propose that Congress shall renew the assent given by the joint resolution of 1845 , for the formation of three or four new slave States out of the present territory of Texas , and assert that the faith of the Government is already pledged for their admission . If this be so , no act of ours can strengthen or impair that obligation . Whether it be so or not , it surely is a question which-this Congress is not competent to solve . Assuming it to be the true construction of the Constitution , as in his judgment it was , that foreign territories can be annexed by the treaty-making power alone , it would follow that the joint resolution for the annexation of Texas was simply void . If so , it was the acquiescence of the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the joint resolution , that placed her on the footing of the other States of the Union . Texas of course knew , when negotiating for admission , the rights she should thereby acquire , and the obligations she should come under . She had perfect , knowledge of the Constitution of the United States . He might , therefore , when this question comes practically before Congress , feel unwilling to admit the binding force of this pledge . He was not now called upon to decide , but he protested against its being sent to a committee of compromise along with other subjects which he might feel bound to sustain , and thus give rise to an imputation of bad faith . Moreover , this is a question which no State but Texas has a right to raise ; and , hitherto , she has manifested no desire to take it into consideration . He thought that Congress should address itself to those duties of legislation which called for action , avoiding discussion productive only of agitation . With regard to the questions connected with this subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treating them ; is to act upon them as they arise . The question of the extension of slavery over free territory admitted no compromise . It involves a deep-seated principle . Slavery was not a natural law . It could exist only by positive enactment , and the majority of the people of the United States , he was satisfied , were averse to assuming the responsibility of any legislation that might lead to its extension . But it is said that slavery being purely a domestic institutiomi of the States , the Government of the United States has no concern with it . This he admitted so far as slavery in the States was conceriied . But he denied that Congress bad no right to legislate on this subject in the territories . Congress must act in the government of the territories precisely as a State Legislature acts within its own limits . The Government and the Territories belonged to the people of the United States , and not to the several States . The treaty-making power negotiates for the nation-not as the agent of the States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation are the people , not the States . With regard to the subject of fugitives from the Southern States , Mr. BALDWIN contended that the salety of the class of colored citizens of the Northern States , demanded that ques 1850. 647 // tions of the kind should be heard and decided by the permanent judicial tribunals of the Government , that the colored freemen of the North are entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several States to which they have occasion to go . He thought that all that was needed upon the subject of fugitive slaves , was to amend the existing act of Congress , so as to confine the exercise'of the powers conferred to the judges of courts of the United States , and to secure to those who allege themselves to be free , the advantage of an impartial jury to aid the courts in the ascertainment of facts . Respecting the other alleged grievances , the burden of the complaint seems to be the petition for the abolition of the slave-trade and slavery in the District of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this any interference with the rights of any State ! Js it any real grievance , if these petitioners confine their request to the action of Congress , where Congress has the entire and exclusive power of legislation * Senators may not he willing to grant these petitions , but have they any right to say that they or their constituents are aggrieved by their presentment l " In conclusion , " said Mr. BALDWIN , " I will only say  --  and I say it with great deference to the opinions of others-that there is , in my opinion , but one course to be pursued to calm the agitations that now surround us , and prevent their recurrence . It is to place ourselves firmly on the platform of the Constitution , adhering faithfully to its compromises , and administering , in the spirit which animated our fathers , and in the light of their admor*tions and example , the powers confided to us *by the people . No compromises of principle are required for our security . No sectional concessions should be asked , or expectations encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a course , I fear no danger to the Union . Its foundations are too deeply laid in the interests and affections of the people , and in their cherished recollections of the past , to be easily disturbed . It is emphatically their government ; and its powers , though wisely and carefully limited , are amply sufficient , if beneficently directed , o lead us to a higher degree of national glory and happiness than has fallen to the lot of any other people . " Apml 17 . The same subject being before the Senate , and the pending question thereon being Mr. BEXTON 'S instructions to the Committee , to the effect that Congress has no power over slavery in the States , nor the slave-trade between the States , and that Congress ought not to abolish Slavery in the District of Columbia , nor in the forts , arsenals , and navy-yards of the United States , Mr. CLAY moved to amei*d this proposition so that it should read , " Provided , that the Senate does not deem it necessary to express in advance any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific , for the guidance of the Committee . " Mr. BENTON said , in reply , that the proposition to which this amendment was offered , was in fact*only an amendment to his original proposition , and which he had accepted in a spirit of compromise , and at the suggestion of Mr. CLAY . As the Senator from kentucky now wished to recede from it , he would withdraw it altogether . The proposition being thus withdrawn , Mr. CLAY 'S amendment fell with it . Mr. BENTON then moved his original proposition , providing that the Committee shall not take into consideration the question of slavery ' in the States , the internal slave-trade , slavery in the District of Columbia , and in the forts , arsenals , and navy-yards of the United States . Mr. CLAY again moved his former amendment , namely , that the Senate does not deem it necessary to express in advance any opinion , or to give any instructions , either general or specific , for the guidance of this Committee . Mr. BENTON objected that this was not an amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequently unparliamentary . He regretted the obstacles thrown in the way of the admission of California . In fact , he saw nothing but long delay and imminent danger to that bill , in proceeding any farther with this motion to refer to a committee . We have no need of this committee , he said . We have the bill already , brief and explicit . He therefore moved , before the pending amendment is gone into , to lay the subject of raising a committee on the table , for the purpose of taking up the bill for the admission of the State of California . Mr. CLAY , in reply . said , that no one wished for the speedy admission of California more than himself , and with due deference to the Senator from Missouri , he suggested that the chief obstacle was the course taken by Mr. BENTON . Let this opposition to the appointment of a committee cease ; let the committee be raised , and then , if necessary , let the bill for the admission of California he reported and acted upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already intimated , he should propose as an amendment to the bill , provisions to give territorial governments to the two new Territories without the Wilmot Proviso . He thought the bill faulty . The brevity that the Senator from Missouri so recommended , would result in losing for the United States , the public doman of California . 648 June , // The question being taken on Mr. BENTON 'S motion to lay on the table , it was negatived by yeas 24 , nays 28 , as follows : YEAS-Baldwin , Benton , Bradbury , Chase , Clarke , Corwin , Davis of Mass , Dayton , Dodge of Iowa , Dodge of Wis Douglass , Felch , Green , Hale , Hamlin , Jones , Miller , Norris , Phelps , Seward , Shields , Smith , Walker , Webster-24 .

Mr. BENTON , then commented on Mr. CLAY 'S amendment . It asked the Senate , he said , to cut itself off from all its parlimentary rights of offering amendments to bills and resolutions while going through that body . The attempt is impotent . We have a right to offer instructions after instructions , and if the Senate will not adopt them , its only way is to reject them when presented ; to vote them down . This right of offerino instructions he meant to exercise to its fuYl extent . In reply , Mr. CLAY said , that there was nothing extraordinary in giving a subject to a committee without instructions . It happened every day ; two or three times a day . When a joint committee was appointed in the instance of the Missouri compromise , no instructions were given ; they were left free as air , to devise the best mode of settling that unhappy question . Senators had a right beyond doubt , to instruct if they wished , or to leave the committee without restraint . This resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , *iat wished to check the free exercise of their rights by the Senate * Why those who by their amendments , against the emphatic expressions of opinion by the majority of that body , would produce embarrassment anti delay . I have framed this resolution deliberately , said Mr. CLAY , and for the express purpose of getting rid of the unnecessary instructions which the Senator from Missouri has proposed , and to dispose of any other instructions which his ingenuity , and no man possesses a greater amount of it than he does , might suggest to be brought before this body . Let my amendment be adopted , and let the Senator offer his other instructions from one to ninety-nine , if he pleases , and we shtll see if the question of order will not silence them all . Mr. WEBSTER cared little hoW this matter of a committee should be decided . He felt no interest in it , for he thought no great benefit would result from it . But the motion of the Senator from Kentucky he considered irregular . It is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the proposition under consideration may be amended . " If this were a bill , could it contain a proposition that it should not be subject to amendment * or could it be moved in amendment to it , that this bill should be carried through the Senate without any proposition to amend * Mr. CLAY rejoined that here was a proposition to refer certain subjects to a committee . The Senator from Missouri proposed certain amendments to that proposition . They had a right to vote these amendments down one by one . His own proposition went little farther than that . At the suggestion of Mr. MANGTJM , Mr. CLAY modified his amendment by inserting after the word " necess4ry , " the words " and therefore declines . " The question being then taken , the amendment was adopted.Yeas 25 , nays 22 , as follows YEAs-Atchison , Badger , Borland , Butler , Cass , Clay , Clemens , Davis ( Miss , ) Dickinson , Dodge ( Iowa ) , Douglass , Downs , Foote , Hunter , Jones , King , Mangum , Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Spruance , Sturgeon , Turney , Underwood , Yulee .

The question was then taken seriatim , up- - on the thirteen propositions of Mr. BENTON , all of which were rejected . It was then taken upon a proposition by Mr. HAMLIN* excepting the admission of California from the reference . This also was rejected . Mr. WALKER moved to except from reference to the Committee , the subject of the arrest of fugitive slaves . This proposition was rejected . The final question was then taken upon the motion to refer the resolution of Messrs CLAY 1850. 649 // and BELL to a select committee of thirteen , and adopted .

The following day the Senate proceeded to ballot for the Chairman of the Select Committee upon the Compromise resolutions of Mr. BELL and Mr. CLAY . On the first ballot Mr. CLAY had 28 votes , BELL 1 , BENTON I , MANGUM 1 , blank 4 . So Mr. CLAY was declared elected . lVlessrs Cass , Dickinson , Bright , Webster , Phelps , Cooper , King , Mason , Downs , Mangum , Bell , and Berrien were , on the next ballot elected , the remaining members of the Committee without opposition . From this Committee , May 8 , Mr. CLAY presented the following report . From the thorough discussion which these subjects have received in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary to give the motives and views which have determined their conclusions on these questions.They would restrict themselves to a few general observations and reflections . Their object in this report was to adjust all the differences arising from our late territorial acquisitions , in connection with the institution of slavery . They wished to leave nothing behind to rankle in the public mind . The.first subject that presented itself to their attention was the Texas controversy . The resolution of Congress annexing Texas to the United States , Provides that additional States , not exceeding four in number , may , by consent of Texas , be formed out of her territory , and that such of these States as shall lie south of 36* 30 ' north latitude , commonly known as the Missouri compromise line , shall be admitted , with or without slavery , as they shall severally choose . The Committee are unanimously of opinion that the compact with Texas contained in this resolution is clear and absolute . It has been urged that it was unconstitutional . But it was also declared at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that province was unconstitutional , and who would now think of opposing the admission of the new States constantly forming within its ancient limits * In grave national transactions , differences may exist in their earlier stages ; but when once consummated , prudence and safety demand acquiescence in the decision . The Committee consequently think that the terms of annexation should be complied with . They do not , however , consider that the formation of these new States should originate with Congress . In conformity with usage , the initiative should be taken , with the consent of Texas , by the people of her territory . When they present themselves for admission , and have decided upon the the purely municipal question of slavery within their own limits , Congress is bound to accept that decision . With regard to the question of the admission of California , a majority of the Committee are of opinion that all irregularities in her application should be overlooked , in consideration of the omission of Congress to provide a proper territorial Government , and the consequent necessity of framing one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States in respect to the admission of a new State , is that its Constitution should be republican in form . That of California is such . Neither can there be objection on the score of population , which is even greater than has heretofore been deemed sufficient for the admission of new States . With respect to her boundaries , the Committee regret the want of accurate geographical knowledge ; but extensive as her limits are , they appear to embrace no very disproportionate quantity of land adapted for cultivation . It is known that they contain extensive ranges of mountains , deserts of sand , and much unproductive soil . The front assigned on the Pacific might have been more limited , but it is not certain that to States formed by thus curtailing her sea-board , a sufficient extent of accessible interior could have been given . Should the necessity arise , from the increase of her population and a more thorough exploration of her territory , to form a new State out of California , they believe from past experience that such a measure would meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , recommend to the Senate the passage of the bill reported by the Committee on Territories for the admission of California , as a State , into the Union . They would advise also the adoption of the amendment to the bill , securing to . the United States the public domain , and other public property , in California . Whilst a majority of the Committee believe it tobe necessary and proper , under actual circumnstances , to admit California , they think it quite as necessary and proper to establish governments for the residue of the territory derived from Mexico , and to bring it within the pale of the federal authority . The remoteness of that territory from the seat of the genera* Government ; the dispersed state of its population ; the variety of races-pure and mixed-of which it consists ; the ignorance of some of the races of our laws , language , and habits ; their exposure to the 650 June , // inroads and wars of savage tribes ; and the solemn stipulations of the treaty by which we acquired dominion over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending to them protection , and of providing for them government and laws suited to their condition . Congress xviii fail in the performance of a high duty , if it does not give , or attempt to give , to them the benefit of such protection , government , and laws . They are not now , and , for a long time to come , may not be , prepared for State government . The territorial form , for the present , is best suited to their condition . A bill has been reported by the Committee on Territories , dividing all the territory acquired from Mexico , not comprehended within the limits of California , into two territories , under the names of New Mexico and Utah , and proposing for each a territorial government . The Committee recommend to the Senate the establishment of those territorial goverments ; and , in order more certainly to secure that desirable object , they also recommend that the bill for their establishment be incorporated in the bill for the admission of California , and that , united together , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called the incongruity of the combination of these two measures in the same hill . A majority of this Committee see nothing incongruous in this combination , but are axvare of many considerations that mark it with a peculiar propriety . The object of these measures is , respectively , the establishment of a government for the new State , and the new Territories . Originally provinces of one mother country , they were ceded to the United States by the same treaty . The same article in that treaty guaranteed them *rotection and good government . Conternunous in some of their boundaries , alike in their physical condition , they present , with the ei4ception of the rapid increase of population California , a common attitude the e4 of the Union . But it is objected , this combination forces members to the alternative of voting for what they disapprove , or of rejecting a measure of which they nl ) prove . To this it may be answered , that there are also many who reject California alone but would willingly admit her in conjunc on with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opposition to the combination lies in the favor or disfavor in which each measure is held , and not in any want of affinity between them . In these conflicting opinions and interests , a majority of the Committee think that the true spirit of legislation demands mutual concession . Few laws are ever passed in which there is not somcthing given up for the sake of the greater good that is gained . Especially in a confederacy like ours should this spi nt prevail . It wa. * founded on mutual concession , and by *nutua1 concession alone can it be preserved . The territorial bill , in itself , is marked by this species of compensation . It omits the Wilmot Proviso , that fruitfuL source of agitation ; while , on the other hand , it makes no provision for the introduction of slavery . This Proviso , so productive of discord , experience has shown to be practically unnecessary for the accomplishment of its professed objects . California , in which the introduction of slavery was most feared , has , by the unanimous action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is every reason to believe that Utah and New Mexico , on their admission as States , will follow the example . Neither is there any aggrievement to California in thus coupling the question of her admission with other subjects , for her best dignity should be found in her power to restore tranquillity to the great family of her sister States . The next subject on which the Committee report is that of the Northern and Western boundary of Texas . A majority of the Committee recommend that the boundary of Texas be recognized to the Rio Grande , and up that river to the point commonly called El Paso , and running thence up that river twenty miles , measured thereon by a straight line , and thence eastwardly , to a point where the hundredth degree of west longitude crosses Red River ; being the southward angle in the line designated between the United States and Mexico , and the same angle in the line of the territory set apart for the Indians by the United States . In addition to this concession by the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whatever claims she may have to any part of New Mexico , the pecuniary equivalent of - millions of dollars , to be paid in a stock to be created , bearing five per cent interest annually , payable half yearly , at the treasury of the United States , and the principal reimbursable at the end of fourteen years . It is estimated that the territory to which Texas will thus relinquish her claims , and which embraces that part of New Mexico lying east of the Rio Grande , includes a little less than 124,933 square miles , and about 79,957,120 acres of land . From the sale of this land the United States may be reimbursed a portion , if not the whole of the amount thus advanced to Texas . A majority of the Committee recommend that the proposals to Texas be incorporated in the bill embracing the admission of California , as a State , and the establishment of territorial governments for Utah and New Mexico . By the union of these three measures , they hope that every question of difficulty arising from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEW SERIES . 42 1850. 651 // from Mexico xviii be placed in a train of satisfactory adjustment . The Committee next report on the subject of fugitives from labor . The Constitution explicitly declares that no person , held to service in one State , under the laws thereof , shall , by escaping into another , be discharged , in consequence of any law , or regulation , therein , from such service , but s/tall be delivered up on the claim of the party to whom such service is due . This clause , so plain and obligatory , is addressed alike to the States composing the Union , and to the General Government . Its enforcement is the duty of both . At present , it is notorious that the attempt to recapture a slave is attended by great personal hazard . Perilous collisions constantly ensue . The law of 1793 has been found wholly ineffectual in prevention of this state of things , and the Committee recommend more stringent enactments . The proceedings for the recovery of the fugitive should be summary . Trial by jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , were this granted , it would draw after it its usual consequences of delay and increased expense , and , under the name of a popular and cherished institution , there would be a complete mockery of justice , so far as the owner of the slave is concerned . A trial by jury , however , would be less objectionable in the State claiming the fugitive . Accordingly , the Coininittee recommend that the claimant be placed under bond , and be required to return the fugitive to that county in the State from which he fled , and there to take him before a compe*teat tribunal , giving him all facilities for establishing his freedom . The Committee hope that , in this way , all cau*es of irritation , consequent on the recovery of fugitives , will be removed . Should , however , these measures , in their practical operation , prove insufficient , they consider that the owners of such slaves will have a just title to indemnity out of the Treasury of the United States . The Committee finally report on the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Columbia . Without discussing the power of Congress to abolish slavery within the District , they are of opinion that its abolition is inexpedient . The apprehension and uneasiness it would excite in the slave States , the constant decrease of the slave p*-pulation in this District , and the probability that this concession would lead to farther demands , stamps such a measure as unnecessary and unwise . But a majority of the Committee think differently , with regard to the slave-trade within the District . This trade is as revolting to the feelings of slaveholders , as to those from the Northern States . Most , if not all , of the slaveholding States have prohibited a trade in slaves , as merchandize , within their own limits ; and Congress , standing in regard to the people of this District in the same position that the State Legislatures do to the people of the States , may safely follow the example . The Committee recommend that this traffic be abolished . The views and recommendations contained in this report may be recapitulated in a few words : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , formed out of Texas , to be postponed until they shall hereafter present themselves to be received iito the Union , when it will be the duty of Congress , fairly and faithfully , to execute the compact with Texas , by admitting such new State , or States . 2 . The admission , forthwith , of California into the Union , with the boundaries she has proposed . 3 . The e*tablishment of territorial governments , without the Wilmot Proviso , for New Mexico and Utah , embracing all the territory recently acquired by the United States from Mexico , not contained in the boundaries of California . 4 . The combination of these two last-mentioned measures in the same bill . 5 . The establishment of the western and northern boundary of Texas , and the exclusion from her jurisdiction of all New Mexico , with the grant to Texas of a pecuniary equivalent . And the section for that purpose to be incorporated in the bill , admitting California , and establishing territorial governments for Utah and New Mexico . 6 . More effectual enactments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to service , or labor , in one State , under the laws thereof , who escape into another State . And 7 . Abstaining from abolishing slavery ; but , under a heavy penalty , prohibiting the slave trade in the District of Columbia . May 13 . The Senate having under consideration the bill to admit California , as a State , into the Union , to establish territorial governments for Utah and Mexico , and for making proposals to Texas for the establishment of her Western and Northern boundaries , Mr. CLAY spoke as follows He wished to give some explanation concerning the report of the Committee of Thirteen . When that report was presented to the Senate various members stated that it did not meet , in all its parts , with their concurrence . This was true . No one member of the Committee concurred in all that was done , or omitted to be done by the Committee . But these difkrences were no source of discouragement to him . In the passage of the measure through this branch of Congress , there was room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it should not be so modified , he felt confident that there would finally he a unanimous concurrence of the Committee in its favor , and a large majority in the Senate . The first measure on which they reported , was that concerning the compact between the United States and Texas , on the occasion of the admission of that State into the Union. - Here there was an undivided opinion . Two Senators made the reservation that they should not consider themselves hound in every condition of things , to vote for the admission of those States thus carved out of Texas , hut united heartily in this as the true exposition of the compact . The question of the admission of California , continued Mr. Clay , was the one that gave the most difficulty to the Committee . It was insisted that , if admitted at all , it should be with one representative ; that there was no sufficient evidence that her population entitled her to more . But accurate testimony could hardly be demanded in this case . Neither did usage call for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on their admission , had a population proportioned to the number of their representatives , but it was known that the rapid influx of emigration would shortly remove the difficulty , and the irregularity was overlooked . There seems an error existing , said Mr. Clay , with regard to the requisite population to entitle California to two representatives . It is not double the amount fixed for one representative . That number was fixed by Congress , ten years since , at 70,680 ; but it was expressly provided that any State , which had an excess beyond a moiety of that amount , should be entitl* to an additional representative. - The Senator then showed from the memorial of the deputation from California to the United States , that her population was 107,069 , on the first of January , 1850 . This exceeds the requisite number , and he had no doubt , from the statements of officials at San Francisco , she had , at the present moment , full 135,256 inhabitants . With regard to the limits of California , a proposition was first offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific of 36* 30 ; a subsequent proposition altered this line to 359 30 , but a majority of the Committee finally decided upon having no dividing line . This proposition was made with the view of reserving a slave State out of the Territory . But with the non-slaveholding State of California on the North , the mountains of Mexico on one side and the Pacific on the other , slavery surely would never be introduced  --  or if introduced , could never be maintained . But California , it is said , is too extensive ; her seaboard is 600 or 700 miles in length ; it is unreasonably lafge . But of this coast , the part below 360 30 is bordered by deserts of sand , back of which are successive chains of mountains , forcing the population to the eastward , to have intercourse exclusively with Mexico and the Atlantic States . While in the Northern part of California is a vast desert , hitherto never passed , and reaching from the country of the Mormons to the Pacific . I think then , said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with respect to her limits , and the circumstances under which she presents herself to Congress , every thing is favorable to the grant she solicits , and that we can find neither in the one nor the other a sufficient motive to reject or throw her back into the state of lawless ' confusion and disorder from which she has emerged . All these considerations , the Committee consider , apply with equal force to the two Territories of Utah and New Mexico . The plan of the Executive , recommending the admission of California , but leaving the other two questions unsettled , was originated at a time when it was thought that to create governments for the Territories would be productive of the greatest distractions and agitation . Since then the extremes of public opinion have moderated . The North and the South have come to the rescue of the Union . Measures that then were dangerous , would now meet with general approbation . He contended that to abandon Utah and New Mexico , to leave them without the authority of the General Government , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in transitu to other regions , to d this in the face of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , was in conflict with the high claims of duty . At this moment , said Mr. CLAY , disorders are commencing , from the backwardness of the Government in establishing the boundaries of Texas . Commissioners have been sent by that State to Santa Fe or New Mexibo , for the purpose of bringing them under her authority . From the temper of the people of that province , he had no doubt these demands would be resisted , and civil commotions and shedding of blood might yet be the consequence . With regard to the amount to be paid Texas for her relinquishment of her claims , to preveiit improper speculation in the stock market , ' the Committee had thought it best to wait until the final disposition of the bill , before naming the sum they had concluded to recommend . Mr. CLAY then alluded to Mr. BENTON ' 5 parliamentary objections to the combination of these three measures . He showed that the process of tacking one bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objected , was not the same in principle in the English Parliament as in Congress . Bills originating in the House of Commons were not subject to amendment by the House of Lords , as in our 1850. 653 // Senate ; but if received at all , were to be passed entire . It was the means of forcing popular measures on the crown and aristocracy . The practice was consequently decried in the messages of the crown , and by all writers under the influence of the aristocracy . It was looked upon favorably enough by the popular party . But in consequence of the power of amendment by the Senate , the technical objections to it are in no ways applicable to the present compromise bill . The practice in this country has been to associate bills of the most diver*.e natures . The constitution of California , providing that no two subjects should be united in one bill , has been held up to us as example . The constitution of Louisiana has the same enactment , and experience shows the greatest inconvenience resulting . The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people , when the Territory arrives at the dignity of a State . The Territorial government , by the plan of the Committee , has been debarred from all legislation on that subject . The Indian or peon servitude however is left open to their action . At present , he said , by the Mexican law and in point of fact , slavery did not exist in that province ; and he thought there was little probability of its entering a country where labor can be obtained at the rate of three or four dollars a month . The next subject the Committee reported on , was the re-capture of fugitive slaves . The Committee here proposed two amendments to the bill reported by the Senator from Virginia , ( Mr. Mason ) . The first provides that the owner of the fugitive shall , whenever practicable , carry from his own State to that whither the ftgitive has fled , a certificate of the Court , adjudicating the fact of slavery , the fact of elopement , and a general description of the slave . This record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact . The inconvenience will be very slight , and the reverence in which records are everywhere held will be great additional security . The next provision is , that the owner , on the detection of the fugitive , shall give bond to take him back to the county of the State whence he escaped , and at the first Court there held after his return , shall afford him all the facilities necessary for the establishment of his right to freedom , if he still continues to assert his right . A trial'by jury is demanded by the non-slaveiholding States , and this the amendment provides , for . The practical ope:ation of this will be , that where , if the trial by jury were allowed in the free State , the fugitive would use every endeavor , and find great facilities for escaping from justice , now that this trial is to be conducted among his old comrades , and where he is well known , he will feel more inclined to relinquish his pretensions to freedom . Mr. CLAY thought that the South should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but maintained in a manner not to wound unnecessarily the feelings of others . The Senator then alluded to the opinion prevalent in some of the non-slaveholding States , that there is a higher and Divine law , entitling the runaway to food , shelter , and hospitality from the man under whose roof he has come . Divine law has often been the pretext for outrages on society . Divine law is the plea of the Mahometan for his polygamy . The wretch , dying from famine , can , with far greater plausibility , point to his neighbor 's abundance , and plead natural and Divine law for satisfying therefrom his wants . Let them point out , said Mr. CLAY , the credentials of their revelation . Finally , the Committee have reported on the abolition of the slave-trade in the District of Columbia . He believed there was no time within the last forty years , when , if it had been earnestly pressed upon Congress , there would not have been found a majority  --  a majority from the Southern States-in favor of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an abstraction pressed upon the South by the North , and urged , they say , by a natural sentiment in behalf of freedom . The South reject it , not from fear of the objects of the Proviso , for these objects will be accomplished without its aid , but in a sense that their security lies in denying at the very threshold any right in the North to touch the subject of slavery . The North contend for an empty form , the South for the preservation of property , of life , of happiness . They know that to yield to this demand , will be the signal for new sects springing up , with new notions and new natural laws , who will carry their notions into the bosom of the slaveholding States . At a meeting of the Southern Members of Congress , held May 8th , a Committee was appointed to take into consideration the subject of a newspaper to be established at Washington , and to be devoted to Southern interests and institutions The Committee , in their report , call the attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall uphold their peculiar institutions , and , at the same time , be held distinct from the ordinary party lies and influences . They assert that the public opinion of the world has been directed against these institutions , and that now these attacks must be met on their own ground . The South has hitherto public sentiment , or fall . This warfare , incited by interest or prej udice , commenced , the Committee state , 654 June , // with Great Britain . That country , after hay-. ing been the cause of the establishment of slavery in the New World , has labored ceaselessly at its destruction . A common origin , a common language , and a common literature , have rendered her efforts on this continent partially successful . Its abolition in her own dependencies has brought on premature decay , and from the influence of this spirit , have proceeded the distractions within our own borders . To combat these pernicious and fanatical doctrines , to enter the lists against the world , to defend Southern rights and Southern feelings , to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience and judgment of those from position better informed , the Committee urge the establishment of this paper . At the seat of government , they say , there is no paper which makes these interests their paramount object . The abolition party can always be heard through their press there , while the other journals make the maintenance of party their controlling object ; and not one to consider the preservation of sixteen hundred millions of property , the equality and liberty of fourteen or fifteen States , the protection of the white man against African equality , as even equal to the political organization to secure the election of President . In the Federal Legislature , the South has some voice and some votes , but the press in this city takes its tone from that of the North . They give , in turn , a coloring to that of the South , and false impressions are consequently produced throughout that section , concerning *public men and measures . This journal is to be sustained by Southern means and talent , and to be dedicated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Southern Democrats are to contribute alike in its columns . Party relations are not to be disturbed , but to be held subordinate to the great and engrossing interest , to the South , of slavery . On April 30 , the joint resolution from the House , respecting the expedition in search of Sir John Franklin , being before the Senate , it was finally adopted , by a vote of 28 to 16 . The resolution was as follows : Resolved , by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States , in Congress assembled , That the President be , and he is hereby authorized and directed to receive from Henry Grinnell , of the city of New York , the two yessets prepared by him for an expedition in search of Sir John Franklin and his companions , and to detail from the navy such commissioned and warrant officers , and so many seamen as may be necessary for said expedition , and who may be willing to engage therein . The said officers and men shall be furnished with suitable rations , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeding three years , and shall have the use of such necessary instruments as are now on hand and can be spared from the navy , to be accounted for and returned by the officers who shall receive the same . Resolved furt her , That the said vessels , officers and men shall be in all respects under the laws and regulations of the navy of the United States until their return , when the said vessels shall be delivered to the said .. Henry Grinnell : Provided , That the United States shall not be liable to any claim for compensation in case of the los* , damage or deterioration of the said vessels , or either of them , from any cause , or in any manner whatever , nor be liable to any demand for the use or risk of the said vessels , or either of them .
