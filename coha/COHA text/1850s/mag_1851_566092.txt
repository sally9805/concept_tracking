NEW ENGLANDER . No . XXXVI . NOVEMBEIR , 1851 . ART . 1. - PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND THE USEFUL ARTS IN THEIR RELATION TO CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION . The Annual of Scientific Discovery , or Year Book of Facts in Science and Art . 1850-1851 . Boston : GOULD , KENDALL &amp; LINCOLN . THIS American Annual of Scientific Discovery now numbering a second volume of . a series that giyes goodly promise of a lasting and honorable succession , the London publication of a similar kind which has already been issued for more than twenty years , the numerous serials devoted to like purposes both in the Old and in the New World , and the frequent appearance of occasional volni*es , in the form of abstracts , digests , retrospects , proceedings of scientific associations , and the like , afford one of the most decisive indications of the course in which the thoughts and efforts of the reflecting and working men of our time are directed . These two compact volumes , the condensed substance of many ample quarterlies and annuals , the bare titles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , serve most effectually both to awaken the desire to enter upon the minute study of every department of art and nature , and also to administer a most humiliating rebuke to that aimless and dissipated ambition , which aspires to the attainment of all knowledge in one short life . But while these publications show at a glance what the scientific world is doing , thus exhibiting both the old and the new fields of investigation expanding beyond the utmost ability of any one mind to keep pace with the discoveries made by so many adventurous explorers , they also supply us with an // indispensable short-hand method of arriving at the chief points of interest in the results , of which any moderately well-informed mind can not afford to be ignorant . Thus the professional or general reader , instead of allowing his impression of any department of science to remain fixed as it was made by the study of a school or college text-book teu or twenty years ago , will be stimulated by the annual perusal of a volume like these to a resurvey of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old boundaries resting upon false or imaginary territories , or far within the limits of actual discovery , he will readjust their position according to ascertained fact . And indeed if there were uot some such abridged process of learnin the grand results of scientific research from year to year , any single individual might despair at once of continuing to embrace within the compass of his unassisted vision , even the general outlines of the ever-widening area of human knowledge . If in additiou to these two duodecimos of four hundred pages each , we had one of a similar character to correspond in like manner to each of the successive years of the half century just closed , the series would bear witness to an amount of patient research , keen observation , and untiring labor , which it is altogether impossible to estimate . Let the most obstinate doubter and denier of the reality of human progress be put to the task of intelligently reading through such a series , and he certainly could not deny that the human mind within the period under review had at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he maintain that the effort put forth had been unattended by a correspondent success in securing the object sought . Never before in the whole course of the world 's history has the spirit of investigatiou on all subjects been so laboriously at work , or so intelligently directed , or so abundantly successful in its efforts . Thousands of restless and inquiring minds have run to and fro through all the earth , and have striven with ceaseless endeavor to subject every department in the kingdom of nature , every mystery overhanging the shadowy* frontier of human knowledge , to renewed and more searching scrutiny . They have explored with the light of modern intelligence amid the fossil remains and the mouldering archives of the past ; and with equal zeal they have written down with unwearied hand every event , and drawn with daguerreotype exactness every feature in the history of the present . They have already abundantly anticipated the future with brilliant and with dark conjecture* They have been intent upon presarving alike every fact and every fable ; every principle in scie*nce and every theory in specul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertain the laws of nature , and every daring hypothesis that has been instituted to explain or to justify the laws of Providence . Exploring expeditions furnished with full scientific corps , appointed expressly for the purpose , have sought out the most unfrequented coasts and islands , aud the most forbidding latitudes of the great deep ; and the ordinary voyager has been excited to habits of inquiry , and furnished with directions , charts , and instruments for making accurate observations wherever his ship plows the surface of the world-surrounding waters . Travelers have ranged through all lands , and have studied the languages , customs , and present condition of every race of men , the habits , instincts , and physical conformation of every animal tribe , and the characteristic properties of every vegetable and mineral substance within the reach of their inquiries . They have exhumed the buried cities of the past , and measured , and minutely scrutinized , restored temples , and mummy-peopled catacombs , pictured and sculptured grottos and hollow pyramids . They have deciphered hieroglyphic inscriptions , and applied alike shrewd conjecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monuments of the scientific attainments of ancient nations . They have brought home as the result of their toil and observations , heavy volumes , elaborate drawings , whole shiploads of antiquarian relics , and of specimens from the several kingdoms of nature , with which to store cabinets and libraries , and thus to supply the ready means of instructing all succeeding generations . And not less ardent and persevering has been the zeal with which all such accumulated resources , and every other advantage for study and observation , have been employed at home . There still , patient and keen-sighted investigators have been continually subjecting every process , every product , and every law of the material world , to the most prying scrutiny , and the most elaborate analysis . Every substance has been subjected to the fiery torture of the furnace , or the disorganizing shock of the battery , to compel it to yield up the secret of its constituent elements . The mysterious processes of germination , reproduction and growth in vegetable and animal bodies , have been scrutinized with a view to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on through the successive stages in the formation of the living tissues , up to the completion in the fully developed plant and animal . Numberless eyes have been upon the watch by night and by day to detect any unusual phenomena , and to discover and publish to the world the causes of those which have been hitherto both familiar in fact , and inexplicable in nature . Thousands of ingenious and enthusiastic cx- // 484 Physical 8eience and the Useful Arts perimenters have been at work to devise new uses and combinations of the generating and moving powers stored up in the earth , the waters and the air ; and in many instances , by startling inventions , by original applications of the chemical or mechanical forces , they have revolutionized at once whole departments of human industry . The insensible machine and engine are made to supply the place of animal nerves and muscles , and to perform their work with a perfection which the nuassisted hand could never attain . The most minute not less than the most magnificent of the works and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods to accomplish their appointed results , and those elements which acts with immeasurable rapidity , have alike been made the subject of experiment and turned to practical uses . While one class of observers , by the aid of the most highly magnifying instruments , have numbered and classified by a skillful inspiration of separate organs , tribes of animals invisible to the unassisted eye , others have endeavored to discover the law of magnetic and atmospheric storms , which throw the whole surrounding air and perhaps the ether of the planetary spaces into commotion , and cover the face of a continent with darkness ; others still have aspired to trace out the footsteps of the Creator , and to mark the successive stages of his work , in the formation of worlds and systems of worlds . While some have patiently investigated the changes that have taken place in the solid crust of the globe , dunn6 the measureless succession of geological eras , others , for all the practical purposes of life , have gone far towards annihilating time and space , bringing the most distant regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the globe itself could . not furnish a sufficiently extensive field for the activity of its inhabitants , many earnest and tireless observers have been nightly searching with their sky-piercing tubes for othee worlds , wresting from the awful darkness of space the history of suns and of systems whose period of creation antedates all human annals , and whose distance and number surpass all finite calculation . Not a comet can complete its swift passage around our sun , but that its direction and dimensions are accurately observed , and the exhausting calculus of the astronomer not only weighs the solitary stranger in balances , but extorts from it the secret of the long pathway which it pursues through the unknown void . Not a planet can be deflected from its orbit , but that the perturbation is observed , and the cause traced home to some previously undiscovered world which had already for ages traveled unseen in the far depths of infinite space around the same central sun . It must indeed be admitted that there is much of theory and // vain speculation developed by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even false theory and the wildest speculation are not unfrequently the indirect means of extending the domain of truth and increasing man 's control oVer the powers of nature . Nor can it be denied that this countless host of bnsy and ingenious inquirers , acting in concert with each other from country to country and from continent to continent , are in reality adding an incalculable amount to the sum total of human knowledge . They are devising new and more appropriate forms of stating , illustrating and applying what was before known , and they are ever carrying farther and farther the torch-light of discovery out into the forbidding and mysterious unknown , which as a wall of darkness must somewhere interrupt the most daring excursions of the human mind . And if we take the present as compared with the past , for our surest gnide in attempting to forecast the future , we must conclude that still greater advances in the attainment of every species of knowledge are yet to be made . Unless the human mind be reduced to a state of complete and irremediaNe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity , labor from it efforts , genius from its inventions , millions of restless spirits from ranging over heaven and earth to find out new laws , new principles , new powers , new combinations , it is impossible but that the present , as compared with the future , shall be only as the star of the morning to the dazzling glories of the coming sun . Such an immense display of patient toil and intellectual activity is brought clearly before us by the contents of a single volume presenting *n a condensed form the results of scientific research for a single year . And such are the hopeful anticipations of the future which these results , when justly estimated , authorize us to entertain . And if we pass from a general to a more specific and discriminating view of the objects upon which scientific inquiry has been expended , and the direction in which the efforts of the investigator have been rewarded with the greatest degree of success , we shall find nothing to shake our confidence in the promise of still clearer light and still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full view of the fact , ( if not indeed rather in direct consequence of the fact , ) that the most rapid advances now making in knowledge are in the departument of the physical sciences , and in the consequent improvement in the mechanic arts and the increased control gained by man over the powers and resources of nature . These are indeed sometimes stigmatized as the material and subordinate interests of mankind . It has even become quite reputable with a certain class of critics to decry the mechanical and // mercenary tendencies of the age , becanse the fine arts , as they conceive , have fallen into neglect through increased attention to the useful ; and becanse the spirit of modern inqniry has presumed to seek for the case of many phenomena and the use of many properties in nature , before which the imaginative Greek and the proud iRoman bowed down with shuddering awe and unquestioning devotion . Again and again we are told that there is no faith , no reverence in the present age , because it does not shrink from questioning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so , does it hesitate to turn back the vail from the most awful of nature 's mysteries . It is said that all taste for the beautiful in nature , and all passionate love for higher ideal beauty in the creation of art , are rapidly giving place to a selfish , stock-jobbing spirit , which esteems the cotton-gin a more effective means of promoting civilization than the chisel of Canova , and an ocean line of steamships more conducive to the permanent peace and enlightenment of the nations , than the gallery of the Louvre or the dome and colonnades of Saint Peter 's . But it certainly should not be charged to the discredit of the present , that it has set itself ardently and successfully to the work of remedying what has been a fatal deficiency in the civilization and intelligence of every past age . That deficiency was the want of a general diffusion among all classes of such practical knowledge as insures at once an amelioration of the physical condition and a more effective appropriation of labor , and thus renders it at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach of all . If man would avail himself fully of the advantages of his position , he must do something more than look with wonder or rhapsody upon the glorious creation which God has given him for a present inheritance . He must aspire to the interpretation of its deepest meaning . He must boldly investigate its laws , and rigidly calculate its economical uses . If , according to the divine blessing and command , he would " subdue the earth and possess it , " he must carefully analyze and appropriate its powers , its productions , its capacities to minister to the combined physical and intellectual necessities of its lord . And whoever undertakes to pronounce authoritatively upon the tendencies of the time , the comparative increase of the means of general , social , intellectual and moral improvemuent , must know how men live , wherewithal they are fed and clothed , by what means they sustain life and secure such a measure of daily well-being as they have . Unless men have the materials , the facilities and the skill to build suitable houses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of making , or possess the means of obtaining and using successfully , the various implements and utensils necessary for answering their daily individual wants , it matters little what else some one among a million may know or be able to do . A single work of ' " high art , " however extraordinary , can by no means make up to the world what it has lost by the vicious indolence , or the unprofitable , uninstructed labor of a million human hands . The temple of Diana of old at Ephesus , which , for its architectural beauty and for the magnificence of its model , became the wonder of the world , by no means led to the construction of even comfortable dwellings for the multitndes of its worshipers . The Pyramids remain , and seem destined to remain , objects of wonder and astonishment to all succeeding ages , for the vast amount of toil , and skill , and treasure employed in their construction . Yet they will by no means show that the hundred thousand men who perished in building a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or houseless , half clothed , half barbarous , dependent upon the most scanty and unsuitable food for their daily subsistence . The nations , the people of antiquity , who assisted with their hands in rearing the unbroken shaft of the Obelisks , or the successive courses of the Pyramids , the Parthenon and the Coliseum , were themselves little else than passive instruments in subjection to the will and power of a few , whose intelligence and riches had been purchased at the expense of the ignorance and wretchedness of millions . They spun for their garments , like the IMlendi and Shoans of today , with their fingers and by the single thread . They plowed up the gronud for tillage with a sharpened stake . They , of necessity , lived , and lodged , and were clothed , in ways that afforded the greatest facilities and temptations to the most brutal licentiousness . They sailed in vessels that could not safely keep the sea for a single night , but were drawn up on shore , like the fisherman 's bark , to wait for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the useful arts , which has gone far , among the civilized nations of modern times , toward relieving such degrading and wasteful applications of human toil , has not been made in those countries where the " creations " of ancient genius remain to awaken and to guide new effort , or where the love of the beautiful in art is recognized as a universal passion . The common people , whose homes are now among the most imposing and magnificent remains of ancient glory , are mainly indebted to other nations for everything in their present condition which makes the means of subsistence , of bodily coinfort and of intellectual and moral improvement , more accessible to them , than they were to the same class , in the same conutries , // many centuries ago . It is in other lands than those , that ten thousand new instrumentalities have been devised for promoting the individual well-being of mankind . It is among people whom the indolent and sensual Italian but recently esteemed barbarians , that everything which has life in itself seems to have acquired a redoubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded by the ancients with superstitious awe , or were believed to be inert and useless , have been made the means of exerting a greater power , and effecting a more rapid communication , than they ever pictured even in the dreams of romance . ilence it is but the simple statement of fact , that our vessels move against the wind , with greater ease and rapidity than those of the most distinguished mariners of antiquity could , with both wind and tide in their favor . Articles of fnrniture which in the golden age of ancient literature and art could be found only in the palaces of kings , and by them deemed more valuable than an equal weight of gold , are employed by ns in the most common and menial services . The makers of purple and fine linen in the days of Tyre and Sidon could only supply enough of their precious fabric , to clothe the princes and the mighty men of a single empire . A fabric , of equal practical value , can now be produced by a much smaller number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attached to a merchant vessel circumnavigating the earth , the material could be raised , prepared , spun , woven , and drawn off the loom , as fast as the ship , with an ever-favoring wind , could extend it around the globe . And the power to destroy has been increased , and rendered controllable , fully in proportion to the power to construct or reproduce . The walls of Troy which ( if the Illiad be not a myth ) an allied army of a hundred thousand men besieged for ten years , and took at last only by stratagem , could now be battered down by a respectable battalion of artillerists , in ten hours . And the direct means of increasing and disseminating knowledge on all subjects have been not less improved . The author , who possesses the happy faculty of addressing the universal heart of mankind , soon , without leaving his home , breaks over the barrier of foreign languages , national prejudices , and world-wide distances , and speaks to the millions of many lands in their own tongue . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression , can in a few hours give form and durable expression to a greater amount of composition , than was written out by the whole human race in a thousand years of the world 's history previous to the age of Alexander , or subsequent to that of Constantine . Three men can now send forth five thousand copies of the // same book , in the time that the same number could have published , in a less legible , elegant and durable form , Live copies in the most refined and literary period of the IRoman Empire . The beautiful fiction of the poet , in which , he represents a heavenly messenger descending to our earth upon a sunbeam and keeping pace with its flight , is almost realized in the familiar process by which intelligence is brought to us from places a thousand miles remote every morning . We can ask and learn the health of a friend , the state of the weather , the changes in the market , the current events in a city so far distant in as little time as Pericles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message from the Pir*cus to the Acropolis of Athens . And if it is still insisted , that all this undeniable progress is only in the most material and mercenary interests of mankind , or in those discoveries which may be productive of as great evil as good ; it is enough to say in reply , that without such changes and discoveries , material and mechanic though they be , it is impossible that the human race at large shall ever become civilized or Christian . The brutal subjection and degradation of the great mass of men , during the most enlightened periods of ancient civilization , would have been impossible , had the physical sciences and the useful arts been carried to anything near the present degree of perfection . If the traveler , exploring the ruins of ancient Nineveh , or digging down to the foundations of the buried cities upon the banks of the Nile , could find there a font of movable types for printing , or the remains of a cottongin , or the model of a steam-engine , or the figure of a mariner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the high state of civilization , and of the general diffusion of intelligence and well-being among the inhabitants of those cities , than we are able to gather , from all the architectural monuments that remain to excite the wonder and admiration of all succeeding generations . It is not denied but That modern discoveries and improvements in the methods of multiplying and controlling the mechamilcal powers and the original forces of nature , may be employed for evil purposes . The printing press in corrupt hands will multiply and disseminate falsehood , and obscenity , and blasphemy , as rapidly as in other hands it will scatter abroad leaves from the tree of life for the healing of the nations . But this liability to abuse is by no means peculiar to the general diffusion of high attainments in physical science and the useful arts . ilowever efficient an auxiliary in the work of human improvement might be secured in the creative faculty of justly disciplined imagination , it is unhappily true , that thus far on in the // world 's history , the loftiest genius , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even music and poetry , has far too uniformly fostered the monstrous growth of corrupt and demoraliziug principle , sensual and debasing passion . And there is no self-adjusting safeguard against such a prostitution of the loftiest endowments of genius as shall become extreme and pernicious in proportion to the merely cesthetic perfection of its culture . But in regard to high attainments in physical science and the useful arts , directly the contrary is true . For it is in accordance with the arrangements of an all-wise and unchangeable Providence , that just in proportion as man perfects his mastery over the powers of nature , his progress in that direction necessitates upon him at least an outward obedience to the laws of the God of nature . Thus , when the enginery of destruction becomes so perfect that nothing can stand before it , the bare instinct of self-preservation will compel the nations to learn and to practice war no more . The man who shall invent a movable and easily adjusted engine , by means of which a single hand can destroy a whole army in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line-of-battle ship , fortress , or wall of defense , will close at once , the history of standing armies , military loans , conscriptions and campaigns , and all the " pomp , pride , and circumstance of glorious war . " When the structure of the human body and the laws of the human constitution are thoroughly understood by all classes , the profession of the quack will become as obsolete as is now , in a limited portion of the world , that of the astrologer , the necromancer , and the rainmaker . When what are now the mysteries of chemical and mechanical philosophy , and of the practical applications of its principles , shall have become as much a part of simple and common knowledge as are now many things that were not less inexplicable mysteries to all a few centuries ago , men will be compelled to enforce such a high standard of public morality , as will of itself afford an effectual security tci property , peace and life . For the present security of locks , checks , safes , secret compositions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a community where all such things are as well understood , as a limited number now understand the trifling experiments , with which the cunning showman startles and bewilders the less instructed mind . When the exhaustless riches which are still stored up unappropriated in the earth , the waters and the air , shall have been discovered and brought within the comprehension of all , the excesses of worldly ambition , the injustice of oppression , the extortion of covetousness , the profligacy of vice , must work their own destruction , as naturally and inevi // tably as the pain of the burned limb compels the man to withhold it from the flame . Of course it is not claimed that any degree of perfection to which the practical application of scientific knowledge may be carried can necessitate the existence of virtue or religion in the hearts of men . The very nature of moral rectitude is such as to make the bare supposition of such a result a contradiction . And yet , we do claim that , though the existence of high attainments in science and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of moral excellence , still , no people , as a whole , can be enlightened and christianized to any considerable extent , without continually advancing in the knowledge of everything that conduces to the improvement of man 's physical condition-everything that tends to increase his subjugation of the powers of nature to his control , and for his advantage . And on the other hand , the whole history of the world goes to show , that none but an enlightened , virtuous and religious people will ever give their attention sufficiently to those studies and pursuits which have for their end the improvement of men of all classes , and in all respects , physical , mental , and moral . An arbitrary government with its millions of ignorant and wretched subjects , may establish an Alexandrian Library , or Il3ibliothecjue IRoyale , with its myriad volumes . But it is only a people , who are already in a high state of improvement , and are advancing to a still higher degree , that will build the common school-house , such as it should be , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Autocrat of IRussia , or the Princes of CabM or Cashmere , may support manufactories , which , by some years ' labor of many hands , shall produce a piece of tapestry or a shawl , such as can not be executed by all the machinery in the world . But materials that shall clothe , and feed , and thereby tend most effectually to improve the naked and hungry millions of mankind will be produced and justly distributed in sufficient abundance for all , only in those countries where Christianity has taught the importance of the individual man , and the obligation , resting on all , to labor not simply for the aggrandizement of one family , or one class , but for the permanent improvement and happiness of the whole race . We must infer then , that every degree of progress , in the socalled material interests of mankind , is so much done in preparing the way for a universal Christian civilization . And that which constitutes the most decisive and prominent characteristic of this " physical and mechanic age , " as compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , more for the present and permanent good of the great mass of mankind than all that // have gone before it . For it may be safely said , that within the memory of some who now live , more has been done to diffuse generally , and thus to equalize , the possession of knowledge , property , security and enjoyment , than in the whole historic period of the world 's existence before . More has been done within fifty years , through applications of physical science to unprovements in the useful arts , to place the necessaries , the comforts and the elegancies of social life within the reach of all classes , than in the five thousand years that preceded . The work of fully equalizing what should never have been regarded as anything else than common advantages has indeed but just begun . But it is the hopeful characteristic of our time that it is begun ; and that thus Christianity is both drawing into its service its own appropriate and efficient instrumentalities , and is vindicating itself before the world , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual man the peaceful possession and enjoyment of the life that now is , together with the promise of that which is to come . For , no one who is at all acquainted with the past history and the present condition of the world , for a moment expects , that these outward instrnmentalities for the improvement of man 's physical condition as leading to the like improvement of his moral condition have come , or are to come , from any other than nations to some degree Christian . A patent office , or a school for the application of science to the arts in a IMlahometan or Pagan nation would be as great an anomaly , as the idol of Juggernaut in a Christian temple . And hence , notwithstanding the contempt of professedly aesthetic criticism for merely economical advantages , and the distrust with which unenlightened piety regards every branch of human knowledge , all advances made in physical science and the useful arts can justly be regarded only as efficient instrumentalities , brought into existence by divine Providence in the appointed time , and destined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the permanent improvement of mankind . If it is anj better for men to dwell in cleanly and well-warmed apartments , than to shiver in the open air before a fire of logs , - if it is any better for them to be clothed in cheap yet healthful and becoming garments , than to be wrapped in the undressed hides of beasts-if their comfortable subsistence is any more secure when they understand the method of enriching barren soils and reducing the rough and intractable to a state of cultivation , than when they gather their food from the accidental growth of the forest , or the still more uncertain products of the chase-if their opportunities and inducements to secure intellectual cultivation are any greater , when the means of preserving // health and preventing disease are so much better understood as to prolong the average duration of human life to double its previous amount-if the reign of universal peace may be regarded as any nearer , when different nations , instead of regarding each other as natural enemies , are brought into intimate communication with each other , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest existing between them-then certainly there is more hope for the world now , even according to the merest human estimate , than ever before . And when we resort to the light of revelation to enable ourselves to explain the meaning of these changes in man 's outward condition , we are taught to regard the changes themselves as indications of an equal degree of progress in the attainment of a higher good , and we are led to recognize the means by which they are effected as so many instrumentalities divinely appointed to bear a necessary part in the great work of securing man 's ultimate rescue from his present degraded moral condition . The connection of all advances in physical science and the useful arts with Christian civilization , and thus with the essential means of securing the highest welfare of all mankind , may be seen most clearly in the results growing out of the constantly increasing facilities for travel and transport-for the communication of intelligence between different parts of the same country , and between nation and nation . It is in consequence of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributing to every region the most valuable prodncti6ns of every other , and making it necessary that each of the great powers of the earth shall have an authorized representative of its interests in the capital and chief cities of every other . Thus while commerce exposes the property , the rights and the lives of the citizens or subjects of the governiug nations , in all parts of the world , it demands that international law shall follow and protect them wherever they go . And thus the system of exchanges between different countries which has now become well nigh universal , and which could in the first instance be rendered possible only by an increased knowledge of naval architecture , navigation and the methods of generating and applying motory power , is most rapidly hastening the day , when among all mankind there shall be of necessity but one law . Even now it is true that no one of the leading nations can suffer greatly in any respect , without causing others to share in the calamity all around the globe . The blow that is struck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks of the St. Lawrence and the Ganges . And let the single subject , though he be but the humblest missionary of the cross , who claims protection // under the flag of Britain , suffer violence at the hands of a tribe of barbarians in the remotest quarter of the earth , and the ten thousand cannon of her mighty navy will be ready to lift up their voices in threatening thunder against the deed . And this state of things has arisen from the fact that practical science having disarmed the ocean and the elements of their terrors , has made commerce well nigh universal , and has thus taught the nations the salutary lesson , that it is for the interest of each to be at peace with every other . So far as we can see , Divine Providence is now employing no other incidental instrumentality which exerts a more powerful influence than this increasingly free commercial intercourse in breaking down the barriers of prejudice , hereditary antipathy and divided interest between nation and nation , and thus preparing the way for the mutual recognition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and facility for intercommunication is demonstrating by actual experiment for the instruction of millions-what reasoning and illustration alone could never prove satisfactorily in the estimate of a selfish race-that the prosperity of every nation is linked with and dependent upon the prosperity of every other . Let a people become enriched in accumulated treasure and the resources of productive industry , and then supply them at hand with a mechanical means of safely distributing their riches all over the globe , and gathering in an ample reward from a thousand sources ; and they must be taught by their daily experience the dependence of one upon another , the community of interests that exists between the different members of the whole family of mankind . And this universal commerce , which is making every nation acquainted with every other ; which is exploring all seas , lakes , rivers , islands , mountains , continents , even deserts and wildernesses ; which is making the manners and customs of every race familiar to every other ; which is distributing all over the globe the peculiar products of any single region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riches , the knowledge and the improvements which can be collected from all lands ; which is thus creating intimate acquaintanceship and associated interests between people of the most diverse habits , languages , laws , and customs ; which in short leads all to recognize in all others of whatever kindred , tribe or tongue , not anthropophagi , nor troglodytes , nor cyclops , nor pigmies , as the ancients did , but human beings , veritable men , with senses , dimensions , affections , passions like their own  --  the process peculiarly characteristic of the present age , which is effecting all this , is certainly to be regarded not only as one of the leading elements of civilization and intellectual im // provement , but also as one of the most powerful auxiliaries in hastening the advent of the promised day , when peace shall be the universal law , and prosperity the uniform experience of all mankind , and the worship of the one great Father of all shall supplant every false religion . It is directly in consequence of the progress which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts , that they have gained an acknowledged pre-elninence over all others , and thus , by their superior knowledge and power , have secured to themselves a respect that never would have been conceded to spiritual truth and natural justice alone . In many instances , the wall of separation which ignorance , and bigotry , and superstition had built up between the different races of men has been broken down by those very nations who had kept themselves within its limits for ages , and refrained from contact with the rest of mankind as from the contagion of the plague . The empire of Mohammed itself instead of offering to the world the choice between the Koran and the scimitar , thus affecting to do in its weakness what it was able to do in its strength , sends its ambassador to this western world  --  to the capital , the ports , and the chief cities of the once hated and despised Christian , that by such means its own people may learn lessons , profiting by which , they too may share in the abundance of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own . And without the aid of such incidental influences , we can not easily see how Christianity itself could effect its great object in elevating and regenerating mankind . For unless the world can be made acquainted with itself ; unless all can know to a much greater extent than most now do , the wants as well as the advantages of all others , it will be impossible to create in the minds of men that enlarged and intelligent benevolence which the gospel would establish in proclaiming peace on earth . IDestroy the present facilities for transport and intercommunication , put back physical science and the useful arts to the position which they held five centuries ago , and effectually prevent their advancing from that point , and you could never hope that by any possible means the religion of Christ would pervade the earth , or even that different nations could be brought to act , in their intercourse with each other , upon the liberal and safe policy which their interest demands . They would uniformly adhere to the old heathen and barbarian policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They would proscribe foreign manners and languages as barbarous , simply because they were foreign . They would shut themselves up within trenches and stone walls and castles for dwellings , clothe themselves // in iron mail , and regard warfare as the only profess ion worthy of a high born and high minded man . They would regard all distant nations as lawful plunder , and esteem themselves glorious , as did onr Saxon ancestors , in proportion to the number of captives and the amount of booty that they could bring home from their marauding excnrsions on land and sea . And they might do all that , as the Abyssinians now do , and as many nations did in the middle ages , while calling themselves Christians . If the religion of Christ maintained a nominal existence among them , it could never avail to extinguish their fierce and predatory habits , except by summoning the arts and sciences to its aid , and thus teaching them that the skill and energy which they have displayed in the work of destruction may find better employment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not sustained by the widest diffusion of intelligence , the most equalized enjoyment of rights , possessions and security , and the greatest possible freedom and facility insured to every one for acquiring all the advantages justly belonging to each individual man , will most certainly be a corrupt Christianity . It will be prostituted to the unnatural and revolting service of sustaining unjust law and usurpation , sanctifying the most inhuman abuses , customs and prerogatives , practicing the most cruel exactions upon the weak and defenseless , and controlling the interests of society solely for the advantage of a corrupt and cunning few . Such a return to the reign of darkness and violence , however munch desired by despotism and bigotry , and however confidently foretold by the prophets of evil , is not to be feared . Despotism can no more put out the light that has been kindled than it can quench the sun . Bigotry can no more recover the lost thunder of its anathemas , or rebuild the demolished walls of its dungeons , than it can recall the chaos and void of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere shines as yet , nor that the prison doors are thrown open to all that are bound . The progress which the world makes toward a better state is indeed slow , compared with what is to be desired . And all that we know of the time requisite to introduce a new era in the moral or the material creation would teach us that it must be slow . But it moves , and in the right direction . " As you were , " though still the standing order with military commanders and the hereditary sovereigns of mankind , is no longer sure to be obeyed . Despotism , in alarm , resorts to her old diviners and enchanters ; but they answer that there is a spirit raised among the nations over which their mightiest spells have no power . It is " the spirit of wisdom and understanding , " the spirit of " coun // sel and of knowledge , " and it smites the oppressor with the rod of its mouth ; it slays the wicked with the breath of its lips . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall ignorance and superstition and all injustice escape from being slain by the breath of its lips ? Nor need we use the language of the sacred word altogether in the form of appropriation to suit our purpose . It is the Spirit of the Lord , the sole spirit of wisdom and of power , that is carrying on this work of revolution , overturning and in aking all things new , progressively subduing all the resources of the material world of nature conjointly with the moral world of man for the accomplishment of the great enterprise worthy of a God  --  the intellectual and spiritual regeneration of a whole race . As we can trace the " footprints " of the great Builder upon the successive stages of his material creation , so may we reverently observe the successive steps of advance by which he goes on making a new heavens and a new earth wherein shall dwell righteousness . We can see the successive instrumentalities which he summons to bear a part in the work . Now , he discloses new powers and resources which he had treasured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth against the time of need for the subsistence and comfort of man . The desir*d progress in some direction meets new obstacles , and the work pauses ; - then he directs the mind of the wise inventor and the hands of the cunning workman , and the new obstacles are overcome by devices or discoveries as new . Again , different nations and different parts of the same country are disposed to regard each other with distrust an hostility , and thus hinder the introduction of his promised reign of peace . And then he draws them into the embrace of each other by double bands of iron over which the intermingling tide of travel and transport moves swift as the wind . lie binds them inseparably together with electric wires , along which the fire of newly awakened thought and the thrill of sympathetic feeling traverse with immeasurable speed . Nations are still disposed to decide their differences by the strong arm of violence , and he gives them such a terrible mastery over the elements of destruction , as that a conflict must inevitably destroy both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which both must lose all , and gain nothing . In proportion as men are disposed to employ life for right purposes , he teaches them the means of increasing its duration and diminishing its evils . As rapidly as men are prepared rightly to employ the increase of their power resulting from unity of action , he increases their facilities for union , removing by degrees the grand cause of the ancient dispersion , by reducing the number of languages and // preparing the way for the universal diffusion of one . And however " material and mechanical " may be many of the instrumentalities which we thus see the divine IBuilder employing in his work of new creating our world , still we are , bound to reverence the selection which he makes of the means , and to rejoice in the result which he accomplishes.
