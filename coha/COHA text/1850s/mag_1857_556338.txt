txt ART . VIII . - Lectures on Quaternions ; containing a Syste ? natic Statement of a New lllathematical lUiethod ; of which the Principles were communicated in 1843 to the Royal Irish Academy , and which has since formed the Subject of successive Courses of Lectures delivered in 1848 and subsequent Years , in the Halls of Trinity College , Dublin : with numerous Illustrative Diagrams , and with some Geometrical and Physical Applications . By Sir WILLIAM ROWAN HAMILTON* LL . D. , M. II . I. A. Dublin : Hodges and Smith . 1853. 8vo. pp. 64 , lxxii , 736 . IT is confidently predicted , by those best qualified to judge , that in the corn * centuries Hamilton 's Quaternions will stand out as the great discovery of our nineteenth century . Yet how silently has the book taken its place upon the shelves of the mathematician 's library ! Perhaps not fifty men on this side the Atlantic have seen it , certainly not five have read it . There is something sublime in the secrecy in which the really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No popular applause follows the act ; neither contemporary nor succeeding generations of the people understand it . The geometer must be tried by his peers , and those who truly deserve the title of geometer or analyst have usually been unable to find so many as twelve living peers to form a jury . Archimedes so far outstripped his competitors in the race , that more than a thousand years elapsed before any man appeared , able to sit in judgment on his work , and to say how far he had really gone . And in judging of those men whose names are worthy // of being mentioned in connection with his , - Galileo , Descartes , Leibnitz , Newton , and the mathematicians created by Leibnitz and Newton 's calculus , - we are forced to depend upon their testimony of one another . They are too far above our reach for us to judge of tLem . It may be true that really great men in any department are always rare . We have but one Plato and but one Homer , one Shakespeare , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is always easy to find competent judges . All men of a metaphysical turn of mind can appreciate the difference between Plato and Aristotle . Every man is ready to join in approval or condemnation of a philosopher or a statesman , a poet or an orator , an artist or an architect . But who can judge of a mathematician ? Who will write a review of Hamilton 's Quaternions , and show us wherein it is superior to Newton 's Flnxions ? The great mathematician is a man peculiarly alone . Of all men , he most frequently treads " The silent desert of a great new thought . " He is alone , and if others essay to join him , before they can possibly accomplish the long and toilsome ascent , he will probably have mounted higher . He is alone , so far as human companionship is concerned . But he ofttimes feels the sublime joy of knowing that to him only of mortal men has been revealed a thought of the Infinite Geometer who has created all things in number , weight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made the Seven Stars and Orion , and guides Arcturus and his sons . The prominent reason why a mathematician can be judged by none but mathematicians , is that he uses a peculiar language . The language of Mathesis is special and untranslatable . In its simplest forms it can be translated , as , for instance , we may explain a right angle to mean a square corner . But go a little higher in the science of mathematics , and it is impossible to dispense with a peculiar language . It vould defy all the power of Mercury himself to explain to a person ignorant of the science what is meant by the simple phrase " functional exponent . " How much more impossible , // if we may say so , would it be to explain a vhoe treatise like Hamilton 's Quaternions , in such wise as to make it possible to judge of its value ! But to one who has learned this language , it is the most precise and clear of all possible modes of expression . It delivers the thought exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of form , but never with obscurity . It may be prolix , as it often is among French writers ; may delight in mere verbal metamorphoses , as in the Cambridge University in England ; or adopt the briefest and clearest forms , as under the pen of the geometer at our Cambridge ; but it always reveals to us precisely the writer 's thought . Hence the judgment which mathematicians , competent to judge at all , pronounce upon one another 's work , is matter of certainty , - of knowledge , not of mere opinion . There can never be the doubt which we sometimes feel in criticising a philosopher or essayist , whether the writer had any real thoughts , - whether he was not skilfully using language to conceal his want of ideas . Moreover , the nature of the subjects of which the analyst and geometer treats , is such that an almost equal degree of certainty belongs to the results of his study . It is a very rare thing for him to be mistaken in a matter to which he applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision against the practicability of ocean steamers brought up to invalid ate the decisions of science ! The fact that this supposed mistake of a second-rate man is so continually quoted , shows that there are no real mistakes of first-class men to justify rebellion against scientific authority . Popular sympathy is now-a-days on the side of the inventor , and the report of science adverse to his hopes is on that account unwillingly received . All the world wished Ericsson success in his new ocean motor , and we were therefore ready to hope that the inexorable decision of Professor Peirce against it would prove erroneous . But time certainly seems in this case inclined to confirm the analyst , rather than the inventor . There is a popular sympathy also with rebellion , and lovers of freedom cheer on those who rebel against the rule of the mathematicians . It is not long since we heard one of the most acute and brilliant essayists of our country expressing his sympathy and hopes of success for one who was making an // attack upon Newton 's Principia . We at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a publication of opinions which were subject to be controverted , but a contribution to knowledge which is undeniably true . He , therefore , who attacks the Principia does not show his courage and originality of thought , but simply displays his ignorance . That the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles is not a matter of opinion . It can not be debated , even if one could be found so ignorant as to doubt its truth . From this certainty in mathematical knowledge , and from the rareness of such ability and taste as lead a man to high attainments in it , the loneliness of the position of him who achieves some new triumph in this field seems to us peculiarly sublime . It was not without profound emotion that we read the close of Hamilton 's preface to his work on Quaternions , where he gives thanks " above all to that Great Being , who has graciously spared to him such a measure of health and energy as was required for bringing to a close this long and laborious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally of his exaltation above men , and his dependence upon God . It is the same true spirit of the geometer which led Pythagoras , twenty-three hundred years earlier , to offl*r a hecatomb in gratitude to the gods for the discovery of a single new proposition in regard to the right triangle . And if the world should stand for twenty-three hundred years longer , the name of Hamilton will be found , like that of Pythagoras , made immortal by its connection with the eternal truth first revealed through him . The genuine spirit of Mathesis is devout . No intellectual pursuit more truly leads to profound impressions of the existence and attributes of a Creator , and to a deep sense of our filial relations to him , than the study of these abstract sciences . Who can understand so well how feeble are our conceptions of Almighty Power , as he who has calculated the attraction of the sun and the planets , and weighed in his balance the irresistible force of the lightning ? Who can so well understand how confused is our estimate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret laws which guide the hosts of heaven , and combine the atoms on earth ? Who so well // can understand that man is made in the image of his Creator , as he who has sought to frame new laws and conditions to govern imaginary worlds , and found his own thoughts similar to those on which his Creator has acted ? An unjust prejudice has attributed a petrifying influence to these studies , and they have been thought to render men indisposed towards spiritual views . But in truth , the charge of atheistic tendency brought against science betrays a lack of faith in the accnser . He that believes in a Creator , and in our sonship to that Divine Builder , must believe that any approach to truth brings us nearer to God , or at least that the knowledge of truth can not cause any separation between us and Him . The genuine spirit of science is also one of philanthropy . The great discoverers in science have always had an unconquerable desire to teach others the truths which they had learned . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their labors crowned with fame . Those eagerly solicitous for fame have not been the true leaders in scientific discovery , while those VhO have really made the greatest advances in science have always shown the most intense eagerness to lead others to the same knowledge . There is something in the joy of discovering truth which is peculiarly unselfish , and yearns to impart the like joy . At the same time , the pursuit of mathematical science makes its votary appear singularly indifferent to the ordinary interests and cares of men . Seeking eternal truths , and finding his pleasures in the realities of form and number , he has little interest in the disputes and contentions of the passing hour . His views on social and political questions partake of the grandeur of his favorite contemplations , and , while careful to throw his mite of influence on the side of right and truth , he is content to abide the workings of those general laws by which he doubts not that the fluctuations of human history are as unerringly guided as are the perturbations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliance on the counsels of the Eternal Will , that cause the man of science sometimes to appear indifferent to the interests of his race , on which meanwhile his most earnest thoughts may be fixed , // and for which his most laborious efforts may be undertaken . The usual records of history may take little note of his achievements , but they at length make their mark upon the progress of human society . The school of Plato has advanced the interests of the race as much through geometry as through philosophy . The modern engineer , the navigator , the astronomer , build on the truths which those early Greeks discovered in their purely speculative investigations . And if the poetry , statesmanship , oratory , and philosophy of our day owe much to Plato 's divine Dialogues , our commerce , our manufactures , and our science are equally indebted to his Conic Sections . Later instances may be abundantly quoted , to show that the labors of the mathematician have outlasted those of the statesman , and wrought mightier changes in the condition of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriot , but we claim that he is worthy of equal honor . All seekers after truth are in reality working together for the human race , in whatever department they labor . But if one is a sincere seeker , while the other is but a selfish aspirant , who shall compare their worth ? The scientific results attained during the French Revolution , by men who stood aloof from the deadly contest , were of more value to the world than all which was accomplished by the most triumphant selfish demagogues . The discoveries of Newton have done more for England and for the race , than has been done by whole dynasties of British monarchs ; and we doubt not that in the great mathematical birth of 18*3 , the Quaternions of Hamilton , there is as much real promise of benefit to mankind as in any event of Victoria 's reign . We have alluded to the value of such triumphs of science to the commerce and manufactures of men , and we might add that their value is still greater to the intellectual wants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple knowledge that such achievements are possible to man . We are all kindred to the great spirits of all times . It is this that gives us our interest in heroic deeds . No soul is so low but that the example of virtue touches it with a sacred fire , - no heart so dead but that the recital of an act of heroism will arouse it to a quicker pulse ; and , in like manner , no man is // of so humble powers as not to glow with just pride on hearing of the signal triumphs of human research . The knowledge that such attainments are possible to souls still dwelling in these heavy garments of the flesh , shames the indolent , encourages the studious , and fills every heart with a just pride , which says , " This was the achievement of a man , and I too am a man . " The Mathematics are usually considered as being the very antipodes of Poesy . Yet Mathesis and Poesy are of the closest kindred , for they are both works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fiction ; and the Mathematics have been called , by an admirer of them , the sublimest and most stupendous of fictions . It is true ; they are not only *c*O*oL9 , learning , but woicqou , * , a creation . In looking over Hamilton 's eight hundred pages on Quaternions ( for we will not pretend to say we have read them ) , nothing has seemed to us more remarkable than the fertility of the imagination which for thirty-four years has been employed in building so magnificent , so complicated , yet so simple and grand , a portico before the great temple of science . The Imagination has been defined by many late writers as a higher power than the Fancy ; and this distinction is just , so far as regards the powers themselves . Yet we can not but regret , that , in drawing it , we are left without a common term which shall include all which was formerly embraced in the Greek-derived fancy and the Latin-born imagination . We need a general expression for that action of the faculties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning , but in image-ination , or phantasy-making . We were made in the image of our Creator , and are ourselves creators , by virtue of this power of imagination , which , in its highest sense , gave us birth . The world about us is the pattern which suggests ideas to us , and stimulates us to create anew after the pattern shown us there . At first , our imitation is literal and servile , scarce more than a repeating from memory the lessons of the school of life . But as we increase in power , we cease to imitate any farther than every act of creation is imitation , and we pour forth our own ideas and our own feelings by the same modes in which the Eternal // and Infinite Spirit has taught us truth , or appealed to our hearts . The mind has three modes of action . It receives and remembers impressions ; it creates and communicates similar impressions ; it compares and judges those impressions . The first mode of action constitutes perception and memory ; the second , fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fancy and imagination act , also , in a twofold manner . Sometimes they create with a simple reference to the sentiment or feeling which they would embody , and then their action is called Art . Sometimes they create with sole reference to reasoning or criticism upon their results , and this constitutes Science , of which Mathesis is a branch . Mathematics and Poetry are , therefore , the utterance of the same power of imagination , only that in the one case it is addressed to the head , in the other , to the heart . Our meaning may be illustrated in a familiar way by a reference to the simplest geometrical form , - the straight line . The great Architect of the heavens and earth has used the straight line but sparingly in creation ; yet there are sufficiently numerous examples of it , and approximations to it , to suggest the idea to the mind . Fancy then builds the idea of a straight line with threefold purpose ; - first , as an element in useful arts ; secondly , as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an element in scientific demonstration . The poetical use of the straight line is familiar , even in our most common and every-day speech ; the mouth of every man is accustomed to use figures drawn from it . The words right , rectitude , straightforward , direct , indirect , and the like , when used in a moral sense , are , in fact , abridged metaphors drawn from a straight line . The man of integrity aims straight for his mark , without deceptions and false pretences , and all the words which we have quoted contain in their very form an allusion to this . In mathematical science , the straight line is a conception employed for very different purposes , as constituting the sides of triangles , the radii of circles , and the like . But in whichever way the conception is used , it is the same power of imagination which pictures to the fancy the line going straight from point to point , turning neither to the right nor left . The conception // THE IMAGINATION IN MATHEMATICS . must be equally clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one than for the other . To rise from this simplest example to higher walks of poetry , let us take Milton 's imagination , as displayed in the Paradise Lost . The poet pictures to us the forms of angels , both of those that fell and those that kept their first estate , - depicts their state in the heavenly courts , and in the flaming billows of the abyss . Here is a creation , by the poet , of material forms , acting under new material laws , subject to blows without being crushed , subject to flames without being consumed . In like manner , only with vastly more precision , the mathematician creates new material worlds , subject to new conditions . Having learned most accurately by what laws the Supreme Creator formed and governs the visible earth and heavens , the mathematician learns how to imagine matter subjected to other laws than these , and is able to state , with absolute precision , what wonld have been the effect had those other laws prevailed . He adds thus to his faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving that no other laws could have produced so harmonious a world as this . The mathematician can go further than this . The poet req nires , for his fancy , material forms . He must speak of floods and flames , of rocks and trees , of earth and air and sky , because he utters the language of feeling , and feeling is excited only through the medium of some spoken or written symbol , or in presence of some tangible fact . Emotions can not be aroused by what is abstract and essentially invisible . Even our love towards Him whom we are bound to love with all our hearts and all our strength , is called out either by the beauty , magnificence , and beneficent arrangement of these works of His hands , or else by the gracious words that fell from the lips of Him through whom God was manifested in the flesh . Abstract definitions of the Divine Being never could have awakened a feeling in our hearts . Poetry and eloquence must therefore deal in things sensible , visible , or tangible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions , figures drawn from sense . But the mathematician can sweep away all thought of // July , matter , and revel in the creation of forms of abstract beauty , with a delight made keener , it is true , by the recollection of the beauty which the Creator has embodied around us , but yet capable of being enjoyed in and for itself . By far the greater part of the most beautiful curved lines that have been invented and investigated by the mathematician have never been drawn by him upon paper . Whole treatises have been written on curves the most curious and interesting in their properties , which have existed only in the imagination of the geometer , or in the trackless realms of space . The laws of mathematics are independent of this material world . Nay , the mathematician goes farther than this . He ventures to imagine the non-existence of matter . Bolder in his flights than Milton or Dante or Bunyan , whose dreams of things celestial and things infernal were still patterned after things on earth , the geometer throws away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their existence . He imagines himself to be alone , separated not only from earth and heaven , but from all memory of material things . " Now , " he says to himself , " let me , in imagination , create a world , in which I shall embody no recollection whatever of earthly things . I will not borrow anything from memory , except the mere * . ideas of number , time , and space . I will retain my own consciousness of power , and then I will see what sort of world I can build in my fancy . " This is a bolder flight of imagination than that of any poet that ever lived . And yet it has been taken by one of our own mathematicians , and with success . No man , of course , can follow him in his flight , except one who has been fitted for it by long and arduous training ; but those who are thus prepared tell us that Professor Peirce has succeeded in showing that from our a priori conceptions of form , number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation intrusted to us , to create a world similar in its plan to this , - that our earthly chemistry , mechanics , electricity , and z&amp;ilogy are thus foreshadowed in our ideas of number , space , and time . Thus he shows that our minds are in the likeness of our Creator 's , - that our thoughts are kindred to his . Thus he demonstrates that true science is a handmaid to Christian faith , and is one of the potent agencies operating // with that Divine plan which would reconcile erring and rebellious men to their loving Father . But while we exalt the office of the mathematician , we would not forget that imagination under his control is limited in its sphere . He deals only with Force , Space , and Time . Thought , Emotion , Feeling , and Character , - all that relates to spiritual natures in themselves is beyond his jurisdiction . It is here that one distinction between the mathematician and the poet lies . But the greatest difference between the two lies in this , that , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fictions , those of the mathematician have a real and necessary existence . The poet 's creation , if it have any value , must be natural ; that is , must be formed after some clear and harmonious conception developed in a symmetrical and consistent manner . It must b&amp;possible ; we do not mean possible under existing physical laws , but possible under some conceivable law . When a poet steps beyond this , he becomes absurd ; his character or scene is self-contradictory , and can not be considered as of any worth whatever . In other words , the poet is limited to conceiving what is conceivable , and can not conceive of what is inconceivable ; a very shallow truism it may be thought . Yet , truism though it be , it can not be affirmed of the geometer and analyst . The mathematician is not limited to conceiving what is conceivable , and he does conceive of what is inconceivable . Nay , while the imaginary beings and imaginary scenes of the poet are so called because they can be imagined , the imaginary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined . Whatever the mathematician really imagines , is not imaginary , but real . Three points in one straight line are readily imagined , and really exist , because the points are only places , and if one of three stakes which the engineer drives to mark the places is out of the line , the place in which he ought to have driven it no less exists . So every line , straight or curved , contains a row of innumerable points , and each point is but a position in space , indestructible and eternal . The beautiful curves investigated by the geometer , but never drawn , really exist at every point of universal space , and although they are in one sense the creation of his fancy , in 20 // another sense they are uncreated , and from eternity to eternity unchangeable . They are the creation of his fancy , because they are not existent in matter ; and although some of them are suggested by the forms of material things , - as the sphere , for example , is suggested by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upto the vault of blue above us ,  --  yet others are unlike anything in creation , and nothing has ever been presented to the senses which could give even a hint towards their construction . They are evolved wholly from the thought of the mathematician , the pure fabrication of his fancy . Yet they are uncreated and eternal realities , - forms in space , which are in their own nature self-existent and indestructible . But the imaginary lines and points of the mathematician are those which can not be imagined , - those which would be required to fulfil absurd conditions . We can conceive that such imaginary quantities may be of real meaning , from a consideration of the somewhat analogous case of negative quantities . To a child it seems utterly absurd to talk of subtracting 4 from 3 , and finding a remainder of -1 . This remainder of -1 , one less than nothing , is to the child a perfectly inconceivable quantity . Yet to adults it is not only coiiceivable , but sensible ; especially if it be in the shape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temperature below zero when our fuel is gone . In these cases the absurd question , leading to the absurdity of speaking of anything less than nothing , conceals a real question , to which we obtain a real answer , in an absurd form . In a somewhat analogous manner , every absurd geometrical question contains a concealed real question , to which an absurd answer can be obtained concealing a real answer . If , for instance , we should speak of the situation of a town within ten miles from Boston , and yet within fifteen miles of Philadelphia , the absurdity of the thing would be unpardonable in the writer of a tale . Yet the mathematician will readily fix the position of such a town for us , and tell us how far it is from New York . This is a familiar illustration ; but it is true , in general , that no question is too absurd for the geometer to answer . He has a set of symbols prepared , by which he can designate lines drawn in any inconceivable way // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those which are conceivable . He will measure the angles of a triangle , in which one side is longer than the other two put together ; tell at what inclination to set a flag-staff so as to have its top higher from the ground than the whole height of the pole ; and describe for you the situation of a straight line which turns a corner . It may seem that this is mere childish folly , - that this imaginary calculus can only be the amusement of a mathematician 's leisure . By no means . This conception of the inconceivable , this measurement of what not only does not , but can not exist , is one of the finest achievements of the human intellect . No one can deny that such imaginings are indeed imaginary . But they lead to results grander than any which flow from the imaginations of the poet . The imaginary calculus is one of the master keys to physical science . These realms of the inconceivable afford in many places our only mode of passage to the domains of positive knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light upon light . And in all modern researches into electricity , magnetism , and heat , and other subtile physical inquiries , these are the most powerful instrnments . Indeed , Hamilton 's Quaternions may be considered in one light as a branch of the Imaginary Calculus . This allusion to the book whose title we have placed at the head of our article reminds us that we have not yet given any description of its contents . It is with hesitation that we endeavor to do this . The truths of mathematics are with difficulty translated into the ordinary forms of language ; and the most successful attempts will convey but a faint idea . Geometry in general might be defined as the science of form , treating of all imaginable shapes . Modern geometry goes , however , farther than this , and treats of all the relations of space to itself and to its parts . Algebra was originally an extension of the art of numbers . Its fundamental conceptions , however , imply the element of time ; and Sir W. IR . Hamilton , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time analogous to Geometry , the science of Space . He was led to this attempt by a singular passage in Kant , who speaks of Time and Space as foundations of the a priori sciences . // From Algebra and Geometry combined sprang Trigonometry , or the arithmetic of sines . In this beautiful branch of Mathesis the chief machine for producing results consists of the three words sine , tangent , and secant . These words stand for numerical quotients obtained from dividing one side of a right triangle by another side . Their value evidently depends on the shape of the triangle , and not upon its size . By means of these quotients arranged in a table for every variety of right triangle , the calculation of all figures which can be subdivided into triangles is rendered exceedingly simple . The essence of Analytical Geometry consists in conceiving lines and surfaces as the dwelling-place of points , and then expressing by algebraic language the whereabouts of a point in a manner which shall be at once loose enpugh to allow the point to be in any part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forbid its being anywhere else . The Differential and Integral Calculus imagines the point as wandering about in its prescribed limits , and from the law of its motion at each instant of its path would detect the peculiar character of the line in which it moves , or from the character of the line deduce the law of the motion of the point . No person would infer from these definitions of wellknown branches of mathematics the true extent of their field , or the energy and yet versatility of their powers . Let none therefore think slightingly of Hamilton 's Quaternions from the description which we will now attempt to give . A line in its full signification does not signify merely length , but direction also . The distance from Boston to Albany is not only 200 miles , but 200 miles west . In like manner , from Albany to New York is 160 miles south . The sum of the two journeys is , therefore , 240 miles southwest . In like manner , a Bostonian , wishing to go to New York , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ westing from his 240 miles southwest journey , and would have a remainder of 160 miles southern journey to perform . These are the new significations which Quaternions impose upon the words Addition and Subtraction . Two sides of a triangle are in this calculus equal to the third , and the difference of two is likewise equal to the third . // TURNBULL ' S LIFE PICTURES . But it is the new interpretation of Division that gives a name to Hamilton 's new mathematical engine . A quotient is the representation of the ratio or relation of two quantities to each other . But the relation of two sides of a triangle to each other requires for its complete expression at least four ( quater ) numbers . One number is required to express the relative length of the two sides ; another to express the angle which they make with each other ; and two more are required to express the position of the plane of the triangle , - what angle , for instance , it makes with the meridian and what with the horizon . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that a line has direction as well as length , that has built this eternal monument to the glory of Hamilton of Dublin , which must command the admiration even of those who appreciate more easily the labors of Hamilton of Edinburgh .
