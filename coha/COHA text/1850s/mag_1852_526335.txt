THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION . A NAME almost unknown to the people of the United States has been presented to them by the Democratic Convention , for election to the Presidency . It ' they accept this name , they will find but one example in history to be their parallel . A certain Roman Emperor , on the eve of a consular election , recommended his horse to the suffrage of the people , who very promptly elected him ; and the parallel is made complete when we read , that the Roman Consul of those days was a kind of political beast of burden , who carried the Emperor , very much as this person , if elected , will carry his backers of the Convention . The nominee of the Convention may , for aught is known , be a very suitable person to represent and execute the sovereign will of " the most intelligent and powerful people in the world ; " but the chances are a million to one against it . For ourselves , we are compelled to plead ignorance . Our information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we regret that we can not give our readers an account of the " public life and services " of this imperial candidate . It is a fault to be amended , that we have hitherto contented ourselves with the ordinary range of our natural vision in contemplating the political eminences of the day . Until now it has not seemed necessary to use the glasses or the diligence of an antiquary , or to have the extended personal acquaintance of a census agent , to be familiar with the imperial candidates of Democracy . Would it not be a better policy in future , to make the Democratic nomination the prize of an Union lottery ? Such a plan would offer unspeakable advantages . Seriously , we recommend the measure to our Democratic friends . Let the duty of a Convention be understood only the settlement of a creed or platform , and the appointment of a lottery committee : let the funds of subscription , which would amount to several millions , be applied to the election of the fortunate drawer of the prize . It would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regulai- rank and file . These are already secure . The " party " vote blind ; they rarely perplex themselves with the " merits " of a nominee ; and if they wish to know something of the opinions of the man whom they are placing at the head of the Union , they can read them the platform of the Convention . Upon the whole , it is difficult to say which of the two are most worthy of our pity , ( and pity is akin to contempt , ) the Democratic candidates or their constituents at home . Messrs . Buchanan , Cass , and Douglas were men of known political opinions ; they represented each a great section of the party . They were men of ability , and had each of them rendered certain services to the party ; but it was for the very reason that they were eminent and influential , they could not obtain the nomination . Let Democratic Senators labor never so earnestly in the public service , let them equal Calhoun in counsel and Taylor in the field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Machiavels of Democracy do not wish to be controlled , but only to control ; they desire not to have a master , but an assiduous servant . The true masters are the political jobbers and convention mongers , who stand midway between the people and the government . These are the men who construct the platform and select the candidate . Which of the two passions , pity or contempt , is fittest to be exercised toward the candidates of the Democratic party , and their constituents among the people i Pity for the fate of genius and ability , wasted iii a fruitless and disgraceful contest , or contempt for the dog-like fidelity with which they maintain the political prejudices of a managing constituency who can not distinguish an idiot from a statesman ? Is it pity we are called upon to exercise towards that blind and silly constituency who take the bread out of their own mouths and give it to the foreign artisan , not from an im pulse of charity , but of mistaken selfishness , and who with equal enthusiasm appoint to the Presi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse " of a Convention ? The wire pullers of the Convention are shrewd calculators . The stake for which they played is the expenditure by themselves of the fifty millions of revenue , and fifty more of influence , of the central Government . They would not have risked any thing to the danger of such a prize . They knew their constituency , and acted upon that knowledge . It is they , and not we , who have fixed the character of the Democratic party . The proceedings of the Convention have disclosed a fact of singular importance to be known , not only by the people of this country , but by all the world : namely , that a Democratic President of the United States is not in any case elected by the people . The Democratic suffrage is for the " horse " of the Convention , and not for the candidate and favorite of the people . It is not necessary that this " horse " should he a " blood : " he is not expected to run : it is the Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a trial of strength between the Whig Cai*didate and the Democratic Convention : surely , the Democratic constituency do not vote for a " horse ; " it is more creditable to them to suppose they vote for a Convention . A Democratic nomination and election to the Presidency has ceased to be a matter of self-gratulation to any man . The managers of the party find no difficulty in forcing their candidate upon the voters . He is accepted without inquiry , with acclamation . Franklin Pierce , the nominee of the Convention , will be voted for by myi'iads who will not have known his name till they read it on the ticket . Republicanism , like other forms of government , has its farcical side ; and that farcical side is precisely the Democratic party . Even were the suppression of the national industry an article of our creed , we should still be loath to find ourselves in the ranks of such a long-eared constituency ; but , as it is , we cease to be astonished at their doctrines , when we consider that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who exercise no knowledge of men , will be as little likely to vex themselves with the merits of things : if they can not tell a Douglas or Buchanan from a " horse , " they must find it equally nice to " tell a hawk from a handsaw . " If they receive with equal enthusiasm the war hawl&amp; of Illinois or the handsaw of the Baltimore Cabinet makers , we may easily believe they are quite as philosophical in regard to opinions as in regard to men , and will receive the very antiquated politics of a Virginian delegation as readily as they accepted their very new and modern candidate . Northern politicians with a Southern policy have received the name of " dough-faces , ** from the facility , we suppose , with which they receive impressions . They have had this appropriate name applied to them because they accepted a Southern Presidential candidate , himself a Southern man . Now since the Virginian delegation were the nominators of the " horse " of the Convention , we shall have to call the Northern men of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the characteristic of the man , the mirror and the orator of reason ; and where there is neither manliness nor reason , there is no face at all . We were by no means angry or vexed with the Northern men when they accepted a Southern candidate , put forward by Southern men : there was reason and justice in that ; there was , if not courage and power , at least discretioii and running . But when a Virginian delegation offers a " horse , " and that horse not a Virginian blood of the ancient pedigree , but absolutely a " pony** from the Canada line , a horse like the consular horse of Commodus , to be voted for because the Emperor willed , we are compelled for dough-face to substitute " no-face , " and set down the " unterrified " as a constituency of a very low facial angle . The Democratic party are a very grave and serious body of citizens , and of all places in the Union we find the centre of their gravity in Virginia . Virginia nominates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . In fact , the gift i*taken as a favor , and the North will not look it in the mouth . Three years ago it was a problem among politicians " to find a principle of union for the Democratic party . " The different sections of the party were supposed to be irreconcilably at variance . In the North , abolitionism ; in the South , nullification . In Pennsylvania , a protection for coal and iron , opposed by all other sections . In the West , appropriations for rivers and harbors , opposed by the Eastern and Southern sections . In one part , agrarian Jacobinism , in another , old-fashioned aristocracy . In // the North , Van Burenism ; in the South , Caihounism . It was a situation which no genius could resolve , no authority overcome . In the midst of this hopeless confusion started up " Young America , " brandishing the sword and firebrand of foreign war , demanding die annexation of Cuba and of Mexico , and swearing to eject all gray hairs from office , though they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions were thrown together into the caldron at Baltimore on the first of June . The demand of the Macbeths of the Convention for a satisfactory apparition was urgent and severe . " Though you untie the winds , and let them fight Again*t the churches ; though the yesty waves Confound and swallow navigation up ; Though bladed corn be Jodged ; Though castles topple on their warders ' heads ; Though palaces do slope* . Even till destruction sicken , Answer us what we ask . " The question asked was , " Who shall he the candidate l " Four days and nights the inferior wizards danced about the caldron , and chanted their lying incantations in vain . The candidate would not appear . On the fifth day , the ilecate of Democracy , the witch of the Old Dominion , came forward , and with a motion of her wand called out of the fire and smoke , not the apparition of " Young America , " " a bloody child , " torn prematurely from the womb of the future ; nor yet a show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last " ( like the first ) " with a glass , " not of water we presume , " in his hand . " The apparition that arose before the Macbeths of the Convention was a less imposing apparition , the figure of a consular horse . " There are two orders of men eligible and available for an office which has become a prize of contending factions . The first of these orders we find represented by those powerful and exalted characters , in whose capacious intellect and consistent conduct ap . pears always the middle term of wisdom , the greatest good of all . In these men , extremes are reconciled by the overruling ideas of national unity and brotherhood . The second of these orders is the mocking image of the first . Like death , it offers the reconciliation of silence in action , and neutrality . The application of one of these neutral conductors to the opposing electricities of a Convention , produces a flash of surprise and a thunder of approbation , and the result is , a caput mortuum , or dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sought , but found only in the greatness and originality of one man . The futility of a Convention without dignity , either in its members or its ideas , is finely illustrated , and its remedy suggested , by an authentic narrative of ancient history . The magnates of Media having to elect a chief , and no person of sufficient eminence appearing among them , it was agreed that the horses of the nobility should be brought together at sunrise , and the master of the beast that neighed first be made king . It would have been an incredible saving of words , toil , and vexation of spirit , had it been agreed by the delegates of the Baltimore Convention to adopt a similar expedient . Each candidate should have been requested to send an ass to the Convention , and the animal that soonest gave forth a bray , in presence of the assembled Democracy , should have been declared the candidate : we mean , of course , by proxy . The moment of expectation intervening between the leading up of the animals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the native eloquence of the speaker would call down , as on other occasions , that hearty thunder , the true Vex Populi Vox Dei , which expands and fires the souls of all true Democrats . As affairs now stand , the principal difficulty of a Convention is to keep the candidates , or t'heir proxies , from braying too soon : now , by the Median method , it might be agreed that no bray should be esteemed of any account , unlest given in full convention . The argument for a representative government has hitherto rested mainly upon a popular choice of rulers . It was supposed that a national party holding certain opinions , and composed of several millions of independent persons , would make an infallible choice of men for the great offices of state . had the " diffusion of knowledge " been less perfect than it is at present , this wo*ild probably have been the case ; but such are the facilities and completeness of the great steam liar VOL . XVI . *O . II . 9 If the kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strenuous about the palaces . // of modern times , it is next to impossible for the most heroic virtue or the most transcendent wisdom to be known out of a small immediate circle , where its influence is directly felt . No sooner is a truly great name presented to the people for their suffrages , a tide of calumny , kept full by the liars of the press , is poured out , to soil and blacken his reputation over the entire continent . The most infamous anecdotes are invented and put in circulation . Every action of his life is turned into ridicule and shame . No reputation can endure such treatment . Friends grow weary of defending , enemies are never weary of abusing . The commendation of great actions soon fatigues the hearers : it is the same old tale ; while calumny is ever new , fresh , and inventive . Hence it is , that in the Democratic party , which consists of that part of the population who are most easily imposed upon , especially by their own press , it has at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services to elevate a man to high offices of state . The Democracy elects , not selects . The choice is made for them by a Convention , and the press put in motion to convince them that it is a good choice . They vote , however , with but little regard to the merits of the candidate ; with as little , doubtless , as the Convention itself . In fact , as there is no means of arriving at a decision , it may appear , in one aspect , a proof of sense in them , that when they have no means of judging , they leave the judgment to others . It is certain , the founders of the Republic did not anticipate the system of election matured by the Anti-American , or Jacobinical party . All the provisions of the Constitution rest upon the supposition of a high degree of popular intelligence and judgment , such as existed when it was framed . They did not anticipate the formation of a retrogressive party , that should draw its strength from popular ignorance , and lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic . What they did not anticipate , they could not provide against : namely , the operations of such a party in the management of Presidential elections . They would not have belicved the political prophet who should then have told them that the Presidency would by and by be filled with as little regard to the character of its incumbent as if it were a throne ; that an entire third of the people would come in time to think as little of the character and personal force of their President , as if they were the subjects of a German Elector or of a King of England . Indeed , it might be well agitated by the Democratic party , what need of a living man in the office of President ? Why not a President of brass or Lignum Vitce ? Could not the press be put in operation to eulogize President Pinchbeck , as well as President Jones or Brown l Would not his Excellency Lignum Vitce make as good a figure in the White House as his Excellency the great Ass ' ? Millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believing they are gods ; but it is a less distant stretch of imagination to fancy a brazen Excellency to be a man . It has become a very current and popular maxim with the managers of the Democratic party , that there are thousands of men quite equal to the Presidential office ; and that the only condition about which we should perplex ourselves , is the docility of the incumbent . Doubtless the managers are right . There are a great number of persons , able and willing , for a fair consideration , to sign their names to public documents , to sit silent at a council table , to veto the bills of a hostile majority , to install in office , and eject from office , the friends and enemies of the government . All these duties , and the message , are exceeding easy , and would be readily performed by almost any person who should be elected to perform them . In case . of difficulty or failure of judgment , there are always enough helpers and advisers near a President of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs but one virtue , docility . Now , docility being the sole requisite for a Presidential candidate , we are not at all surprised at the opinion of Democratic manag*rs , that " a thousand men ' * may be found fully equal to the Presidential office ; for , if there is a striking trait of their party , it is this same excellent virtue of docility , to that degree that we find them accepting their opinions and their candidates entirely from a Convention . The political ignorance of the Democratic constituency , in all parts of the Union , is in nothing more astutely illustrated than in the facility with which they break into factions under the influence of local demagogues and fanatics . In fact , they are but a larger illus // tration of ' a woman 's convention , into which each member carries her private affairs , as if it were a thing of public utility and interest . To this confusion comes in aid the very docility so much admired ; which is of local as well as of general value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse of the Convention , begins by splitting the party into an hundred local docilities : that is to say , fanatical and blackguard factions . It is a fatal necessity we suffer under in a representative form of laws , of judging the people by the manner of men whom they select for office . If they select powerful men , of great experience and intelligence , tried in public business , and staunch supporters and originators of a national policy , we judge that people to be intelligent and observing , and we are sure each one has given in his vote with a distinct knowledge of its merit and importance . If , on the other hand , we see them electing a convention horse , a creature of which they know little and care less , we are struck with surprise ; but when we hear the same constituency directing their representatives " to collect the revenue in order merely to spend it , and to let national matters alone , " our problem of wonder is solved ; for , that the dull should elect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is equally natural that they should become the prey of jobbers . and faction mongers , a class of men who especially abound in the Democratic party . These men , finding that the only political knowledge required of them is to know the measures of the Whigs , and the only political action , for the most part , to oppose them , have leisure enoubh left for that more important and difficult department of demagoguism , the management of jobs and elections . We are compelled to say that , however dear to us the republican form of government , the condition into which it would quickly be reduced by the rapacity and falsehood of these schemers , were they left for any great length of time to their own counsels and machinations , would lead us to prefer a free life in a wilderness , with no government at all . For the jobber , considered strictly as a man of business , an agent employed in negotiations , we are obliged to entertain a certain respect ; he is a useful , indeed an indispensable man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government and all citizens who have business with the government . He is the manager of contracts , and saves the time and labor of Congress committees , by performing himself the entire duty of a committee , and enabling the representatives of the people to give their undivided attention to the composition of speeches and the forwarding of their private interests . We would not therefore advocate the suppression of these middlemen , but we would have them restricted to their duty as above stated , and not allowed to assume the responsibility of several millions of Presidential votes . This is jobbing on too large a scale . We remark upon it , as the regular Democratic platforms remark upon the doctrine of internal improvement : as a system excellent in the detail and in moderation , but bad when it swallows up all the revenue , half the franchise , and two or three neighboring countries . A jobber of this stamp is the Robin of jobbers , as we have it in Mother Goose : " Rohin thinks robbin ' is nothing but jobbin ' ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives more dinners than twenty rich sinners , But those who dine with him are never the win-ners : He 'll swallow a steamer or I am a dreamer , Dine off of Cuba and Mexico too , And ' sup up the Capitol whole in a stew. *** To the unrefi*cting of our own party it may seem a reason for exultation , that our Democratic opponents have reduced their constituencies to such a level of baseness , and betrayed their disrespect for them so grossly in the Convention . Let these unreflective persons remember that the Democratic constituencies , by suffering this disgrace to fall upon themselves , have betrayed their incapacity to become Whigs , and have thus very sadly diminish*d our expectations for the enlargenient of our own party . Had the constituencies themselves committed an error , we could have hoped for their future conversion and reform ; since , where there is the strength to do ill , there is the possibility of doing right . But the proceedings of the Baltimore Democratic Convention have betrayed the odious and shocking fact , that the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for good ; and that , * Mother Goose 's Melodies , Political Edition , page 1 . // qwq order , and daily improved upon , by those ment the people are satisfied of his legitiwho prof qwq certain popularity ; all were admitted to be men of capacity and talent : all were in their turn rejected , and a name till then unknown to the people of the United States , excepting as it has been read and forgotten in the senatorial list , was put forward and carried by acclaim . The principle of popular election thus abandoned , it is not at all surprising to read that the main duty of the Convention-agreemen t upon a creed-was immediately abandoned , the majority dispersing , and the rump voting a list of sentiments called a platform , made broad enough , it was supposed , to hold the entire delegation , but which the majority of them unluckily mistook for a pillory , and incontinently fled from , to the arms of their impatient constituencies . The gentleman of the name of Pierce , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vacuum , is said , by those who are personally acquainted with him , to be a person of much respectability . This is the more to be regretted , as the situation is not as happy in that particular as its incumbent . The learned antiquary who supplies us with the subject matter of his biography informs us , that the nominee is a native and citizen of New-Hampshire . That State is now happy in the nativity of the representatives of the two philosophical loci of all nature , the plenum and the vacuum , Mr. Webster representing the fullness , ( plenum , ) and Mr. Pierce , the hollowness or emptiwss , ( vacuum . ) Nature , it is figuratively said , abhors a vacuum ; so does not a Baltimore Convention . On the contrary , they have offered it , by its representative , ( for such , as our learned co-laborer informs us , is Mr. Pierce , ) as a candidate for the Presidency . Mr. Pierce , we learn , with great research , served in the Mexican war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards occupied the " vacancy " of Democratic Senator from New-Hampshire , in Congress ; and here the record shows him voting against the Cumberland Road bill , against the River and Harbor bill , against the Delaware breakwater , against the great road through Georgia , Alabama , and Florida , against the widow of General Harrison , to whom it was proposed to grant relief . It is said his most labored speech was made against the widow . In these votes and speeches Mr. Pierce found himself generally at the extreme point of negation , in company with three or four other representatives of vacuum or negation . There is something uniform and remarkable in the political course of this gentleman . Signalized by nothing in Mexico , he attains a political station in New-hampshire . Faithful to the same destiny in New-Hampshire , he is deputed to represent nothing in the Senate ; where , by a line of consistent opposition to harbors , roads , and widows , he attains the extreme point of the negative . Returning to his native State , he finds himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire more ? Hence the unanimity of the Convention ! They had found the representative of nothing , who had not only done nothing himself , but would compel the whole world to imitate his discreet example . Already the dili*ent antiquaries of the Convention have traced his genealogy to the great Percies , the Hotspurs of Northumberland . It is a trait of the Democratic learned that they delight in genealogies ; it is pleasing to them to consider how far down their heroes have descended from those of the olden time ; to follow the long and gradual decline from a Hotspur of Northumberland , who did every thing , to a Percy of NewHampshire , who does nothing . Fifty years of masterly inactivity in the service of Democracy have qualified the NewHampshire Senator . For aught his countrymen know , he may be an extremely talented , as he is beyond joke , alas ! or dispute , a worthy gentleman , and of " a good old family ; " but the positions he has chosen have forbid the exercise of genius . The absence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative of Negation . If he be a se.cond Webster or Clay , he must be assiduous to hide it . Our political Buddhists , who adore the great Fo , or Nothing* might have selected an idiot for their candidate with equal propriety , if we regard their creed ; but instead of that , they preferred one who for fifty years has suppressed himself in their service . Now , if we were FoYtes , instead of Whigs , we should be at liberty to say , " Mr. Pierce is only one of several thousands of people , who know something of the detail of public business , and are therefore qualified for the Presidency . " But we are not of the FoYte faith , and consequently require a certain superiority of character and talent in a Seacondemned , // as a fruit of the European or despotic heory of government , incompatible with the Constitution and the Republic .

" Country politicians arc advised that our , satirical rhymester , by a strong flaure , has put the friends and factions of the candidates for the candidates themselves . As in this particular he has followed their own great example , he can not be accused of innovation . The absurdities of that congeries of factions miscalled " the Democratic party " would move only pity and derision , were it not for the startling possibility of their success in the election of their candidates . The confidence and unanimity with which they have put forward a candidate without power or popularity , is a symptom worthy of the most serious attention . It reveals the astounding fact , that there are , in the United States , an immense body of citizens who give themselves no thought as to the kind and character of men who are to fill the great offices of state ; only a theore* or a a body who take litical affairs , tic partisan view of powith an utter disregard of national honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-eyed horse is easier to lead and manage than the perfect animal . In regard to those politicians who have undertaken to construct a free-trade , redrepublican faction in the heart of the Democratic party , their defeat has been accomplished precisely in the manner predicted by ourselves in February . The inconsistency of a system of free trade with a hostile opposition to the foreign policy of Great Britain was immediately perceived by the Southern Democracy , whose dependence upon Great Britain is little short of colonial , and rejected by them with indignation . To the annexation of Cuba , if it could be accomplished without involving us with England , they had no objection ; nor would the absorption of Mexico disturb their equanimity ; but the establishment of a Red Republic in France , ireland , and Germany , with ultra-abolition l ) rinciples , and the doctrine of the guillotine , did not strike them favorably . It will consequently become necessary for our disappointed factionists to fix their attention in future upon domestic matters . Like hounds , forbidden to hunt game abroad , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their teeth very hungrily upon the flanks of our native industry . " Young America " gains nothing by alliance with those who , while they break up our commercial relations with the British and Continental powers , apply the torch to our manufactories , and convert us into a nation of marauders by depriving us of the means of honest livelihood If the European powers perfect their newly agitated Continental tariffs , and of their own accord declare war upon the commerce of America , the beggarly doctrine of free trade must perish as it deserves , trampled to death under the heels of the people . We are gradually colonizing and civilizing the States of Mexico and Central America . England must withdraw in season , for she will find it necessary to do this . If her merchants and bankers invest their millions in the transit I rotites of the Isthmus , it is because they con // fide in the skill and industry of our people like the ethics of a Red Republican , in nato make them yield an interest , and not because they look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These foreign investments are of themselves a guaranty of the ultimate withdrawal of England from the territory which she has unjustly acquired . Either by formal treaty with the States of Central America , or by the natural moveinent of colonization , these pseudo British acquisitions must become American . Taken as a whole , the Democratic party at this day presents an unparalleled spectacle of contradiction and absurdity . In the South alone , the native country of free trade , do we find it consistent with itself . The British policy of annexation by war and colonial dependence here rules supreme . In the West , on the other hand , a hostile rivalry with Great Britain upon the ocean would inadvertently compel the South to adopt Whig principles , and either manufacture its own cottons or purchase those exclusively of the North . In the Eastern States , Democracy industriously mortgage5 and beggars itself ; by cutting off protection from the manufactories . In Pennsylvania it attacks and buries alive the coal and iron of its own mountains . In New-York , it originates and maintains a furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " Democratic " policy of free trade that has its root in the excessive culture of cotton . In a word , the Democratic party , considered as a whole , has not a principle upon which it can unite , except the one principle of selfdestruction . Its policy terminates all ways , tional suicide . The election of 1852 will show whether the majority of voters in the United States have , or have not , resigned the right of choosing their rulers , and forming a policy for themselves . If their votes outnumber those of the Whigs , we shall have a President put in office by the jobbers of a Convention , and a national policy made for us by the jobbers of Birmingham and Manchester . We shall have millions expended in salaries upon the sworn enemies of American labor and industry . We shall have a Cabinet fostering border quarrels with Mexico , and covering by its neglect and connivance the aggressions of England upon the States of Central America , while it favors the covetous grasp of the South upon the slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity or genius ; a territory extended but not enriched ; an industrial population driven off to seek ncw homes in the wilderness . It will be a period of confusion and corruption without a parallel in the history of this Republic . The union of such a number of furious and unscrupulous factions , upon no other ground but that of opposition to all and every measure of the Whigs , though it is a topic of the severest satire , should nevertheless be a warning to the Whig* to lay all minor differences aside , and unite in defense of national policy and honor . Let them spare no endeavor to enlighten the misguided intelligence of the people . They haveonly to resolve upon a victory , and they will gain it .
