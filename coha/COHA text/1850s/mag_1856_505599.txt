The overflow ofthe Nile , which occurs in tile latter part of our summer and autumn , is the grand means of enriching the soil . Very little manure is used in Egypt . I Ilave , indeed , seen none applied except the old earth from decaying brick walls of the ancients , which are pounded into dust , and carried in baskets to such points of land as are not sufficiently enriched by the Nile . The Nile water is muddy . Whence the mud comes is a question for solution . Mssch of it is from the wash of the banks thecaselves , and therefore much of the deposit of soil is but a ecu 005A. change from one place to another . Still it is tar. , may draw yOllr own conclusions . To us muddy at Wady Ilalfeb , the second cataract. they sound like those deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand // miles above this point . II am unable to ascertain at what remote part of the river , if any where , its waters are clear and limpid as are our great streams ; and therefore I can not say whence the soil of Egypt has come , though the Blue ( or Black ) River is supposed to yield it rather than the White Nile . The annual deposit of the river on its overflowed lands varies , of course , according to the height of the overflow . On the low laud of Beni Hassan I found the deposit of this year to be about an inch and a half . Other years it is more , and others less . Naturally , the overflow of the river is followed , when it recedes , by a qwq be in Egypt for ten years , and I believe it would be the garden of the world . My last article left the party on their donkeys , I returning from the grottoes and tombs on the Mountain of Osioot . We took a shorter path down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some heavy plunges over steep places , where two Arabs to a lady and a third to the donkey were hardly sufficient to keep them safe from accisowing , and also the pulling up by the roots , of dent . But the foot of the bill was safely the millet , or doom , as well as the cutting of reached at length , and we trotted rapidly across grain with a sickle , in all respects similar to the bridge and into the city again . modern husbandry in Egypt . Here , as elsewhere in Egypt , the traveler The great crop of Egypt is corn , doom and will not fail to observe the process of brickwheat being the most plenty . Doom is of making as now carried on , and be surprised as // well as interested at the new light it gives him in reading the history of the hondage of the Israelites . It was not common among the ancients to hnrn brick . It is no more common now . It is almost incredible , to one who has not visited this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , composed entirely of these unhurned brick - mere Nile mud sundried , which date quite as far back as the time of the children of Israel . Large structures remain , of which every brick bears the name of THOTUMES III. , the supposed Pharaoh of the Exodus . In Dr. Abbott 's collection , in New York , specimens of these may he seen ; and he who is incredulous of the genuineness of these may convince himself hy visiting Egypt , where he may turn hundreds of them over with the point of his hoot , and read the ancient legend . The making of brick , in those days , was much more of a business than now , for the great population of the country doubtless required a constant supply of building material , and the mud was probably then , as now , the chief article in use for this purpose . But aside from this , kings built pyramids of brick , which yet stand , and inclosures of temples , and residences for priests , and city fortifications , and all the other massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There as , therefore , employment enough for the miserable sons of Israel . Douhtless the modern process of hrick-making is similar to that then in use , and a brief explanation of the method , which we saw here and often elsewhere along the river , will serve to make the history of the Israelites more intelligible to many readers . The mud of the Nile is the sole article now in use for Egyptian housebuilding , and this is either roughly plastered up in mud walls , or is shaped in the form of brick , and dried in the sun . I passed by some men , a few days ago , who were building a tomb . It was made of crude brick , and they paused in their work to make their brick , which was done by preparing a bed to hold water , into which they threw mud , and , over all , large quantities of cut straw . This they trod into the mud with their feet , and when the whole was thoroughly mixed , they took out large lumps with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laid down to dry . At another place I saw two men at the same work , with only this difference , that they held in their hands a rude mould , into which they thrust the mud , and from which they almost instantly shook out the brick , and left it to dry in the sun . The tenacity of the Nile mud almost passes description , and until one has his foot in it , he can not fully understand it . That a similar process was used by the ancients , the best evidence is afforded in the accurate painting of one of the tombs at Thebes , which contains a view of the whole machinery of an ancient brick-yard . Men dig the mud , while others dip water in jars and bring it , and others still mould the bricks with a wooden mould , and lay them out to dry . I have paused to speak of this subject here , as ruaasiiiao MAcnINE. // qwq since I have looked up into these skies whose deep blue beauty and unfathomable glory seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascending Lord into their radiant depths-since I have breathed the East wind from Bethlehem , and begin to see clearly my pathway to the cross and the tomb of our Master and Saviour , I say now I realize that he whom I so loved in boyhood , whom I have so mourned in secret in all my years of wandering life , whose lips have whispered to me a thousand times in the solemn nights-that he has seen , with clearer eyes than mine , the grandeur of Egypt , and the olives of the hills of Jerusalem . Did I not tell you once , my friend , that I thought the sky must he lower down over the Holy Land than elsewhere from the crowding hitherward of the footsteps of the angels , and that heaven must be nearer here than our cold Western clime ? It is so , I think ; and already I am where the arch is lower , for I never felt so near him as here . He sleeps-not where we laid him then , but where we laid him last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the congregation of the dead . And he hears not , and he heeds not the roar of the city , the tramp of the thousands , the sounds of warring , wrangling life there . He hears not that , but he did hear me as the morning sun rose up above the Arabian desert and poured his flood of light on this slavish land-he did hear me praying for a blessing on the " old folks at home " on that Thanksgiving morning , and I heard his voice too , from the deep sky . It was not till the sun was far up , and the sounds of Arab life were heard on all sidesof me , that I lost the influence of that morning reverie . The coolness of these Arabs is amusing . It was not enough that we should occupy the Viceroy 's steps with our boat , hut our men erected their poles on lines at the top of them in front of the palace gates , and all manner of clothing , unmentionable articles of ladies ' and gentlemen s apparel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor of Upper Egypt , doubtless much to the edification of the ladies of his harem , who had an opportunity of studying Christian styles of dress and American costumes . Nor was this all . The butcher killed a sheep on the steps themselves , and when I went out to see what was going on , I found the Arab hound actually skinning the animal before he was dead . I was strongly inclined to have him flogged till he understood the meaning of flaying alive . The mails of Egypt go by a curious sort of post . All Egypt is on the Nile , as every one knows , and one line of mail service up and down the river goes through every city and village from Cairo to Assonan . This line is cut into sections , and on each section is a foot runner , who goes over his course three or four times a day , back and forward , meeting the next runner at each end of his section , and passing along from one to the other any letter he may receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are passed singly . I sent my letters to the local governor at Osioot , to be posted in this way ; but he had orders to take special care of me and my wishes , and forthwith dispatched an express with them . This is the method with all governmont letters . They go by dromedary , crossing the desert and avoiding the long bends of the river . It was somewhat strange to follow with my imagination those letters on their wanderings , and I sat that evening thinking of the dromedary carrying an Arab charged with those precious words of affection , crossing the desert back of the lofty hills of Aboufayda , guided by the stars as he hastened northward . In what wild and dark pass of the mountains he might lie down to sleep , who could tell ? What howling wolves or fierce hyenas would follow his steps , who might know ? On what sandy plain , in what Arab tent or hut of Fellab might they rest ! What moonlights would look down on their swift course across the desert-what hot suns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victory ! It was something to have a dromedary express dispatched with one 's letters , and I was content , thinking only that I hoped the envelopes would be kept at home in some safe place , that I might look on them and endeavor thereby to learn something of their eventful travel . As I was returning from the mountain on the previous day , and riding across the plain toward the boat , a mounted officer rode up to me and handed me a small package . They were letters prepared by Latif Pasha to various inferior governors along the upper part of the river , introducing me to their attention , and these subsequently proved of far greater value to me than I supposed possible . They were the means of my becoming acquainted with several Turkish gentlemen of the highest character , and forming two or three friendships that , I trust , will be lasting long after I have returned to America . But of these I shall say more hereafter . The bread was ready . Have I or have I not mentioned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to give the crew of the boat an opportunity to bake bread , which is their sole article of food , and which is always renewed at this point , and again at Esue . The Nile boatman is sui geaeris . There is no other race of men in the world like them . They live a miserable life of hard labor without enough pay to he able to save a farthing , and yet they seem to be always happy . Their songs make the night musical , and all day long , at oars or the tow-rope , they go chanting and singing as cheerfully as if they received thirty instead of three dollars a month , and were well fed and clothed , instead of having to feed and clothe themselves out of this miserable pay . Their food is hut the poorest sort of bread , baked and broken into pieces and dried on deck in the sun . A heap of several bushels of it always lies on the cabin deck , and this is boiled in Nile water , mak // qwq diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but have a momentary glimpse of the splendor of the bill in the light of a setting Egyptian sun , and this was the last night of the autumn , and the winter came on us next morning right gloriously with a flush of gold in the east , and the full-orbed splendor of the sun , and an air balmy as June , and a sky that tempted one heavenward . Pelicans began to be plenty , and this morning we shot two , and in the course of the day half a dozen geese and as many ducks . We made no count of the pigeons that we shot : they were innumerable . There was one day when we were at Negaddeb that we shot three hundred and six , which we distributed to our neighbors in other boats , and gave our men as many as they could eat for three days . All along the river game began to abound , and crocodiles were frequently seen on the sand The d6m palm-tree now appearing on the banks . I shot at several , as all travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but I killed none , as all travelers must say . the palm groves , and the shadoof poles seem to There was one which I came very near to killTHE nOM ANO DATE PALM . // ing . Had he waited for me , I should have hit him . He was sunning himself on a hank , and I crawled quietly toward him ; hut when I got there , he was not there . The trochilus , the hird celebrated as the watching friend of the crocodile , who is said to warn him of the approach of enemies , flew before me with a loud cry , and perhaps alarmed him . I can not say that I verified the story of this bird 's habits and friendship for the hnge water monster , but I have no doubt that in this case he did act as ancient and modern writers say he is in the habit of doing . But he also acted precisely as he and a thousand like him have done every day that I have been on the Nile , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , he would have gone along before me in the same way , with the same sharp , shrill cry . Mr. Curzon , an English traveler , gives the most circumstantial account of the habits of this bird , and his testimony appears sufficient to establish the truth of the story . He states that when he was approaching a sleeping crocodile , the trochilus made a furious noise and flew at the sleeper , pecking him with his bill , and rousing him to a sense of his danger , while he , the author , in place of shooting the animal , paused to admire the sagacity of his small friend and protector . We were at Mensheeb . I had walked along the shore ahead of the boat , and on reaching the village met Suleiman Aga , the local governor , taking a walk with his old uncle along the bank . He was apparently delighted at seeing the face of a stranger , for he said he led a life of imprisonment in his village , and was glad of any relief to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the boat came to the land near the upper end of the village , be came on board and spent an hour with us . While we were lying here , our friends the American missionaries , who were lying near us , bad a difficulty with their servant , who was an impertinent scoundrel , and whom it became necessary for them to discharge . The Governor begged hard to be allowed to thrash him into respectability , but to this , of course , our friends would not consent ; and I have seldom seen a more disappointed man than was Suleiman , after sitting for an hour and hearing the fellow complain of his master , when he was not permitted to put on the bastinado . It is a luxury to some of these governors to thrash a man ; and it is even related of the Defterdar , Mehemet Ali 's son-in-law , that he often whipped men to death for his amusement . But this is not all . It is also a luxury to the men oftentimes to be whipped , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush into the necessity of being punished . " You may give me a hundred if these eggs are not fresh , " says the Fellab , and the clerk of the market breaks three spoiled eggs in succession , and down goes the Fellab and gets his hundred , with fifty to boot . A roving letter of credit on the Nile is a marvelous assistant to one 's traveling com forts , and at the same time affords much amusement in the way of incident . I was not a little amused that same evening at Mensheeb by overhearing a conversation on deck between Abdel-Atti and the sheik of the village . When we left Cairo , among other articles of boat furniture we were particular in ordering a good cat ; but we were sent away with two worthless kittens , both of which found their way into the river within the first week after sailing , and we repeated the order to provide another . It seemed that Abd-el-Atti had directed one to be brought down to the boat , and the sheik was protesting that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitten , not a piece of the skin or tail of a feline animaL The war of words grew furious , and at length the dragoman rushed into the cabin for the firman , and infinite was my amusement to see the government seal exhibited , and condiga punishment threatened if the cat were not forthcoming . It had the desired effect , and the sheik instantly and silently departed , and an hour later a row and general outcry on deck called me out to see five cats , black , white , and yellow , each led by a string , and all now tangled in an inextricable knot , fighting , spitting , and uttering all manner of Arabic sounds , brought for us to select from . We took three , and I may as well pause to record their fate . The yellow one took a flying leap from the boat to the bank , about thirty feet , struck heavily , and fell back into the water . I have forgotten what was the immediate impulse which induced this catastrophe , but the cat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with an unhappy fate . We found a dead rat in a closet , and from the appearance of May 's Indian rubber overshoes , we concluded he died of caoutchouc . He lay on deck dead , when the kitten caught sight of him , and made a dash at him , seized him by the neck , and swung him up and over the rail , and , presto ! rat and cat fell overboard together , and we swept on , leaving them to their fate . The last one was a furious wretch , with the eye of an arch devil , and one day in Nubia I loosened the rope by which he had been tied , and gave him a chance to run . The last I saw of him he was crossing the desert twenty miles below Abou Simbal . I have said but little thus far of our manner of life on the river , preferring rather that it should be guessed at from what I might write . But I find that nothing I have yet said will convey any idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day is one long dream of delight , the night a paradise of beauty . We never weary , yet we do nothing . We have books , but we do not read . We have paper , bat I have not had the courage , until I reached the second cataract , to write . All day long lounging on the divans , we gaze out at the deck or the ever-changing shore , and should the wind fail us for a moment , we amuse ourselves by seeing the cloud of flies that instantly settle down on every thing , and the vain attempts of // the men to escape them . But then we are ourselves glad of a coming breeze again , for they do not long leave the cabin free from their incursions , and once in it , we must move out or drive them out . In fact flies have been our only annoyance on the river . Fleas we at first found plenty and venomous , but they left us after a while , and we had but occasional visits from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some similar abode of the masses . It is not to be denied that we have once in a while , after being carried through the mud in the arms of an Arab , found a small nameless animal on the skin , that shocked our ideas of cleanliness beyond all description . But one learns to submit to this sort of thing with due l ) patience after a while , and we have long ago ceased to regard it with much surprise . But I was speaking of our employments . Yet that is not the word , for we have no employments . Time dies-we do not kill it . If there be no wind , and the boat is tracking , we walk along the shore and shoot whatever we can find , and game is plenty every where , for there is almost no one in Egypt to disturb it . If the wind spring up , a hail fiom the boat calls us ; we jump on board , and are off perhaps for only a mile or two , when we again track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be impossible to say what style or national costume I wear , unless it be a remote approximation to the French blouse-man ; for I wear but a thin pair of linen pants and a blue shirt-nothing else , on my word . With this it is not difficult to follow the example of the Arab sailors and jump overboard at any moment , or wade in deep water after game . Sometimes I follow the men at the tracking-rope , and cross the branches of the river which come down around islands , wading where it is up to my waist , and never thinking of changing my clothes , I push on through villages and fields , to the manifest astonishment of the natives , who are not accustomed to see a Howajji so nearly on a parallel with themselves in dress . Oftentimes I am far in advance of the boat , and then , if I am near a village , I usually sit down in front of a coffeeshop-which is very certain to occupy a prominent point on the river-bank  --  and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently and look on , I take the first pipe offered me , and curl my legs under me as well as I am able ( I begin to have a knack that way ) , and wait the coming of the boat . At other times I push the iReis from his place , which is the top of the kitchen on the extreme bow of the boat , and , as this is altogether the best look-out that I find , Ferraj brinas me cushions from the divan and my chibouk , and , with my gun close at hand , I smoke and watch the river and the shore . From this point I have gotten not a few shots at crocodiles that lay basking in the sunshine ; arid if I have not hit them , it was worth the shot to see the splendid start the fello*vs made as they heard the crack of the gun , and how they leaped into the air and the water with a grand flourish of the tail and a tremendous plash . Hajji Mohammed , the cook , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never sends word to the cabin that he sees one , but on the instant that he gets sight of him , whether near or far oW sends a bullet after him , if it be half a mile . He wastes an awful amount of lead and powder , and gets nothing . But not seldom I have gotten geese and duck from my seat on the kitchen , and Halifa , a capital swimmer , stands always ready to swim off and bring them to me . It is vain on the Nile to attempt late sleeping in the morning . I have usually been on deck at break of day , and almost always on shore before the sunrise . The mornings are delicious beyond expression , and the beauty of the dawn is only equaled by the brief evening twilight . But early as I am out , I am never ahead of our prince of cooks , who sends me a cup of coffee the instant he hears my footstep , and then *oes to work at breakfast , which he makes / / ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KILE BOAT . // Unfortunately a deck plank was up , and , as he rushed ont , he tripped in the hole thus left and went down on deck with a tremendous fall just as he heaved a second time ; and then the poor follow lay frightened and badly hurt in the scuppers . And now I learned the cause of his fright , for I saw that the wound was a trifie . Ilajji Mohammed , the cook , had invited Hassabo to an extra * good supper , and the poor fellow , glad as they all are of a chance to get anything better than sourbread to eat , had accepted the invitation , and overfed himself at the kitch en with sundry relics of fowls and mutton . Now Hassabo is rigid in his observances , and always wash es before and after eating , so that when he had finished his supper ama GAME . he stepped into the small boat , a meal f qwq I sat down to the oars . I remembered all the heavy pulling I had done in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called oars , any one of which will outweigh two long-boat sweeps . I thought specially of two scenes in my past life : one when I rowed against a fierce gale off the north point of Block Island , and the other when , with May wrapped np in oil-cloths and Indian rubber seated in the stern of my boat , I pulled up from the ferry-stairs at Niagara to the foot of the American Fall , and across to the milk-white basin of the Horseshoe . But in neither of those instances , said I to myself , did I hear these hungry jackals that are harking on the shore to-night . Then I sang , and I made the Egyptian darkness ring to Yankee songs , until it occurred to me that I was inviting the Ababdee scoundrels , who are all along that part of the river , and always awake at night watching for chances to rob passers-by on the water ; and so I kept myself quiet , and pulled steadily , and counted stars . There never were half so many visible to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear night since I have been in Egypt , I have seen twelve stars in the constellation of the Pleiades , and one night I saw thirteen distinct ly . But I did not pause long to count stars . I looked northward and pulled southward with a will , and in an hour I saw the red light which we always carry at the end of the high yard , and in half an hour more I was pretty much used-up , and alongside the boat , where every one was sound asleep , and no one knew of my lonesome adventure until they saw the fish lying on deck the next morning . Administering to the diseases of the crew became an every-day matter . Hajji Hassan , the cook 's mate , a tall bony Arab , had never before been in the upper country , and the sun effectually skinned his face , so that be was as miserable an object in appearance as one will meet in a year , and , I have no doubt , was equally miserable in feeling . His head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of other parts that he imagined he had , ached unendurably , and well they might . I applied cooling lotions ( I believe that is the phrase ) , and the next morning be was much better , only needing a mild dose of medicine to complete the cure . My stock was small , for we eschew the use of them ; but a Seidlitz powder would fit the case tolerably well , and I gave him one , explaining before he took it the effervescing character of it . But he did not understand it ; and as he held one glass in his band and I poured the acid in from the other , telling him to drink quick , he raised it to his lips , but the foam touched his nose and he was astounded beyond measure . He dropped the glass as if he were shot , and cried out " Efrit ! efrit ! -A devil ! a devil ! " and no persuasion could induce him to try another . I substituted the half of one without the acid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot , for the first time , a bird that the Arabs consider almost sacred . It is much like our curlew in size , shape , and habit ; but its peculiarity is that it utters a note that the Arab understands to be a distinct address to God : El moulle illek , La skareek illale " The universe is thine , Thou hast no partner ! " This cry is remarkably distinct and musical , esacan. // and we heard it all the evening , in the twilight , across a waste of Halfeli grass , which marked the position of a forgotten city . I know no picture on all the earth 's surface more striking than that of this bird standing erect , in the gloaming , on a mound that covered the palace of a long forgotten prince , and uttering on . the desert wind that simple and sublime tribute of praise to Him who alone knew the history of the dead that lay below . This was the same day that Hassabo 's adventure with the fish occurred , and this was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning I went up into the town with May to see if the bazaars furnished any curiosities worth purchasing , and as we entered the gate of the street of shops we were altogether " taken nback " - if I may use a common phrase-by finding Abd.el-Atti engaged in administering justice , or injustice , which of the two remained *o be seen . He had a ring of thirty or forty persons around him , in the centre of which , prostrate on his face , lay a six-foot Arab , one man sitting on his hack and another on his legs , while two held up his feet to receive the blows that Abd-el-Atti 's hand was raised to give , when I arrived and interrupted the amusement . Thrashing is necessary in Egypt . I am a full convert to this doctrine . The time may come when it will be otherwise , but for the present it is an absolute necessity . Nevertheless I am too much of an American to look on it with any feelings but those of horror , and I always interpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's the row now , Abd-el-Atti ? " " Only whipping a man , Sir . " " For what ? " " Why , Sir , he was ordered by the sheik of the village to get some turkeys for you , and I overheard him telling his partner to pick out the leanest and poorest he could find . I waited till he brought them , and see here what a poor starved lot of animals they are ! He says he has n't any better , and that there are no better in the place . " " How is it ? Ask him again . Let me hear what he says . " The fellow insisted as before . They were the best he had , and there were no better to be had in Girgeb . It had been a bad season for turkeys . They had not thriven any where along the river , and especially here they had suffered from every disease that feathered bipeds are known to inherit . I was half-convinced by the fellow 's earnestness , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two men sitting across you is not the best possible position in which to talk good Arabic . But there was a twinkle in Abd.el-Atti 's eye that weakened my faith in the prostrate Arab . The poor fellow looked up at me , evidently expecting an escape , and he would have gone free if I had not at the moment caught sight of his partner in the crowd , and the scamp looked so knowing that , when Abd-el-Atti said , " Let me VOL . XIII. - No. 75. -Y give him just one , Sir , " I replied , " Do as you please , " and turned away . The Arab howled before the blow came , and it did not reach him , for Abd-el-Atti caught his promise to produce the proper kind of turkeys in the howl , and the rope went by his feet without touching him . Five minutes afterward , the man still lying under the weight of his captors , a lot of large plump turkeys made their appearance , and the man had his pay in full and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our stay at Girgeh , and is well enough to relate , as illustrating a general fact that an Arab will often prefer to be whipped rather than do what is not only correct but just as easy for him to do . It is a common remark that the Fellab will have the money for his taxes ready , but will not hand it over to the collector until he has had one or two hundred blows , boasting afterward howmany it took to make him pay the money which he fully expected and intended to pay before the beating began . Walking on shore , two days after leaving Girgeh , in the morning , I came on the ruins of a village which was evidently Arab , and whose destruction was manifestly violent . Such village-scenes are not uncommon in this miserable land . Not infrequently the inhabitants of one of these mud heaps-they can hardly be called any thing else-rebel against the authority of the Viceroy . More foolish or mad conduct could not be imagined . Entirely destitute of arms , they have no hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after village , galled by the enormous loads of taxes imposed on them , resist and are destroyed , and such ruins as this mark their sad history . I asked an old man , who was at work near the ruin , who destroyed this place , and when ? He answered , " Ibrahim Pasha , two years ago . " Now Ibrahim Pasba rendered his account to an avenging God some eight or more years ago , and the old man was , of course , mistaken in his date or the person . Ibrahim Pasha had a way of destroying villages , a sort of passion that way , and I supposed it possible that the people might attribute every thing of the kind to him as a sort of matter-of-course . There is a town not far from New York where it is said , on good authority , that the people at the last presidential election supposed they were voting for General Jackson , and I fancied this was much the same way . I learned afterward that it was the date only that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible Ibrahim , and yet I have no doubt the verdict of impartial history will be that the same Ibrahim was one of the greatest men of this age . But I contrasted this ruined village , these deserted houses , fallen roofs , burned thatches of doom , and silent streets with the gorgeous tomb in which he lies at Cairo , surpassing in its splendor of marble and gold any work of modern art that I have seen or expect to see ; and I felt-who could avoid it ? - a shudder at the thought of the meeting beyond the grave of the spoiler and the slain ! // As I was walking by the men on the shore one morning , shortly before reaching Gheneh an incident occurred which , while it illustrates the brutal character of an Arab who has a little power , serves also to introduce more particularly than heretofore to the reader 's notice Reis Hassanein , as stupid and poor a specim*n of a Nile captain as could well be found on the river . I do not yet know what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages a man should go through to become captain or commander of a dahabeeb . This much I know , that there are fourteen men on our boat , any one of whom is more competent for the office than the man who fills it , and we have been often tempted to hand him over to a governor and take another in his place . Some difficulty occurred at the tow-rope . I do not know the nature of it , but the first that I saw of it was when Hassabo , the steersman , by the direction of the Reis , turned the boat to the land so as to allow the latter to jump on shore with a large club in his hand , wherewith he made a rush on the row of men who were hauling on the tow-rope , and struck two of them , bringin one to the ground . Had this one been any other man , I do not know that my sympathies would have been so strongly excited , but it was Mohammed Hassan , who was altogether the best man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies when they walked on the shore . At first I thought his knee-pnn broken , and I had a strong notion of administering summary I ) unishment on the Reis , then and there . He was himself much frightened , and on my advancing to the scene he retired , leaving Mohammed to me . I had him removed to the boat , where his wound was attended to , and it fortunately proved to be but a bad bruise . Nevertheless the Reis was left to understand that on our arrival at Gheneh we should hand him over to the governor , to determine whether it was proper for him to beat the men in that way ; and in the mean time he was forbidden to punish the men with any similar weapons , under penalty of a broken head himself . This filled to overflowing the cup of Reis Hassanein 's afflictions , and thereafter he was a milder and a better man . He had asked and obtained permission to leave the boat before we reached the village of Manfalout , and , crossing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who resided there . He also asked permission to have the boat remain there all night , which we granted , and he had a day and a night in the midst of his friends . When he came on board the next morning , I observed that he was in a sorrowful humor , and so continued for a day or two ; and at length he unbosomed himself of his sorrows . He had met a cold reception  --  or rather , a warm one , the wrong way-at home . His wife had not seen him for a year , and she knew he had been marrying *another wife in Cairo , and no asseverations would convince her to the contrary . He swore it was not so , and she swore that it was so . She scolded him ; and finally called in her family and friends , and beat him-actually beat him-in their presence . This capped the climax , and as it was then nearly morning , he left the house and came down to the boat , and when we were ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing : that on the way down the river we would not stop at Manfalout at all , but go Imy as rapidly as the current would take us . This trouble was now increased by finding himself in disgrace on the boat , and I had no pity for him , but let him suffer until we reached Gheneh , under the apprehension of punishment , for his too free use of the club . An Arab can not take a joke . He will inevitably understand it as a serious affair . The evening after we left Girgeb , Hajji Mohammed , the cook , made a mistake in his bread , and it came in as heavy as lead , and as damp as the Nile mud . Abd-el-Atti , mindful of Hassabo 's illness , and the cause of it , rolled up a lump of the soft bread into a pill as large as an English walnut , and sent Ferraj to give it to Hassabo , and tell him it was one of the cook 's pills , and would do him good . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one dreamed of this till the next day , when I found Hassabo quite sick , and he laid it all to the cook 's pill , which he told me he had taken . I have no doubt be was right , but it came as near being a case of cholera as I have ever seen . We reached Gheneh in the afternoon , and I proceeded immediately to pay my respects to Abd-el-KaderBey , theGovernor of UpperEgypt , and next in rank to Latif Pasha , to whom I had letters . I have met many men of high rank in Egypt , and have been fortunate in making the acquaintance of several of the most distinguished officers of the Viceroy , but I have seen no one with whom I was so well pleased , or whose acquaintance I was so glad to have made . The letters would not have been necessary . I found an accomplished gentleman  --  a Turk , indeed , but affable , polite , and dignified ; a pleasant man in conversation , a good soldier , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revered . I found him in his audience-room , a large chamber , forty feet by forty , with a high ceiling and a stone floor . Across the upper end of the room was a divan , covered with rich cusimions , and this also extended down one side ; while opposite was a row of chairs , of Eastern pattern , heavily gilded . He led me to a seat on his left , at the upper end of the room , and gave me a ehibouk of magnificent pattern . The stick was carved ebony , and the amber mouth-piece was loaded with diamonds . Pour young Nubian slaves , handsome in countenance and elegantly dressed in the Nizam dress , brought coffee and sherbet , and then retired , one standing on each corner of the carpet to await farther orders . They were manifestly favorites , and a fifth , who had been absent on some err-and , entered while // the governor was talking , and making directly up to him , took his hand and kissed it and pressed it to his forehead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpets covered about one-fourth of the room , across the upper end , and the next fourth was covered with Nubian mats , the reinainder being hare . No one stepped on the mats with slippers on his feet , hut every one who approached the governor left his slippers on the stone floor , and advanced over the mats as far as the edge of the carpet , hut no farther unless the governor gave leave . My visit did not interrupt the usual course of business , but be continued to affix his seal to papers that were presented , and to hear petitions and administer justice as usual . He turned from me with a polite excuse each time , completed bis business rapidly , and resumed the conversation , which was chiefly on political subjects , with all of which he was more familiar than any man I have met in Egypt . One poor wretch who had deserted from the army was hrou*ht before him by his soldiers , and he turned to look at him . There was a world in his eye , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of life and death had not been taken fl-nm the governors by recent changes , I have little doubt that I should then and there have heard-what I have so often , and always with deep emotion , heard in America  --  the sentence of death passed on him . The man held up a bleeding hand , from which he had lately cot two fingers , hoping thereby to render himself unfit for military service . I believe I have already remarked that this is so much the custom in Egypt , that nearly every man has lost a finger or an eye . But this did not avail him now , and he was remanded to await examination . On my return down the river I passed two days at Gheneh , and of the pleasant friendship which I then established with Abd-el-Kader Bey , and of the favors he did me , I shall have occasion to speak fully at another time . He now forwarded letters to every inferior governor on the river , informing them of my progress , and gave me copies to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Gheneh and approached Thebes . That night the wind wailed around us , and December voices came flying on it . The starry sky was like the skies of our home-land , but the air was pure , soft , and delicious to the cheek , though the blast was terrible . Once there came on it , from down the river , a long , wild cry-a shriek of women in agony . It was the deathcry of some poor wretches whose boat went down in the tempest . Our men took the small boat and went to their rescue , but in vain . They found the floating evidences of a lost boat , but nothing more . And in the night I heard the sounds of a distant land come to me distinctly on the gale . You may laugh at me : you may say , I write it because others have said and written the same ; you may tell me I dreamed it . I care not what you say , but I know that on that stormy Satur day night I heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves of the Nile . Yes , I heard them . I , too , laughed when I read in the hooks of travels of others that they heard such sounds on the desert , but I did not laugh now , for I have learned the truth of those sounds right well . I was sitting just here where I now sit , writing a letter home , to be mailed when we should reach Luxor . Profound silence for a moment rested on every thing . There was a loll in the wind . The flow of the river was swift and noiseless . May was sleeping . All the others on the boat were sleeping . It was midnight , I say ; but far away , in that I ) leasant land that I call home , it was just sunset , and the hour of prayer . I leaned my head forward on my hands a moment , and perhaps-I will not say it was so , hut perhaps-perhaps there were some tears in my eyes ; for on a winter evening like this , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fade out of eyes that I loved , and deep gloom take its place forever , and so , perhaps I wept as I remembered it  --  and then  --  and then I heard those bells . They sounded sweetly-clearly , and I sprang to the door of the cabin , and out into the starry night , and leaned my head forward to listen to the melody . Soft , soft and sweet they came over the swift river ; clear , rich , and full . There could be no mistaking them . I might have doubted , but the tones were all the same . There was the Presbyterian hell , deep , stern , and solemn in every stroke ; the Episcopal church bell , more musical and silvery ; the old Scotch church bell , that was forever chanting the psalm , " they th' go down to the sea in ships " - all clear and loud ; and then the wind arose , and they went away over the desert , and I heard them far off , and then no longer . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood with a friend  --  the best friend of all my years of life , the companion of boyhood , youth , and mature years  --  and - talked with him of this same subject . lie had been in Egypt , and had once beard that same sound , and with all the calm thoughtfulness of his nature , be believed that the bells did verily sound in his ears with their own metallic notes . We were speaking then of Eothen , and the same story as related by its author , in his own inimitable style ; but I had little faith then in my friend or in Eothen . I have more now . You may tell me it was the wailing over a dead man in a village along the bank , or you may say that it was a creaking sakea , or a palmtree moaning in the wind , or whatsoever you please to believe it . I am content to know that my ears heard the church bells , and since my feet might not tread the accustomed path , my heart went there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a worshiper there that none knew who surrounded it that evening , but whose worship was sincere and fervent , though the waters of the Nile were under him , and the skies of Egypt , starry and clear , over his head .
