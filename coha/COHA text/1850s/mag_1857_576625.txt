txt * the cod-fishing . Banks off Newfoundland . Accordingly , having made the necessary preparations for an absence of three months , I started for Boston , where I supposed I could procure all requisite information in regard to obtaining a berth as a passenger on some one of the thousand cod-fishermen that were daily and almost hourly leaving from some port in Massachusetts . On my way up the sound on the " Empire State , " I fell in company with a Boston pilot , to whom I applied for advice and counsel . After looking at me for a moment , he said , " You wo n't make a cod-fisherman , the work is too severe , and there is little , if any , sport . Let me advise you to go to Cape Ann , and ship on some vessel going up to St. Lawrence Bay after mackerel , and , if possible , get a berth as a hand , ' as neither crew nor skipper like passengers , they are always in the way . " On my arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some parties in Cape Ann , and the same afternoon found me landed in Gloucester , the " City of the Cape . " Within an hour after my arrival , thanks to my letters , I was in close communion with John Gott , a lineal descendant of the original Peter Gott ( the founder of the American mackerel fisheries ) , and the skipper of the prettiest craft that ever sailed out of Cape Ann har bor . He inquired if I had ever caught a mackerel , or had ever been to the , " Bay . " On my telling him I bad never seen a live mackerel , and had never visited that part of the world , he expressed his regret that he could not take me -- for the reason , that he had chartered his vessel for the season , and had paid so high for the charter , that it was absolutely necessary that his crew should be picked fishermen , as every fish counted , and if a single berth should be filled by an inxperienced person , his investment might prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " George Washington , " a new vessel of about 83 tons , which was not chartered , and said he , " Brigham is a young man , and a good fellow , this is his first trip as skipper , and he will be anxious to accommodate you , if he can . " So I walked up to Brigham , and addressed him . " Skipper , I want to ship with you . " " Ever bin fishin ' ? " " No , but it is time I should go . " " Sorry , ca n't commodate , crew all shipped . " " But now , skipper , I want to go , in fact , I must , either as a hand or passenger . " " Never take passengers , crew tumble over them , hurt themselves , always in the way , get sick , have to bring them home , crew swear , trip spoiled ca n't take passengers nohow . " " But , skipper , I will ship as a hand , and if I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will promise not to be in the way , and besides I like the appearance of your schooner , she looks trim and stiff , and can sail some , I fancy . " This flattering *otice of his vessel touched him in the right sp9t , and he replied , " Why , yes , I had her // A RAW HAND built to suit me , and I guess she can sail a leetle . I will try and accommodate you , bat you will have to share my *June , berth , and fish way aft . " " Oh ! yes certainly , anywhere : when do you sail ? " " Fifth July . " " Do you want any help getting ready ? " " Why , no , guess we can get afong without you , we 'll send you word when it 's time to come aboard . " And so I shipped on my first trip as a sailor and fisherman . And now , while the rest of the crew are getting the vessel ready for sea , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fishery Question . " Cape Ann and Cape Cod are the two points from which three-fourths of the mackerelcatchers sail , about one-third of the whole number of vessels hailing from the former port . There are two divisions of the mackerel fleet , one , the most numerous , but comprising the smaller class of vessels , follow the fish along the Atlantic coast , from the Capes of Delaware to the southwestern shores of Nova Scotia . These vessels are almost constantly together , that is , in sight of each other , and , throwing large quantities of bait , are generally more successful in raising fish than single vessels in the same waters would be . About five hundred sail , ranging from seventy to one hundred and twenty tons , comprise the " Bay fleet , " a totally distinct organiz* tion . Of these vessels , those owned in Cape Ann are the smallest , averaging from seventy to ninety tons , with crews of from tea to thirteen men , and those from Cape Cod are from ninety to one hundred and twenty tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a great spirit of rivalry between the two capes , it being supposed by many that the Cape-Ann men are the most daring sailors , while , on the other hand , there is less discipline among their crews than is maintained on the large CapeA FLIIJII OF FISHING SMACKS . qwq respects between the two places , I can not say , but will testify what I do know in regard to the Cape Ann customs . The fishermen receive no wages , but are entitled to one-half of the fish caught by them , deducting out of their share their proportion of the expenses for bait and cook 's wages , and also the charge per barrel for inspecting , repacking and salting , ready for sale . This last item is about $1.25 per barrel , and of course is only chargeable on the part of the catch belonging to the crew . I should think it safe to estimate each man 's net receipts at a little over threesevenths of the gross catch . The owners of the vessel furnish all the provisions , salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and generally reserve to themselves the right to sell the fish on the highest offer that can be obtained at any time before the vessel is ready to sail on her next trip . The crew , of course , can take their share of the fish , if they desire it , but they almost universally prefer that the owners should sell the whole , and then take their share in money . The mackerel are generally bought up by large dealers from Boston or New York , who make their offer to the owners , sometimes two weeks before the vessels come in , and generally to take all the fish , whether more or less , that may arrive , at certain prices for each kind , ones , twos , threes , and extra ones . There are eight or ten fitting establishments in Gloucester , all owning a larger or smaller interest in each vessel that fits out at their wharf , and from appearances I should judge that very few of them are losing money . The stores furnished are generally very good  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chocolate , sugar , rice , molasses , butter , potatoes , lard , flour , etc. ; for your mackerel fisherman has a very exalted idea of the necessity of living well , and he wants his hot bread fresh at each meal , and his pies , and duff ( Anglice boiled flour pudding ) , and sweet cakes whenever he is hungry , and that is all the time . In fact , the cook is a personage of equal importance with the skipper in the eyes of these salt-water epicures , and the first question asked by one sailor of another is , " Who is your skipper ? " and the next , " What kind of a cook have you 7 " and then , if the responses are satisfactory , and the questioner wants a berth , he straightway makes his demand in form -I say demand , for a good fisherman can always get a berth , and being , therefore , independent , he is somewhat particular as to the company he keeps . Four-fifths of the crews are Yankees or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch , and Germans , with , now and then , a Portuguese , Swede , or Norwegian . They are generally first-rate seamen ; for they are on the water almost all the time-seven months cod-fishing and five months mackerel-catching-which last is perhaps the most profitable , as it certainly is the most agreeable . The schooners are fitted out in January for the Grand Banks , or for " George 's ; " which last are soundings about two hundred miles easterly from Boston , in the broad Atlantic , where there is no lee or shelter , and where they ride at anchor through storm and gale , hauling in cod and halibut , straining their backs , freezing their feet and fingers , and trying their powers of endurance to the utmost . It is no wonder that they are strong and hardy sailors , and that they are always welcome in the navy or in the merchant service  --  and it is no wonder , either , that so many of them die , long before old age overtakes them , worn out with toil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are but little better circumstanced ; but the trip is longer , and is preferred by many sailors on account of the greater certainty of profit . In June these vessels generally assemble in port . and are painted , cleaned , and thoroughly overhauled , preparatory to making their first trip to the " Bay . " Everybody employed , then , seems to be in high spirits , as the change from the Banks to the Bay is like that from close confinement over books and slate in school to the careless , happy hour of play . Almost all the schooners are painted alike-black , with a white streak  --  and masts scraped or stained yellow . They are rigged alike , also , carrying generally a main but no foretop-mast , jib and flying-jib , fore and mainsails , with gaff-topsail and stay-sail , for light winds . They are all built to combine speed with stiffness and capacity  --  and the craft that can gain one mile in seven , over another , in working to windward , is a remarkably good sailer . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a short distance , look exactly // alike , but the fisherman , from long experience and practice , can point out a hundred differences in rig and hull , totally inappreciable by the " green hand . " In fact I have often , with the spy-glass , seen on the horizon the peak of a mainsail , and perhaps a gaff-topsail , and almost any one of the crew could say , for a certainty , where that sail was bent , the name of the schooner and her " hail , " ( i. e. , where owned ) . The vessels cost from $3,600 to $5,000 each , and are owned principally in and about Cape Ann , the skipper generally holding a quarter interest-the dividends on which , together with his per percentage ( from 3 to 5 p. c. ) on the part of the catch belonging to the vessel , make the only difference between his share and that of the crew  --  and it sometimes happens that there are fishermen on board who make more out of the trip than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is one of the requisites for acting as skipper that he should be A 1 as a fisherman . His work is harder by half than that of the crew , as he has to be up at all hours of the night , when there are any indications of an increase or change of wind-besides which , he has to throw the bait , to keep the fish near the vessel , to stand at the helm while running into the schools of mackerel , and while going into and coming out of harbor -- and , in addition to all this , he must be ever watchful of the vessel , to see that nothing about the rigging , spars or hull chafes or wears ; in short , his life is one of constant anxiety , and , I think , inadequately recompensed . The crew have no cares - each one keeps his watch in turn , and takes his " trick " at the wheel - beyond this , except when the fish bite or are to be dressed , they have little else to do but to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly manned - having three times the number of hands required for coasting vessels of the same classthat the working of the vessel is only sport ; and we could weigh anchor and set all sail , if necessary , as quickly as any one of the English revenue cutters that we occasionally fall in with in the Bay . Having premised thus much , I will now proceed to give some account of my doings in my new character of sailor and fisherman . About 11 , A. M. , July 5th-as beautiful a morning as the sun ever shone upon-our skipper sent word to me to report myself at the wharf in an hour . Within that time down I trundled with bag and baggage , books , bed-clothes , boots , oiled coats and pants , and everything that I supposed could be wanted to clothe , comfort , and console me , on my watery pilgrimage . Our schooner lay in the stream , and I got aboard alone , in order to " take an observation " before the crew showed themselves . Matters looked discouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck and down below ; all was confusion worse confounded . The cook was in the forecastle , arrangkig his small assortment of crockery and iron-ware ; on seeing me he said : " Oh ! you are the green hand , eb ? guess you 'll be sick enough this time to-morrow. ** Comforting-very . I had a small demijohn ( not empty ) in one hand and a box of cigars in the other , which I purposed using as my letters of introduction to the crew . I passed the former to my sympathizer , and desired him to give an opinion as to the contents . He took hold , " looked down in the mouth " a few moments , and , when he had regained his breath , expressed his entire approval . Got ashore again , and seeing nothing of the crew , went back to the hotel to dinner . But some way or THE POLLY ANN . // another I could not eat . I had seen so many curious things on board , and the ominous words of the cook rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely destroyed . About 2 , P. M. , I went down to the wharf again , and found skipper and crew all assembled , and a better-looking set of boys I never expect to meet-almost all young , strong , and hearty , full of fun and jokes and all manner of curious absurdities . I thought to myself , " Well , I am glad I came . " They eyed me narrowly , but said nothingand when we had all signed the shipping articles , we got into our boat and sculled off to the schooner . Every one tumbled on deck , and in five minutes one asked me to take a cigar , and another suggested a little grog , and to my surprise they passed to me my own cigars and Jamaica , which they had fished out of the locker where I had stored them . Telling them to take hold , as I had intended both cigars and rum for them , I drank their health , and we were on the spot sworn friends and ship-mates . " Hoist the mainsail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jib and flying-jib ; " such were the orders issued in quick succession by our skipper , as he took the helm . Great was the confusion . fearful the rush , and go where I would , I always managed to be exactly in the way . My hands would get into my pockets , as I did not know what else to do with them , till finally I seized hold of one of the brakes , rapped my knuckles smartly against the cable , developing the inner cuticle to some extent , and then concluded that I would look on a while and see how things were done on board ship . As we rounded Eastern Point , the skipper passed the word for the crew to come aft , and draw lots for sleeping berths ; this took about ten minutes , and then all hands set to work to make up their beds , stow away their bags , and clear up generally . Our bunk ( the skipper 's and mine ) was wide enough for two , but when the bed was made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deck plank . There were accommodations for six in the after cabin , and seven in the forecastle . The space , exclusive of berth , in each apartment , was about seven by nine feet , and in the forecastle nearly all that was taken up by the table , lockers , and cooking stove-at that time I thought it impossible that thirteen persons could stow themselves away , much less be comfortable , in such narrow quarters , but within very few days I found I was mistaken as to both the stowage and the comfort . The after-gang was to mess first , and the others made up the second table . About five o'clock the announcement " Supper ready , after-gang , " came from the forecastle , and down we went , the subscriber last ( a position he abandoned as soon as his sea appetite was established , and the importance of being early at table was demonstrated to his satisfaction ) , of course I descended the wrong way-instead of turning my face to the steps , I was walking down quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on land , when presto-the schooner made a lurch , and I came down by the run , my head striking the foot of the foremast , which appeared to have been placed in that particular spot on purpose to prevent green hands from upsetting the table . A slight laugh , a few expressions of sympathy , and the encouraging assurance , that I would THE COOK EXPRESSiNG APPROVAL . // soon " learn the ropes , " reached my ears as I picked myself up , and took my place . Appetite I had none , although there was plenty to eat , and everything was good . After supper I turned in , and soon fell into a troubled sleep , interspersed with dreams , of which shipwrecks in every variety formed the staple article , and I awoke in the morning , anything but enchanted with a sailor 's life . All that day I could see the crew watching me , looking for the first symptoms of sea-sickness , and ready , no doubt , to minister ( in their way ) to my wants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although for three days I felt listless , weak , and chilly , and had not a particle of appetite . In the meanwhile all hands were arranging the watch , setting up the slack of the rigging , slushing the masts , overhauling their clothes , and gradually shaking themselves down into their new quarters . On the following Saturday we anchored at Sleep Creek in the Gut of Canso , where we remained until Monday , taking in fresh water , catching lobsters , wandering about the country , and feasting on strawberries , which gr ow luxuriantly in that part of Nova Scotia , and are much larger and of finer flavor than the wild strawberries with us . The skipper and I visited the crew of a schooner , on her way home with a full fare of fish . They said , mackerel were plenty , but small , that they had been only three weeks filling up , and that we would find a number of Gloucester vessels in the Bay . On Monday we got under weigh , and soon after the skipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lead , and pewter . The lines are linen , white or blue , and about the size of heavy trout-lines . The fishing-berths were then marked off , and all hands drew lots for the choice of stations , with the exception of the cook , skipper , and the green hand ( myself ) , whose places are the same on all vessels , that is , the cook has the forward berth , just aft the fore-rigging , the skipper the middle berth , just forward of the main-rigging , and the green hand the after-berth , being aft of all the rest , and reaching from his neighbor to the stern , very commodious , and , I found on trial , very appropriate , as in any other position I should have entangled the lines of the crew continual ly . In catching mackerel , all hands fish on the right or starboard side , the vessel laying to under foresail and mainsail , and drifting bodily to leeward , bait being thrown continually , which keeps the fish near the vessel . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . I lay on the deck in the sun , smoking , and watching the proceedings of the crew with intense interest . The first thing was to fit out their several berths with cleets , for coiling their lines on , which was soon done . Next came the casting of the jigs , and for this purpose an iron mould is used , in which the hook is firmly set , leaving about one-third of the shank with the point projecting below the mould . The lead and pewter are then melted together and poured in , and when each one has cast all the jigs he wants , the mould is passed to the next  --  and in about three hours , all hands were seated around the deck , with files , rasps , sand-paper , and dog-fish skin , shaping , scraping , smoothing , and polishing the jigs , each one according to his fancy . I had made an attempt to run a jig , and succeeded in melting the material , and pouring some of it into my shoe , some on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seeing my awkwardness , " Tom " ( my especial chum ) , and " Procter , " who took a fatherly interest in my welfare , told me to " belay all that , and they would rig me out , as soon as they had finished their own . " The next day , as I chanced to look along the " LEARNING THE *&amp;w*S. ' // elects , I found my own berth fully fitted out , lines , snappers , jigs , and all , in readiness for immediate use , and , on closer inspection , I found that my friends had bestowed far more attention on my tackle than on their own , and , in fact , that my establishment was more complete than any other on hoard . As the crew were now prepared for business , and we were very near the fishing-grounds , the skipper announced the hours for meals , etc. , as follows , breakfast at four , A. M. ( unless the fish are biting , in that case as soon thereafter as they stop biting ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception ) ; tea at 4 , p* M. ( with the same exception ) ; and supper any time from 8 , p . M. , until next morning ( no exception to this , as mackerel do not bite after sun-down ) ; and no cardplaying ( except when the anchor is down ) . On Wednesday , the 15th of July , about four o'clock in the morning , I was sleeping soundly , when the cry , heard by me for the first time in my life , " All hands ahoy ! Mackerel , here they gnaw ! " awoke me with a start . I raised my head suddenly , struck the plank above , and dropped back to think it over ; in the meanwhile every one had rushed on deck , and by the time I got there , the fish were flipping lively in the strike barrels , one of which is placed to the right and a little behind each fisherman . Mechanically I threw out my lines , thought I felt a bite , and drew in the lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon a large mackerel took hold , the jerk I gave caused the line to cut my fingers to the bone , besides tearing the hook out of the fish . Again and again I pulled , and jerked , and hauled , but all to no purpose . I could feel for a moment the weight of the fish , but straightway he was gone . Looking over the side , I could see the animals with their round big eyes , turned up towards me , and their mouths open , apparently on a broad grin . I glanced into my neighbor 's barrel , It was half full . I was in despair-soon the flipping ceased , not a bite , fish all gone . The boys came and looked into my barrel , laughed a little , said I must not be discouraged , next " spurt " they would show me how . About ten o'clock some one sung out : " Skipper , school of mackerel on our lee bow , about a mile off . " We looked , and sure enough there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cats-paws made by the puffs of wind . The skipper took the helm , one of the men ran out on the jib-boom with his hands full of bait , another climbed into the boat on the davits , provided in the same way , and a third took his place at the bait-box amidships ; the rest of us stood by the main and fore-sheets , boom-tackle , and jibhalliards and down-haul . " Tack ship " - round she came on her keel- " hook on boom-tackle , ease off main-sheet , down jib , let go fore-sheet , " and in three minutes the schooner was stationary , with the water on her starboard side alive with fish . Then came the rush to the side , and the quick plump , plump , of the jigs , and the flip , flip , flip , of the mackerel into the barrels . " Tom " left his lines and came to me . Says he , " when you get a bite , haul in quick but steady , so-  --  the first jerk will tear out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him within three feet of the side , reach down your right hand along the line to within six inches of his nose , so-then raise him quick , and with a jerk snap him into the barrel -- that will tear his jaw off , and the jig will naturally fly forward PULLING A NELOHBoa 's LINE . // into the water , then go through the same operation with the other line . " Tom caught half a dozen fish while giving his instructions , and then left me to shift for myself . For some time I could not get the " hang " of it , and I remember , the first mackerel I got safely over the side , I took hold of with one hand , and with the other took out the hook . I did not try it again , however , as the laugh that followed my first mancnuvre satisfied me that that was n't the right way , no how . When the fish had ceased biting , we divided into four gangs for dressing and salting . These operations are thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skipper , who takes the helm , and whose fish are dressed by the gang nearest his berth ) , then the splitter , taking a mackerel in his left hand and laying it on a board , with the head from him and hack out , draws a fiat , sharp knife down from the head to the tail , close to the back-bone , then , with a turn of the wrist , he throws the fish into the gib-tub , a large wooden box , about three feet square , and six inches deep , on opposite sides of which stand the two gibbers . They take out the entrails-which is done by holdi g the fish in the left hand , and with the thumb of the right loosening the gills on each side , the whole of the gibs are in the Bay . June , then extracted with one turn of the hand , and the fish are thrown into a barrel of water to soak : there they remain for an hour or so , when they are salted and put into other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed up , marked with the owner 's name , or in some other way , to distinguish them , and stowed away below . The quickness and dexterity with which a " catch " of fish is dressed and salted , would surprise any one who looked upon the operation for the first time . It was my business to pass up the fish to the splitter , and after they were dressed , to the salter , ad although I worked as hard as I could , I found it impossible to keep them busy all the time . Two good hands can gib as fast as one can split , and there is great strife always among the gangs to see who shall be through first , especially with the last or sun-down " spurt , " as supper is the only meal at which all the crew assemble in the forecastle-and , accommodations being rather scanty for twelve men , it is easily understood that " first come is first ( and best ) served . " When all the fish are dressed and salted , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stowed so as to be out of the way , and we are ready to try them again . I may remark here , that were it not for wat r SPLITTING AND 5ATTINC. // being so plenty , and so easily available , fishing would be dirty work ; and even as it is , there are some kinds of business that are more cleanly . There are few things more exciting than catching mackerel where the fish - are biting fast . Every one moving his hands and arms as if his life depended upon his exerting himself to the utmost , the constant flip , flip , of the fish , as they fly from the water into the strikebarrels , and the short , quick , impatient cries - " keep lines clear , " " whose lines these in my berth ? " " there 's a bloater " ( extra large fish ) , " more bait here , skipper " - with now and then a strong expletive , indicating the breaking of a jig , or the parting of a line . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood for nearly an hour , without stirring my feet or changing my position in the least ; for any movement , or shifting of feet or body , will almost certainly embarrass the proceedings of our next neighbor , whose lines , while barreling in his fish . lie on the deck close to our heels . But now the bites are less frequent , only at long intervals a tinker ( small mackerel ) comes over the side , and every one draws a long breath , gets a leg over the rail , and sits down to rest . Then come the jokes and " sells , " and loud and hearty laughter takes the place of the quiet that a moment before reigned supreme . Soon . however , we hear the peak of the mainsail would be swayed up a trifle , then they would take a pull at the jib-ha1liards* then she would yaw about and wait till we got abreast of her , when suddenly she would haul up and work away , beating up to windcook , away forward , sing out : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an instant the dangling legs are all drawn in , every face resumes its gravity , the laugh and jest are hushed , and the business of the day is resumed . Sometimes the crew will stand at the rail for fot* hours , the fish biting fast and then leaving , at in* tervals , until perhaps our second strikebarrel is full , and the skipper says " Haul in , boys , guess we 'll dress- ( not ourselves but the catch ) . But we did not fish every day we were in the Bay , by any means . About the 7th of August , and when we had taken about half our fare , say 150 bbls. , a succession of easterly winds with heavy fogs came on , and for three weeks we did not take a fish . We were in harbor frequently , and enjoyed ourselves hugely , in the various ways peculiar to sailors and fishermen the world over . We cruised along the Noi*a Scotia , New Brunswick und Canada coasts , and up into St. Lawrence river , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish , but they would not bite . We spoke with the skippers of some forty fishing-vessels , and the invariable answer to our hail of " Got any fish lately 7 " was " No ; plenty all over the Bay , but they wo n't eat . " Occasionally some schooner , distant perhaps half a mile , and heading on the same course with ourselves , would show signs of preparation for a race . First the ward . We always accepted the challenge-would take a pull on all the braces , hitch on the tackle to the fore and main boom , to draw the sails down flat as possible , and if there should happen to be a good fresh breeze , were SMACKS IN A FOG . // generally successful , after an hour or two , in leaving our friend away off to leeward . At last , about the 27th of August , toward sundown , we raised a " school . " They took hold voraciously .

We worked slowly down to the North Cape of Prince Edward 's Island , where we found about forty sail , mostly Gloucester vessels , and mackerel plenty and hungry . The weather all the time fairly alive with them , acre upon acre swimming round and round , seemingly without any fixed purpose or destination . The rest of the fleet saw our mancenvres , and by the time we had worked into the school they were all after us , every sail set and coming down in a body . Strike-barrels were becoming scarce , and by unanimous consent we closed up the hawse-holes on the lee side , and struck off the fish on deck in one indiscriminate heap . And such fishing ! I had supposed , on former occasions , that I had seen fast biting and fast fishing : but I soon found my mistake . The fish seemed perfectly ravenous . We shortened our lines to about eight feet , and for three hours the sport was kept up . But I am wrong ; it was only sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was work , and hard work , too . The jig could scarcely touch the water before the fish would seize it , and it was almost impossible to attend to two lines , June , was delightful , . though somewhat cold , with an occasional breeze from the northwest . We filled up rapidly , when our skipper , one morning , as we were working into a school , sung out : " We 'll turn her nose towards home to-morrow night , boys , if we have anything like luck till then . " During that day we took ei0hteen barrels , and the next morning about seven o'clock , the other vessels being all close in shore , we saw , about three miles off , the largest school of fish that had been met with in those waters for five seasons . The sea was which on all former occasions we had little difficulty in doing . At last , our skipper said , and for the last time that trip : " Haul in , boys , we 're full , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines and straightening our backs after our exertions , we looked around and saw the rest of the fleet lying to on all sides of us , none of them more than a mile distant , and the crews of every one working away for dear life . It was a very curious sight to see the quick and constant movement of so many hands and arms ( we were so far off that the lines were invisible ) , and it seemed as though every man was gesticulating with frantic vehemence , ever and anon pointing to the water before him . Over eight hundred barrels were taken that day , by the fleet , out of that one school . When we turned to , to dress this last catch , we found , and greatly to my surprise , that they were a totally different THROWING BAIT FOR MACNRa 2L. // body of mackerel from those we had previously been taking . Tbey were large and lean , and had evidently just come into the Bay , perhaps from their spawning-grounds . However , by dressing them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , and those who get hold of them this winter may not notice any peculiarity in their taste , although we did . Well , we had filled up everythingevery barrel , half-barrel , and tub , and were off for home about four in the afternoon . We hoisted our bunting and lay to , as is customary , that any vessel might run down and speak us , and send word to their owners or others at home . At supper we were congratulating our skipper on his good fortune , a full fare , and not a rope yarn parted , or a dollar 's worth of d mage done to the vessel during the cruise . As I was standing at the foot of the companionway in the after-cabin , filling my pipe , a shadow obscured the light , and , looking up , I saw , directly over my head , a jibboom moving somewhat rapidly towards the main-mast . I had just time to turnble on deck , when one of the vessels that was bearing down to speak us struck our boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her side , broke the davits , and spilled the oars , oil clothes and various miscellaneous articles that were stowed away in her . Fortunately , the boat was new and very strong , or the damage to our bull might have been serious : as it was , after a few pointed remarks by our skipper , we got under weigh , taking our boat in on deck , and thanking our stars that it was no worse . On Sunday , September 7th , we passed through the Gut of Canso , with the wind S. W. and heavy , allowing us barely to lay our course , close hauled . On Wednesday , we were becalmed , and on Thursday we had a terrible blow from the southwest . We double-reefed our fore and mainsails , and staggered along , the sea running very high , and for six hours our leebow was oftener under than out of the water . About 4 , p. *. , the wind lulled , and heavy clouds came up from the west . It grew darl er and darker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would burst upon us . Soon the rain began to fall , slowly at first , but , in a short time , it came down in torrents , yet all the time without a breath of wind . In about an STAGGERING UNDER A IOU ' wElTER. hour , we felt a gentle air from the south , the h avy cloud lifted , the rain ceased , the sun shone brightly out , and , directly before us , everyhouse and steeple tinged with th beauty of its setting rays , lay the city of Gloucester , not more than six miles distant . The breeze was fair and freshening . In a few minutes every sail As set , and before eight o'clock we were lying at our dock , and our cruise was done . As*I stood on the shore , watching her scudding away on her second trip , I could not but feel sad and lonely . She had been my home for nearly ten weeks , the happiest of my life . Her crew , rough and boisterous as they often were , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , and her skipper , from first to last , had treated inc like a brother . As for the personal results of my trip , they were briefly these . I had visited scenes , and places , and people , of which I had scarcely heard before . I had obtained some practical knowledge of the great " Fishery Question ; " had gained health and strength , and fifteen pounds of solid flesh , and when I left Gloucester the owners handed me a checque for fifty dollars , as my share of the proceeds of the trip . Verily , I can ask , as " Procter " did , one lovely morning in the Bay , when the fish were biting famously , and I had just got the " hang " of catching them , " Who would n't sell his farm and go a-flshin0 ?
