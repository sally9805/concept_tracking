DEATH OF HENRY CLAY : THE CONVENTION SYSTEM . qwq // to his private worth , as well a to his integrity to political engagements . In 1820 , Mr. Clay , though young to the polities of the country , was a mediator to save it from civil war , and to him was owing , more than to any man the settlement of the Missouri question . In 1822 , he advocated the independence of South America ; and in 1824 the cause of liberty ii1 modern Greece . These acts are among his mightiest deeds of statesmanship . One of the most honorable fields of Mr. Glay 's usefulness was the formation of the African Colonization Society . For sixteen years he presided over that great institution , which has constantly directed public attention to the most critical subject in our destiny as a free people . To Mr. Clay more than to any other statesman is due the glory of remaining faithful , through good and evil report to the society , which now has secured its object , and has converted the sceptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity . Mr. Birney and Mr. Greeley are no longer doubtful of its practicability and its value ; and we are confident that we are hardly yet half conscious of the future , which its agency will create for the white , as well as the black race of the United States , in restoring the latter gradually from a state of semi-freedom here , to the perfect enjoyment of human rights in their native Africa . The Colonization Society has only to act on a differcut theory of conquest , as well as settlement in the colony and adjacent country to overspread the entire continent . In a more appropriate place , we have discussed what change ought to be made in the plan of operation , and enlarged on the reasons in its support . In 1850 he was now grown old in the public service without having impaired his faculties , or forfeiting the character of mediator . Again he put his soul into the controversy , and moved like a spirit upon its agitated waters . He achieved another compromise , by which the interests and safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of the parties . We have nothing here to add to that discussion , which is now fortunately settled , after a struggle of the greatest bitterness and intcnsity . But the crisis was put into the hands of Mr. Clay , and by the assistance of distinguishied statesmen from all sections , the danger of the hour passed away . Few men of ancient or of modern times have presented such a combination of qualities to *ontrol affairs . He was always sought out by the party instinct whenever there was need of a leader . He himself never shunned responsibility , and never concealed his own opinions , nor was guilty of the meanness of rtiisrepresenting those of his adversaries . He cam.e fairly upon the ground of debate , no matter what the question , and did his utmost to enlighten the judgment , to assist the understanding , and to move the soul . He always had his proposition , or his opposition clearly defined ; lie was master of the facts and reasons which were appropriate , and without any great weight of learning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed his argument . He could plead as well as expostuhate ; denounce or melt at his pleasure , and there was an inflexible purpose always manifested in his actions , while his manner could be either insinuating or dictatorial . His great arena was oral discussion , and especially that of l*gishative dcbate . He was an accomphislied writer and conversationalist , for many thought he wrote as well as he spoke , and many were in doubt whether he did not talk as well as he did either . He had wit and pathos , sprightliness and style , great sympathy , and greater knowledge of the world , so that his personal contact produced a like impression of superiority in the private as well as in the public auditory . His address was superior and charactcristic ; he aimed to acquire the vantage ground of the listcner , and generally succeeded before the speech or conversation fairly began ; and lie improved that position a.s he advanced . his face , voice , person , and gesture admirably secondcd his ambition ; they were all adapted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose to real dignity . The equilibrium of his physical and mental system was perfect , so that he felt much less than men do generally the most arduous labors of the forum ; and at an extraordinary age he lingered beyond all expectation on this side of the grave , wishing constantly to enter its dread solemnity , but hong and painfully withheld by the tenacity of his constitution . // Mr. Clay had becohie a member of the Episcopal Church several years ago , and was pious and exemplary , bearing constant testimony to the merits of his Redeemer : in his language and conduct ever since . Mr. Clay has outlived almost all of the great men of the second generation from the revolution . He was born just after the Thclaration of Independence he lived to see open before him the second half of the nineteenth century , with its immense events and its mightier portents . He turned his eye abroad , as well as on his own country . He was incessantly thinking upon the past , and the future , as much as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilization . He was still learning as well as teaching , and , for an old man , was not averse to correcting his conclusions . So distinguished a statesman was always a power behind the throne greater than the throne itself . No administration could neglect or provoke Mr. Clay with impunity , and to any Whig President he was indispensible . Yet he never was elected , though nominated to the Presidency ; others were nominated and elected by his party who. were his ae knowledged inferiors in all the qualifications for the station . Harrison and Taylor were not extraordinary generals , but they were insignificant statesmen . Scott is a great general , but in no other respect superior to Harrison and Taylor . For two of these men Henry Clay has been deserted , and for the third his wishes were violently thwarted by the politicians who compose all kinds of conventions , county , state , or federal , and who are the managers and tricksters of parties . The gigantic proportions of the departed statesman , so well called , from the obscurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great conunoner , offended the vanity of petty intriguers as much as the stride of Gulliver did the Lilliputians . He met the same fate . But when they and their doings are forgotten , the laurel and the cypress will still guard , in kindred embracQ , the name and fame of him who reposes beneath their shade ; but for whose deeds and glory the world is not too wide . These national losses are always occasions of general mourning , and no man has ever received in this country such funereal honors as his remains have attracted from the capital to the cemetery . The spirit of Henry Clay departed at Washington , and his mortal body bas been interred at Lexington . No man , living or dead , could produce a deeper sensation then he did , borne along in his shroud , to his sepulchre . There , the duty of his countrymen does not cease . They are bound to treasure the lessons taught by a life so long , so arduous , and so illustrious . Of the thousand themes which offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the most instructive . The first remark we have to make is that great men appear not singly , but in clusters ; we have several distinguished characters appearing upon and leaving the stage about the same time . Such was the period of Pericles , at Athens ; such the age of Augustus , at Rome ; such the case in Germany , with Luther , and Calvin , and Melancthon ; and so it was in the era of Anne , in England , and Elizabeth , and George III . and George IV . It was the same with our own Revolutionary epoch ; and in the first French revolution , as well as in the last . So it is now , and since 1848 , in Germany , in Hungary , and in Italy . So it has been since the galaxy of great American statesmen who came on the public stage during the war of 1812 , and of whom the t.hree last , and preeminently the greatest , have disappeared , and will disappear in what we hold to be the very order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clay ; and now lingers still , but ripe for departure , the survivor of the group , that wonderful-looking and extraordinary being in so many respects , Daniel Webster . This historical fact can be explained . The whole character of man can not be developed , nor his faculties be strengthened , without society . He needs the contact of his fellows to give him tone and justness and equilibrium ; that is equivalent to saying he is a social being . But more than that is true . It shows that the hardest strife of rivalry with equals and superiors , with scholars and masters , is necessary to put his whole mind and soul in action . Like the development of the body , the mind can only be fully developed by controversy . The athlete must have his antagonist , he must buffet and be buffeted , to acquire volume of muscle , quickness of eye , and dexterity of hand . In the solitude , he could // never come to perfection . There must be other athletes-many , or there could be no champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , noble and constant strife , makes the great spirit as well as the great body . Therefore rival champions , leading on different hosts in the forum , should imitate those of the arena , who treat each other courteously during the struggle for supremacy , and before and after the battle is over . If that were not so , there would be less improvement in athletic exercise and what was gained in the physical , would be lost in the moral sense . Intellectual men should keep this constantly in mind , and be fair and generous with their rivals ; especially regard them , instead of enemies , as indispensable friends , whose powers always graduate their own . It is not possible to be very great among one 's decided inferiors ; nor little among superiors , as a general rule . We can never have , we know , for any long space , a good bar with a miserably constituted bench ; nor a good bench , on the contrary , without a corresponding set of advocates . The reason is universal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an argument always to convince comes down to the level of an inferior judge , or he loses his preparation altogether , and is beaten by ordinary men whom the judge better understands . By any such practice however , long continued , the lawyer 's mind is ruined . On the other hand , before a first rate tribunal , feeble minds naturally quail , or grow stronger , while the discussions are conducted by those who are ablest . Now , therefore , the class of men of talent should deeply and constantly respect each other , as mutual necessities , valuable , or rather invaluable , to one another and they should avoid as a pestilence recriminations and great or petty injuries . They should seek , instead of avoiding , the encounter of opinions , but they should cultivate those feelings of justice and magnanimity through life , which so often find their only expression from a foe at the death of a great adversary . An example can not too soon be set of reformation , by which the small fry shall find no employment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality . The noble and gifted will then not only be capable of high deeds , but will really perform them , for the theatre will be glorious , and the antagonists worthy of the war of minds . Consider , that we have to choose between this spectacle and that of the mere dumb show and noise of shams ; or a fearful and brutal encounter of bad passions . The former state attracts no man of sense . The latter is even more repulsive . Contemplate the bird and beast of prey , and observe how oppositely they are constituted to man . To them , society is nothing , for it confers nothing , and solitary ferocity separated from their kind , and making indiscriminate war on all animated nature , is their normal state . Two lions are never found in one desert , nor two eagles upon one mountain , and the lion and the eagle wo*ild not be at the head of their respective species were it not for this savage habit of isolation . Man was not born and sent into the world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and over his own race , depends in his capacity to sympathize with , comprehend , and reflect all other men , with truth and patience and justice . It is due to Mr. Clay to say , that he was as distinguished , after all allowance is made for his love of mastery , in the civilities and amenities of life , as for his faculties . He might have been more so with advantage ; and we submit to the rising merit of the country whether taking his example of personal intercourse , so far as it goes , for a guide , they ought not , for their own sakes , to surpass it . We assure them , that it will be a great gain to themselves and to humanity . If our advancing age demands anything peremptorily , now that the secrets of all knowledge appear to be opened to it , and another era of human history and destiny just before us it is manly , rising to heroic opposition of one man or party to another . We take it for granted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clusters will only come the sooner and the riper , if there be forbearance of malice , hatred and ill will , and the cultivation of rugged but generous natures . Our second , and most valuable topic is contained in the proposition that such a man as Henry Clay is the product only of democratic institutions . It is true that we have not cited English examples of // individual superiority as statesmen yet we have indicated the ages in which they might be found there ; but England has been great because she has ever been at least the democratic and Protestant country of Europe - that is to say , that in spite of her monarchy and her oligarchy , she has had some municipal and ecclesiastical freedom . Her church establishment , now hardly distinguishable in its forms from Catholicism , is the very vilest thing on earth , for it adds hypocrisy to the long list of clerical vices , and her state establishment , so far as Parliament is concerned , has not one spark of popular spirit . The people 's portion in the representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiftyeight members , and the voice of that seventh often distracted , always feeble , is worthless , except for its infallible service in indicating clearly on every vote what the government will not do . SGll the internal struggle of popular strength is going on slowly and blindly , and dumbly at all times , and occasionally a domestic revolution , like that of 1648 , allows great men to command in the cabinet and in the field . And the outside pressure of France , in 1792 , 50 far threatened to derr*ocratize England as to make the epoch of Pitt and Fox and Burke and Sheridan illustrious , while the event of our own revolution , in 1775 , made the fame of Chatham and his contemporaries . It was the mantle of republicanism , as understood at Athens , and which was a republicanism far in advance of all coeval forms , that fell on Pericles , and made up into a halo which illuminates this earth to the heavens , and our day , from the remote antiquity , the glories of a transcendental firmament of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that covered the shoulders of Cresar , and made that Roman effulgence which soon after the Grecian galaxy , still blazed brightly , and even in the midst of modern splendor , " pales ( not ) its ineffectual fired . " In France , ancient and recent , the spirit of democracy lifted the souls of her philosophcrs , patriots and martyrs . In the centre and South of Europe , since 1848 , the same spirit has gone abroad , and inspired the souls of Kossuth and Mazzini , of Blum and Bem , of Bathyani and Garibaldi , and made them each a giant in his day , and placed all of them as far above their opponents , as the son of Kish rose above the stature of his warriors . Under a despotism it is impossible for the head or the heart of man to expand , because association is impossible , and because the forms of business , and , above all , the means of all grand and memorable expression , the public debate and the public press , are forbidden . Society lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despotic decrees , which the individual must strictly and swiftly obey . There are no entities , but cyphers ; no individualities , *but types without meaning . Under any limited form of government , the limitation reduces proportionally the scale of effort , by operating to mutilate every man , and accordingly to abridge his powers and his field of action . - Instead of completely expanding his nature , he must compromise more or less to the prevailing sect or caste , or creed , which , in such institutions , will not allow attack or question , and , therefore , a whole section of the man himself is paralysed . It is not to be supposed that the favored class in such systems will improve . They have their privilege , without any merit , secured to them by the institution , and hence want the spur , and the energy dies within them which nature gave , but which indolence takes away . Now , the same thing is true of church as of state establishments . The hierarchy and its assumptions is the same in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see by frequenting the chapels and cathedrals . It is not in either that the great displays of taste , genius , imagination or learning are made ; but it is in the unprivileged , dissenting , and Protestant independent churches . By the same token the ecclesiastical is ever faithful to the political system with which it lives , and consents cheerfully to the sacrifice of the most splendid ornaments among its priests and clergy . Persecutions fell on the eminences of the church of the Middle Ages as lightning falls on the peaks of cliffs , and the tallest trees of the forest and the plain . Luther , Calvin , Wickliffe , Zuingle , Erasmus , Melanothon , were the targets of the Pope , and of the satellites of the Papacy . And , before our own eyes , we have just seen the removal of the high* est candlesticks of the Galhican church // from their places , and their exile and extinction . Lammenais and Lacordaire , the prodigious fountains of most wonderful written and spoken eloquence , have been silenced , the former by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despotism it embraces and entwines - by the Pope and the President . But , in a democratic republic , the interests of all and the advantage of none , is the foundation stone of the political edifice , which is , consequently , incapable of priestly domination , and may be considered alone . They can not co-exist one or the other speedily or ultimately perishes . Where all have the same interests there will be justice , in the vast majority of cases and above that , the people , from the day of the foundation of such a system , begin to learn their own rights , and the due exercise of them , and every man in the state knows the fundamental principles of government correctly . As it is by that means that the peace is preserved , and the superficial interests of society , with some more profound , should be committed , by democratic means , to the very best men how can be found . We confess that we can not say such is the effect where the convention system , ( and consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment in the state constitutions , which we will indicate , conventions themselves would be killed , except for the Presidency , and for that office the tribunal intended by the constitution is much preferable . Universal suffrage , universal eligibility to office , short terms of service , and pay of members , with the ballot , are all the means the masses want under the fundamental law , to secure themselves the best possible administration and enactments . The universal choice , in theory at least , is consulted , and the universal mind and heart of the country is assayed for the very purpose of finding the gold in its purest shape . The term of office is short , so that the constituent retains his interest in government , and yet the representative does not forget his responsibility , nor do aspirants lose their zeal . None are too poor to serve the country in its councils , for which they are paid , and the rich therefore , can not monopolize positions . None are excluded , on the contrary , for the opposite reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it . Thus , selected by ballot , and constantly amenable to instruction , about six thousand state and federal legislators assemble annually for periods of three to eght months , and the prizes of ambition , interested or disinterested , are subjects of impartial contest . He that proves , by his superior talent , tact , temper , wisdom , and virtue that he is capable of taking and keeping the intellectual lead at all events , if not the official , is sure to command it , whoever may be the lieutenant held up by honors to the vulgar eye . And this leader is the leader , howsoever his authority may be kicked against , and whatsoever may be the pitiable airs of the nominal rulers and paper captains . Such , with divided power , was Calhoun ; such also , and likewise , was Clay ; and such is Webster . These , three men , have gone before their generation , like true leaders , instead of skulking after , and had it not been for the bribery of patronage and the jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest honors to their account , and the latter , at least , would have sustained a less disastrous contest with a small rival in reality , though , like the owl , very large in appearance , and , for the same reasons , purblind , as well as superficial . The French have a proverb , by-the-way , which applies peculiarly to General Scott , " What is lighter than the wind ? A feather . What is lighter than a feather ? A woman . What is lighter than a woman ? Nothing . " But , with all his avoirdupois , the hero of Lundy 's Lane is rather lighter than his own feathers , for he has the largest superfices of the most braggart vanity that ever held a Virginia gentleman above the ether itself , and that as regularly as the day begins and ends . When , therefore , reader , thou regardest the artificial plume , ( for what huge yellow bird is known to naturalists ? ) take special notice that the busy brain beneath , and the restless eye , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for incense , and the eye for praise , make up a mortal far more disdainful of the earth and the commerce of mankind than the renal creaturcs of Blanchard or Wise , Godard or Clayton. * We can not help * We mean not John M. bet ft . M. Clayton here , aithoegh we are qaite aware that it will be difficult // speaking lightly of so imponderable a subject , and protest that we are sorry for haying been betrayed into it by the extraordinary levity of the last Baltimore convention . We stipulate not to give similar offence soon again , although to make the feathers fly is the most popular of all occupations , and the temptation will come upon us sorer from month to month , till the winter flight of birds of passage , and ill and good omen , from these hyperborean latitudes . The distinctions won by Mr. Clay in a lengthened and laborious life are imperishable . " Recorded honors , " in the language of Junius , " will cluster round his monument , and thicken over it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirs will be dimmed by those other noble and enduring chaplets of immortal laurel which already crown the tomb of Calhoun , and are woven for their great competitor . Speaking again of these celebrities brings to mind the contrast of their oratory with the elegaic eloquence which was so prodigally lavished upon the death of Mr. Clay . It was , with one exception a fearful falling off from the usual standard of such occasions : it was infinitely below the corresponding efforts of the great senators so often mentioned . It was not even speaking , for the most part ; it was lecturing . It did not come from its place in the heart , but from the memory or the manuscript . These are no repositories for eulogiums on the recently departed . It is within our province to comment upon this proceeding , and we make it with no other view than the amendment of the gentlemen who feel called upon to rise ; and further , to preventthe delivery , on such occasions , of twenty or thirty manufactured speeches , which were not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call " damnable iteration " in any other ceremony . There is a propriety in such things that should control the number as well as the kind of speeches . It is a moment when Buncombe should be let alone , and the mouth should only speak out of the abundance of the feelings . Some one man in either branch of Congress should have been ready in this case of a long anticipated dissolution of the Kentucky senator to speak to it with all the passion , eloquence , and finish which was due to the time , the place , and the dead . All would have listened , all would have been attention , all would have been affected , all would have been , impressed , and a magnificent public duty would have been magnificently discharged . In the eyes of the world such a scene would not be unworthy ; into the ears of the world its language would find entrance , and from the universal memory of mankind , future ages could always collect at least fragments of the discourses . It had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the speech of Mr. Breckenridge , who was singled out by the public expectation , not less from his locality so long represented by Mr. Clay , and always having been his manhood 's residence , and for ever to reto distinguish these intrepid aeronauts , since the main , his final resting place , as by the former is just pluming is ostrich for his native speaker 's own superior powers of thought , skies . It is probable that one of these illustrious expression , and oratory . He combined gentlemen , however , will be about as successful in qwq it the utmost inflation short of bursting . For this his inspirat qwq and without straining , as duty to every body , including , first , the deceased , and , secondly , himself aud his constituents , required of the orator . In the Senate , the youngest member made decidedly the most fitting discourse in the words , and , we have understood , the most thrilling in the delivery : - Senator Clemens , who is , in appearance , almost as youthful as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that one advantage possessed by Mr. Clay , and shared by Mr. Calhoun , was , that no convention system came and went , like a guilty mercenary , between them and the great , cordial , and honest masses of the people . The system is unknown in South Carolina , and probably owing to the individual presence of her great man . Whether she can keep clear of it in the strife of those who succeed to her affections , depends upon their nearness or remoteness to his loftiness ? ind spotlessness of public life and private character . We so much love , so truly admire , the pluck and talent of that gallant state , which has so well served the constitution , by her constant war of self-defence , that we put confidence for the future , even in her politics . Our confidence in her is not of slow growth ; but nevertheless it is an evergreen-an immortal , which we cherish , because she deserves it . Mr. Clay 's poSitiQn in Kentucky has been the same as Mr. Calhoun 's , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be looked for elsewhere than in either . If it had taken root there before the day of these statesmen , it is certain that it and each of them would have come into conflict , and that they or it would have prevailed , for their co-existence was just as irrational as a privileged sect among a democratic people . There could , logically be nothing between the thing and such men but perpetual war till there came an overthrow . The great obfection to conventions are , that they are too often composed of the active , packing , trading , shuffling little politicians , of counties and districts , in which the choice is to be made of the candidate , who have natural repugnance to a great mind , and so instinctively rebel , by force of clamor and of numbers , their only weapons , against him . Their procedure is extremely siniplc . It is to collect all the office seekers and office-holders at the primary meetings for appointing delegates ; and then have the most insignificant of these sent to the county convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek out every petty story , or invent some , to combine all the other minutice whose dignity has been offended , or whose claims are in danger , and by " bargaining , intrigue , and corruption , " to prevent the selection ever going beyond themselves , as it must do , if it be worth anything . And wilat does it amount to ? For in all the earth , is there a more moving spectacle than to see an old convention bell-wether in Congress or the Legislature , when men are in requisition and called upon to face an emergency ? Mr. Wirt , in his early and classical prod uction , the OLD BACHELOR , has done most graphic equity to such a creature , who got into the Assembly at Richmond , from his county . We commend the reader to his anatomy of both speaker and hearer ( himself ) when Noodle rose to address the house in relation " to some ingrievances which aggnjfied his constitutes very much . " Mr. Wirt is not the only man who has been compelled to hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortcomings of just such a representative . In a short time he describes himself as standing fire in agony ; and for the gingerly way in which he edged out of the crowd , and dodged all inquiry after his residence , we must ask that the book itself be consulted . It is long since we read it , but it will be longer yet before we forget its satire . We despair doing the subject of his sarcasm any justice , if for no other reason simply because he has touched it and Non tetiget qood non ornavit . Now then , the way to defeat these double cunning delegates who get into all sorts of conventions for their unfitness and upon their own recommendation solely , we would propose the sensible change of the State Constitutions which would allow the choice of members from any part of the same State , by any constituency . For instance , that the county of New York , might , if it pleased , select an Albany or Canandagna man , or vice versa . That this isnotso , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there is // nothing in our Constitution , State or Federal , to prevent its practice in the election of our Congressmen . In France it was a provision of the Constitution of 1849 ; and it is the practice in England . Residence in the county or district for twelve months is now generally required of Senators and Representatives as a qualification for State officers . But this is not defensible . Residence has nothing to do with a candidate 's qualifications ; and the electors are unfairly deprived of the largest liberty of choice from among all the citizens of the State , by a restriction . The reader must not confound this matter with elections by districts and counties , instead of general state ticket . We are in favor of such elections because - they preserve the rights of the minority , and especially give to reformers living in any small section of the State a chance to be heard , which would not be so under a general ticket system . What could be more sensible than for any section of a State entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allegiance . But , it is objected he must belong to the place to know the local wants of his constituents . We reply , that they are the best judges of the man whom they want , and that they will not select one liable to such a charge of unfitness . And look for a moment at the advantages of such a range of choice . It has been shown in this paper that great men come in clusters , and we may add , that at least , in the Northern States they appear in cities where the exertion of the mind is promoted by every stimulant of knowledge . rivalry , interest and ambition . But only one or two can now be sent to Congress or the Legislature , and as in all our cities it happens that either party , as the case may be , has a sure majority , the machinery aforesaid is always used to insure the selection of mediocrity . If it were otherwise , then it would be of immense advantag* to both parties , and to the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose an inferior man , when there were better men , it would be the policy of another county of the same politics and more sagacity , to chose from among the rejected ; and the contrast of the two members in business would be a powerful check upon their favoritism The Whigs of another county than New York , we will suppose , would chose some chieftian of that city as their man , and so compel the democrats to put forward their strongest man . Besides these considerations , there are two others . Men up for the office , would , certainly , have a little chance of being selected on their merits and peculiar sets , opinion could as soon as they get strong enough in their own locality to elect , take the representative in the whole State who could advocate their views . Perhaps within the district not one could be found who could do any justice to their wishes and their feelings and interests . They would be sure of the strongest men of their faith , and that is a great deal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth begins in the individual mind , it penetrates a few followers , it makes reluctant proselytes ; it gets a hearing , and soon controls affairs , and ends by moving the world . LegislalAve bodies are the organs through which much of the light is shed on the path of humanity , which is very extraordinary , considering their composition . They might be made infinitely more effective , if they were properly constituted . We would be in favor of such an amendment , not only because of its intrinsic merits , but because it would be a perfect bomb in the camp of the poor devils who grind the ungreased and creaking machine of party , till one is as begrimed as the other . We have had enough of the ancient shams and formulas , the wind bags and sand bags , the riff-raff and fagends of a past age which claims respectability still , although it ought all to be sent to Coventry . In a previous number we promised a suggestion to purify at least the convention system , and we shall keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shall speak of them pointedly and with benefit . We are least of all , satisfied with the representation of the Atlantic and other great cities , in Congress , and in the respective State Legislatures and we attribute it . not to the absence of merit , or to the wilfulness of the constituency , but to the filthy workers of the rusty wires which make a paltry , packed , imbecile county caucus of either party , so much in stench and nastiness , like a rat-trap which has been long in an ancient and vermin infested // family . We perceive that Mr. Benton declares for nominations made directly by mass meetings of the people . He has characteristically overlooked the liability of such Oflfl*t ? flS to the sudden frenzies which . overtake all the overgrown , elephants and crowds particularly , and the contradictory action of one mass meeting and other and as large mass meeting . If Mr. Benton will not look into that , as he does into almost every thing , a second time , we will have to stimulate him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not to be freely consulted , and to labor hard , if necessary . Indeed , this convention system is his Augean stable , or he is no Hercules , which we are sure he will not admit ; and if he should do so , he will convince no one else . The matter merits deliberate and frequent discussion in the Democratic party paramountly . We will venture to make some suggestions which constitute an intelligible and better plan perhaps , than the one so long in use for nominations . This is done under correction , for we are opposed to remedies which can be shown to be worse than the disease , but to do good , it is convenient to present something tangible , and hear what people have to say . Reform or repeal of the convention system is evidently , at hand , and before long those who turn their l2ack to suggestions , will hear the latter become a party watchword . No party worthy of the name will submit , permanently , to any regime which ostracises its best men and selects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party politics , and may take off most of what is worth recognizing in the pride of our boasted institutions Our propositions will be very intelligible and short . They are in the alternative . In the first place , the business of nomination could be managed by the popular vote , in the usual way , or by viva voce voting at the polls . But then a plurality of voters should secure the nomination of the candidate who stood highest on the list . The polls should also be kept open at least one day , so that all the votes could be taken , instead of a few hours at night , as is the case in some of the larger cities . And rowdies , with every sort of appearance of force should be promptly put down and kept under , or the result should be cancelled , and a new vote be taken , in any ward or precinct , which had been so outraged in the exercise of its own rights . In the second place , there is a mode by which the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nomination of the party ticket , there should be sent a printed list to the house of every Democratic voter , with all the names of the*. candidates seriously asking for any of the offices . This list might be torn from the newspaper where one is printed , or the impression could be struck from that column of advertisements on fresh paper . It would cost very little ; it could be readily sent to the voters , and both duties could be attended to by the candidates , or more properly by a committee . That done-what would follow ? Why the best possible result which can flow from the representative system of government ; -  --  the best-tIme very best of the respective parties would be called out by the people . And thus it would be managed . For a week , the formation of the ticket would be the fireside topic in which the father would take the lead , and the mother , and sons not old enough to vote , could canvass the merits of the candidates . The result of this domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the packed convention ticket , or any form whatever of excited and violent selection . The thing would be , at least , dispassionately done , and done upon discussion-it would have the further distinguishing advantage of being influenced by the household gods . What earthly opposition can be placed on tenable ground against this plan . It is cheap and easy , and can not be falsified for the voter after having erased all the superfluous names , should sign his name , and hold the ticket ready for the call of the person duly authorized to collect them . When they had been counted and compared , the majorities would indicate the proper candidates , and the party ticket would be nominated by the plurality . We request objections , for really none of much weight present themselves . On comparison of such a plan , which we know has worked well in certain very extensive localities in another country , with the convention system , one is shocked with the contrast* and over the now being tried experiment of double elections by the popu // lar vote system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at great loss of time of money and of patience ; and in spite of repeated failures , proves that people are ripe for some radical alteration of the system of nominations throughout this country . It is really a theme which deserves study , and which the best minds may profitably condescend to examine . Thecostof failure , which we now pay is in the positive discount on talent , and the highest premium on inanity , under which regimegenius sickens and intellect shrinks away to hide its discouragement . We might welcome again , and we ardently desire to welcome to our legislative halls , me-n as distinguished as the great luminaries which are sinking , like dying day , into darkness . We hid them welcome ; we bid them not to despair , and we promise them that thrift instead of following fawning , shall wait on true desert . Of one thing the young and rising talent of the United States , so soon to enter as most important integers upon the political *4ge , may be confidently assured . And that is , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the IDEMOCRATIO REvIEW . In an age of revolution they are prominent among the natural leaders of the people . We trust they will do battle for their position with faith , hope and courage , as we shall inevitably continue to do until the ancient abuses of party and sect are entirely removed . The language of Mr. Clay on a memorable occasion , even more than his undaunted conduct under all circumstances , may he here most appropriately quoted and remembered . Ahout ten years ago , he was charged in the Senate with wanting the courage belonging to his character and prominence . He replied in tones which have supported us throughout the recent convulsion of the democracy , and which we commend to those for whom we are writing those remarks , a class not more distinguished for their over modesty than for their merit . " I thank God , " said he , " for having given me a soul incapable of fear from the wrath of any being but himself . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
