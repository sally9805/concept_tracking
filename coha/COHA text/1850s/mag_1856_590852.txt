PIROGRESSIVE INFLUENCE OF AMERICAN LIBERTY . LIBERTY can not prosper but in a sphere congenial with its own spirit . Like many plants of noble growth , it must have a soil and an atmosphere of its own , and if you deprive it of these , you deprive it of the nourishment and support necessary to its vitality . When an imperious interdict was laid on the vessel in which , it is said , Cromwell and llampden had embarked in order that they might enjoy the blessings of freedom in the wilderness of the new world , the measure , it may be supposed , was denounced as an act of unqualified tyranny , as it undoubtedly was , while the friends of liberty , at a subsequent period , could not but congratulate each other on a proceeding which secured to their cause two of its bravest and most distinguished champions . And yet it may be doubted , after all , whether these two prominent individuals would not have flourished more on the inhospitable shores of America , than they afterwards did in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , for a time , seemed to be so remarkably successful . In the one case they would have been unobstructed and unopposed by the adverse influences proceeding from a stupid and habitual submission to a tyrant , while in the other we know that these influences pursued them with relentless malignity , and shed a discouraging and opposing influence around them , even when they thought themselves most secure in permanently establishing the just rights of a struggling and oppressed people . So true is it , that in almost every instance of revolutionary reform , men are impelled forward more by their feelings than their principles . And hence it is easy to account for the excesses which , in nine cases out of ten , disfigure and disgrace the course of political revolutions . The great mass of those who take an active part in these struggles , are governed by no fixed principles of right and justice . All their feelings are tumultuary and impulsive . They are swayed to and fro by men who are more selfish and more cunning than themselves . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptive of bad influences tomorrow . If they sigh to be delivered from their yoke of // oondage at one time , they passively go back to their own servitude at another . If they now follow the standard of a republican party leader at the North , they will again fall back into the ranks of a leading royalist at the South . They stand in the midst of conflicting interests , and ten chances to one but they favor those impressions at last , which they received in early life from example , education , and habit . John Milton was a model patriot-wise , firm , temperate , patient-and when he saw the Commonwealth in England established on the downfall of monarchy , although it was reared over the bloody tomb of a royal victim , we may suppose he felt in his bosom a strong feeling of complacent satisfaction . Tie could not but believe that the momentous struggle had ended well for his country , and that , henceforward , liberty might be proclaimed to the captive both in Church and State . Had any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in behalf of English liberty was more apparent than real , he would have discredited the assertion as an unworthy slander on the sublime sacrifices of patriotism , and , in proof of its absolute falsehood , would have pointed triumphantly to the strength and freedom of his disenthralled country . Had any one told him that the little band of Pilgrims-landing on the rock of Plymouth-hewing their way through the wilderness-facing the cold blast of the winter-storm-sinking beneath the hardships of a civil encampment-dying from famine and pestilencepromised more for the successful establishment of freedom in the world , than all the marching and counter-marching , the skirmishing and fighting , the parading of troops , and the providing of munitions of war , had done in England-he would have listened in stupid bewilderment to the improbable story , and would have declared that it altogether transcended his comprehension and belief . And yet Milton was a man of powerful understanding , as well as of powerful philanthropy . He loved the truth no less than he loved mankind and he had studied much , and labored much in behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in all probability he would have forgotten that , while many might be brought to see the truth as he did , few were able to follow it with the same degree of devotion and constancy . He would have forgotten that men 's passions are stronger than their understandings , that they are every moment in danger of being carried away by their sympathies and affections , and that the only safe way of guarding them against evil examples and evil influences , is to transport them beyond the spheres of their pre // sent associations . Hence , he could not rightly have appreciated the benefits of isolation in the wilderness to the cause of civil liberty . It might have been difficult to convince him that it did not only require freedom of thought , but likewise freedom from all external bad influences , to secure the blessings of a corresponding degree of political emancipation . It is obviously necessary to avoid bad influences if we wish to maintain the integrity of our moral and spiritual states , and the rule will hold equally good in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither Milton , nor any of his contemporaries , could anticipate the mighty consequences that were to flow from the emigration of a few of his persecuted countrymen to the wilds of America . These consequences could only be known from experience-from the example of independent thought in a young and vigorous people , and from the successful establishment of an equally free and independent form of government . The establishment of a good political government is no more dependent on certain prescribed rules for its efficiency and success , than the establishment of a good religious character is dependent on a confession of faith for its purity and holiness . In both these cases the written confession borrows its distinctive features from man , and not man from the written confession . The articles of our belief it is true , address themselves to our understandings ; but however sound or orthodox they may be , if they fail to reach our hearts at the same time , there is great danger that they will be profaned and violated . We are disposed to argue with Cowper , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only so , but that all liberty , that is , all noble and independent thought , is eminently sublime and spiritual . It underlies the foundation of every thing that is useful , exalted , and diffusive . It hallows the aspirations of the wisest and the best of men . It consecrates the holiest purposes of life . It is progressive and etherial , and , like the sun in the firmament of heaven , it moves majestically forward in its orbit , shedding light and warmth wherever its benign rays are permitted worthily to affect the heart . But as the vegetable world is differently influenced by the light and heat of that same sun , some plants sending forth a profusion of the most delightful and odorous flowers , and others a like abundance of noxious and poisonous fruits , so liberty is pr9ductive of c , ood or evil according to the reception it meets with from men . It can only flourish and bring forth good fruit where there are understandings and affections to receive it happily . // ft can be of little benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand from the light and heat dispensed by its munificent rays . Nay , it may poison all the springs of life in such as are not prepared for its glorious visitation . Its peculiar properties will be felt as they were by the actors in the French iRevolution . Instead of a beautiful development of order , benevolence , and virtue , we shall have exhibited to our sight the most loathsome features of disorder , selfishness , and profligacy . That there is a Providence which shapes the course of men , very few people of the present age will undertake to deny , although we have reason to believe there are too many who habitually overlook and forget it . That there is an equally watchful Providence , shaping the course of nations , is a truth quite as obvious , and perhaps not the less generally acknowledged than the other . In no single instance , so far as we may judge from profane history , has this last truth been more signally illustrated than in regard to our own happy and flourishing country . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that principally which embraced our struggle for independence . The most interesting , if not the most remarkable , portion of all history , is its commencement . And far the most remarkable part of our own , is comprised within the period of our growing importance as colonies , and our subsequent release from the political wrongs imposed on us by Great Britain . The prominent events connected with the early history of our country , can not be deemed less than extraordinary , when considered in reference to their perfect adaptation to accomplish the purposes of a mighty revolution in the world , in political feeling and sentiment . The crew of the Mayflower was composed of men not only of remarkable characters , but of remarkable experience . Their first great object had been to avoid the intolerance of a cruel government-their next was to escape the intolerance of equally cruel men . Tbe measures of Charles were not more arbitrary and tyrannical , than the mockery and contempt of their fellow-subjects were insolent and mortifying . The peculiar habits and prejudices of the Puritans enlisted for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nay , these very habits and prejudices , which were dearer to them than any thing else-which formed important in redients in their religious hopes and experience - for which they had been willing to forego their just rank and station in society-for which they suffered in public , and // prayed in private-these were not only charged against them as follies and infirmities , but , even in many instances , visited on their heads as crimes and misdemeanors . Nor must we suppose they were insensible to the rudeness and injustice they were doomed to suffer at the hands of their oppressors . It was the clearness of their understandings that gave the more poignancy to their sorrows . It was the sharpness of their discernment that probed their bosoms the most deeply and most severely . Decried , insulted , and neglected , they writhed in terrible agony under the stings of their tormentors , and nothing but the meekness of their religions profession prevented them from exercising in their turn a corresponding spirit of retaliation and revenge . Such were the Puritan Nonconformists in the time of Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of enjoying a more liberal indulgence of their peculiar feelings and sentiments . But experience soon taught them that Holland itself was no refuge from the cruelty and intolerance of religious bigotry . If they suffered less from the government there , perhaps , they suffered more from the people . At all events they met with no congenial fellowship amongst the orders of religious men with whom they had gone to associate , and the sympathy they found it impossible to command they resolved for ever to relinquish . For this purpose they prepared to sever the connections which bound them to the soil of Europe , and to seek for an asylum and a resting-place on the inhospitable shores of America . Here , then , was an extraordinary band of resolute adventurers  --  a handful , it is true , but a most remarkable handful -- placed under extraordinary circumstances . We will not say they had precise indications of the mission they were about to fulfill . Perhaps they were as little acquainted with the full purposes confided to them , as they were with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps they had no other object in view than to subdue the incorrigible wilds around them , and render them fit habitations for the enjoyment of that exemption from religious persecution they could find nowhere else . But we have said they were placed under extraordinary circumstances . A mighty continent was before them . A mighty ocean divided them from the rest of the civilized world . If they were still exposed to the encroachments of English law , they were at least exempt from the scoffing and contempt of English insolence . The savage wilderness was a guarantee for their immunity from savage perse // cution . It was better to suffer the cruelty of the elements , than to be exposed to the more relentless cruelty of blind intolerance . It was better to endure hunger , cold , and nakedness , all the horrors of want and disease , than to face the bitter scorn of intractable selfishness . One great object of this little band of adventurers was obtained , and that was religious liberty . If another object , of equal importance to the welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enthusiasm , it was at least likely to follow with almost the same certainty , and that was political liberty . We are not sure that these two noble prerogatives will bear to be sundered for a moment , not even in the wilderness . They are the inseparable constituents of one system and one government . They follow each other as adhesively as Ruth declared it to be her intention to follow Naomi : " Whither thou goest I will go , and where thou lodgest I will lodge . Thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God . " The crew of the Mayflower , calm , considerate , and determined as it was , may not have thought of this at first , but it was verified in all their views and proceedings afterwards . They pondered no scheme of life , they made no onward progress , they provided no future good , that was not moved and animated by the noble impulses of the spirit of liberty . We have said that freedom of conscience , and freedom of enjoying an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet a striking and painful deviation from this rule , or at least , a selfish modification of it for a brief period , may be noticed , perhaps , in the policy and practice of these very Pilgrims . This , too , is the more remarkable , as the rule is subverted on that side of it where we should have expected to see it become the more unyielding and inviolate . What we mean is this . At the very time when their triumph had been complete-when they had found themselves entirely freed from the trammels of ecclesiastical despotism-when they ought to have erected an altar to religious toleration-they began to trouble and persecute each other . So true is it that our blind selfishness often leads us to deprive others of those very privileges , which we ourselves once claimed as part of our inherent and inalienable rights . The fact is one painful to record , and of mortifying humiliation to the pretensions of the human understanding and heart . But in the instance of the Pilgrims , it left civil liberty unharmed and triumphant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken full possession of the human breast . That which was first had become last , and the // last was first . And yet , as we have said , they were so inseparably united , that they must necessarily grow and flourish together . iReligious persecution could endure but for a season . And now we approach the signs of a coming change , which was destined to reform and regenerate the world . The cloud no bigger than a man 's hand began to assume a visible significance , promising joy and refreshment to the longing hearts of a multitude of people . It hung in the far distance like a speck on the horizon , only dimly seen and not fully heeded ; but it was , nevertheless , preparing to open the windows of heaven , in order to let down the blessings of a new era of light and liberty . It might not come soon , it might be necessary that it should undergo the slow transformations incident to all revolutions of substantial benefit to mankind , it might wait the purposes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladdening the hearts of men , and promising to come in its appointed time . It was remarkable that the first determinate show of hostility on the part of the colonists against the mother.country , involved no important principle either of disaffection on the one side , or misgovernment on the other . The trifling taxes laid on the exports and imports of the colonies , created some dissatisfaction on their part , but this was speedily arrested by the members of the Long Parliament , who felt disposed to extend every kind of indulgence to their Puritan brethren of NewEngland . After the Restoration a greater degree of concern was experienced by the latter , on account of their colonial rights and privileges . But no opposition to any measure of the parent government was expressed , nor does it appear that any was intended . And even when the duty on stamps , and other similar measures , was resorted to by the British govern ment , it may be doubted whether there was any decided purpose to oppress on their side , or to rebel on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Great Britain the tyranny would have been greater ; in any other people than that of the colonies the opposition would likewise have been greater . The whole contest seemed to involve a question of expediency , rather than one of right and supremacy . Had the British government been less proud , and less apprehensive of encroachments on her royal authority ; had she sought more to secure than to exercise her power ; had she been content to see her colonies flourishing and happy , without becoming jealous of their prosperity , it might have been much longer before they would have violated their faith and allegiance . So on // the other hand , had the people of the colonies been less vigilantly sensitive to the rigors of the parent power ; had they paid less regard to her assumptions of authority than to their own happiness ; had they looked more to the substance of tyranny than to the form of it , there is no telling how soon their misguided step-dame might have seen the extravagance of her folly , and ruled with less rigor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like all family jars , the quarrel was pregnant with faults on both sides . The parent was blind and dictatorial ; the children were petulant and disobedient . We say this was the state of things at the commencement of the quarrel . As the breach widened , circumstances became more alarming and desperate . If the children complained more , the parent did not chastise the less : and as the latter possessed the greater degree of power , the former were beaten with a still greater number of stripes . Such a contest could not but end in a total disruption of the ties which bound the parties together . When Lord North repealed the Port Duties , in 1770 , retaining , however , the obnoxious tax on tea , he offered a direct insult to the whole body of the American colonists . The announcement was made in emphatic language , that Great Britain not only had a right to tax her colonial subjects , but that , in spite of all their remonstrances , she was determined to exercise that right . This declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ j ust government , and in the freedom of the British Constitution itself . What was intended as a concession was , by the reservation of this obnoxious principle , converted into a cause of opposition the most obstinate and uncompromising . The spirit of liberty no longer paused at the prospect of a speedy separation from the mother-country . The impending crisis was now regarded by many as certain and inevitable . The debated question was not one of forbearance and negotiation , but involved all the realities and horrors of a bloody war . Thus ended the first period of colonial trial and conflict . It was one of doubt and perplexity , of alarm and hesitation , of courage and preparation . But another was approaching of fierce and desperate action ; a period whose busy doings and mighty consequences were to be felt in all parts of the civilized world . In the foregoing remarks we have spoken of the Pilgrims alone , and we have described them as a company of extraordi - nary men placed under extraordinary circumstances . They shared with the savage tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continefit . They brought with them to their new habitations a strong sense of religious obligation , and , perhaps , a still stronger love of religious freedom . Having separated themselves from the masses of civilized society , they found it necessary to incorporate into their institutions of government the elements of a new organization , adapted to the peculiar circumstances under which they were placed . Their Yove of religious toleration engendered in their minds a corresponding love of civil and political liberty , and although their first object regarded the duties they owed to God , yet , as pious men and good citizens , it was impossible they should fbrget the duties they owed to themselves and to each other . Hence it was they watched with jealous scrutiny every movement , having for its object the control alid regulation of their social and individual rights . So long as these were not essentially violated by the corrupt ambition and selfishness of their rulers , they were willing to exercise an exemplary share of patience and moderation in all their proceedings . But as soon as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rulers at subjugation and slavery , they indignantly unsheathed the sword in defense of their liberties , and threw away the scabbard . But there were other men who were now brought forward to share with them in the sufferings and achievements of the coming contest . From Massachusetts to Georgia the beacon - fires had been kindled on every hill , and a thousand miles of the Atlantic Coast were lit up with the blazing torches of the revolution . Precisely the same spirit that was animating the bosoms of the Pilgrims and their descendants  --  the same strong love of liberty  --  the same strong abhorrence of slavery-the same indomitable courage  --  the same unflinching resolutioncaused the other Colonists to fling the banner to the breeze , and to pledge themselves to conquer or perish under its ample folds . It was a spectacle that attracted the attention of admiring nations . And yet there were few individuals in the world apprised of its singular moral grandeur and sublimity . Other men might fight for their altars and their firesides-they might rally in defense of their persons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ambition . But here was a noble band of enlightened patriots-young in expeiience , but strong in the faith of republican principles-scarcely noticed by the world-yet aiming at setting that world an example of free government , prizing nothing so highly as rational // liberty , and claiming it as a blessing intended for men of all nations and of all climes . The exigencies of a crisis so important and eventful , required not merely the talents of one order of men to meet them successfully , but a diversity and combination of powers of different capacities in different individuals . And it is remarkable how admirably these powers were parcelled out to the prominent leaders in our revolutionary struggle . Military skill and courage-prudent and enlightened statesmanship-warm and patriotic eloquence-all were brought into requisition as the country needed their services . It was not Washington alone , or Adams alone , or Franklin alone , or Jefferson alone-it was not the peculiar abilities of either of these distinguished individuals , or of any other great men of that period-that shortened the time of our vassalage to the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indebted to one individual than to another for the kind of services he was qualified to render to his country : but the services would have availed us but little without the exercise in other quarters of powers almost equally transcendent and meritorious . The achievements of the American revolution were not the work of a single arm , or a single tongue , or a single head . These achievements were manifestly the creations of an overruling Providence-of a wisdom that showed itself in every department of the republic necessary to carry on the war-of a strength and ability that pervaded the army and the Senate-of a spiritual influence that warmed and animated the minds of soldiers , of statesmen , and of orators . What wonderful men were raised up and qualified for their respective stations by the events of that remarkable revolution ! Washington managed the affairs of a campaign with a degree of wisdom , foresight , and patience , that has astonished the world . He discarded all the ordinary modes of fighting-he transcended all the ordinary modes of suffering-he denied himself all the ordinary modes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his greatest trials . It would be doing that distinguished man gross injustice to suppose that he was compelled to endure no greater hardships than those inseparable from his station as the commander of a raw , undisciplined , and unprovided army-as the leader of regiments of dispirited , ragged , and newly-raised recruits , against hosts of well-trained and successful regulars . His station was one of more perplexing peril , as well as one of more mortifying humiliation . His greatest merit , as we have hinted , was his self-denial , and dur // ing the time he was busy in exercising this difilcult-and almost superhuman virtue-superhuman at least for a soldier - his enemies were equally busy in misrepresenting his motives , and despoiling his character . His sufferings were only known to himself-they were concealed in the inner chambers of his own manly bosom . The trials he was called to encounter were not ordinary trials  --  the sacrifices he was called to make were not ordinary sacrifices . They were the offerings of a pure and noble heart  --  but of a heart little known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleeding countryindignantly feeling the wrongs inflicted on him by his enemies - burdened with public cares and with private sorrows  --  but resolved under Providence to brave all and to suffer all in the cause of human liberty . With such a man as Washington for a leader , how remarkable it is that we should have had such men as Hancock , and Adams , and Jefferson , for his compatriots and advisers ! All these , as well as many others , were brought within that same spiritual influence which we have already adverted to as being involved in the benignant designs of a kind and merciful Providence . We do not mean by this , that they were absolutely better men than the mass of individuals around them , *although for the purposes they had in view they were certainly wiser and more intelligent . This wisdom and intelligence was more wonderful than any thing connected with our revolutionary struggle . It fitted them for the part they were to act in the great drama before them . It identified them with the events of coming time , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls a deep sympathy for men of other climes and of other nations . It instructed their minds in the lofty principles of truth and justice . It opened to their view the fundamental constituents of all good government . It allayed their fearsit quickened their hopes-it brightened their prospects . It brought them into a communion of feelings , and wishes , and projects , of momentous importance to the welfare and happiness of the human family . It bound them by indissoluble ties to promote , as far as they were able , the great ends of civil and religious emancipation-for which purpose , and appealing to the Searcher of Hearts for the rectitude of their intentions , they subsequently pledged their lives , their fortunes , and their sacred honors . Is it wonderful that such men as these should have refused all conditions of compromise and conciliation with the British government ? When Lord North , after the surrender of Bur // goyne , offered them peace on their own terms , they refused to accept it . Few of them ever murmured that they had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to suffer in**onceivable hardships in the wilderness . The day had gone by-if it ever had a place in their experience-that could have restored them to the influence of British laws , or the subjugation of British tyrants . Not even Lord Chatham  --  the only great politician in England who seemed rightly to estimate their character  --  the only great man who anticipated with fear and trembling their loss to his country  --  the only great statesman who wept at the folly that had compelled them ever to abjure their allegiance and fidelity-holding a new compact of fraternity and federation in one hand , and pushing aside the wrongs and treacheries that had estranged them from their fealty with the other-thanking God that he was yet spared to speak on a subject of such vital importance to England , and dying in the very act of fulfilling his proffered mission-not even he could have won them back to a renewal of their faith and obedience . Not only had they been goaded by the government of Great Britain into a trial of their own strength , but they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only had they freed themselves from the shackles of slavery , but they had been taught to appreciate the glories and advantages of liberty . It was this spirit of liberty that cheered them under all their discouragementsthat consoled them under all their privations-that supported them under all their hardships-that roused them to renewed efforts under all their disasters and disappointments . It taught them to hope  --  to persevere  --  to struggle manfully for their rights  --  to fight , and at last to conquer . Their sufferings and their bravery were crowned with victory , and they retired from the contest , not less pleased with the blessings it promised to men of other nations , than with the freedom and happiness it had conferred on themselves . And now came the crowning work of all their labors and all their successes . Hitherto they had been principally engaged in repelling the unjust usurpations of a powerful aggressor , and winning back from him the freedom which had been wrested out of their hands . Their next object was to secure this freedom to themselves and their posterity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might justly challenge the applause and emulation of succeeding generations . For this purpose they incorporated into a written constitution the great principles of political and religious liberty , for which they had // fought so bravely , and suffered so successfully . And never was a constitution of government framed with more profound wisdom , or more enlightened sagacity- a wisdom and sagacity not the less wonderful and surprising on account of the circumstances in which they had their origin . From whence had these men the skill and understanding to conceive and plan a work of such practical beauty and utility-of such nice adjustment-of such simple but vast and elevated proportions ? They surely did not borrow their plan from any scheme of ancient or modern polity . They copied nothing from the bald and crumbling structures of European dynasties . As well might they have attempted to extract the pure and humble religion of the Bible from the systems of divinity put forth by proud and bigoted theologians-as well might they have attempted to extract the principles of natural justice from the codes of jurisprudence contained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cumbrous machinery of more learned and confident projectors  --  the rude contrivances of dark and despotic ages  --  and fall back on the simple elements of common sense and common honesty . They turned with loathing and disgust from systems of worldly wisdom , to find an humbler , but a purer and a brighter pattern , in the unsophisticated suggestions of their own hearts . We do not say that their intention was primarily to enlighten the world o* questions of political freedom and equality . Their first object no doubt was to benefit themselves  --  to establish their own freedom on the strong and immutable basis of eternal justice . But in achieving this mighty work of political reformation , they practically sowed the seeds of future progress and improvement on the soil of other nations , where they are destined , sooner or later , to bring forth an abundant harvest of precious and inestimable fruit . Its universal bearing on the future destinies of mankind will be an effect of that divine inspiration  --  a plan of that divine providence-which not only established liberty in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all nations of the civilized globe . What a lesson of profound awe , of thankfulness and admiration , may we learn from the past history of our beloved country ! The great problem of self-government was to be tested on our shores , and it has been tested to the satisfaction of all thinking and reasonable minds . But how was this remarkable experiment commenced and brought to a glorious and successful issue ? We think no one can deny that it was begun and sanctioned by a wisdom superior to our own . The incidents // of a movement so magnificent and important were too remarkable to have happened altogether by chance . In the first place a new world had to be discovered by Columbus . Then came the peopling of this new world by a class of men whose ideas and habits were peculiar-whose love of liberty was strongwhose love of religion was stronger . These men were little conscious at first of their own inherent force and superiority of character , but they were obliged to pass through a process of hardship and suffering every way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by degrees for the still greater hardships and sufferings of the revolutionary conflict . At last that conflict opened on them with terrible effect , but they met it *Vith skill , with courage , and with a degree of fortitude and patience truly astonishing . Up to this time they showed no disposition to swerve from the duty and allegiance which they believed might justly be expected from them by the parent country , but the infatuation of their oppressors was no less striking than their own moderation and forbearance had been submissive and respectful . The consequence was , that the breach continued to widen , until at length the time for reconciliation had completely passed by . Then was exhibited to the world the unanimity  --  the courage  --  the strength  --  the obstinacy-of a young and determined people , declaring themselves independent of all extraneous rule and sovereignty , and casting themselves entirely on their own wisdom and their own resources . This wisdom and these resources were found to be ample for the occasion which called them forth , and they were wielded with powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a people more literally feel the ardor of a sublime and intelligent inspiration . It animated them with hope-it nerved them with courage-it bound them together as one man - it elevated them to liberal and just views of the proper ends of government  --  and it struck a blow for liberty that was felt throughout the civilized world . When that liberty was gained , it was enrolled on the pages of a written constitution , but it was more indelibly inscribed on the hearts and affections of the American people . These were providential means of saving it from being swallowed up in the vortex of political agitations , connected with the ruling dynasties of the old world . But the most effective of all these means consisted in its absolute segregation from foreign interference , and its exclusive custody on the shores of the western continent . Here it attained to its just proportions , and was suffered to dispense its benign influence in the freedom and // vigor of its first expansion . It was suited to no other home , and would have ingloriously perished had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It never could have been reared amidst the restrictions and perversions of European governments . It would have caught an incurable taint from the surrounding catagion , and it would have sunk and been buried in the common mass of political degradation and slavery . It could grow spontaneously but in one soil , and yield its fruits but in one clime . The time had not yet come for its being transplanted under other skies , and in other countries . But it was a plant of rare and commanding beauty and usefulness . It might at least waft its odors to nations abroad , if it could not nourish and revive them with its blossoms and fruits . And may we not hope that they have caught a portion of its spirit - that they have admired its beauty-that they have been moved by its majestic attractions  --  and that sooner or later the Tree of Liberty may overshadow the nations of the earth , as it now overshadows our own growing and happy republic ?               @ @ @ @ @ @
