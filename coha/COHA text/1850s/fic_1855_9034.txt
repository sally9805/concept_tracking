Main text A Literary Martyrdom . BY O. F. BRIGGS . Section A LITTLE EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS AMBITIOUS OF DISTINCTION : COMPILED FROM PAPERS WHICH WERE DISCOVERED IN HIS DESK , AFTER HE HAD LEFT HOME ON A TOUR THROUGH EUROPE . The subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve pages of the present volume , was the son of wealthy but honest parents ; at least they had never been convicted of lareeny , nor of any other crime . We mention the fact of their honesty for the reason that there is a prevalent opinion among a certain class , that in this country , where wealth is so rarely inherited , it can not be honestly obtained ; honesty and fair dealing not being supposed to be favorable to large gains . Though the father was engaged in the most respectable business of importing German dolls and other useful articles , and was one of the safest men down-town , he had enlarged views for his son , and determined to give him what he had always felt the need of himself  --  a thorough education ; that he might have a capital to start with , which no adverse circumstances could deprive him of . Bonds and stocks might prove worthless , banks might fail , and merchandise depreciate in value ; but no changes in the market could affect Latin and Greek ; and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fears for his son . His reasons for attaching so much importance to these valuable languages , could not have been the wealth and importance which they have usually conferred upon those who possessed them in the greatest quantities ; but , whatever the reasons were , they were all-sufficient in his opinion . After leaving college with the degree of A.B. , and as much knowledge as young men usually take from the halls of learning where they graduate , the subject of our memoir very sensibly took a wife , to aid him in combatting and overcoming whatever obstacles he might encounter in his way through the world . Having no leaning toward any particular profession , and feeling quite indifferent whether he earned his living by preaching the Gospel , practising medicine , or promoting litigation , provided he could distinguish himself , he hesitated a long time before he could prevail upon himself what to do , and perhaps he would never have come to any decision upon this important point , had not his father intimated to him , at last , that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition to do something for himself . Marvin , for that happened to be his Christian name , suggested to his father that a year or two spent in Europe might enable him to determine what profession would be best adapted to the bent of his genius . But the father did not see the force of the suggestion , whereupon the son was suddenly illuminated by a brilliant thought , which put an end to discussion and satisfied all parties . He would start a magazine , and distinguish himself as Jeffrey , Brougham , Campbell , Sydney Smith , Kit North , and other illustrious men had done before him , in the same way , and make lots of money beside . Any of the learned professions would require years of patient drudgery to gain respectability even , but here was a plan , now , by which reputation and wealth could be attained at a bound . " Where there is a will there is a way , " is an excellent maxim when there is money to back it up , which happened to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all the operatives whose aid is necessary to further a literary enterprise , are the most amiable , obedient , and manageable of slaves , and always hail , with encouraging cheerfulness , every new attempt to establish a literary undertaking , when they are sure of their pay . Authors , too , forget their caprices , suddenly grow industrious and obliging , genius brightens up , and a thousand friends come forward with manuscripts and advice , under similar circumstances , and with a similar contingency . So the subject of this brief history found , and chuckled with inward delight over the opening glories of his career , as he made his preparations for issuing his first number . There were drawbacks to the business , to be sure  --  a back side to the canvas , which , it was consoling to him to remember , none would see but himself . He would become so prominent an object of popular esteem and curiosity , that he foresaw many annoyances and inconveniences , from being so continually invited to dine with this and that great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renowned prima donnas , to join literary coteries , being bothered for his autograph , and to accept conciliatory and grateful offerings , from authors , artists , and actors ; all these things , to a gentleman of his quiet and unostentatious habits , would prove annoying ; but he heroically straightened his back for the burthen which was to descend upon his shoulders , and resolved to take the bitter with the sweet of his new employment without grumbling . His consolation and reward would be the consciousness of having elevated the tone of popular sentiment , of enlarging the bounds of human enjoyment , and of assisting in the development of American genius , and rewarding native talent . Very likely other men may have entertained some such feelings in embarking in similar enterprises , and they will readily comprehend the emotions of Mr. Smilax , at this momentous period of his career . Our twelve pages will not allow us the pleasure of giving the world an account of the reception of the first number of the magazine , nor permit us to chronicle the gradual change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor , as he day by day discovered he had so wonderfully over-estimated the delights and profits of his enterprise , and so ridiculously under-estimated its troubles and annoyances . How could he have so deluded himself ! Manuscripts poured in upon him by the cart-load , and he was required to read every thing he received , and give a critical opinion upon it the next day . If he accepted an article , he did not thereby make a grateful friend ; but if he refused one , he created an implacable enemy . Illustrious authors did not manifest any of that feverish anxiety for his company to dinner that he had anticipated , unless he acted the part of Amphitryon himself ; and as for his autograph , the only applications he received for it were from certain gentlemen who were anxious to have it on the backs of notes , which they wished to part with . One day , as he sat in the little apartment , which was most absurdly called his " sanctum , " for it was as open to the inroads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heap of manuscripts with aching head and weary eyes , and thinking to himself that the business of enlarging the boundaries of human enjoyment was not half so agreeable an occupation as that of importing German dolls would be , when he was diverted from his desponding thoughts by the sudden apparition of a lady , accompanied by a small boy , who carried a large roll under his arm . " You are the editor , I presume ? " said the lady ; and , having been assured of the correctness of her supposition , she seated herself in the only chair which was vacant in the sanctum  --  all the other seats being filled with bundles of manuscripts , which were waiting to be returned to their authors , or consigned to the balaam-box . The lady then lifted her veil , and taking the roll from the boy , pleasantly informed the dismayed editor , for whom such visitors had long since lost all novelty , that she wished to occupy a few minutes of his time in reading a manuscript novel , which she desired his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , as courteously as his temper would permit him to do ; but she insisted that he would be charmed with the work , and she would permit him to publish it in his magazine . He pointed to the heaps of manuscripts lying all about him , on the shelves , on the tables , in baskets , on the floor , and in the chairs , beside two or three green boxes , which were filled full of accepted articles , waiting their turns to be published , and told her they had all prior claims , which must first be attended to . But ladies who have a point to carry are deaf to all arguments which do not tend to further their purposes , and the strange authoress only smiled more pleasantly than before , and tossing her ringlets from her pale cheeks , said , in her persuasive voice , " Allow me to read you one chapter ? I am sure it will interest you . " " Madam , " replied the beleaguered editor , " I have no doubt of it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story if it pleased me never so much . And then I should only feel the greater regret in being compelled to reject it . " " Ah ! now , " said the lady , " there is the most delightful character in it , and a ghost , and a most mysterious personage . It would make your magazine sell wonderfully . It is just the kind of story which every body says your magazine needs . Let me read you but one chapter ? " A pitcher of water and a tumbler were standing upon the table , and the editor , taking up the pitcher , filled the tumbler full . " There , Madam , " said he , " you see that when a vessel is full it will hold no more ; see , another drop and it overflows . I am full , my room is full , desks , drawers , baskets , boxes , magazine , and all are full . I can receive no more . " " Just one more will make no great difference , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heed to the foreible illustration of the editor , than to smile most benignly and patiently while he demonstrated the simple fact . " Come , let me read my introductory chapter , and I am sure you will want to read the rest yourself . " " Madam , I have been compelled to deny thousands of such requests , " said he , biting his lips . " But a lady ! " said she . " You might refuse to hear a gentleman , but you would not refuse a lady ? " The editor paused a moment , and he was ruined . He was naturally tender-hearted , and he thought of his wife and his mother ; what if either of them should ever be compelled to solicit a favor from an editor ? and how would he feel to hear they had been refused ? " Madam , " said he , with a softened tone , " it is quite impossible for me to hear you read your novel now ; but leave it with me , and I will read it through at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " she said half-doubtingly , as she deposited the roll on his table . " I pledge you my word as a gentleman , " he said . " I will call again soon , " said the lady , who courtsied and smiled , and then retired , followed by her page . But she had scarcely left the sanctum when the wretched man , as he took up the roll of manuscript , and tossed it upon a shelf , where lay heaps of similar bundles , repented of what he had done . " What a fool I was ! " he exclaimed , as he glanced around him , " to make that rash promise ! There is O'Mulligan , who will challenge me if I do not read his essay on the Round Towers ; there is the Reverend Doctor Slospoken , who will denounce me to his congregation , if I neglect his essay on Human Responsibilities ; Professor Verdigriss will speak sneeringly of me to his class , if I am not prepared with an opinion of his article about the Retrocession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be reviewed for my next number . How am I to do all these things , and read that woman 's tremendous manuscript ! I was a madman to make such a promise ! The deuce take her ! But I will not be so caught again . " He gave strict orders that no woman , under any circumstances whatever , should ever again be permitted to enter his sanctum ; and after spending a few more hours at his dreary employment , he went home to his wife , solacing himself with the recollection of his domestic happiness , and repeating to himself a quatrain from some verses which he had addressed to his Maria Jane before their marriage : " Maria , on thy peaceful breast The weary worker seeks repose , And in thy fond affections blest He finds a cure for all his woes . " " A cure for all his woes ! " he repeated to himself , as he put his night-key in the door , and bounding up-stairs into the boudoir of his Maria , was suddenly arrested by discovering her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Smilax was smitten by the sight , and his anxiety to learn the cause of her first sorrow may readily be imagined by husbands who have had a similar experience  --  and what husband has not ? But he then learned that when a wife is most afflicted , there is nothing the matter with her . Mrs. Smilax continued to weep , and at every appeal of her husband , to enlighten him as to the cause of her grief , she would only reply , " Nothing ! " But Smilax knew perfectly well that " nothing , " in this case , meant something dire and calamitous to his domestic peace . After a while , the torrent of his wife 's grief subsided into a sullen and reproachful melancholy , more hard to endure than the most terrifying outbursts of grief and passion . Maria Jane was not one of the Queen Catharine style of wives ; she calmly subsided into the injured innocence state , and personated most effectively the character of a resigned saint , persevering in her sad declaration that nothing had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would all be over soon ; and what was her happiness , if he were only happy ! Smilax went to his office the next day , a thoroughly wretched man ; but his duties were too engrossing to permit him to dwell on his domestic troubles . He had tried in vain to imagine the cause of his wife 's griefs , but he could not call to mind any circumstance which could , in any manner , have awakened her jealousy , or given her reason to shed a tear . What added to his distress was his inability to consult with any of his friends in regard to the matter , or ask advice as to the proper mode of procedure in such cases . The spirit of discontent had entered his paradise , and he was unhappy , and that was all he knew about it . The mail had brought him heaps of letters and manuscripts , all of them requiring immediate attention ; the printer had sent him bundles of proofs , which must be read and returned at once ; and O'Mulligan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for not deciding on his manuscript sooner ; and two elergymen , a lady , a Polish lecturer , and half-a-dozen suspicious-looking men of a very miscellaneous character , were waiting in his ante-room , some to learn his decision in regard to communications already sent , and some to offer him essays and poems . It was a melting hot day ; all the rest of the world had gone to the country or the sea-side ; but he was forced to remain to make up his next number . The perspiration rolled from his clouded brow , as he seated himself at his overburdened desk , and thought of his duties . With a kind of grim desperation , he took up the roll of manuscript which the lady had left him the day before , and smiled scornfully , as he read the title , " A Pledge of Affection . By Pattie Passionflower . " " Another vegetable name in literature ! " he said to himself ; " Poppyflower would be better . I thought , when I received a poem from Carry Cauliflower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end ; but here is another . " He ran his eye rapidly over a few leaves of the manuscript  --  for he had learned the art of judging of the character of a literary performance without reading it all through  --  and remorselessly writing a mystical word upon it , tied up the bundle and threw it into the balaam-box , with a large heap of other rejected offerings to be returned to their owners . This was , at first , a most painful thing for him to do ; for he had himself once been a contributor to a magazine , and he well knew the irritating anxiety which a young author feels for the fate of his manuscript ; and he used to write soothing letters to the poor adventurers whose bantlings he was compelled to reject ; but he had long since become hardened to his duty , and rather felt himself the aggrieved and injured party , when a manuscript was offered to him , which , after being at the cost of reading , he was compelled to reject . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " if they ca n't write better ; why should I be unhappy about it ? " Ah ! little did the public think or care , that , to obtain the one tolerably good essay , which they would find fault with for not being more brilliant , he had been obliged to read through four or five hundred much worse ones . " What does the world care about the troubles or sufferings of any of its servants , who wear their lives out in trying to give pleasure or instruction to others ? Not a straw ! Yet we will be martyrs for the chance smile of approbation which the world now and then bestows upon us  --  slaves of its whims , " said Smilax to himself , as he wended his way home that night , wearied with his day 's work , and half-dreading to meet Maria Jane . The truth was that she had neglected to give him the customary parting kiss , which she had never forgotten to do before . " Forgotten ! " exclaimed Smilax bitterly in his thoughts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on purpose ; she had her handkerchief to her eyes , and she would not allow me to kiss her . I have broken my wife 's heart ; but how I did it I have not the ghost of an idea . I hope she has got over it by this time , though . " But the faint hope was soon withered ; for , as he opened the door , he heard a stifled sobbing , which he knew at once proceeded from Maria Jane ; and worse and more ominous than all , the severe visage of his mother-in-law frowned freezingly upon him , as he entered the room where the wife of his young aflections lay sobbing hysterically upon the sofa . Maria Jane had sent for her mother , and Smilax knew that she would not say that " nothing was the matter , " for that is not the way in which mothers-in-law vent their reproaches . It was a comfort to the distressed husband and editor to feel sure that he would now know the worst , let it be what it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , as he mildly asked what was the matter , the word " Monster ! " fell upon his ear with a clearness and distinctness of utterance that made him hop . " Do n't , mother ! " sobbed out Maria Jane ; " I can die , but I will never reproach him . " What Smilax would have said , or might have said , if he had not been rendered speechless by the strangeness of these proceedings , we must leave the public to imagine . " I do n't wonder at your silence , " said his mother-in-law . " You have killed this suffering angel , and made me childless . " Maria Jane , we may observe , was an only daughter , from which the tender manner of her bringing up may be inferred . " If I have killed her , " said Smilax , meekly , " I am  --  " " I ca n't bear hypocrisy , " said his mother in-law ; " I should think much better of you if you confessed your villainy openly . Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissimulation . " As the word " letter " was named , the suffering angel on the sofa broke out in a fresh agony of hysterical sobs . Smilax took the letter , and with a puzzled expression examined the direction , which was to his wife ; the hand had a very familiar look to him ; but , accustomed as he was to examining so many specimens of handwriting daily , he had but a confused idea of its individual character . He opened the letter with a trembling hand , and had read but a few lines when , to the horror of his mother-in-law , he broke out in a fit of the most obstreperous mirth . Unable to restrain his laughter , he threw himself upon the floor and fairly roared , holding on to his sides with both hands , and kicking his heels as though he were in convulsions . Maria Jane started up wildly , and her mother tried to look very indignant , but felt that she must look very foolish . She knew she had made a mistake ; and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose eyes she had ever striven to appear immaculate , and not liable to any mistakes whatever , was enough to make her feel and look very foolish . It was a good while before Smilax could command himself long enough to speak , but the moment he did , his wife leaped from the sofa , threw her arms around his neck , and , if there had been a piano in the room , she would have gone off with " Ah ! non giunge ! " in a manner that any prima donna might have envied . To save the trouble of an explanation , we will give our readers a copy of the letter which caused this domestic emeute , and leave it to their own imaginations to do the rest . COPY . " Dear Madam : " Though a stranger to you , I am not to your husband ; and I do not flatter myself that he would confide to you the kind of transactions which such as I have with him ; and I would not now intrude upon you , were it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am a mother ; I believe that you are not , and you may not understand my feelings . But my offspring must be provided for . I am not mercenary , yet I can not afford to part with the Pledge of Affection ' which I left with him yesterday , without pay . This I wish you to say to him . After a long and most satisfactory interview which I had with him , when I returned to say this much , and nothing more , ' I was denied all access to him , and have ventured to request you to act as my mediator with him . If my presence is disagreeable to him , he has my address , and may drop me a line informing me of his decision . The Pledge ' may be sent back if he declines to pay . " Most truly yours , " Pattie Passionflower . Letter - MrsSmilax This little affair proved the straw which broke the camel 's back . Smilax concluded the next morning that his martyrdom in the cause of literature had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself by acting as a monthly nurse to other people 's literary bantlings , and of elevating popular taste by any such means , was entirely dissipated . He sold out to some body as deluded as he had been ; and soon after , the following advertisement in the morning papers told the catastrophe of his literary career , and the total eclipse of all his ambitious aspirations for distinction : " Partnership Notice .  --  Mr. M. Smilax , Jr. , having been ad-mitted a partner of our house , the business of importing German dolls will be conducted under the name of M. Smilax , Son &; Co . " Smilax &; Co . " Section " After all , " said Smilax to me , one day , as I met him coming out of his broker 's , where he had been looking over the stock list , with the view of making a safe investment of his spare capital , " what a precious delusion this love of distinction is ! What more should sensible men like ourselves aspire to , than to be distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to have the satisfaction of knowing they owe no man a dollar , which they can not pay on demand ? That 's the only distinction worth striving for . " I am afraid there was a shade of sareasm in the smile which passed over my features in reply to these grovelling sentiments of my friend ; for he immediately added with a slight blush : " It is true that importing German dolls is not the noblest occupation in which a reasoning creature can engage ; but children must be amused with dolls , as well as men with magazines , and why not choose the business which affords the best returns ? " I could only smile again , for arguments of this nature have but one side to them ; and Smilax , feeling his triumph , changed the subject by inviting me to a family dinner , with Maria Jane and the children .
