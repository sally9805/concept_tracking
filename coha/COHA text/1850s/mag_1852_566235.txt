txt ART . 11. - VICARIOUS RELIGION . The Errors of Romanism traced to their origin in Human Nature . By RICHARD WHATELY , D. D. , Archbishop of Dublin . Philadelphia : James M. Campbell &amp; Co. , Chestnut St. New York : Saxton &amp; Miles , 205 Broadway . 1843 . WE place at the head of this article the title of Archbishop Whately 's volume on the Errors of Romanism traced to their origin in Human Nature ; but we intend to write only on the subject of one of the six chapters of that volume , Vicarious Religion . The other chapters are upon " Superstition , " " Pious Frauds , " " Undue Reliance on Human Authority , " " Persecution , " and " Trust in Names and Privileges . " These errors , together with that which we have chosen as our topic , Archbishop Whately proves to abound especially in the Roman Catholic Church ; and he traces them to their origin in human nature , with a subtle and accurate analysis of man 's native character , a careful discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth he sets forth , that render this one of the ablest and most useful among his works . And this is to call it one of the ablest works of the age : foe Archbishop Whately has no superior among the writers of ' the present age in penetrating insight and comprehensive observation , in acuteness of discrimination and wholesome judgment , in candor , integrity and honor in controversy , and in clearness and exactness of expression . To treat all these topics , however , assigning proper space to each , // would weary ourselves and our readers ; and therefore we select that which , in our view , is the most important in itself and most pertinent to the times . The disposition to a vicarious religion is universal among men  --  a disposition , as Whately has well termed it , " to serve God by proxy " -  --  to have the claims of God on the heart and life complied with Lw some representative method  --  to escape the trouble and responsibility of personal religion , by having re . ligion attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everywhere implies the great lesson of personal and direct responsibility to God . It reveals clearly God 's character and will , and imposes on man the obligation to understand and love the one , and to learn and obey the other . It reveals man 's sinfulness , and holds him responsible for seeing , feeling , and repenting of it . it reveals Jesus Christ , the Saviour of sinners , and bids man come directly to him for pardon and life , and have faith in him . But men , averse to practical religion , are universally disposed by nature to divest themselves of this personal responsibility , by throwing it on others . They know it will not do wholly to neglect religion . They would attend to it indeed ; but not in person , not by bringing their own minds and hearts to the performance of its duties . They would have the work of religion done for them by others . They say xvi*h the foolish virgins , Give us of your oil . ' ' It may be useful briefly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among men , and to refer to some of its lessons . We may find it , not only where we have been accustomed to look for it , but also where we have not been wont to discover it . Its workings are subtle and deceptive , and it behooves all to understand them . The first evidence in order of this disposition is seen in the proneness of men to take the foundation of all reJi*ion , viz : its doctrines , their creed , on the authority of others ; in other words , the proneness of men to do their religious studying and thinking by proxy . How large a proportion is there of mankind , whose religious belief is founded , not on their own diligent study of God 's works and word , but on the authority of others ; who take their belief at second hand ; who believe as they do , simply because their fathers have thus believed , or those around them thus believe . To study and search at the proper sources for an answer to the question , What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer ready made up to their hand , and they take it . It they live among Pagans , they are Pagans ; if among Mohammedans , Mohammedans ; if among infidels , infidels ; if among Christians , they are nominal Christians . They do not take the trouble , carefully // obtaining all the assistance they can , to investigate and settle the foundations of religion for themselves . They take this work as it is done for them by others . This many do professedly while others do it really , though they do not acknowledge it , and perhaps are not aware of it . The Roman Catholic professes to receive , implicitly , the religious doctrines of other men , and even renounces the right to study and judge for himself ; saying openly , " I most steadfastly admit and embrace apostolical and ecclesiastical traditions . I admit the Holy Scriptures , according to that sense in which our Holy Mother the Church has held and does hold ; to which it belongs to judge of the true sense and interpretation of the Scriptures neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the unaniruous consent of the Fathers . " * Thus a large portion of nominal Christians . not only do not study the Bible for themselves , but solemnly promise that they never will , and agree to take their faith at the hands of others . Nor is this reliance on the Church to study and interpret the Bible , confined to Roman Catholics . It exists among a portion of nominal Protestants . They say , indeed , that the Bible is the only rule of faith and practice . Yet they add that the Bible is not to be interpreted by individuals , but by the Church . The Church , or the standard writers in the Church , are to study the Bible for them , and they are quietly to take the results . Even the minister , one among them says , " should guide himself by the Holy Scriptures , not as he understands them , but as Catholic antiquity has revealed , and Catholic consent has kept , their meaning . " Or , as another has said , " Scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor are those denominations who reject the Roman dogma of Church infallibility , and the Oxford doctrine of Church interpretation , entirely free from the disposition to take their belief from human authority . There are those among them who exalt certain formularies of doctrine into authoritative teaching , appealing to them as standards of truth ; who take the Bible not as they have studied and learned its meaning , but ns the authors of certain confessions or creeds have studied and interpreted it . Others in a greater or less degree take as authority the opinion of some eminent individual among the dead or the living ; xvh ile many moie without examination and study receive as infallible truth the teaching of their own minister . Thus almost universally we see , in a greater or less degree , this reliance on human interpretation of Scripture , or human exposition of religious truth , not as assistance , which is very well , but // as authority . This results , indeed , partly , from the perversion of a good principle , reverence for the wise and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from priestcraft , but principally from this disposition to escape the labor and responsibility of religion by availing ourselves of that of others . To study the Bible so as to arrive at its exact teaching requires time and labor , and therefore , men say , " I believe all that the Holy Catholic Church teaches . I take Church interpretation as the true meaning of the Bible . " To read the Bible with care , comparing passage with passage , that we may learn thus its consistent schemes of doctrines and precepts , requires patient care and toil , and therefore men take the Bible as creed makers and system makers have arranged and compacted it into a mass for easy acceptance . Instead of reading and digesting the truth themselves , they take with little examination the preparations of others . Instead of " searching the Scriptures daily , " like the noble minded Bereans , to see " Whether those things are so , " they take them on the assertion of human creeds , eminent writers , or admired and revered pastors . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying and thinking by proxy . When we leave the doctrines and consider the duties of religion , we find in human nature the same tendency . evinced in a disposition to rely on rites and ceremonies performed by others . Passing by the heathen , in whose religion of rites and forms and priests , we might find abundant evidence of this disposition , we will look nearer home for its manifestation , among those called Christians : for , if we find it under the light of the gospel , and in spite of that light , we shall have the fullest evidence of its vigorous existence in the human heart . So strong is this disposition in men , that it has , to a wide extent , essentially corrupted Christianity , and , to a still wider extent , spread in it a serious , though not fatal , taint . This has been the chief cause of the prevalence of the idea of the saving efficacy of sacraments , when administered by the hands of an authorized class ,  --  the chief cause of the gradual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Christianity , as it is in the gospel , has no human priest to offer sacrifices , no human mediator or intercessor to stand between the soul and God , through or by whom alone the soul can make acceptable approach to the mercy seat . It has but one priest , Christ Jesus , the Great High Priest , who offered himself once for all , a sufficient sacrifice  --  the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world , the One Mediator between God and man , who ever liveth to make intercession . Christianity has teachers to // give instruction in the way of salvation , or rather to render assistance in learning the way of salvation , and to administer ordinances , which , in a lively manner , will call to mind the sacrifice of Christ , and represent his coven an ted mercy ; but it his , no human priest . Yet men have not liked this simple gospel . They have not liked mere teachers of Christianity , who would only assist them in learning religion , and leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much personal responsibility on themselves . They wished a cheaper method , some process of getting to heaven by representatives . And therefore , they have gradually changed the Christian minister or teacher into a priest , who is to offer sacrifice for the people ; who is to be a kind of mediator and intercessor between them and God ; who is to interpret God 's word for them authoritatively and infallibly ; who , on condition of their submitting to his spiritual rule , is to take the care and responsibility of their spiritual affairs , and by the administration of efficient sacraments and ceremonies , is to absolve them from their sins , and give them a title to life eternal . In a word , they haves over a large portion of Christendom , madeout of the Christian ministry , a priesthood , on whose performance of rites they may rely for salvation-who are to have the responsibility and doing of religion , in their stead . We are speaking of a general fact , which is illustrated by many particular facts every day , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity prevails . That father , whose new born child seems about to die-his chief anxiety is , not for its life , but to have it baptized by a priest , if possible , that he may be entirely secure of its salvation . There is another , ( thousands do it. ) going to a priest to confess his sins ; and , having obtained absolution from him , he comes away with a light heart , feeling that his soul is safe . And his feeling of safety depends , not so much on the fact that he has made a clean breast , or a full confession , ( for often he does not confess those sins which expose him to the civil law , ) but on the mere fact that he has absolution from that human mediator . An intelligent Christian physician , who exercised his office in a hospital where there were often many Roman Catholics in the last stages of fatal disease , tells us , that he has had frequent illustration of this fact , in witnessing , on the one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had no priest of their church to give them absolution from their sins , and , on the other hand , the entire composure and security with which they went into the presence of God , after that priest had pronounced their absolution . We once knew an instance , where the friends of a man who died without absolution went on foot to a priest , a hundred miles off , to hire him to pray the departed spirit out of purga // tory , and with perfect confidence in the necessity and the efficacy of that ceremony . Here is another , ( this case occurred within our personal knowledge , ) who , in his poverty , has not wherewith to pay the priest for burying his child in ground consecrated by priestly rites . He solicits ai ( l from those of his own faith . But those within his reach are few and poor , and he obtains but little . In his extremity , he applies to his Protestant acquaintance . They ofFer him a burying place in their ground . But no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bury the body there would endanger the soul . They tell him , then , that his priest is cruel to require a sum which , in his poverty , he can not pay . He admits it , and , in their presence , curses the priest for his cruelty . Yet he feels entire confidence in the necessity and efficacy of burial by him in consecrated ground to give repose to the soul , and he has no peace till he has procured the necessary sum . Now it is said that this is the result of priestcraft ; that the ignorant have been imposed on by the cunning of ambitious and designing men . In this statement there is undoubtedly something of truth . Yet this is not mere imposition on ignorance : for many men , of great intelligence , have this reliance on priestly rites . The chief reason is , that men have been willing to have it so . They have wished to be free from the responsibility of attending to their own spiritual concerns . Their conscience and their fears would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depravity made them reluctant to undertake for themselves its studies and duties . They have therefore been willing to rely on the performances of a priest , and to substitute his religious services for the service of their hearts ; in a word , to make him their deputy or representative in religion . They have wished thus to purchase ease of conscience here , and security of happiness hereafter , and , at the same time , freedom from personal responsibility , and from inward , spiritual effort , in religion . Without this disposition in human nature , wide-spread , deep-seated , and strong , successful priesteraft would have been impossible . Without this it would have been impossible . under the light of the gospel , to transmute a Christian minister into a priest . Men are the willing dupes and slaves of a priesthood , that they may escape a sense of personal responsibility and the necessity of personal and spiritual religious work . This stupendous system of Romish priestcraft , superstition , and despotism , has been laid like an incubus on men , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and thus satisfy conscience and fear , rather than bring their own minds and hearts to the exercises and duties of spiritual religion . // This reliance on rites and ceremonies performed by others , we find not among Roman Catholics only , but also , though not in as gross a form , among Protestants . This idea , not uncommon among nominal Protestants , that a minister , regularly and validly ordained , is a priest , whose sprinkling of water on a child insures its regeneration , and whose baptism of that child on its death-bed , may be relied on as a saving rite : this idea that bread and wine , consecrated by a priest , is so changed in its qualities , that it has in its company the real bodily presence of Christ , so that the partakers of it may be said , in some mysterious manner , to partake of the body and blood of ' Christ ; whereas , participation of bread and wine set apart to represent the breaking of Christ 's body and the shedding of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest , but only an appointed and pious Christian minister , is not the Lord 's Supper , but merely , as one has termed it , " a common pious meal , " accompanied by no peculiar benefit  --  the idea , not uncommon , that " the sacrifice of symbols , " as the Lord 's Supper has been called , offered by a priest at the bed-side of a sick person , has a mysterious efficacy in preparing for death  --  the idea , in a word , that covenanted mercy ( the only mercy known ) flows , and flows only , through sacraments administered by the hands of priests-these , although not as grossly superstitious , are as real evidence as the instances before mentioned of a reliance on rites and ceremonies performed by an authorized class , having charge of men 's religious interests . They never could prevail , except by the strong disposition of men to devolve the care and labor of their spiritual affairs on others  --  the disposition to substitute the offices and performances of others for that discharge of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart-work , from which the natural man so reluctates . Nor is the manifestation of this disposition confined to those who , in theory and in practice , rely on priestly rites and ceremonies . But it is seen in a variety of forms which are not as palpable as those which have been mentioned , and can not be as well classified . Not unfrequently there is , in the minds of some in a congregation accustomed to hear the teaching of a minister , a half reliance ,  --  ( never , perhaps , expressed in words , or distinctly reflected on , but yet existing , and in various ways betraying its existence. )  --  a half reliance for salvation on that minister-a feeling that , as they attend on his ministry , he will , in some way , fully provide for their spiritual interests , just as their physician takes care of their bodily health , or their lawyer of their legal business . And not a few , if they should speak out their real X*OL. x. 66 // feeling , and the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , they rest , would say as did a sick man once to his clergyman : " Sir , I put my spiritual affairs entirely in your hands , and depend on you to have them done right . " This state of mind is not , indeed , a matter of very distinct consciousness to those who possess it , because it will not bear examination and reflection . Yet there can be no doubt that it often exists , and keeps men quiet in neglect of personal religion . So , too , there are men who have a kind of reliance , not very distinct or strong , but yet sufficient , for the most part , to keep conscience quiet , on the fact that they regularly attend on the services of the sanctuary , and freely pay for the support of religious worship , and show an outward respect to that worship , and have a friendly regard for the minister , and can avail themselves of his services when needed  --  a feeling , that , in some way , though they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so closely connected , the religion of others-of the house of God and of their ministers-will avail for their spiritual safety and welfare . And it is partly , though not wholly on this account , that there is a prevailing opinion , ( not wholly , for there is a just ground for the opinion , in the fact that a minister is appointed to the office of teaching by his words and illustrating by his life the Christian precepts and doctrines , ) that a minister should be more exemplary in his piety and conduct than others , and , more than they , should avoid the appearance of evil  --  a half formed feeling that he is to be pious for his people ; that his exemplary deportment is to avail instead of theirs , and , therefore , that failure and defect on his part , affect the general insurance . There may be detected , also , not unfrequently , in children of pious parents , a reliance on the piety of their parents , a feeling that , in some way , their prayers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any endeavors of their own  --  a feeling somewhat akin to that expressed by a son of an eminent ruinister , who , when a friend manifested anxiety for his salvation , and urged him to personal attention to religion , replied , that he need give himself no uneasiness about him , for , if he wished to be converted , his father could convert him at any time . In these , and in many other subtle forms , there may be observed everywhere , among those of all opinions and organizations in religion , this disposition to make the piety and duties of others answer instead of their own ; and thus to secure a quiet conscience and a comfortable hope , without personal effort of mind and heart in religion . // The foregoing discussion thi%ws light on a question , often asked at the present day , and with painhil interest by many . Is there not reason to fear that the Roman Catholic religion will have a prolonged and powerful existence in this country ? It is often said that a system of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long exist amid the growing light and progressive freedom of the present age . But this is an assertion , the truth of which many profound thinkers greatly doubt ; and the subject is worthy of more than a superficial exarnination . One of the most able writers of the present dayone who has no favor for or tendencies to the Romish Churchspeak ing of that church , says : " We do not see any sign which indicates that the term of her long dominion is approaching . She saw the commencement of all the governments and of all the ecclesiastical establishments that now exist in the world ; and we feel no assurance that she is not destined to see the end of them all . She was great and respected before the Saxon had set foot on Britain-before the Frank had passed the Rhine-when Grecian eloquence still flourished at Antiochwhen idols were still worshiped in the temple of Mecca . And she may still exist in undiminished vigor , when some traveler from New Zealand shall , in the midst of a vast solitude , take his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch the ruins of St. Paul's. " * Now , though we may think this opinion extravagant , and be unable to accord with it , yet , we must acknowledge , that the fact that it is advanced by one so well versed in human history , so cognizant of the nature and causes of its events , and so far from favor toward the Romish system , ( and not by him alone , ) does show , that this is riot a question to be lightly examined , or hastily decided . it is often said that there is no danger of the spread of the Roman Catholic religion in this country , among our native population certainly , so inconsistent is it with the spirit of our free institutions and with the general intelligence of the people . It should lead us thoroughly to examine this ground of confidence , when we remember that the observant , profound , and philosophical De Tocqueville , who has done better justice to this country than any other European traveler , and who has better understood our institutions than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a friend of popular freedom , has expressed it as his decided opinion , that the Roman Catholic religion is , best of all , fitted to democratic governments ; and , also , when we look over the world and see that some of its most // eminent scholars and enlightened philosophers , and they , too , favorable to political liberty , are themselves members of this Roman Church and advocates of its religious system . The great reason why we have to fear the prolonged and powerful existence of Romanism , is the fact which we have been considering-that there is a strong tendency to this kind of religion in human nature  --  a disposition to serve God by proxyto rely on some system of priestly rites and ceremonies ; . and this ally to the Roman Catholic system in the heart of fallen man is more than a match for mere intelligence , freedom , and the spirit of inquiry , real and strong foes to that system as these undoubtedly are . The congeniality of this system with the inclinations of the depraved heart-this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and even enter it . No danger from the Roman Catholic religion in our free country ! There is danger from it everywhere where there is human nature . Alan is a Roman Catholic by nature . His intellectual indolence , his disposition to throw off direct responsibility to God , his great reluctance to submit his will and heart to God , in a word , his desperate depravity-this is an ally , a tremendous ally , of the Roman Catholic system . That system is the masterpiece of human policy , yea , of Satan 's policy , in its adaptation , not to the real wants , but to the corrupt inclinations and wishes of mankind . There is nothing which man by nature so bitterly hates as to submit his will to God and bring his heart to the humbling experience and duties of religion  --  to sorrow for and renounce his sins , and to cast his soul , penitent and obedient , yet confessedly lost , on the mere mercy of God in Christ . Any outward service , whatever it may cost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortifications , however painful , he will gladly perform , rather than this-anything which can be substituted for the religion of the heart . Any system which will give ease to conscience and a comfortable hope , while it frees from personal and direct responsibility to God and from spiritual duties , he will accept . And the system most cunningly devised for this purpose-that which gives most quiet and hope on the one hand , in consistency with freedom from personal responsibility on the other , is the Roman Catholic , which enables a man to devolve all his religion , except some outward services , on a priesthood , just as he devolves the cure of his bodily disease on a physician , and thus to retain all his pride , all his self-righteousness , all his self-will , all his ambition , all his worldliness , all his practical atheism . Notwithstanding , therefore , our freedom and the general diffusion of knowledge , the Roman Catholic religion , in some form , modified , perhaps , // yet real , entrenched in the strong holds of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , will maintain a warfare , long and vigorous , though , as we believe and trust , ultimately unsuccessful ; ultim ately unsuccessful , because , though depravity and Satan are for it , God 's truth and spiriL are against it . There is another lesson quite worthy of attention . It is this Protestants need to guard not only against the progress and power of the Roman Catholic church , but also against the entrance and prevalence of a virtual Itomanisin within their own denominations . It is the grand device of Satan , readily adopted by human depravity , universal and active , if men will attend to religion , to make them attend to it by proxy . And this  --  the reliance on the religious opinions and services of others for salvation-call it by what name we will , is the essence of Romanism . There is observable among Protestant denominations a constant tendency , which can be held in check only by constant vigilance and resistance , to substitute the Romish reliance on the opinions of men , expressed in one form or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Protestant and Christian principle of reliance on the Bible or the word of God only . On this point , Archbishop Whately writes very ably in the work before us : " But are Protestants then , as long as they do but acknowledge theee principles , exempt from all danger of any such error as that for which the Romish church has flow been censured ? By no means . Such might indeed have been the case had the claim to infallibility for the decisions of the church , and the comparative disregard of Scripture , been the cause , instead of being , as in truth it was , the effect , of the tendency to pay undue deference to human authority . The real cause of that tendency is to be sought in the principles of our common nature ; - in the disposition to carry almost to idolatry the veneration due to the wise , and good , and great ; - in the dislike of doubt and of troublesome investigation  --  the dread of perplexity and disagreement-and the desire of having difficult questions finally settled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mass . While this disposition continues to form a part of our nature , we can never , but by continual self-distrust , be safe from its effects . And the danger of virtually substituting human authority for divine is the greater , from the necessity which exists of making use of human expositions of Scripture ; not only for the purpose , above alluded to , of providing a symbol , test , or creed , ( such as our thirty-nine articles , ) in order to ascertain a sufficient agreement in members of the same religious community , but also for the purposes of public worship , and of catechetical instruction . For the sacred writers have not only transmitted only one short form of prayer , and no complete form for the administration of the Christian ordinances , but have not even left us any systematic course of instruction in the Christian doctrines . These they have left to be collected from histories and epistles , evidently addressed to Christians  --  to persons who had already been regularly instructed ( catechized as the word is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus leaving , as it should seem , to the church the office of systematically teaching , and to the Scriptures that of proving the Christian doctrines . // And it is a circumstance not a little remarkable , that they should , all of them , have thus abstained from committing to writing ( what they must have been in the habit of employing orally ) a catechism or course of elementary instruction in Christianity , consisting of a regular series of unquestionable canons of doctrinearticles of faith duly explained and developed-in short , a compendium of the Christian religion ; which we may be sure ( had such ever existed ) would have been carefully transmitted to posterity . This , I say , must appear to every one , on a little reflection , something remarkable ; but it strikes me as literally ntiraculous . I mean , that the procedure appears to me dictated by a wisdom more than human ; and that the apostles and their immediate followers must have been supernaturally withheld from taleing a course which would naturally appear to them the most expedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of all the elders and catechists appointed , in various places , by the apostles , and by those whom they commissioned , it seems hardly credible , that no one of these should have thought of doing what must have seemed so obvious , as to write , under the superintendence and correction of the apostles , some such manual for the use of his hearers ; as was in fact done repeatedly in subsequent ages , ( i. e. after , as we hold , the age of inspiration was passed , ) in all the churches where any activity existed . Thus much , at least , appears to me indubitable ; that impostors would have taken sedulous care ( as Mahomet did ) to set forth a complete course of instructions in their faith ; and that enthusiasts would never have failed , some of them at least , to fall into the same plan ; so that an omission which is , on all human principles , unaccountable , amounts to a moral demonstration of the divine origin of our reli ; ion . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the supposed wisdom of such an appointment : it holds good equally , however little we may perceive the expediency of the course actually pursued ; for that which can not have come from man , must have coma from God . If the apostles were neither enthusiasts nor impostors , they must have been inspired ; whether we can understand , or not , the reasons of the procedure which the Holy Spirit dictated . In this case , however , attentive consideration may explain to us these reasons . God 's wisdom doubtless designed to guard us against a danger , which I think no human wisdom would have foreseen  --  the danger of indolently assenting to , and committing to memory , a " form of sound words ; " which would in a short time have become no more than a form of words ; - received with passive reverence , and scrupulously retained in the mind-leaving no room for doubt-furnishing no call for vigilant investigation-affording no stimulus to the attention , and making no vivid impression on the heart . It is only when the understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the watchful observation  --  the careful deductionwhich the Christian Scriptures call forth , by their oblique , incidental , and irregular mode of conveying the knowledge of Christian doctrines-it is then only , that the feelings , and the moral portion of our nature , are kept so awake as to receive the requisite impression : and it is thus accordingly that Divine wisdom has provided for our wants , Guns acuens mortalia corda . ' It should be observed also , that a single systematic course of instruction , carrying with it divine authority , would have superseded the framing of any others-nay , would have maclu even the alteration of a single word of what would , on this supposttion , have been Scripture , appear an impious presumption ; and yet could not possibly have been well-adapted for all the varieties of station , sex , age , intellectual power , education , taste , and habits of thought . So that there wonlcl have been an almost inevitable danger , that such an authoritative list of credenda would have been regarded by a large proportion of Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited no influence on the character ; they would have had a form of goddness , but denying the power thereof , ' the form itself would have remained with them only as the corpse of departed religion . Such , then , being the care with which God 's providence has guarded against leading us into this temptation , it behoves us to be careful that we lead not ourselves into temptation , nor yield to those which the natural propensities of the human heart present . For , through the operation of those principles which I have so earnestly , and perhaps too copiously , dwelt on , we are always under more or less // temptation to exalt some human exposition of the faith to a practical equality with the Scriptures , by devoting to fhat our chief attention , and making to it our habitual appeaL There is one decisive argument , perfectly simple , and accessible to every understanding , and especially acceptable to a pious mind , against employing any human statement of doctrines in place of Scripture as the standard to be habitually appealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this should be done . For if it had been his design , that there should be any such regular system of doctrine for habitual reference , and from which there should be , in ordinary practice , no appeal , he would surely have enjoined , or at least permitted , ( and the permission would have been sufficient to insure the same result , ) the framing of some such confession of faith or catechism , by his inspired servants themselves ; since such a system would fully have answered the purpose in question , with the great additional advantage , that it must have commanded the assent of all who acknowledge the Christian Scriptures . No church , therefore , is empowered to do that , which God for wise reasons evidently designed should not be done . He has left to the church the office of preserving the Scriptures , and introducing them to the knowledge of her members , as the sole standard of faith-as not merely the first step and foundation of proof , like the elementary propositions of mathematics , but as the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office of teaching the Christian doctrinesfrom the Scriptures . It savors of the spirit of Romanism to refer for the proof or disproof of doctrines , solely , or chiefly , to any , the most justly venerated , human authority  --  to any thimig but the inspired word of God . For if any one proves anything from our Articles or Liturgy , for instance , either he could have proved it from Scripture , or lie could not : if he could not , he is impeaching either the scriptural character of the church 's doctrines , or his own knowledge of the scriptural basis on which they rest ; if he could have proved it from Scripture , that is the course he should have taken ; not only because he would thus have proved his point both to those who receive our Articles , and also to those who dissent from them ; but also , because it is thus , amid thus only , we can preserve to Scripture its due dignity and proper office , and avoid the dangerous and encroaching precedent of substituting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , that human formularies , when once the habit is established of making a definitive appeal to them for the proof of any disputed point , have a tendency not omdy to rival , but to supersede , Scripture . They are usually drawn up in a more compact and regular form , such as to facilitate reference and they are purposely and carefully framed , so as to exclude certain particular interpretations , which those of a different persuasion have introduced . The convenience then resulting ought to put us the more on our guard against this encroaching character of human compositions . More troublesome indeed may be the diligent search of the Scriptures than a compendious appeal to established formulanes ; but God has appointed that this labor shall be the Christian 's lot , and shall bring with it amply its own reward . The care , and diligence , and patient thought , arid watchful observation required in drawing for ourselves the Christian truths from the pure spriughead , will be repaid by our having , through divine grace , those truths ultimately fixed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only read , ' but mark , learn , and inwardly digest them , ' so that the heavenly nourishment will enter into our whole frame , and make us not merely sound theologians , but , what is much more , sincere Christians and good men , truly wise unto salvation , through faith which is in Christ Jesus . ' It must not , however , be supposed , that those are exempt from the spirit of the error I aiim speaking of , who are the furthest removed from paying undue deference to the authorizedformularies of a ckerch . Many such persons on the cont.rary are particularly addicted jurare in verba magistri  --  to adopt blindly , and maintain in defiance of argument , whatever they are taught by some favorite preacher , author , or party ; whom they thus invest , virtually and practically , with infallibility . There is no benefit in an emancipation from the shackles of Rome to men who set up a pope of their own making , or merely substitute an unerring party , for an unerring church ; nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term infallibility , by those who believe in the thing . // Not . Those among the clcrgy who are particularly zealous and sedulous , and particularly successful , in awakening sinners-in enlightei*ing the ignorant-in administering consolation to the desponding , ought most especially to be on their guard , not only not to encourage , but watchfully to repress in their hearers this error . I depend entirely on Mr. Such-a-one ; he is my stay and my hope ; I feel that I should be lost without him ; I am sure every thing he says is right , and that I am quite safe under his guidance : - this is the sort of language often heard , and this the kind of feeling evinced , in the case of many a one who has been recalled from irreligion , or rescued from despair , through the means of some spiritual guide : a deepfelt and perhaps commendable gratitude and veneration , degenerate into a kind of idolatry ; and they at length come to exalt him into their mediator , intercessor , and divine oracle . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must he the more vigilant in opposing . He must not only be ever ready to adopt the Apostle Paul 's cautions , Sirs , why do ye these things ! we ourselves also are men of like passions with you : ' Every one of you saith , I am of Paul , ' &amp;c . Was Paul crucified for you ? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul l '  --  but more than this , he must also warn his hearers , that whereas Paul , having been instructed by divine revelation , was an infallible guide , he himself , having no such inspiration , claims accordingly no infallibility ; and he must therefore exhort often , and earnestly , the flock ( not Isis , but Christ 's ) committed to his care , instead of pinning their faith to his bare word , to exercise their own minds  --  to weigh well the reasons he lays before them  --  and to study for themselves , as carefully as their circumstances will permit , the Scriptures which he is endeavoring to expound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become , each man a pope to himself , by indulging the habit of making his decisions on some points like the law of the Medes and Persians , which altereth not , ' and of enrolling them as it were in a certain code , which is thenceforward not to he open to discussion . Such persons make up their minds perhaps on few points , and with cautious deliberation ; but having once adopted an opinion , will listen afterwards to no arguments against it . I have long adopted ' ( says a respectable and amiable writer ) an expedient which I have found of singular service . I have a shelf in my study for tried authors ; and one in my mind for tried principles and characters . When an author has stood a thorough examination , and will bear to be taken as a guide , I put him on a shelf . When I have fully made up my mind on a principle , I put it on the shelf . A hundred subtle objections may be brought against this principle ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle is on the shelf . Generally 1 may be able to recall the reasons which weighed with me to put it there ; but if not I am not to be sent omd to sea again . Time was when I saw through and detected all the subtleties that could he brought against it . I have past evidence of kaviag been fully convinced ; and there on the s/self it shall lie . When I have turned over a character on all sides , and seen it through and through in all situations , I put it on the shelf . ' The proceeding here described I believe to be adopted by not a few , though there are not probably many who would so frankly avow it . Yet such persons perhaps censure ttie itomanists for claiming imifallibility for their church ; a claim not implying a pretensionto uaiversal knowledge , but to an exemption from the possibility of mistake as to the points we do pronounce upon ; which points accordingly are no more to be discussed , nor any objections against them to have a hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does , so far , virtually , claim infallibility . Indeed if he did not-if he still admitted that he might possibly be mistaken on the point on which nevertheless he would bear no discussion , this , it is plain , would aggravate the fault . But , ' they say , it is extravagant scepticism to be certain of nothing ; it is an absurd and a wretched thing to have no faith in any thing , but to be for ever wavering and hesitating . ' I need hardly say that is not what I recommend . The lover of truth need not be always in actual doubt on every point ; but he must be always open to conviction-always ready to hear and to meet fairly . any seriously-urged objections . It is one thing to be without faith , and another thing to have the faith of the apostolical Christian , who is always ready to give toevery one that asketh hima , a reason of his hope . ' If there be any thing virtuous or manly in any faith , it // must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that which rests on our resolution to shut our ears . If our confidence , for instance , in a friend 's integrity is accompanied with a determination to hear no objections to his conduct , it surely is not so creditable to him , as if it rested on a defiance of accusations , and a readiness to hear all that could be said , though with a full expectation that all censure would be refuted . For we may very reasonably , on many occasions , feel , after a careful examination of some question , a confident expectation that no arguments will be adduced that will change our opinions ; but this is very different from a resolution that none ever shall . Yet nothing is more common than to hear a person say , in the course of some discussion , Nothing shall ever convince me ' . . . . Then hold your peace !

' I am aware that this is , in many cases , no more than a form of speech adopted from imitation : but considering how prone we are by nature to the fault in question , I can not but think it important that even our language should be carefully guarded , so as never to express , what we should never allow ourselves to feel , that firm confidence in the authority of man ( whether the decision be another 's or our own ) in matters wherein he is liable to err , which is due only to the unerring God . " But not only in respect to a Romish reliance on human creeds and opinions in matters of faith , but in respect to all those subtle modes , some of which we have alluded to , wherein human nature is prone to depend for salvation on outward forms and on the religious offices and services of others , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to keep vigilant guard , and to employ constant and strenuous resistance . And they need , especially , to bear in mind , that the prevalence of spiritual religion among their members , subduing the source of this great danger as it exists in the heart , is the only effectual safeguard . Those denominations who reject prelacy and exclude liturgies , have been accustomed to think that their organization , doctrines , and modes of worship , render them less liable than others to this danger . And this , both reason and history prove to be true . But it should be borne in mind that no mere outward organization , however favorable to spiritual freedom and development , no mere doctrine written in creeds , no absence of forms in worship , can keep out that vicarious religion which human nature so eagerly craves , and ever will . It can be kept out only by constant vigilance , activity , and spirituality in religion .
