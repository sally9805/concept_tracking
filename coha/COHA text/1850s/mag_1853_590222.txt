UNITED STATES REVIEW . MAY , 18*53 . THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM . THE United States and the United Kingdom-sometimes called " The Mother and Daughter " are the two great commercial powers of the New and the Old World , and all history demonstrates that while iii this relative position they must be rivals , and rivals are never friends . The old adage , " There is no friendship in trade , " is equally tine with respect to nations as individuals . It is most especially applicable to the present age , when the commercial spirit is rampant and the power of nations depends more on the purse than the sword . Accordingly a great portion of the wars of modern Europe , may be traced to commercial rivalry . Such were the longcontinued and inveterate contests of Yenice and Genoa , wh ich equally disturbed the repose of Asia and Europe ; such the famous naval struggle between England and Holland , which deluged the sea with blood ; and a careful perusal of history will distinctly show that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory that disturbs the peace of the world , but that avarice comes in for its full share . It is true that the centres of the United States and the United Kingdom are thousands of miles apart , but commerce makes neighbors of all nations ; and if this were not so , the extremes of the two empires touch at a thousand points , and their national rivalry is fed from as many sources . Our own experience has taught us that in the future as in the past , the United States can never hope to remain on friendly terms with England except by submitting on all occasions to her arrogant pretensions , or becoming the dupes or willing instru // ments of her insidious policy . Almost all the difficulties in our foreign relations have been with her , and with the exception of the trifling skirmish with France , the United States have never been in hostility with any European power but England . It should be remembered too , that in all these conflicts the latter was the aggressor . The IRevolutionary War originated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects in America those rights which were claimed and exercised by all Englishmen ; and the second Punic War was forced on the United States by a long-continued series of outrages on their commerce and citizens . Though first declared by them , it was strictly a defensive war , because its sole object was to arrest these outrages . It aimed at no acquisition of territory , and demanded nothing but what it was willing to concede . Though these were the only contests of force between the two powers , their intercourse has been almost one continued series of resistance on the part of the Infant I*epnblic to the policy or pretensions of England . The long delay in surrendering the forts on the frontiers of Canada as stipulated by treaty ; the repeated refusals to conclude a commercial arrangemnent with the United States on such terms as had been conceded to other nations ; the difficulties with regard to the Fisheries , tle North-Eastern , and Oregon boundaries , and in short every other difficulty that has occui'red in the relations of the two powers , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollection of past mortifications , coupled of late with a sleepless jealousy of the future growth and prosperity of the United States . Yet in the midst of all these demonstrations we are perpetually stultified with assurances of the most friendly disposition on the part of England , and lulled to sleep with the delusive idea that she is closely associated with the United States in all those great efforts of philanthropy through which that hypocritical power is affecting to christianize and civilize the world by subduing or overawing weaker nations , and making Them tributary to her avarice or ambition . It* there were the slightest indications of any change in the policy of England towards the United States , this article had never been written . But so far from this , the contrary is every day becoming more evident . Ever since the vast stride made by the United States from the shores of the Atlantic to those of the Pacific , the relations of the two powers have become more conflicting and complicated , owing to the increasing jealousy and apprehensions of England . The statesmen // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foiiinidable rival to the commercial and naval ascendancy of En*land has sprung up as if by magic in the West , and that the isthmus of Suez is about being superseded by that of Panama . All the great plans for securing the control of the commerce of the Eastern World , are rendered in a great measure obsolete by events that have lately taken place in the West , and it has now become the first and greatest object of British diplomacy to obtain by every means , honorable or dishonorable , the control of the only route to the East which En bland does not now possess . Her American policy has taken precedence of her Asiatic , and she is now gradually preparing the way fur enabling herself at any future time to cut off all direct communication between the possessions of the United States on the two great oceans of the world , except by land across the entire continent . This project was gradually consummating by secret conventions at IMlarshfleld over the bottle , or in the cabins of fishing smacks on piscatory excursions ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States might at this moment have found themselves involved in a web of inextricable difficulties which could only have been cut by the sword . As it is , the new Democratic Administration will veceive from its predecessors a precious legacy of blind or wilful blunders from which it *vihl require all its wisdom , honesty , and firmness , to extricate itself . In addition to these pregnant proofs of the friendly disposition of England of which we are so confidently assured in the late Presidential Message , she is constantly wielding against the United States the whole force of hei ' Press with a view of rendering the government and people not only obnoxious , but infamous in the eyes of the world , while at the same time aiming a deadly blow at their internal peace , as well as outward prosperity , by administering perpetual fuel to the fires of fanaticism under the hypocritical pretext of sympathy for the African Slave . By perpetually stimulating the friends of " the entire human race " among ourselves , awakening new apprehensions on the part of one great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is never thoroughly healed , she hopes at length to scatter into conflicting elements that great constellation of stars whose increasing lustre is so ominous of the decline of her departing glories . In addition to this , it can not have escaped the . notice of those who trace great causes to their ultimate consequences , that England is steadily aiming , by the influence of her Press and her power , so to modify the long-established Law of Nations // as to suit her present condition and future purposes . After having obtained possession of half a world under the sanction of that code , and reached the top of the ladder , she is kicking it from under her feet , because she has not only no longer any use for it , but begins to perceive she can now gain more by the adoption of opposite principles . The most important right of nations , as of individuals , is that of property  --  the right to the land they occupy . It is in fact the foundation of all their other rights , the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no society of nations without a recognition of the rights of each other . It does not distinctly appear what were the precise rules regulating this important point among the nations of antiquity , or whether they recognized any right but that of the strongest ; nor was this question finally adjusted until the discovery of the New World , by directing the ambition of the great maritime powers of Europe towards the unoccupied wilderness of the West , rendered the adoption of precise rules for the general government of all absolutely necessary . There was not a little contention on the subject between Portugal , Spain , Holland , France , and England , and finally an appeal was made to the Pope , at that time the Sovereign Arbitrator between those who recognized no other superior . This gave rise to that famous Bull by which the New World* was apportioned among the different claimants of the Old . However arbitrary this decision may appear , it was based on principles of Natural Law universally acted on by individuals in their intercourse with each other , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature with which we are acquainted . Even among our wildest Indians the finder of any article having no owner among the tribe , is entitled to the possession ; and he who erects a hut , or cultivates a spot of land not claimed by any other , or constructs a bow and arrows , is held to be entitled to them as his own exclusive property . " I have digged this well , " said the Patriarch Abraham to the servants of Abimelech , who were trespassing on what , in the dry and arid regions of Syria and Palestine , was the most valuable of all property , because indispensable to the existence of herds and flocks in which their wealth altogether consisted . And this , we believe , is the first recorded example of a claim universally recognized among all nations , savage or civilized . * This Bull , also adjusted the claims of Portugal and Spain in Asia and Africa . // The same principle was applied to nations , and doubtless governed the Pope in his decision of this question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all the rival powers , in so far as that they did not oppose it by force . When , however , the Reformation took place , and the King instead of the Pope became the recognized head of the Church of England , the rights of Spain to portions of America , enjoyed under the sanction of the Sovereign Pontiff , began to be disputed , especially on and about the Isthmus of Darien , and it was not long ' after , that expeditions were fitted out at Jamaica , if not with the direct sanction , at least without any attempt on the part of the British government to discourage or arrest them , against the Spaniards in Central America . This was the origin of that band of bloody desperadoes which is still infamous in history , under the name of The Buccaneers of America , and who it is not a little remarkable , justified all their ravages and massacres , precisely on the grounds since assumed by Lord Palmerston in the establishment of the Musquito Protectorate , which were unquestionably borrowed from the Buccaneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of these renowned champions of human rights : " While we lay at Tavoga , the President or Governor sent a message by some merchants to us to know what we came for into those parts To this message Capt . Sawkins made answer , That we came to assist the King of Darien , who was the true Lord of Panama and all the country thereabouts ; and that since we had come so far , it was but reason that we should have some satisfaction . So that if he pleased to send us five hundred pieces of eight for each man , and one thousand for each commander , and not any further to annoy the Indians , but suffer them to use their power and liberty as became*the true natural lords of the country , that then we would desist from further hostilities , if not , we would come and visit him at Panama , and bring our commissions on the muzzles of our guns , at which time he should read them as plain as the flame of gunpowder could make them . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the origin of the Musquito Protectorate , and that the celebrated manifesto of Consul Chatfield was modelled from that of the renowned Captain Sawkins . His Lordship and the Consul are without doubt deeply read in the History of the Buccaneers . But , be this as it may , the same principle on which the rights of individuals are based , with respect to property , was now applied to Xations . The Sovereign under whose flag any portion of the New World was first discovered , was held to possess a prior right to its occupation , which he might exercise at pleasure , and at any time most convenient , as there // was no specified limitation . One of the greatest infringements on this right was on the part of England , *ihich took formal possession of New Holland and New Zealand by proclamation , though without the shadow of any right of discovery , and on no ground of occupation but that of having made the former a receptacle for convicts who had forfeited their character as British subjects . It was by thus taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what has since been discovered to be one of the richest regions of the globe . Yet notwithstanding this infringement on the long-recognized principles of international law , the rights of discovery and occupation have continued to be considered by all civilized powers except England as among the fundamental principles of the International Code . That government is proceeding to undermine and overthrow them in order to acqnire a wider sphere for the exercise of that dominion of the seas and that monopoly of commerce to which she has so long aspired , and a jealousy that this will at no distant period be disputed by the United States , is the key to all her policy in the New World . There is another new principle which England is attempting to foist into the Code of International Law , which , if universally acquiesced in , will place every weaker nation at the mercy of th' stronger . It is thus stated in a late number of the Edinburgh IReview , and we have seen it lately peeping forth from so many quarters , that we are convinced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become one of the leading principles of British policy . " Each nation , " says the writer , " undoubtedly has an exclusive right to the posses*ion of its own territory ; but it must ifot abuse that right to the extent of debarring all other nations from a participation in its riches and its virtues . The only secure title to property , whether it be a hovel or an empire , is , that the exclusive possession of one is for the general benefit of all . " ' Here is an entire new basis for the rights of property ; and thus while the London Times and other organs of British policy are declaiming against the " Filibusters , " and denouncing the people of the United States as pirates and buccaneers ; and while all England is railing against socialism , we have here a complete justification of both , in the enunciation of a principle that covers the whole ground . It applies equally to nations and individuals , to hovels and empires ; it is a general warrant for universal interference , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any individual declines sharing " their riches and their virtues * with the entire human race , // they become Ferco Naturce , and may be lawfully hunted by all the rest of the world . Governments thus become the sole arbitrators of the policy of each other , and the strongest is of course to be the Supreme Judge whether the weaker shall not allow it to participate in its " riches and its virtues . " So also with individuals , who , if they are strong endugh , may lawfully expel a neighbor from his hovel , under pretence that he refuses to open his door to strangers who for aught he knows come only to rob and murder him , and therefore does not use his property " for the benefit of all . " If we carry out this principle into practical operation , it will be found to combine within itself all the varieties of socialism , communism , and Fourierism , on a scale commensurate with the world . Yet it is gravely put forth as a dogma , by a leading journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle in the policy of a great nation claiming to be the last remaining bulwark of religioh , morality , and freedom . This principle , like many others , may be true in theory as applicable to a state of Nature , but if universally acted on in the civilized world , would be , as before stated , a general warrant for all aggressions of the strong on the weak ; render national rights and individual property the sport of hypocrisy , *avarice , and ambition ; set all mankind by the ears ; uproot the entire system of social organization ; convulse the world , and deluge the earth with blood . Instead of producing universal harmony , there would be neither peace on earth nor good will towards men . It was on this principle the Jews exterminated their neighbors ; that IMiahomet and his successors desolated Asia , and but for Charles Martel , would have done the same to Europe ; that all religious wars and persecutions have been undertaken , and it is under this specious pretext that England , whose financial condition imposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations an all quarters of the globe , bullied and buffeted a people which had been at peace with all the world almost from time immemorial , and is now proceeding to subjugate the Birman Empire . They do not , forsooth , employ their riches and their virtues for the general benefit of all mankind , notwithstanding the former furnishes them with their most innocent and wholesome beverage , and it is therefore not only the right but the duty of every Christian nation-especially if it has a strong naval force at command  --  to come in for its share , in other words , monopolize the whole if it can . The United States , if they were not fortunately too strong for the experiment to be tried on them , might themselves be made the victims of this // Filibustering doctrine . The monarchs of EuropQ , and the great modern Pharisee , John Bull , has long since decided that we do n't employ either our riches or our virtues-if we have any of the latter commodity-for the general benefit of all mankind . They are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples to be held up to the contemplation of their subjects , who are undoubtedly the best governed and happiest people in the world ; and there are not a few indications of a latent desire to come in for a share , if not of our virtues at least of our riches . The policy of England clearly discloses a vehement passion for inculcating into our minds those orthodox maxims of philanthropy , filibustering , and international law , which she is now so gloriously exemplifying in ilindostan , I3irmah , Borneo , the Cape of Good Hope , Central America , and in places too tedious to be enumerated* We shall now proceed to show that all these new principles , or new applications of old principles of International Law and the Laws of Nature , have a direct application to , and are intended as a basis for and a justification of her present system of policy in the New World . If the principle assumed by the renowned Captain Sawkins , Chief of the Buccaneers , and adopted by my Lord Palmerston , is acquiesced in by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this Continent will  |p6ssess  any right to those Territories which , though included within their limits , may not be actually occupied by their citizens . Of the remainder , England or any other European government sufficiently powerful may become virtually the supreme arbiter by taking it under her " Protection , " and assuming the guardianship of any real or pretended Chief or band of roaming savages , equally ignorant and regardless of their rights and duties as members of the family of nations . To change the law of nations is to revolutionize the world . To prescribe new rules to regulate the rights of nations and the terms of their intercourse with each other , is at once to strike at the root all those established principles on which rest the repose of mankind , and to bring the New and Old World in direct opposition on questions of such vital interest to the former , that there is no prospect of their ever being settled except by a resort to those decisive measures which ultimately decidethe fate of nations and of the universe . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration , but would respectfully advise the prompt adoption of a firm , decisive , yet temperate policy , which will , if steadily pursued , most assuredly arrest the insidious schemes of England before they arrive at maturity . After that it may // be too late . When the Great Polypus once plantsjts " Feelers " on the prize , it is no easy matter to force it to relinquish its grasp . When the Hawk has pounced on his prey , lie never abandons it except when the Eagle is in chase . In this , as in all other cases , the maxim that " Prevention is better than cure , " most emphatically applies . It will be perceived that the new Code of International Law , called Universal Philanthropy , has no practical application to Europe where there are neither unoccupied territories , roaming Indians , nor any slaves but white ones . The rights derived from discovery and occupation sanctioned by the old International Code , and under which Europe held a great portion of the New World , are therefore to be set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America holds its sovereignty over the soil , are to be abrogated to suit the purposes of England . This point once conceded by the United States and the sister States of America , and she may claim the independence of any tribe of savages on this continent , take them under her protection , and whenever it suits her interest convert them into instruments for plundering , massacreing , and scalping peaceable white citizens , as we verily believe she is now doing in Yucatan , for the purpose of forcing one or other of the races to seek her " Protection . " Our two wars with England furnish bloody evidence of the consequences which would flow from a powerful , civilized , Christian nation associating itself in hostilities with pagan savages , and protecting them in their barbarous excesses. * The result would inevitably be a war of extermination . The principles which England is attempting to establish in relation to African slaves , are , if possible , still more dangerous to the repose , prosperity , and safety of the United States , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government of this country would be justified in making a for rual protest against this most dangerous species of intervention , as a demonstration of hostility far more injurious than even her encroachments on the Isthmus . She has taught the slaves of the United States that " the condition of slavery absolves them from all the obligations of mankind , " and consequently that they are neither subject to the law of man nor the law of God . She has thus endeavored to let them loose like wild beasts , to exercise their great natural * We were told many years ago by Mr. Madison , that the British Goverainent had on more than one occasion , made earnest efforts to have the Indians , who it had instigated to murder and massacre , included in Treaties as independent powers . It is needless to say the overture was promptly rejected . // right to rob and murder their masters , burn their houses , and commit every conceivable outrage on their wives and children . This is the great fundamental principle of her new Code of Philanthropy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the United States , through the efforts of the Britisb press , have been placed as criminals before the bar of ' the Christian world , and almost ostracized from all community with civilized nations . Pious frauds and exaggerated falsehoods have been made the grounds of an indiscriminate condemnation of a whole nation , and the testimony of anonymous fanatics , received as decisive of the character of twenty millions of people . If we look back to the early history of the colonies , we shall find that England never exhibited any maternal feeling towards her American children . On all occasions their interests were sacrificed to those of the parent state ; and her colonial policy , though not perhaps so rigid as that of Spain , consisted in a series of jealous restrictions on their commerce , combined with equal restraints on those personal rights which for ages had been considered the inalienable inheritance of Englishmen . She left them to fight their way alone , and if she at any time sent troops to this country , it was not to protect its inhabitants from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enable her to dispute the empire of North America with France . Finally , when the Colonies by respectful remonstrances and earnest appeals to the throne , endeavored to escape the application of a principle which would have placed their property at the mercy of a Parliament in which they were not represented , she made war on them , and for seven years spread desolation over the laud . She neglected us in our infancy , oppressed us in our youth , and now in our manhood is steadily pursuing a course of policy equally hostile to our prosperity and dangerous to our peace . Yet England still claims from us the obligations of filial duty , and though she has never done us a sin6le good office , accuses us of ingratitude . Under all these circumstances , and in reference to the past , the present and the future , we can not perceive one solitary indication that England ever has been or ever will be our friend . 1-fer policy has always been , and now is , hostile to the outward prosperity and internal repose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent but progressive policy . It will be invariably pursued whether the government is administered by whigs or tories , and it is of no consequence to the United States whether Lord Palmerston , Lord Malmesbury , or Lord . // John Russell directs the foreign affairs of Enodand . The result will be the same tissue of spiteful misrepresentation , arrogant intimidation , and wheedling diplomacy . This policy , being , as before stated , not only permanent but progressive , must necessarily sooner or later bring about a crisis when the United States will be imperatively called on to submit or resist , for never was there an instance of magnanimous forbearance on the part of England or any other modern European power . Our own experience has taught us that submission to one insult or wrong is only a prelude to others still more aggravated , and that let the United States be as patient as they may , that patience will at length be exhausted . That crisis is already come , and the period his arrived in which , as seems to us , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dangerous policy , at first by temperate , firm and decisive remonstrances ; and if these should fail , a resort to counteracting measures , whatever may be the consequences . This brings us to the main subject of the present article , namely , an enquiry whether there is any disparity in the power and resources of the two great commercial nations of the Kew and Old World that should induce the United States to submit to any wrong or insult from England they would not endure from any other quarter . In the present state of the relations of the two powers , this is a great practical question involving interests of the greatest magnitude , and we shall endeavor to consider it with the temperate impartiality becoming the subject . In thus placing the United States and the United Kingdom in an antagonistical position , it is neither our desire or intention to administer to national antipathies , to infuse a spirit of rivalry and hostility , or least of all , to inflate our countrymen with extravagant ideas of their own vigor and resources . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from their ancestors ; but at the same time , it seems to us , they want a correct and well-founded conviction of what they really are , ahd what they can really do when under the influence of a patriotic devotion to their native soil , their combined energies , physical powers , and national resources are tasked in the attainment of a great and noble purpose . They begin to waken and rub their eyes at the first dawning of the light , but are not yet wide awake . The young Hercules is not yet aware of his strength , or that he can strangle the serpent should he dare to intrude on his cradle . There is one monster before whom , from early impressions and long habit , he is apt to cower , when called // upon to toe the mark . Nations should never live in fear , for it is always a prelude to degradation . Even arrogant confidence is better than conscious inferiority . England has always been the great bugbear of the United States , which like the emancipated slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The time is come when they should throw off this nightmare . It is time , and high time , the United States should KNOW THEMSELVES , in order that they may be ready at all times to maintain with temperate dignity and firmness the high , responsible position in which God and Nature have placed them . They stand on the great watch-tower of Liberty which has now no other beacon in the wide waste of the universe , and their acts and example are fated to exercise a decisive influence on the future destinies of the New if not the Old World . Nay , we firmly believe it depends on them and them alone , whether the tide of Christianity , civilization and Liberty continues to advance on this great continent , or again recedes before the reaction of barbarism . The Indians have already driven the Mexicans far within their ancient limits in New Mexico , * and were it not for the protection of the United States they would drive them still further .

It is not long since the Capital of Guatemala was in possession of the Indians under command of a half-breed , and at this moment the savages are contending with Christian white men for the dominion of the peninsula of Yucatan . In all the States of Central and South America , the Indian and Mongrel races greatly outnumber the whites , and such is the imbecility of the latter , such their indolence , weakness and degeneracy , that unless shielded by a more wise and energetic race , there is strong ground to apprehend they will some day or other be either subdued or exterminated , and the New World in process of ages require another Columbu* to unveil it to the eyes of the Old . The United States are the champions of the whitenman in the New World . It is a part of their mission to arrest this retrograde motion , which , aided by the policy and power of England , may convert at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Musquito empires under the " protection " of TIer Britannic Majesty . This is no idle vision of fancy , but a simple deduction from causes which have everywhere and at all times produced the same consequences . * See Expedition of Colonel Washington against the Navajos. // It is a subject which well merits a more extended development , and may be resumed on some future occasron . Let us now proceed briefly to compare the resources and power of the United States and the United Kingdom . In comparing the relative vigor and resources of nations , the first constituent that presents itself is their population . But it is not alone the number , but the moral , physical and intellectual qualities of a people that form the basis of their superioritv . China with its three hundred millions , is one of the weakest nations in the world , and its very numbers is one great cause of its imbecility . The free population of the United States is now twenty millions , and increasing annually by millions , for whom there is ample room and employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is somewhat more than thirty millions , but such is the condition of the country , that every increase in numbers only brings new accessions to the poor-house , and additional recruits to the hundred thousand miserable beings in the single city of London , who , when they rise in the morning know not where to seek their daily bread. * Of these thirty millions nearly one-third are Irishmen , disaffected by intense suffering to such a degree , that they are only kept in subjection by martial law enforced by a standing army , and an armed police . Another large portion of the people of the United Kingdom , as it is pleasantly called , consists of laborers in the cities , fields , and manufacturing districts , some above , some undergi'ound , half pauper , half operative , debilitated by incessant and unwholesome toil , and disaffected from hunger and privation . If we hear no more lately of their indignant complaints and remonstrances , it is not that they have no longer any cause of complaint , but because the late Acts of Parliament courteously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have deprived them of what was once considered the inalienable right of Englishmen , the right of peaceably assembling to petition for a redress of grievances . They can no longer speak , but they may one day act . Men thus circumstanced , though they may love their native soil , have no attachment to their government , and can not be considered as one of the elements of national strength , either in defensive or offensive war . They are rather a source of internal weakness , for , although they may contribute to the wealth of the nation by their labor , they not only exhaust it by poor*-rates , derived from the labors of others , but by their * See statements in the English papers . // discontent render it necessary to employ a large *portion of the military force which might otherwise be either dispensed with , or brought to bear against a foreign enemy , in maintaining interna*l tranquillity and order . In addition to this they debase the body politic by the infusion of b norance and depravity , the most fatal source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population of the United Kingdom with these drawbacks , it will be found less than that of the United States , deducting the southern slaves . In this estimate we have not included the population of the dependencies of England , in various quarters of the globe , because , even in time of peace , we conceive they rather detract from the wholesome vigor of the parent state , and in time of war , especially with a powerful naval antagonist , diminish the capacity for offensive operations , by the necessity of protecting them . Hitherto , indeed , the wars of the United States and England have , with little exception , been altogether defensive , on our part ; but we venture to predict that any future one , come when it may , will be of a different ( laracter . It may well be questioned , too , whether these vast dependencies do not rather exhaust the resources of the parent than add to her wealth and power . Canada , according to Mr. McCulloch , than whom there is no better authority as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to keep it in good humor , rivet its dependence , or prepare it to resist the United States should they ever think it worth their while to acquire that hyperborean region . India is in a great measure exhausted of its wealth , and the East India Company depends much for support on new acquisitions of territory , and smuggling opium into China . The great diamond destined to adorn the diadem of Queen Victoria , which was wrested from an Indian Prince , under pretence of a debt incurred in subjugating his territories , is probably one of the last items of plunder that will be squeezed from that once rich and splendid region , which has long been undergoing the process of poverty , depopulation and decay . Australia , once a den of thieves , is now indeed a mine of gold to England , but its influx will only bring with it increasing corruption and extravagance , while it affords new resources to that great complicated system of monopoly , by which so large a portion of the people are manacled in golden chains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant feat of IBritish philantrophy ; Gibraltar is principally valuable as a great emporium for smuggling ; and Malta , the lonian Isles , the Cape of Good Hope , Singapore , // Aden , Hong Kong , and a hundred other commercial or military establishments , by which , according to Sir George Simpson , she " commands all the highways and byways of the ocean , and all its inlets , " # are so many s the life blood of England . luices draining The whole of this vast farago of dependencies is without any cement but force . Instead of one people , of one race , one language and one God , they are inhabited by Pagans , Idolators , iViussulmans and a few Christians of all denominations . Instead of speaking one language and having one standard of morals , manners , customs and habits , they consist of an incongruous medley of patches on an old thread-bare garment . With skins of every hue and every variety , they present a motley confusion of tongues , a heterogeneous mass whose elements of cohesion are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment in common but that of hatred of their common master . Not one of these *F ringe-streak ed and spotted " millions can be brought to bear on the United States in any contingency of peace or war , and so far from preying on them , woulA be much more likely to become their prey if they were worth a visit . To the United States , England is nothing but herself alone . She is great on the maps , especially in North America about the genial regions of Hudson 's Bay , Labrador , and New Albion . But the limbs of the giant are dislocated and can never be united . The two countries do not , therefore , differ materially in point of efficient numbers , and if there is any disparity between them , it must arise Porn a difference in moral , physical , and intellectual qualities . We have already , in a previous number of this Review , given a comparative sketch of the leading characteristics of the two people ; and , to avoid repetition , would refer our readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the subject of this article , are all we shall offer . As a general proposition we think it may be safely affirmed , on the basis of past experience , that the patriotism of a people is always in proportion to the freedom they enjoy , and that the courage of slaves is only another name for cowardice , since it originates from being more in fear of their masters than , of the enemy they may be called on to encounter . The conquests of the Roman Republic were achieved by the people ; those of the Empire by hireling soldiers entirely divested of patriotism , since they as frequently turned their arms against their own countrymen as against a foreign enemy . * See " Overland Journey round the World .

That they have this martial spirit and this aptitude for the exigencies of warfare , is equally demonstrated by the conduct of the volunteer citizens in the late I*1Iexican war , who , guided by scientific officers bred at West Point , proved themselves equal to the regular army ; and excited the admiration and wonder of the European world . We were told by a distinguished American officer , who made a tour abroad with a view to professional objects , that many of the high officers of the European armies , and especially those o n*land , were extremely desirous of knowing by what system these raw volunteers were so speedily transformed into soldiers ready and willing , nay , anxious , not only to encounter the enemy in the field , but to march up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrenchmeuts. lie might have told them that this miracle was achieved , in a great measure , by that patriotism , that martial spirit , and that individual love of glory , which are the invariable characteristics of a free people ; those men were not governed by the mere habit or instinct of discipline , which destroys all sentiment and individuality , bat by that reason and reflection which taught them the necessity of acting in concert , and obeying their officers . Thus every man , while animated by a feeling of patriotism , at the same time sought his own personal glory ; and the two sentiments combined , furnished an excitement far more powerful and noble than that of a hireling soldier who cherishes no incentive to action or exertion but that of pay and plunder . Thus , should the United States ever be in danger from a foreign invasion ; they have millions of gallant defenders , who , if once roused by a sense of ' actualdanger , would flock from the cities , vales , and mountains to the rescue , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England or any European power could bring against them . Thus it is that liberty creates her own defenders . It produces soldiers who fight , not merely with hands , but with hearts and hands , and the two combined make men invincible . // From causes to which we have referred in *a preceding portion of this article , the United Kingdom is , in a great measure , divested of these advantages . The attachment of large portions of the people to their native soil has been greatly weakened , as sufficiently appears from the progress of emigration to this country ; and as to the government , the people of England would long since have overthrown , or , *t least , radically changed it , had they not been overawed by a standing army distributed through every disaffected district . The fortunate circumstance of having a sovereign of that sex which every man feels himself bound to protect , has , in sonic measure , substituted loyalty to the sex in place of loyalty to the sovereign , and thus very materially strengthened the royal authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kings , as mere kings , is now only the ghost of a departed principle . That feeling which was once a substitute for the more 9nlarged and noble spirit of patriotism , is now principally con$ied to privileged nobility clinging to the skirts of kings for protection against the people ; right reverend bishops in the same predicament , civil and military officers still more dependent , petty officials in the colonies , and upsta*t millionaires who think it genteel to ape their superiors . Nor , th*ugh England produces good soldiers and sailors , are the English a martial people ; nor have they ever been so within the range of history . Whenever invaded they have been conquered , and even the old psalm-singing Scotch covenanters laid England at their feet under Charles the First . It is true , they once conquered France , and France may one day return the compliment . But all know that this conquest was achieved through the divisions of that country , and by the treason of certain great vassals of the crown more powerful than the crown itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon driven out by a warrior in petticoats . England , it is true , has been constantly at war for a century past in some one or other region of the earth , but during all that time the English nation has been at peace , and felt none of the evils of war except in the shape of additional taxation . Depending entirely on their " wooden walls " for protection , and l*aving been disarmed by the game laws and the jealousy of the government , they have entirely lost what little martial spirit they may have once possessed , and if guns were placed in their hands they would not know how to use them . The commercial spirit pervades all classes , and all thoughts , persuits and occupations are absorbed in getting money . The // alarm lately excited , and still subsisting in England , by the mere vague apprehension of a French invasion , is *ignificant of conscious weakness , and the opposition to the project for arming the militia to aid in repelling it , is equally significant of a jealousy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunder and point their guns the wrong way . Let us now descend from generals to particulars . The revenue of the United Kingdom is at present perhaps three times as great as that of the United States , but we do not think a process which enriches a government by impoverishing the people , altogether favorable to the happiness , and still less to the strength and resources of a nation . But , setting this aside , if England has great pecuniary resources , she ' has likewise a vast many uses for them . More than one-half of her revenue is absorbed annually in the payment of interest on her debts , and with the other half she must support her civil and military establishments , maintain her empire , and prosecute her schemes for its extension in Hindostan , Persia , Borneo , Africa , Arabia , and Egypt , as well as on this continent . Hence it happens that though the English financiers manage generally to make out a small modicum of revenue beyond the expenditures of the government , it is quite certain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great difficulty that they can make both *nds meet . They every now and then tickle John Bull with a project for ( liminishing his burdens , but like that of Mr. D'israeli , which upset the late ministry , it is only taking the saddle from the back of the horse to place it on that of his rider , and reminds us of the sagacious miller , who lightened the burden of the ass he was riding by hoisting the meal bag on his own shoulders . In a word , the resources of England are barely sufficient for her present exIger*cies ; her sinews are always on the stretch , and if strained much more , would in all probability crack asunder . Old debiljtated nations , like old debilitated men , should be careful how they overstram tuemuselves . Youth may renew its strength-old age , never . There is no principle of renovation left , and when the foundation is once decayed the superstructure must fall . We are told the days of good old Ilezekiah were by a special providence lengthened fifteen years , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England is probably ten times as numerous as that of the United States . But here , as in relation to her revenue , there is an infinite variety of demands for its employment . It is demanded at home to repress public discontent , and preserve internal tranquillity and order , for // which purpose soldiers and bayonets are now the great instruments , in all parts of Europe where civil government 110 longer exists . It is demanded in Ireland , boiling over with misery , discontent , desperation and vengeance . It is demanded in India , either to preserve old , or acquire new usurpations . It is demanded at the Cape of Good Hope , and in other portions of Africa , on which England is trying an experiment of philanthropy ; and it is demanded in almost every portion of the habitable world , from Canada and Nova Scotia to Affghanistau and the Birman Empire . Thus dispersed at distances that render a junction impossible , and thus , indispensable whereVer stationed , it must be greatly augmented in order to become an object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draught be made on those resources which are already required for indispensable purposes . The army is not , however , the most dangerous weapon England wields against the United States . It is her navy we are principally to guard against , and it can not be denied that it is somewhat formidable . It is on the ocean the tug of war must . come , if it comes at all , and Greek meet Greek . The British navy once boasted of a thousand ships , all drawn up in battle array in the navy list . Many of these were old hulks totally unfit for service ; others so decayed that they required to be entirely rebi*iilt ; and of the whole thousand at least one-half ; if not two.thirds were , to all intents and purposes , useless as instruments in defensive or offensive operations . Still they made a great figure in the navy list , insomuch that when the late war was proclaimed against England , it was confidently predicted by all those who opposed it , that in one year our navy would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our maritime cities sacked or laid in ashes * our seacoast devastated ; and our country utterly ruined . Yet none of these things happened , except the brilliant achievement at Washington , reinforced by the plunder of hen-roosts and pigstyes , and the good people of the United States were astonished to find that at the end of three years they were not extinguished as a nation . The number of British old line-of-battle ships , frigates and sloops of war is now much less than during the war of 1814 . But this deficiency is supplied by an equal number of armed steamers , which hitherto have only signalized their prowess by carrying mails , exterminating Bornese pirates , or prowling about the world , insulting and bullying those who are too weak to defend either their rights or their honor , and performing various other offices of British philanthropy . The Navy // of that country is , however , probably at this time more efficient than at the commencement of the late war , except that it has lost what must be regained before it can reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had long deluded the world , and the people of the United States most of all , is now broken , and the consequence is that in England the Red Coat has superseded the Blue Jacket , and renown of the Blake , llawke , Rodney , Nelson , and 5t . Vincent fades before that of the victor of Waterloo . So much the worse for England , for she may lose the empire of the sea without gaining that of the land . In fact , according to all appearances , the naval spirit of England is fast waning away , and enonneers are becoming of more consequence to success in naval exploits than experienced seamen or heroic officers . Victory now depends on steam-engines , and the bursting of a boiler may decide the fate of nations . Besides , the English sailors have lost the prestige of victory , which had grown out of a long series of triumphs , arid it will require many a hard struggle to regain , if they ever regain their ancient unquestioned pre-eminence in naval skill and prowess . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not held by entail . It has slipt from the grasp of many nations , and passed from the Danes , the Northmen , the Venetians , Genoese , and ilollanders , to the hands of England , which may some day make one in the concert of nations that chant in nielancholy strains , the requiem of their ancient glories . It is the course of nature and Providence . That proud consciousness of superiority , which is one of the great elements of power , when once lost , like woman 's honor , can never be recovered . To regain is more difficult than to acquire , and the sceptre once departed from Judah never returned again . But whatever may be the number of ships of war on the navy list of England , their employment must necessarily be limited to the number of seamen that can be procured to man them . Commerce is the mother of a navy as well as its nurse . We may , therefore , form a much more accurate estimate of the relative naval power of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marine than the number of their steamers and ships of war . Raw recruits may be drilled into the mere mechanical motions of soldiers in a short time , but it takes years to make a good sailor ; and there is little to be apprehended from vessels of war nianned by peasantry fresh from the fields . We remember , at the time , the Spaniards accounted for the great defeat of Trafalgar on the ground that a large portion of their ships // were manned , or at least partly manned , by peasants and strollers about the towns and cities ; most of whom were either sea-sick or just recovering from its effects . We know , too , that the disaster of the Chesapeake was , in a great ineasnre , occasioned by her going to sea with a raw , inexperienced crew , who , in nautical phrase , " had not their sea-legs on board . " According to the last official returns of both countries , , the commerce of the United States is nearly equal to that of the United Kingdom ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriations is three or four-fold greater than in the United States , Parliamentary votes do not create seamen . We have , therefore , a right to conclude that the number of seamen is in proportion to the commerce of the two nations . In This respect they are pretty well matched as to physical force , admitting their seamen are in all respects equal . This , however , does not appear to be the case . The loyal and orthodox British writers , in attempting to account for that succession of naval victories , which astonished the world , and the people of the United States more than all the rest , among other causes ascribed the phenomenon to the great proportion of British sailors who it seems had deserted the iled Cross and enlisted under the StarSpangled tanner . But admitting the fact to be so , for the sake of argument , it only proves that a large portion of British seamen are disloyal and disaffected to the service , and that they fight better against than in behalf of their own country . In one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the service in which they have entered , they are , therefore , decidedly inferior to the sailors of the United States , who are all volunteers , whereas those of the United Kingdom consist , in no inconsiderable degree , of men forced from their homes by that system of impressment which presents such a brilliant specimen of the freedom of the people of England . Under all these circumstances , we may sately infer that , in respect to the great constituent of naval power , the United States are at least on a par with England . The naval power of the United States does not merely consist in their vessels of war . They have hundreds of merchant ships , the swiftest in the world , and of such admirable construction and qualities that they can be equipped and sent to sea as privateers with but little expense and delay . As a means of inflicting severe wounds on that commerce which is the mainstay of British power , they should never be lost sight of in estimating the comparative means of the two nations // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agent of self-defence , but of active hostility , by not only rendering it necessary for an enemy to employ his maritime force in protecting his own merchant vessels , but at the same time diminishing his resources by preying on his commerce . We are perfectly aware that persons of peculiarly susceptible morality , have denounced privateering as a species of highway robbery , unbecoming in civilized nations . But war , after all , is nothing more than a contest of mutual injuries , and every blow inflicted on a nation operates through the medium of individual suffering . While nations continue to cut throats , it seems rather squeamish to deny them the privilege of picking pockets . The philanthropists of England never discovered the unlawfnlness of this weapon until they found it turned against themselves during the late war . That war exhibited a succession of victories so decisive and disastrous that no alleged superiority in mere numbers and weight of metal can account for the phenomenon . There must have been other elements of superiority on the part of the United States* there must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Warned by these repeated disasters , which laid centuries of glory low , the British government his suffered one-half , perhaps two-thirds , of the thousand ships that whilome figured in the navy list to rot in the dock yards . The victories of Hull , Decatur , Bainbridge , Stewart , Biddle , Blakeley , Porter , Warrington and others , placed all the old ships kors-de-combat . Few have been em ployed since , except against Chinese and Bornese pirates , or in bullying petty powers , and most assuredly never will be , in a war with the United States . Our gallant officers must , therefore , expect in future to cope with none but their crack ships . They must be prepared for hard fighting ; and wo to their own and their country 's honor if , reposing under the shade of their well-earned laurels , they should fall asleep and dream of future victories , while neglecting the only means by which the past were gained . England has been preparing to retrieve her tarnished honors by every effort in her power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is one of the items in which they may follow her example with great benefit to themselves , by preserving , and , if possible , improving their naval discipline in spite of the clamors of squeamish philanthropists ; cherishing those habits of hardy endnrance and daring enterprise by which they are distinguished , and keeping up , in all its vigor , that patriotism and love of glory which , when individualized , // makes men invincible . The next contest , co me*when it will , may be the third Panic war , which xviii , probably , decide the fate of two quarters of the globe , if not of two worlds . Let not our gallant officers and seamen fear the enemy ; above all , let them not despise him , for , though lie may not conquer , he is not easily overcome . J3ut if England had a thousand ships , sailors to man , and money to equip them , she has a thousand uses for them all . Like her armies , they must be distributed over the surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They can not be concentrated on our coast , nor can the United States be blockaded except on paper . A great portion of her navy must necessarily be employed in protecting her commerce and maritime colonial possessions in all parts of the world ; for it is not to be presumed that the United States , now advancing with giant strides towards the period of ripe and perfect manhood , will hereafter invite the enemy to their doors by confining themselves to defensive operations . There is more than one Paul Jones in our navy . They will " carry the war into Africa , " as Cato said . iNor is it so easy to fit out great military expeditions to a distance of three thousand miles . Such efforts exhaust a nation , and England can bear no more exhaustion . During the late war with this country her debt , if we remember right , was increased 120,000,000 sterling . It still remains , and will forever remain , unpaid ; while the war debt of the United States was extinguished within fifteen years after its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep np a naval force on the coast of the United States at all seasons of the year , even with the aid of Halifax and Bermuda . It would cost a prodigious sum , and England has now little to spare from the necessary expenditures of her peace establishment . A war with the United States would *mdd some hundreds of millions to burdens already ruinous to the happiness of the people ; while , at the same time , it would greatly decrease her capacity to bear them by preying on her commerce , and depriving her of her best customer . The candle would be burning at both ends . In a word , if the present naval force of the United States were concentrated at any one point , it would require all the disposable force of England to watch it ; if it were spread over the ocean it would require the same force to protect her own commerce . Great apprehensions have been felt and expressed , in regard to the six or seven hundred war steamers , it is stated , England now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated to figure in the navy list , among the old hulks of // antiquity . It seems to be the prevailing opinion that she has only to put as many soldiers as she pleases on board , and scour the coast of the United States , both on the Atlantic and Pacific . But it should be borne in mind that steamers occupy the place of men-of-war of the old stamp , and that consequently the actual naval force of England has not increased since the late war . It has only changed its nature , and it yet remains to be seen whether the change will be advantageous . This species of force , has never been tried through all the vicissitudes of war , and its efficiency is yet to be tested . It may answer very well against the feeble nations of the East , but has not yet encountered Old Ironsides . The only occasion in which war steamers were brought into collision calculated to try their capacity for defensive or offensive war , except against the Chinese and iBornese pirates , , was the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the steamers where so mauled , that they were obliged to withdraw out of the reach of the enemy 's fire . We repeat , it remains yet to be seen , whether , all things considered , they are superior as means of defence or annoyance to the old class of ships of war . As we are following , as usual , headlong in the track of England , who , finding herself inferior in the old mode of warfare , has adopted a new one-it may not be amiss to consider this important subject a little more critically . It involves a question of the highest moment , namely , whether the United States shall , in a great measure abandon that system of naval warfare in which they have shown a decided superiority , and adopt one in which , for aught we know , that superiority may be transferred to an enemy . It therefore becomes a question of vital importance , whether , all things considered , war steamers are superior to the old class of ships , or whether any advantages they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience will make manifest . In the first place they can never become efficient cruising vessels on the high seas , from their incapacity to carry a sulk ficient quantity of fuel , as well as from the fact , now pretty well demonstrated , that their speed under canvass can not compete with ordinary sailing vessels . They must return to port to replenish their fuel at the end of every three weeks . There has , as yet , been no successful attempt to combine speed nuder steam , with fast sailing under canvass . Time two war steamers Missouri and Mississippi , the muost efficient and perfect ever constructed , were , to oni ' certain knowledge , mainly intended to ascertain as far as possible the practicability of // this combination . But the experiment was not satisfactory , and we believe the combination impossible . In the second place , in all great exigencies of battle or storm , this class of vessels must rely on their engines alone . Their machinery , being their sole dependence , is greatly exposed to the fire of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it most especially , because to disable it , would be decisive of the contest . In addition to this , the management of the engine requires a watchful attention , a cool self possession and self-command in the heat of action , which might not always fall to the lot of an engineer , who , perhaps , for the first time is placed in such a predicament . It is clear that the result of the conflict would depend more on the engineer than the commanding officer . In the third place , those who have been accustomed to watch the movements of steamers must have seen that they can not compete with vessels under canvass if there is anything like a sailing breeze , in putting about , or in any ordinary evolution , except that of stopping short and going backwards . In order to make a circuit , they require far more time , as well as space , than sailing vessels , and this of itself is a most serious , if not decisive disadvantage in the manoeuvres of a sea-fight . In the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of guns to an old fashioned man*otLwar , because a large portion of their space is occupied by machinery and fuel . The English have sought to remedy this by guns of greater calibre and weight ; by hollow shot of a vast size ; and other expedients equally ingenious and nugatory . Had not Sir Howard Douglass lately demonstrated the inefficiency of these so-called improvements , the common sense of every reflecting man might have taught him , that these great guns and these formidable shot would require much more time and force to handle than lighter and smaller ones ; that these immnense guns in heavy gales when the vessel is rolling , would require such strength of tackling to keep them in place as it would be next to impossible to apply ; and that the probability is , that our active seamen under these circumstances , would give two broadsides , consisting of from thirty to fifty or sixty shot each , to one of theirs , consisting of ten at most . If these immense guns could send their shot farther than 32s or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument in their favor ; but this is not pretended , and we do not hesitate to pronounce these boasted improvements a stupendous humbug . Indeed , we might // almost say we believe the whole system one of those imaginary improvements , which time will show to have originated in error and miscalculation . It is only in calms or very light winds that steamers possess any decided advantages over our old victorious cruisers , and it is not with a little pain we see the successful attempts to substitute one for the other . But setting all this aside , how is England to man her seven hundred steamers , which for belligerent purposes would probably require at least one hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand seamen . The United States , however , have steamers , too , the swiftest in the world , and can build them more rapidly than their neighbors should it become necessary ; so that on the whole we are inclined to the conviction that the seven hundred steamers of Enodand would do us as little damage as did her thousand ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and England , would unquestionably , in the language of Mr. M'Culloch , referred to in a previous number , call for " new exertions of industry , economy , and invention , " on the part of the people of England . It would involve the necessity of borrowing hundreds of millions , and it is generally conceded that the credit of that government has been strained to its utmost capacity of extension . Money would , however , probably be furnished by appealing to the philanthropy of Englishmen against the " Negro drivers , " and " two-legged wolves . " But come whence it may , it will lay new burdens on the people and aggravate their distresses and discontent . We believe it is now conceded by the most loyal of the British political economists , that the system of borrowing , if carried much farther , will l ) produce a financial , and of course a political *crisis , for one is dependent on the other . The government of the United States would doubtless follow the fashion and borrow too , but as yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is now a large surplus in the Treasury . They would also no doubt feel the effects of a collision with England in every bone and sinew . But this would only strengthen their energies , and they would soon recover from the temporary exertion , while England would be permanently weakened by her efforts . One is a young country , possessing all the vigor of youth and the power of renovation ; the other laboring under the burden of age and its inseparable infirmities . One is rapidly progressive , the other slowly receding . One is a new ship just off the stocks , and without a decayed timber ; the other an old hulk , always out of order , and requiring expensive repairs . // The sinews of England are perpetually on the stretch , and it is with great difficulty she can stagger under her everyday burthen . The United States have never been overladen , and if necessary , can carry double . England , though continually acquiring new possessions , is only weakened by the expansion ; the circulation of blood can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pyramid is reversed , and totters on its apex , instead of resting firmly on its base . Every new acquisition is only an addition to the incongruous elements of her empire , a new patch in Joseph 's coat of many colors , stitched on by the bayonet . The growth of the United States is , on the contrary , natural and spontaneous , and their expansion continuous . There is no great chasm between their possessions , no rent in their garment , which is without seam . Their skin is sufficiently elastic to accommodate a giant , but it is greatly to be feared that England will one day , like the frog in the fable , burst from its violent efforts at expansion . Such will be some of the inevitable consequences of War with the United States . Will they be counterbalanced by any corresponding advantages ? England can not dream of acquiring , or at least retaining any integral portion of the United States , and they have no distant dependencies . She can not new expect to coerce them into submission , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered into a sort of limited partnership with her in the New World , while they are rival traders in the Old . The experiment of intimidation , however successfully tried on a Whig , will , we trust , not succeed with a Democratic administration . Nor can she reasonably anticipate any new laurels on land or sea ; still less is there the slightest reason to believe she can , by any exertion of her remaining strength , arrest the growth and expansion of th' United States , by attempting to stop the career of " A deluge of men driven forward by the hand of God . " The causes now impelling their course are innate and irresistible ; they are in conformity with the laws of Nature and the decrees of Providence , and all the arts of gray-beard diplomacy can not arrest them till they have done their work . We call it destiny ; and what is destiny but a firm belief in destiny , which rests its anticipations on the inevitable operations of those great universal causes which constitute the instruments of Providence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States require no spasmodic efforts for the attainment of wealth and power . They will conquer North America in their bed-chambers . Whatever injuries England might inflict on our commerce // would be retaliated with interest ; and whatever ii*terruption of intercourse might ensue , would be much more severely felt by her than by the United States . The former would not only lose her best customer , but the supply of that raw material which is the great basis of her manutlicturing system , if not of the very organization of her society . In addition to this , as was the case during the last war , a new impulse would be given to our manufactures , and we might ultimately learn the lesson that we had hitherto been dependent on Europe for what we could easily furnish ourselves . One thing is certain , that were England to attempt a repetition of that system of predatory warfare heretofore practised , she would only poison the arrow that may one day be buried in her own bosom . Thus her commerce would be crippled ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear them diminished in at least equal proportion . Can England carry any heavier burdens ? The people of that country have endured much ; but patience has its limits , and there is nothing more terrible than the reaction of long forbearance . The longer the calm , the more destructive the tempest ; and the earthquake is always preceded by a pause of the elements . That great and illustrious people have built up a stupendous empire , and are now being crushed by its weight . Itis a Tower of Babel and a confusion of tongues ; and as sure as the erection of that tower was the signal for the dispersion of mankind , so surely will the erection of this vast empire be tblloxved , at no distant period , by a total dislocation of its members . An invasion would scatter all the elements of British power to the winds , and had the Great Napoleon possessed as many steamers as the Little Napoleon , England might at this day have been a province of France , as she was once a dependency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more to disclaim , from the bottom of our hearts , all intention of stimulating our countrymen or their rulers to hostilities with England . The United States never have raised , *nd never will raise their hand against their mother , except in defence of what they believe their rights , their interests , or their honor . If left to themselves , without any interference on the part of England , they will never interfere with ker rights , interests , or honor . They ask but to be permitted to pursue a peaceful course , with which no European power has a right to interfere ; and all they wish is to make a good amid beneficent use of the advantages which God and Nature have vouchsafed them . If they covet the possessions of their neighbors , it is only to bestow on // them the freedom and happiness they themselves% enjoy , and wish to extend to others . They do not subdue , but incorporate ; they conquer to set free , and every accession of territory is only an extension of civilization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , under every administration , whether whig or democratic , desire peace with England if it can be preserved on equal terms ; but that power ought to have learned by this time that no administration , whether Whig or Democratic , which stoops to submission to any palpable wrong or insult from that quarter can withstand the indignation of the American people . It will fall , as the late administration has fallen , for its subserviency to England ; and though for the moment the gentleman who , for nearly four years past , directed the foreign policy of the United States , may find shelter in the grave from the just retribution his memory deserves , he will assuredly in future times be quoted with ignominy as one who forever forfeited the good opinion of posterity by his gross partiality , or mean subserviency to the insidious and sinister views of a designing foe . There are times when the truth should be uttered even over the grave . Let the truth be spoken , though the heavens should fall . In conclusion , if it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statesmen of England , that it is far better policy to conciliate , than alienate the United States . By the course they are now pursuing , they are making an eternal enemy of a great and growing power they might easily make their friend , without any sacrifice of their rights or their dignity . Whatever they may gain at home by their constant efforts to injure the interests , ai'rest the progress , and blast the fame of their " transatlantic brethren , " as they are pleased to call them , they will lose far more on this side of the Atlantic . The time is past when they could play upon our fears , but it is not yet too late to win our love . The time , too , may come when England will want a friend , who , far removed from the conflicts , interests , and jealousies of the Old World , and actuated by the force of blood , will be able and willing to aid her in one of those hours of extreme peril which are the common lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is surrounded by nations as powerful as herself , whom , like the United States , she has alienated by her aml ) ition , her arrogance and her abuse , and to have for a friend a great and growing people , whose future is without bounds , and who may one day hold the balance of the world , is surely worth a little sacrifice of her peevish fretfulness and itching rivalry . // Every appearance indicates that the period is at hand when the United States and England must be friends or foes . Their relaions are becoming every day more critical ; and though , for the last four years , England has had her own way , we venture to predict a far different course in the four years to come . The United States can not , will not , must not remain longer quiescent , while England is taking sure measures to dissever their empire on one great ocean from that on the other , and at the same time weaving a web to catch their commerce in the Gulf of Mexico , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Mexico and Central America , and Cuba in the hands or under the control of any great maritime power of Europe , and least of all , of England . They must and will resist it at the hazard , nay , the certainty of war . They do not covet these possessions for themselves , but will not consent to see them in the hands of those who , whenever they please , may convert them into instruments of stupendous mischief . We repeat  --  the period has come when the two great corninercial powers of the New and the Old World must be friends or foes . Let England choose .
