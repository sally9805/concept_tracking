ART . 111. -i . On the Probable Fall in the Value of Gold : the Commercial and Social Consequences which may ensue , and the Measures which it incites . By MICHEL CHEVALIER , Member of the Institute of France , etc. etc . Translated from the French , with Preface , by RICHARD COBDEN , Esq . New York : P. Appleton &amp; Co. 1859. 2 . The Principles of Political Economy applied to the Conditian , the Resources , and the Institutions of the American People . By FRANCIS BOWEN , Alford Professor of Moral Philosophy and Civil Polity in Harvard College . Boston : Little , Brown , and Company . 1856. 8vo. pp. xxv. and 546 . ( Chapter XXII . The Decline in the Value of Money. ) 3 . The Ways and Means of Payment : a full Analysis of the Credit System , with its various Modes of Adjustment . By STEPHEN COLWELL . Philadelphia : J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. 1859 . Svo. pp. xii . and 644 . WE have placed at the head of this article the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additions to the department of science of which they treat . We propose , however , to examine only the first of them . We have deemed it a duty to mention also the other two , though one of them has already been reviewed in our pages , because the chapter of Mr. Bowen 's book to which we especially refer anticipates , by a period of nearly two years , some of the most important statements and conclusions of M. Chevalier ; and from the very recent and elaborate treatise of Mr. Colwell we have derived some valuable facts , for which we desire to give the proper credit . This latter work is worthy of more than a passing notice . Its author , who is intimately connected with one of the great producing interests of the country , is also known as a veteran in the science of Political Economy , and has hitherto , by his pen and by his editorial labors , made valuable contributions to its literature in this country . We have now , however , to speak of M. Chevalier 's treatise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work which is destined , we think , to produce more impression than any on a kindred subject which , in this age teeming with discussions of credit , currency , and money , has recently // appeared . It is not a long book , nor is it a dry one , as a glance at its somewhat appalling show of figures might lead one to fear . It is easily read , and its main facts and arguments are easily mastered . To the disciplined mind of the author the whole subject seems so simple , that lie makes it almost equally lucid to our own . Michel Chevalier is known in this country as one of the most intelligent foreigners who have visited the United States for the purpose of studying our political , social , and industrial institutions , and given the results of their observation to the press . He came here in 1832 , having been sent by M. Thiers , then Minister of Commerce , to investigate our railway system . He spent nearly two years upon this side of the Atlantic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to the United States . The best known of them is that entitled , " Society , Manners , and Politics in the United States , " a translation of which was published in Boston in 1839 . In Europe M. Chevalier is known as an eminent political economist , of which science he is a Professor in the College of France ; and especially as the leader of the free-trade party , a position which secures to his writings peculiar influence and favor in Great Britain . No man is more competent than he to discjiss intelligently the important topics of the present volume , and to no man should we look more naturally than to Richard Cobden , his admirer and fellow-laborer , to introduce the work , in our language , to English and American readers . The name of Mr. Cobden upon its title-page will , at the present moment , draw more attention to the book in this country , than even that of its distinguished author . Mr. Cobden has recently been , for the second time , a visitor to the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy is the science of a free and commercial people , and accordingly it was in England - then the freest of commercial states - that it was first intelligently discussed . It presupposes that the people of a country , and not merely its rulers , have an interest to discover , and power to establish , the true laws which should regulate the business intercourse of nations , and make the industry and resources of individuals productive of the highest national prosperity . Without free 29* // discussion , and free legislative action , this end can not be accomplished . It is a coincidence not unworthy of notice , in this connection , that the same year which witnessed the American Declaration of Independence , gave to the press Adam Smith 's " Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations " ; and quite as inemorable is it in the history of the institutions and material progress of Great Britain , that a decade of years which saw the waning glory of Chatham , the meridian splendor of Burke , and the rising effulgence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in promoting the welfare of that great empire , as the wisdom of her statesmen or the eloquence of her orators . Much of the later legislation of that country we believe to be fairly attributable to the information and principles which that work first brought together and disseminated , and to the interest which it awakened in the minds of public men . The subject of the currency had occupied the minds of some of the ablest men of Great Britain , before the publication of Adam Smith 's book . Very early in the century , the philosopher Newton , then Director of the Mint , had established , with a clearness which has not since been surpassed , the principle that any unusual production of either of the precious metals disturbs the arbitrary relation affixed to them by law , and leads inevitably to the exportation of the one thereby rendered more valuable ; and he then suggested the true remedy , in a readjustment of the legal relation . The Earl of Liverpool , also , as early as 1774 , had begun to direct his attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not until thirty years afterward that his celebrated Treatise on the Coins of the Realm was given to the press . During the period that intervened between the suspension of cash payments in 1797 ' , and their resumption in 1821 , a host of writers , and a multitude of very able debates in Parliament , presented the subject of the currency in every light of which it seems capable . The report of the Bullion Committee , in 1810 , brought the whole matter distinctly before Parliament , and it was constantly discussed there from that time till the passage of Sir Robert Peel 's Act in 1819 . Then arose the two great parties of Bullionists and Anti-Bullionists , which have // divided public opinion in Great Britain from that day to this , and which at this time carry on their discussions with as much interest , and dispute with as much acrimony , as in the days when Lord Liverpool was Minister . In popular language , money is but another name for wealth , and all estimates or expressions of wealth are made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a " representative " of value , but this does not express its full meaning . It is not merely the measure of all values , but , like other useful commodities , it is a value in itself . Aristotle thus explains its origin . " It was agreed , " he says , " to give and to receive a substance , which , useful in itself was easily transferred from hand to hand in the ordinary transactions of life ; it was iron , for instance , or silver , or some other substance , of which the size and weight were in the first place determined , and on which , to escape from the inconvenience of continual measurings , a particular stamp was affixed as a sign of its value . " The patriarchs of ruder times are supposed to have consummated their bargains by the exchange of flocks and herds , in which their wealth consisted . " Pecus , " a flock , is the root of the Latin " pecunia , " money . Thus does language preserve and transmit to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious metals , which is an expression on the face of the metal of its weight and fineness , is of much later origin than the use of them as money . It grew necessarily out of the inconvenience of the continual weighing and testing of quality . The selection of gold and silver to serve the purposes of money was due to the supposed stability of their value . It was essential that the commodity selected should be difficult of acquisition , moderate in quantity , and as nearly as possible of uniform production . The early experience of the world justified the application of these qualities to gold and silver , and though later discoveries of gold have done much , as we expect to show , to disturb its relation of value to other commodities , the two metals still continue better fitted to perform the important functions assigned to them than anything which could be substituted in their place . Every event which tends to impair the immutability of their value , in the same degree impairs , for a time , their usefulness as money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern history , the discovery of the silver mines of Peru in 1545 , and of the gold fields of California and Australia in 1848 and 1851 . The effect of the first of these discoveries in disturbing the value of the precious metals is abundantly established . Silver became , relatively , much more abundant than gold , and its value , measured by its purchasing power , fell in* the early part of the seventeenth century to less than a third of what it had been previously to the discovery of America in 1492 . In France , a " hectolitre " of wheat ( about three bushels ) , which at the earlier date cost a sum equivalent to from 49 to 62 cents of our money , at the beginning of the seventeenth century cost from $1.86 to $ 2.05 . The price continued to rise gradually through the eighteenth century , and has risen until the present time , so that , during the last fifty years , the hectolitre has averaged in price about $3.72 . These facts establish the principle that the precious metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the fluctuation is marked chiefly by the fluctuation in the price of other products . A few words respecting value and price are necessary to the clear understanding of the subject . The value of an article depends upon the extent and degree of its usefulness , and upon its abundance . Of two equally useful articles , that is most valuable which is produced in the smallest quantity , and in an exchange of those articles , a larger quantity of the more abundant must be given for a smaller quantity of the scarcer of them . Value , when expressed in money , - which is the common standard by which all values are rated , - becomes price . It is common to treat these words value and price as synonymous , but this is by no means correct ; for money , in which all prices are expressed , is itself of variable value . While , therefore , in most cases , fluctuations in the price of commodities have been owing to the increased or diminished production of them , or to an increased or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and silver have remained of uniform value , in not a few instances the change of price has been caused by a real change in the value of money . Property is extremely sensitive to fluctua // tions even in the temporary supply of money . This is witnessed in the daily operations of the stock exchange . It is still more sensitive to any permanent disturbance of its own value ; but with a metallic currency , it is not always easy to determine whether a rise or fall in commodities is attributable to one or the other of these causes . When , however , we abandon for a time the use of the precious metals as a medium of exchange , and resort to paper money as a substitute , we very quickly perceive that a depreciation in the value of the medium raises the price and apparent value of all other articles . The most remarkable illustrations of this truth , in modern times , are to be derived from the issue of the Continental money during our Revolutionary war , and of the assignats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of money , after the price of a bushel of salt had risen , in America , to two hundred dollars , and the fare of a hackney-coach in Paris to six thousand livres . A similar , though much less marked , depreciation in the value of paper money was consequent upon the suspension of cash payments by the Bank of England in 179*T , bank-notes having fallen at one time to twenty-five per cent below the gold which they represented . The amount of gold and silver yielded by America from 1492 to 1500 , is estimated not to have exceeded $ 290,400 annually . From 1500 to 1545 , the product of mines , together with the hoards discovered in Mexico and Peru , rose to an average of more than $ 3,000,000 annually . After the discovery of the rich mines of Potosi , in 1545 , the production increased rapidly to $11,000,000 , and afterwards even to $15,000,000 a year . When we consider how few in number and variety were then the exchangeable commodities of the world , we shall perceive the immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals must have occasioned . We have seen that history , with its unerring data , supports the universal law . The most authentic estimates of the production of gold and silver , prior to the present century , are those of Humboldt , who , in his Essay on New Spain , fixed it at the following average annual amounts - // From 1492 to 1500 , . . . . $ 250,000 " 1500 to 1545 , . . . . 3,000,000 " 1545 to 1600 , . . . . 11,000,000 " 1600 to 1700 , . . . . 16,000,000 " 1700 to 1750 , . . . . 22,500,000 " 1750 to 1803 , . . . . 35,300,000 The amount of gold produced at the beginning of this century , in America , in Europe , and in Asiatic Russia , he estimated at about $10,500,000 annually . Adding all that was received in Christendom from other sources , M. Chevalier estimates the aggregate amount at less than $12,000,000 . The supply was first increased from the Russian mines ; those of the Oural Mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those of Siberia , discovered about 1830 , yielding a far richer return after 1840 . M. Chevalier represents the quantity , thus increased , to be three times the annual production at the beginning of the century . Birkmyre , whose estimates at the time of their publication , in 1851 , were regarded as the most accurate and valuable then made , represents the increase of the annual product as from $12,643,048 in 1801 , to $28,298,129 in 1846 . The difference between this estimate and M. Chevalier 's is not important in itself , and it dwindles into insignificance when we come to consider the immense increase in production which followed the discovery of the Californian and Australian deposits . Chevalier estimates the mass of gold annually furnished to the states of Christendom in 1857 at $ 183,750,000 . The production of that year was fifteen times as great as it had been forty years before , , and five times as great as it was in 1848 . In the same period of forty years , the annual production of silver had increased only from $38,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking when expressed in another form . The whole continent of America , from its discovery in 1492 to 1848 , produced only about $1,944,657,000 of gold . At the present time , the amount annually yielded throughout the world is nearly $200,676,000 , or more than one telith of the whole production of America prior to 1848 . To present this marvellous production in still another aspect , and one which , at the same time , shows the influence it // is already having upon prices , M. Chevalier states that the ordinary daily earnings of a miner in Australia and California average nineteen francs , or $ 3.53 , while , at the same time , a gold-washer on the Rhine gathers daily gold-dust worth only one and a half or two francs ( 28 to 37 ' cents ) , and is contented to follow the occupation . If , in answer to this , it be said that the cost of living in California and Australia is higher than in Germany by an almost equal degree , it is replied that this is but a temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that the cost of producing or procuring the necessaries of life will be permanently greater in those countries than in other countries of similar climate . The richness of the soil , its capacity to yield every kind of agricultural product in the greatest abundance , and the energy of commerce , always tending to restore prices to an equilibrium throughout the world , will speedily bring about this result . If the richness of the mines still continues , the California miner will receive $ 3.50 for that labor which , under precisely similar conditions elsewhere , is worth but one dollar . Such a disparity can not long continue ; gold will diffuse itself through other countries , and tend there to raise the price of labor to the California standard ; or , in other words , gold will become depreciated elsewhere as it is in California . The next inquiry which suggests itself is , What has become of all the new gold , and why has it not produced a more marked enhancement of prices , than is supposed to have occurred ? A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us to answer this inquiry satisfactorily . The coinage of gold since 1848 has followed closely upon its production , and in that condition it has diffused itself , with a rapidity and to an extent hitherto unparalleled , through the currencies of Europe . In France , during eleven years of the reign of the first Napoleon , the coinage of gold amounted to about $102,000,000 , or an average of about $9,000,000 a year . Under Louis XVIII . it averaged only $ 1,250,000 . In the six years of the reign of Charles X. , the whole amount coined was only $9,672,000 , or $1,612,000 a year . Under Louis Philippe it averaged $2,325,000 . During the eight years ending December 31 , 1857 , the gold coined at the Paris mint // amounted to $ 505,000,000 , an average of $63,240,000 a year . The greatest amount coined in any one year was in 1857 , when it reached $106,496,388 . In England , for the seven years ending December 31 , 1856 , the total coinage of gold amounted to $ 221,429,361 , an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coinage of France in the same period . For the seven preceding years , it had amounted only to $138,132,201 , or an average of $19,733,171 a year . In the United States we have not so accurate returns ; but from several sources we gather the following facts . The Director of the Mint , in a communication addressed to the Governor of Massachusetts , December 11 , 1858 , estimated the total amount of gold and silver coin in the United States at $258,000,000 . In October , 1856 , the same functionary , in a letter addressed to  --  the Secretary of the Treasury , estimated the amount at $200,000,000 . These statements show an increase of $58,000,000 in two years , of which $46,064,000 was in gold , being an average of $23,032,000 a year . Other estimates place the amount of gold and silver coin in the United States , in 1849 , at $120,000,000 , and show a gradual increase to the figures given above , or a more than doubling of the amount in nine years . Nearly the whole of this increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known that the influx of gold from California soon operated in the United States to drive the silver coin of full weight out of the country ; and this dangerous depletion was stopped only by the Act of 1853 , which , by reducing the weight of silver coin below the weight of bullion of like value , rescued it for use to the country , but practically abolished silver as a money standard , - the law providing that the new coin should be legal tender only to the amount of five dollars . We shall have more to say of this law in another connection . Following the statistics of our author , we find that , since the discovery of the new gold , the coinage of silver in France has largely diminished . During the first forty-eight years of this century it amounted to $ 723,726,000 , or an average of more than $15,000,000 a year . During the eight years ending with 1857 , it has amounted only to $60,298,760 , or an // average of $7,537,345 . In 1857 , the year of the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in 1854 it was less than half a million of dollars . The imports of silver into France formerly exceeded the exports ,  --  the excess , from 1816 to 1839 , amounting to nearly $340,000,000 . They continued in like proportion till 1852 , when the exports began to preponderate , so that in six years ending January 1 , 1858 , the excess of exports amounted to $ 212,600,000 , or about two fifths of the silver money which France was supposed to possess a few years previously . This sudden and rapid displacement of silver in France is attributed by M. Chevalier chiefly to its enhanced value as caused by the fall of gold , though it is due in part also to local and temporary causes , which have created a demand for the metal elsewhere . Silver in France is now at a premium , ranging , in the two last years , from two to four per cent . This , in a country where the annual rate of interest is within the same limits , is quite sufficient to cause a constant drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus parted with has gone to the East , - to countries where it is the only legal currency . The amount of silver sent to the East from Western Europe in 1857 is estimated at $ 97,506,257 , or more than double the production of the silver mines of Europe and America in the same space of time . At the beginning of the century it is estimated that the export of both silver and gold to the East did not exceed $13,000,000 , and that in 1830 it had fallen below $ 10,000,000 . M. Chevalier admits that the amount likely to be hereafter exported to the East can not be estimated with any degree of accuracy . Since the renewed attempts in China to suppress the opium-trade , and during the period of the wars which have convulsed that country as well as India , the condition of things in that quarter of the globe has been exceptional , and such as to cause an unusual demand for silver , both to pay for commodities and to supply the military chest . The complete subjugation of India by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state ; but the necessity of maintaining a much larger army there in future , and the measures recently taken to exclude gold altogether von . Lxxxix. - NO. 185. 30 // from the currency of that country , will tend to keep up in India a demand for silver greater than has ever hitherto been known in time of peace . It has just transpired that the finances of British India are in a very disordered and embarrassed state . This will , of course , increase the necessity for remittances from the mother country , and new loans of large amount are now projected . On the other hand , the legalizing of the opium-trade , by the recent treaty between Great Britain and China , will bring back to India from China a part of the hoards which have for ages been accumulating there . By the conversion of the trade from smuggling to a lawful commerce , opium will , however , cease to be paid for altogether in silver , as has hitherto been the case . Credit , and an exchange of commodities , will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments . It is well known that hitherto , whenever opium has been freely , though illicitly , admitted into China , that country has been an exporter rather than an importer of silver . This was the case from 1830 to 1839 , when the government became alarmed at the drain of silver , and with a strong arm seized and destroyed all the opium then in the country . This being chiefly the property of British merchants , a war with England was the consequence . At the present time , the opium sold to China is said to equal $40,000,000 a year . Now that the trade is legalized , it will vastly increase . It must therefore be admitted , that the drain of silver from France is , in some measure , owing to an unusual demand for it in other countries ; but we think it equally certain , that the export is partly due to the premium which it bears over gold , and which , as gold is equally a legal cu*rrency in that country , allows it to be exported at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal relations of gold and silver in France , and other countries , and to the subject of a double standard . The motive which has led most civilized nations , at some time or other , to adopt both gold and silver as currency , is , that while the great value of the one , in small compass , renders it extremely suitable for large payments , the inferior value of the other permits it to be coined into pieces of convenient size for use in petty transactions . To constitute both alike mediums of payment , a fixed relation of value must be established be- // 351 tween them ; and if the cost of producing each remained always uniform , there would be ' no objection to the double standard . Unfortunately , as we have seen , this cost does not remain the same , but is ' subject to fluctuations quite considerable enough to disturb the arbitrary relation , and to make one metal or the other , for the time being , the exclusive currency . In France , by the Act of March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ) the relation of silver to gold was fixed as one to fifteen and a half , and that law is still in force . In 1857 an Imperial Commission was appointed to consider the condition of the currency consequent upon the great influx of gold . The conclusions at which the Commissioners arrived are such as to awaken no small surprise in the readers of M. Chevalier 's book . They maintain that gold has not fallen in value , notwithstanding its extraordinary increase , and that the drain of silver is attributable wholly to the demand for it in the East . They , however , regard this drain as of so serious a character , that they propose to check it by the imposition of a heavy duty , and by affixing penalties to the act of selecting and assorting silver coin for export . Upon the futility of these recommendations M. Chevalier remarks : - " If there be anything confirmed by history , it is that the efforts of ' governments are powerless to regulate the value of gold and silver in relation to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are equally so to compel the precious metals to remain within the territory of a state , should commerce give the impulse to their exportation . " In the United States , the Act of April , 1792 , fixed the proportion between gold and silver at one to fifteen . Experience proved that by this ra'tio gold was undervalued , and , as a consequence , gold formed but a small part of the circulation , till the relation was altered by the Act of June 28 , 1834 , which fixed the ratio at one to sixteen . The effect of this change was to quadruple the coinage of gold . Both metals circulated together , till the influx of gold from California , after 1848 , again raised silver to a premium so considerable as to cause a sudden and rapid disappearance of silver coins of full weight , and the bringing to light and use the worn and depreciated Spanish and Mexican coins , which had previously almost gone out of circulation . Such a threatened debasement of the silver coin // could be met oniy by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 , 1853 , was passed , by which the weight of halfdollars and all smaller coins was reduced about seven per cent below what it had previously been , thus giving to the coin an artificial value above that of a corresponding weight of silver bullion . This expedient had been often resorted to before in other countries ; and it has proved an effectual protection to our small domestic currency , as all motive for melting or exporting the smaller coin is now taken away . The new coinage is , however , made legal tender only to the amount of five dollars . In England , by the Act of 1816 , ( 56 Geo . III . c. 68 , ) gold coin is the only legal tender for amounts greater titan forty shillings . In Holland , Belgium , some of the states of Germany , and those parts of India lately under the dominion of the East India Company , gold has been altogether demonetized , and silver established as the only standard money . Gold , in these countries , is treated only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities . We have now endeavored to show that the value of gold is rapidly and seriously depreciating ; and that the great law of values , making them to depend on the cost and magnitude of production and the extent of demand , holds good when applied to the precious metals , although , as they are by law invariable and a measure of all values , their depreciation is made apparent only by the enhanced price of other property . We have also seen , that where there is by law a double standard , and a fixed relation between the two metals , a fall in the value of gold has operated to drive silver out of circulation , causing it either to be used more extensively in the arts , or , what is more usual , to be exported to those countries where it is the exclusive standard . We have shown , moreover , that in Great Britain and the United States gold is substantially the only currency . In these countries , therefore , no less than in France , will the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probabilities of this depreciation , it is assumed that the supply of gold is to continue as great as it // 353 has hitherto been . Mr. Bowen expresses a doubt of this , and thinks that there are already indications that the richest sources of supply are becoming gradually exhausted ; but even he admits that gold may fall to half its present value . M. Chevalier , on the contrary , believes that the supply will not diminish , and that , after meeting all the wants of the world , for use in the arts , for the indulgence of luxury , and for substituting gold in place of paper money in those countries where , as in the United States , bank-notes are extensively used , a large surplus will still remain to dilute the currencies of those countries which shall still continue to use gold as money . This is an extremely interesting portion of his book , but we have not space to give the details of it . We can not , of course , vouch for the accuracy of his figures and estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjecture , but there is one important fact which must not be lost sight of , - that the business of the world is done to a far greater extent without the intervention of money , than would a few years ago have been thought possible . Bills of exchange and other instruments of credit , and in large cities the operations of clearing-houses , have very much reduced the actual use of money . The effect of the new gold upon prices is not yet as apparent as we believe it is soon destined to become . We have seen that hitherto it has nearly all passed into the coinage of France , England , and the United States , displacing , in those countries , silver or bank-notes . To use the expressive title of one of M. Chevalier 's chapters , " France has served temporarily as a parachute to retard the fall of gold . " There are many intelligent persons in Great Britain , who still deny that prices have risen in consequence of the plethora of gold . They admit that they have actually risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes , - to shortness of crops , to expensive wars , to the increase of population beyond that of production , to unwonted commercial activity and speculation . M. Chevalier believes the rise to be general , permanent a the fall of gold . , iid based upon Prices rise so gradually , and we so readily accustom ourselves to pay year by year a little more for the articles which we use , or upon which we subsist , that few persons are aware 30* // of the great increase which has taken place within a few years . From a table in the last volume of Tooke 's History of Prices , made up of twenty-seven articles , and including all the chief staples of food except bread-stuffs , and the chief raw materials used in manufacture except cotton , we find that in Great Britain , between January , 1851 , and February , 1857 , a period of only six years , there was in these commodities an average rise of forty-seven per cent , and that the price of many of them was doubled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of gold , and this rapid rise of prices , is the great and serious question in which this whole discussion ends . Both M. Chevalier and Mr. Cobden regard it with great solicitude , and the arguments of the former all tend to show the necessity of substituting silver for gold in the currency of France ' ; permitting the latter , however , to remain as a legal coinage , to be taken at its actual value , subject to frequent readjustment . Mr. Bowen , on the other hand , believes that the fall of gold is not an alarming circumstance ; but that it will be of positive advantage to this country . There is , doubtless , so wide a difference between the condition of our own and older countries , that very different effects may be experienced here from those which are to be apprehended in France and England . The fall of gold will certainly be attended with much less of inconvenience and danger to our people than to theirs , while in some respects we shall derive a benefit from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rise uniformly together , wages as well as commodities , no person , whose income depends upon earnings , or the profits of business , would be the loser . Such is the condition of the great mass of the people of this country . Capitalists invest their money either in real estate , in short loans upon real or personal security , or in the stocks of corporations , banks , railroads , manufacturing or insurance companies , all of which pay dividends out of their earnings , and those earnings will increase with the cheapness of money , which enhances prices . Nor will merchants and mechanics suffer , for they are always the first to profit by an abundance of money . Professional men will suffer more ; for there is always a jealousy of professional charges . Those services // which are the product of the brain , the fruits of learning and education , are ever the most grudgingly paid . The man of suddenly acquired wealth , who lavishes money without stint upon the adornment of his house , upon equipage , and upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , a benefactor to merchants and tradesmen , contributes tardily and stingily to his minister 's salary , frets at the expense of his children 's education , frowns at the doctor 's bill , which is the penalty of his luxurious living , and revenges himself upon his lawyer by maledictions out of Scripture . All these professional men will suffer by the enhanced cost of living ; for their remuneration will not keep pace with it . Salaried men , agents , clerks , and officers of corporations will also suffer , though in a less degree . The rate of their compensation being dependent in considerable measure on the profits of business , their salaries will rise in new communities rapidly , in old ones more slowly , with the prosperity of their employers . Many , however , of the humbler of this class , especially in great cities , where a life of routine has rendered them almost incapable of other employment , and chained them to the desk like galley-slaves to the oar , will be truly straitened in the endeavor to give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , they have hitherto been able to afford . Those who live by the labor of the hands , the dependents upon wages , will fare the most severely . In great establishments , wages fall suddenly and greatly upon a depression of business ; but they are slow to rise on its revival . The tendency of factory labor is towards relatively lower prices ; and hence the condition of our New England manufacturing towns is rapidly changing for the worse . The places at the loom an*l the spinning-frame , once occupied for a limited season by the daughters of our substantial farmers , are now filled from a much lower class , either of foreigners or permanent native operatives . The degradation in this respect has been great within ten years . We are rapidly creating in this country a manufacturing class ; and though it has not yet fallen to that low estate , which in England ties the laborer helplessly and hopelessly to his machine , for such a pittance of wages as the master chooses to give , we are fast drifting in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see mere stupid force substituted for that intelligent and skilful labor , which has hitherto enabled us to compete with the foreign manufacturer , who is worse served , but at far lower wages . In the United States , we have few persons living on annuities or funded property . Annuities , though granted by some of the life-insurance companies , are very little understood by our people . Contracts of life-insurance are happily very common , and becoming more so . An annuity differs from a contract of life-insurance chiefly in this , that the price of the annuity is usually paid at the beginning in a gross sum , while insurance on lives is more commonly kept in force by the payment of an annual premium . The purchaser of the annuity , who paid for it when money was dear , will suffer by a depreciation of its value , and his income may at last purchase only half as much as the sum he stipulated for ; but the holder of a life policy , who pays from year to year , gets the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heirs can not complain , if they are paid , after his death , in money of like value . France and England have a great public debt . In England , the debt now amounts to $ 3,816,563,470 , and constitutes the wealth of a large body of the people . In France and the other European states the debt is less , but the aggregate indebtedness of all Europe falls little short of $10,000,000,000 . As this is substantially permanent , for the principal is never paid , a fall in the value of money relieves the government in paying the interest , but it entails a corresponding loss upon the people . In the United States , we have no permanent debt , and the few public securities which our government has issued are better known to the stock-exchange of London than to that of New York . The States , it is true , owe a heavy aggregate of debt , probably not much less than two hundred and fifty millions of dollars ; but most of this is held abroad , so that foreigners , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . As tax-payers in the indebted States , we shall gain by their loss . Protracted leases of land are not common in this country . A few ground rentals exist in the large cities , for long terms of years ; but generally , land and buildings are rented together , // on short leases . Long farm leases , such as go to swell the rentrolls of the English gentry , are almost equally unknown , except in the manorial districts of the State of New York , where they are rapidly disappearing . There is a very important species of property , which we have not yet mentioned , - railway bonds . Of these a vast amount , estimated at $400,000,000 , has been issued by the various railway corporations of the United States . Much of this debt was contracted before the influence of the new gold began to be felt , and as the bonds have generally twenty years to run , the railway corporations will profit by the fall of gold . If , at the maturity of the bonds , gold has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well off as if only half the debt had originally been contracted , while the cheapness of money will have swelled their earnings . A large share of the railway bonds are also held in Europe , so that here again , as in the case of the State debts , we must profit by the change . We have thus endeavored to show the nature of the several species of property in which the wealth of the Uiiited States consists , and have endeavored to predict the effect upon each of them of . a considerable depreciation in the value of gold . Though not devoid of danger to our people , they will suffer so much less than those of older countries , that we can patiently await the issue . Our relations with Europe are so intimate , however , that we can not escape injury from whatever seriously injures the European states . In case the relation of gold to silver should be once or oftener readjusted in those states , or should gold be altogether demonetized by them , our legislation must follow theirs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value than the currencies of Europe . Even now , we fully believe that the inability of our manufacturers to compete with those of Western Europe is largely owing to the superabundance of our paper currency , which is worth less than the specie in which it is by law redeemable , though practically never redeemed . Prices are inflated as well by cheap paper , as by cheap gold ; and whatever we import from foreign countries we buy at prices governed by our own currency , - while , unfortunately , we must pay for it in theirs . Another European war may postpone for a time the oper // ation of those causes which are leading to the depreciation of money . Our reasonings have been based on a state of peace . A long and general war would not only diminish the production of the precious metals , but would increase the demand for them . But we believe that the results which we have predicted will come to pass , whenever the causes to which they are attributed shall be operative in full , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus to unfold , will be justified by future history .
