NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE . No . XXXY ,  --  APItIL , 1853. - VOL . VI . NOTES FROM THE COPPER REGION. * BY ROBERT K. CLARKE . VIEW NEAR AN ANCIENT EXCAVATION . DOUBTLESS there is nothing which the Visitor will see in the copper region , which will produce in him such lively emotions of wonder and admiration , leading the mind directly to the Inighty , yet hidden and mysterious forces of nature , as the Mass Copper . Whether regarded as the product of the same convulsive throes by which the Trap Range was heaved to its present position ; or as afterward injected or formed by chemical action in the fissures then created ; in either case , he beholds before him the palpable result of secret and marvelous agency . Reflections like these will arise to him , when landing at the Sault , he first beholds upon the dock a pile of such masses as we have before described ; and aga in at Eagle River , where a similar pile awaits him at the warehouse of the Cliff Mine . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when standing deep in the recesses of the aged rocks , he beholds uncovered before him , lfl sztu , and in solid connection , an extent of the metal , which , fairly estimated , has a gravity of fifty tons , and all , saving a slight admixture of quartz , of the utmost purity and malleability .

In this way , by the successive removal of small narrow chips , still increasing in length , until this reaches the thickness of the mass , the separation is finally effected . Many of the ancient stone hammers , chisels , &amp;c. , here represented , have been found near the remains of excavations made in early times . A mass of eighteen inches in thickness and four feet across , will in this way require eight days to divide it . Such a mass when severed , supposing the length the same as the breath will be found to weigh between 4000 and 5000 pounds . It * The largest mass of native metal which has been found in the Cliff Mine , uncovered at one time , has been estimated by the superintendent at eighty tons . // has been attempted by the application of the circular saw , to effect this subdivision more rapidly , and much expenditure was made by the Copper Falls ( ) ompany in this attempt ; hitherto , however , without satisfactory results . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the copper , and running through it in irregular but narrow veins , occasionally occur thin deposits of the quartz rock . The hardness of this mineral is proof against steel of any temper ; and not only so , but is the speedy destruction of the saw . When divided into rriasses of proper size it is next raised from its position on the ground by means of a portable framework of iron , provided with an arrangement of wheels , cranks , and ropes , by which , when placed over the mass , the workmen are able to raise it upon the truck . It is than rolled out upon the railroad , with which the drifts are provided , to the shaft , where it is elevated in* the manher before descAbed . Once upon the surface it is weighed , and the weight , with the initials of the establishment having been impressed upon it , it is hauled to the lake for shipment to the smelting furnace . In perpendicular shafts , the masses of copper are raised to the surface by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is covered with cast-iron plates , fire-wood is piled to the depth of three feet . The veinstone is then placed upon this , till it reaches the quantity of about 60 tons . The fire is then applied , and the veinstone is thus roasted , and made much more easily separated . After the roasting , the veinstone is broken by the hammer into small pieces , the largest seldom exceeding two pounds in weight . It is then shoveled into a truck , and slid out upon a train road to the stamps . The truck , being provided with a movable bottom , or front piece turning upon a hinge-readily confined or loosened by the turning of a bolt - is emptied of its contents into the pass . This is a large chest or box , some ten feet in height , and eight feet through , running along in the rear of the stamps . There being openings in this opposite each cover or battery of stamps , the stone comes through , as fast as it is removed and shoveled into the covers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water , the same in part derived from the draining of the mine . This greatly assists in reducing the stone to a gravel-like fineness . In the illustration the reader is presented with two covers of stamps , consisting of five each , those which are now in use , there being five covers of new ones now in course of erection . The stamps consist of heavy blocks of cast-iron , weighing with the pestle of wood to which they are attached ( b d ) , from 400 to 500 pounds . These work with great force and rapidity in the chests or covers , being successively elevated and dropped by the cams ( c ) which , in diagonal rows , are inserted in the cylinder ( a ) revolving in front of them . The machinery is impelled by a small engine of eight horse power . As fast as the stone is made fine enough to pass the wire grating near the bottom of the covers , it passes out with the water into the angular space in front . From this the heaviest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balance passing off by the trough to the left . Of the portion entering the pool , the heaviest particles settle there , the rest going to join the stream on the left . As well the stream flowing from the pool , as that which runs off through the trough to the left , pass into and through the pits , which are two large receptacles just outside of the stamp-room in the present arrangement . Here it again loses the heaviest portion of its copper . The copper taken from the pool , together with that found adhering to the stamps , and on the bottom of the covers , termed the stamp-heads* is put into barrels , and is then ready for shipment to the smelting furnace . The residue of the matter left in the pool , is again , after having been passed thtough the small *hopper ( to be noticed in the il1ustration ) where it is triturated to a still greater de PLACiNG cOiTaa ON THE TRUCKS .

The jigger is a kind of low tub , with a bottom of sheet brass finely perforated . A portion of the ( leposits from the heads of this trench or from the sUike , to be noticed directly , having been hoveled into the tub , the boy stands astride of the trench , and by sundry vertical and whirling motions in the water as well as out , gives it the proper degree of agitation . Then resting it upon the floor , he with a scraper retnoves the surface . The copper lies in a deposit of reddish particles beneath . The top is thrown in a heap by itself , to undergo further washings at the buddies . The jigger separates the largest grained and roughest copper which is obtained from the floors . The next heaviest content* of the stream from the stamps will seek their place of deposit at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is termed by the workman the strike or tie . Of what settles here , the whole being supposed to be divided into three parts , the first , or part next the entrance of the water , termed the headings , as well as the next portion termed the middles , are reserved for repeated washing in the strike . The second middles , or lowest portion is washed over in the jiggers . The hutch is the designation for the next trench , and its contents are all passed through the strike . The two trenches last on the left , to which the lightest contents of the water from the stamps find their way are denominated respectively , the first and second buddies . At the head of the first buddle may be observed a small FIRST BUDDLE. grating in a flat or horizontal position .

The headings of this trench are reserved for the second buddle . The middles are worked over in the first . In the se ond buddle may be observed a contrivance somewhat similar to that noticed in the first ( though the grating is absent ) , in which the stuff from the first huddle is washed over and distributed by a similar contrivance over the bottom . The headings of the second huddle , the balance being reserved for repeated washing as before , are taken to the heaves . These are large iron-bound tubs , truncated cones , set upon the smaller end . They are kept half-full of water , and the matter from the huddle being frequently agitated by the shovel , its copper contents are deposited at the bottom . The water having been removed by buckets , and the poor-stuff carefully shoveled off , the finest grained copper from the floors is obtained , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process there is a quantity of refuse matter , or poor-stuff , which is wheeled off in barrows to the bursom , or waste pile . This is also the term for a similar deposit of poor-stuff from the mine . It may be seen in lines deleted // done , so far as the writer is informed , only at three points in the States-Detroit , Cleveland , and Pittsburgh . The process of smelting , accompanied with the rolling into sheets and bars , though it does not differ very greatly from that employed in regard to iron , is still highly interesting , and may be taken up on another occasion . In the mean time , I may be allowed to continue the somewhat discursive method which I had first adopted . And still a few items germane to the copper . The appearance which the native metal often presents is in the highest degree interesting , but quite incapable of being represented to the reader here . The blue and green carbonate , and the red oxide , often present hues the most positive and beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkling brilliance . Often of a color and lustre which rivals that of gold , it occurs in highly fantastic shapes imbedded in the veinstone , or in the midst of rhombs of the most beautiful spar , or again in connection with transparent crystals of quartz . A more beautiful but less common appearance is when it spreads out into an admirable resemblance of the most delicate foliage , thin almost as gold-leaf , and scintilating with iridescent colors . Good specimens of all these appearances are not difficult to be obtained at any of the mines which have penetrated much below the surface . Respecting the number of men employed at the mines , rates of wages , &amp;c. , a few particulars may not be without interest . The Cliff Mine employs at this time about 260 hands ; the North American about 75 , though when in full operation , requiring 150 . The rate of wages for surface-men is $26 per month . Stoping is paid for by the cubic fathom . in obtaining which the product of the length and breadth , the thwkness being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from $18 to $35 , according as the rock is highly compact , or of slight cohesion . Drifting-the usual size of the drift being six feet by four-is paid for at the rate of $5 the foot horizontal . For sinking a shaft , whose usual size is 10 feet by 14 , the compensation is from $10 to $15 the foot vertical . For cutting copper by hammer and chisel , the workmen receive from $1 34 to $1 50 per diem . In all cases the miner finds his own candles , his own fuse and powder . The population of the " Cliff " and " North American , " which are in close contiguity , is in the winter , when it is somewhat greater , about 900 . That of the whole mineral region is supposed to be about 5000 . There are forty-one companies on Keewenaw Point , which are carrying on mining operations to a greater or less extent , besides one on Isle Royal. * There are also several on the British * From the " St. Mary 's Sentinel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of the companies is taken : Northwest , Siskowit , Algonquin , Piscataqua , Ontonagon , Bohemia , Chesapeake , and Cape-8 ; which have their offices in Philadelphia ; the Pittsburgh and Boslon , Northwestern , North American , Iron City , Eureka , Ohio Trap Rock , Coiling , Ohio , Aztec , Adventure , Ridge , and Fire-Steel-12 ; having their offices in Pittsburgh . The side , among which are the Pointe aux Mines , and Bruce Mines , in active or partial operation . Exploring parties are understood to be now out on that side . Freights from Detroit to Lake Superior ports are usually $1 the barrel bulk-increased to $1 50 by the time of reaching the mines . The freight on copper to Detroit is $12 the ton . The charge at the portage is 5 cents the hundred pounds , which is included in the statements . Horses are much used among the mines , but the hardiness of the mule renders him much better adapted to the climate . They are much used for the draught , and are an item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he reaches the mines from Kentucky , whence they are obtained , not less than $200 . That all higher social and humanizing influences are not wanting in these growing communities , the stranger will see gratifying evidence here in the church and schoolhouse . The Methodist denomination has a regularly officiating clergyman , and a school is supported by private patronage , at which some 36 pupils receive daily instruction . No spirituous liquors are allowed to lie sold on the locations , and stringent regulations exist for the control of such miners as show a disposition to disorderly behavior , or neglect of business . By their own consent , when receiving employment , penalties are often imposed , which , in cases of good conduct subsequently , are generally remitted . One evening during my stay at the North American , I had the pleasure of a walk with Doctor C- , the physician to this as well as to the Cliff Mine , to the Farm , as it is called , of the former company . Here , on a clearing of some sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops the most thrifty and promising of oats , timothy , and potatoes . The last men-. tioned , indeed , seems to be much cherished , as I saw their green and vigorous tops in every little patch attached to the miners ' dwellings , as ' well as spreading clean along the face and upon the very summit of the bluff , wherever a potatG could be stuck among the rocks , disputing possession with the blue-berry and the bramble . In the opinion of my Yankee friend from Massachusetts , the whole of this region , so far as examined by him , while not more rugged than much of the Bay State , presents a much better soil for agriculture . I was informed by Major B n , formerly connected with the Indian department in this quarter , that he had raised at the Anse  --  a small cove or inlet in Keewenaw Bay , at which there is still an Indian settlement Minnesota , Norwich , Wheal Kate , Albion , Forest-5 ; with offices in New York . The Copper Falls , Phenix , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Farm , Toltec- ; with their offices in Boston : and the Montreal ( Bruce Mine ) , whose office is in Montreal , Canada . These , with a half dozen others , appear to be all that are now heard of out of a list of 104 companies , which are given in Houghton 's work on the Mineral Region of Lake Superior , published in 1846 , the list at that time being confessedly incomplete . // - crops of corn ( of the eight-rowed yellow species ) tomatoes , onions from the seed , cabbages , squashes , ruta-baga , and other turnips , besides potatoes , oats , and timothy , of as good quality as he has seen any where in the States . All these crops , according to Major B n , with the exception of corn , which is not reliable as a regular crop , can be raised with ordinary care any where back from the coast , where the land is suitable for tillage . One of the most cheering sights which offers itself to the eye of the visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive fields of oats and timothy , which , like a verdant carpet , spreads out at his feet , as he first draws in sight of these mines . This is on the " Cliff " location , and though still thickly studded with charred stumps , bidding defiance to the exterminating hand of the husbandman , it still looms up in the not distant future a vale of gardens , blooming with beauty and teeming with the rich productions of nature . The climate of this latitude , about 470 30 ' , is that in which most persons would be disposed to think the inhabitants of this region must experience their chief disadvantage . This is not so , however , if credit is to be given to their own representations , the winter being that season , which , save in respect of the inconvenience of being cut off from communication with the lower country , affords far the most satisfaction . The temperature , while producing no greater sensation of cold than the Middle States , is yet regular at that temperature . Extremes are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first fall of snow , affording the desired facilities for winter travel , begins among the residents of the different settlements , a round of social visits , festivities , and amusements , which are protracted till the snow leaves them as the sun enters Taurus . It is true the snow sometimes descends to a degree quite adverse to locomotion , and there are some days of biting severity ; but generally overhead , the eye of day is bright and unclouded ; underneath , the ground is smooth and slippery for the snow-shoe and the sleigh ; while around is an air , keen , bracing and exhilarating even as the strength of racy liquors . Such at least is the effect of exercise in the winter air of Lake Superior , as I was informed by one who , generally an explorer , has sometimes taken a turn at wood-cutting . The inexpressible elasticity and buoyancy of spirits which it produced in him , he could liken to nothing else but the effects of intoxicating drinks . From one fact , the degree of cold would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cliff Mine of the dripping water some 300 feet down the shaft . At such a time it clogs up the ladders , and is a source of serious annoyance to the miners . It happens in consequence of the draught occasioned by the winses from one level to another . The famous purity of the water of this region is indeed one of the most extraordinary things to *e noticed here . So great is this purity , so entirely free is the water of the streams and springs from earthy or foreign matter of any kind , that the daguerreotypist finds it better for his purposes than the best distilled water of the chemist . For laundry purposes , as I was informed by the ladies at the North American , it is rivaled only by that which falls from the clouds . It is remarkable again that in this last particular the water of Lake Superior , however pure in other respects , exhibits very different properties , being by the same authority entirely unfit for the laundry without a previous " breaking , " by soda or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lake Superior at least soft , but it seems that the hardness which characterizes the waters of Lakes Huron , Michigan , and Erie , and which is so unpleasantly perceptible to the feel , belongs also to it . It probably arises from similar causes in all - that of rolling over calcareous beds , somewhere in their vast course , though to consult only the formation of Keewenaw Point , there is nothing to encourage such a theory as regards Lake Superior . One morning during my stay at the North American , I clambered up the precipice which hems in the valley , in order to enjoy the prospect of the rising sun from such an elevation . This bluff , while one of the highest upon the whole ridge , is provided with a kind of mast , leading by steps to a round-top , the whole being surmounted with a flag-staff . From the round-top the sweep of the eye embraces three-fourths of the circle upon the lake ; while , in the other quarter , save the pleasant little oasis about the mines , spreads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching away in deepening files , or piercing the sky like the spears of giants . The mists rising from the valleys to meet the glorious orb of day were transformed by his touch into clouds of amber , while down-down-far , far away-rolled the broad and majestic Superior , a sea of blazing crystal . But words are inadequate to paint the magnificence and grandeur of such a prospect . Having accomplished most of what I had intended in a visit to these mines , after a few days ' stay I took leave of my hospitable friends one afternoon , and at four o'clock was pursuing my way on foot to the river . As I walk along the road leading close by the field to which I have before alluded , I am greeted with the rural and grateful sight of hay-making . The laborers are Canadian French , and are giving loose to all the merriment which to them is constitutional , as well as excited by the occasion . As I pursued my solitary way down the long declivity leading to the river , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raspberries and thimbleberries with which the bushes were laden to oppression . Now in the perfection of maturity , it seemed to me that I could have gathered them in unlimited quantities . The thimbleberry is a large and luscious species of raspberry , destitute of briars . To me , though acquainted with most of the productions of the States from the Lakes to the Gulf , this was a new species . So likewise was a species // of elder , whose clusters of scarlet berries , so dazzlingly brilliant , seen*ed to light up all the woods . This I had first noticed at Mackinaw , though nut then ripe . The fruit grows not in umbelliferous bunches , as in the common elder , but in irregular clusters-more of a botryoidal form . As I approached the village of ' Eagle River , which consists of some *20 or 30 houses , I was much struck with an appearance which in going to the mines had escaped me . This was the great number of poles which rise up every where . as if to rival the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost every house on top of the hill appeared to be provided with one of these appendages , to which was also attached a cord , as if for running up a flag . lit was soon showa that these houses were " groceries , " a sort of scrub-tavern quite common in the western world , where very cheap and very bad liquor is sold to the miners , and those who will patronize them . Each one has its flag-staff from which on particular occasions , as Sunday , they hoist their respective colors , like ships of different nations . The Eagle River House where I stop , I soon perceived has the tallest and most conspicuous of this sort of signs in the place , indicating that it is a sort of man-of-war in the business . Indeed the traveler may find worse accomniodation than he will meet with from my German host of the Eagle River I-Louse . While waiting for the approach of the propeller , which is in sight , I sauntered about the village . Passing by a new log building , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I soon discovered to proceed from a tall , gigantic son of Erebus , who , true to his African origin , preserved under the rigors of these northern skies his musical propensities . The air was one of those opera airs made so popular by Jenny Lind ; and confident I am that no performer in an orchestra ever rendered it with more spirit and effect . At length the " Manhattan " gets in-that is to say , as close as she can , for there is not water enough for her to come up to the pier . Casting anchor at a hundred yards out , the copper intended for shipment is first placed on board of a scow , on which the passengers also take a position , and is floated out to the propeller , and here being raised by a crane which is stationary upon the side of the vessel , is soon got aboard . Having at length weighed anchor just as " night , " in Homeric phrase , " rushes down upon the sable deep , " an hour 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some further objects to accomplish here , I conclude to await the arrival of the " Baltimore . " Many of the visitors at the Atwood House taking passage by the " Manhattan " down the lake , I am at length put in possession of a comfortable room . One day , while staying at the harbor , I find myself on the rugged rocks of the point near the light-house , while the delicious freshness of a breeze from W. by N. sends through my frame sensations of delight . A little sail-boat scuds out of the harbor with a pleasure party on board . The gulls too are enjoying the beautiful motion // of the water-their snowy forms rising and fall . ing with the waves with a careless abandon which one almost envies . What on earth is so happy as the life of a gull With pinions which can bear him at any time almost with the speed of a wish to the clear and cool depths of the upper air , or where the waters sleep in perfect tranquillityor , if he love excitement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the genial breeze is sending the waters with gentle surges upon the shores  --  the gull seems formed specially for an existence of unalloyed felicity . Too insignificant a prey for man-hardly dreading a foe in " winter and rough weather " - he sails , indifferent to the future , alike the etherial deep , or sways with the foam of the rolling billows . I believe he entertains similar notions , for his shrill note rises high upon the breeze , its weird music sounding in joy . An incident which occurred on the boat while rounding Keewenaw Point in our outward trip , and is brought to mind by the appearance of these rocks , seems to crave a place here . One of the passengers , while surveying intently the red conglomerate coast , seemed suddenly to waken up with an idea . " What is that red rock there P ' he eagerly asked ; " is that copper ? " It should be observed that the rock , as thus seen from the coast , is in breadth from 10 to 50 feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so called , of the Ontonagon mass , the Copper Falls mass , and the immense masses of the Cliff , ' would be mere pebbles , scarce worth the trouble of taking up if on the surface , much less of sinking for them 500 feet , cutting them into manageable masses , raising , and by expensive process hauling them several miles to the lake . Such are the ideas with which some men visit the copper region . Here was a man who thought it not incredible that he should see the waves of Lake Superior breaking against coasts of solid copper ! During a ramble along the shore I was able to find a number of beautiful agates , cornelians , and amethysts . Many flowers , too , of much beauty and peculiar species , are found interspersed among the rocks and pines . At a little lake , not far from the village , I found the water lilies spreading their starry disks far and wide over the water . They were of the same species ( ATymphea and Nelumbiurn ) , the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnesota . By the aid of a falleA pine , I am able to procure a magnificent bouq*iet. which makes me think Oi eyes far away , which such an offering would gladden . As the best disnosition I can make of them , I prepare them for a little girl who , with her parents , is among the visitors at the Harbor . Resting a moment on the fine cliff of conglomerate , supporting a magnificent growth of pines which precipitously overhangs the water , I see so pended in its pure depths many little fishes of the size of brook trout , " their wavy coats dropped with gold . " One morning we were presented with a sight of the mirage , a phenomenon of frequent occurrence on this lake . On this occasion Isle Royal was seen with great distinctness of outline , elevated above the water , by a space of several degrees . A similar appearance was a terward exhibited at Granite Islet , which in shape somewhat resembles a rude pyramid rising out of the water . Under the effect of the mirage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as piled up in successive layers , still separated by belts of bright light . Respecting game , and animals ferce naturce , as the lawyers say , the stranger is surprised to find such an utter absence of every thing of the kind . Deer are very scarce ; and of rapacious animals scarce any thing above the dignity of a wolf ranges these vast forests . Bears , it is true , are sometimes found , though very rarely . I was informed by a resident of the personal rencontre had with one of these animals , of the large brown species , by the chief of the Iron Band of the Chippeways . The Indian succeeded in slaying his adversary by means of his knife , but it was at the expense of being mutilated , and horribly " chawed up , " as my informant stated , till he hardly bore any semblance to the figure of a man . The polar bear has been stated by Schoolcraft to have been seen upon the southern shore of this lake , and this I find confirmed by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnesota Territorywhere they are hunted every winter by those engaged in trapping for furs-has a latitude precisely the same as Keewenaw Point . The " Baltimore " at length enters the harbor one evening while we are at tea , on her return trip to the Sault . Having to return from this place some thirty miles up the lake , to bring down a portion of the engine of the propeller Monticello , wrecked at that point , her passengers , consisting of a pleasure party from the Sault and from northern Ohio , all come ashore at our hotel , to await the return of the boat . A large portion of them consisting of ladies , we are all turned out of our rooms once more . A dance having been determined on , the dining-hall is cleared , the musicians seated , and sets of still unwearied dancers are soon moving through the mazy cotillion . The night being Saturday , mid night sends all to bed . The gentlemen are stretched out on mattresses or sofas , over time parlor floor , which thus presents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the gratification of the party , extended the usual length of her trip-which is only to Ontonagon-as far as La Pointe , at Ma deline Island . This , by the representation of a gentleman of the party with whom I had much conversation , is indeed a very delightful spot . In ituation somewhat more elevated than Eagle Harbor , though rising beautifully by a gradual ascent , it is backed by picturesque hills of about equal height with the trap range here . A few years ago the American Fur Company had a factory there , which has since been transferred to Saint Paul , on the Missouri . The dwellings , warehouses , gardens , are said to be still in excellent preservation , but the whole place wears // the appearance of extreme decay . The population is said to be some 600 , chiefly Indians , with Canadian French and half-breeds ; and it seems to the stranger a matter of difficult conjecture how they contrive to gain a subsistence . It is supposed to be chiefly by fishing . There has been for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white population is very small . The party spent some time on shore there-the place affording one of the best as well as most beautiful harbors upon the lake In the gardens attached to some of the dwellings of the Fur Company they found ripe cherries , and apples of eight and ten inches in circumference . This property , it is understood , has been for some years offered for sale by the Fur Company , at a very moderate price ; but though apparently eligible , and embracing many arrangements for comfort , it has not yet found a purchaser . It has been suggested that for agriculture , raising crops for the mines  --  to which an easy access can be had by sailing craft-this place presents advantaees . The soil is said to be excellent for potatoes , barley , oats , and grass , and generally for such vegetables as are common to this latitude . An extension of the fisheries also would no doubt be found profitable , provided such skill in packing shall have been attained as will enable the fisherman to ship for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are mostly taken ; for in this particular great errors have sometimes been committed . I was informed by a gentleman of Cleveland , interested for some years in the mines at Isle Royal , that the Fur Company had gone into the business one season at that island ; but that , owing to the miserable system of packing , the fish when taken below could not be made to keep . The result was a loss to the Company of some $10,000 . It is supposed that should the Ship * be made around the Rapids , affording an easy passage in the fall before the close of navigation , that the fishing interest may be expected to grow , not only at La Pointe , but especially at Isle Royal , and other places eligible for the business . Repairing to one of the large warehouses of the Fur Company , the party enjoyed a rare opportunity for the dance , which they improved for some time with great spirit . They were then favored by their Chippeway friends with a wardance . After this , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize , got up by some of the party , being a barrel of flour . Starting with their blankets about them , they quickly threw them aside as useless encumbrances , and ran puns neturalzbus . In this state the victor , to the great distress of the ladies , was brought up to receive the prize , which he rolled off with evident pride . We are at length all on board the Baltimore , which is steaming away for the Sault . After rounding Keewenaw Point , and passing between the mainland and Manitou Island , thc tempera. ture , which for a few days past had been uncomfortably cool , becomes much milder and more pleasant . This is no doubt owing to our being sheltered by the land against the NW. wind , to which , as well as from other quarters , the whole of Keewenaw Point is much exposed . For a similar reason , it is said , the climate at the wesl* end of the lake is much milder , the winds which reach there not passing over so vast a surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Baltimore found pleasant , even warm weather at La Pointe , while it was chill and disagreeable at the Harbor . After we had just passed Manitou Island , bearing south for Marquette , at Carp River , having the bold , now rounded now darkly broken outline of the coast upon our right , between us and the occident , the scenery assumes a character of majesty and beauty which is very striking . On the high ridge of trap a few miles east of Copper Harbor , a fire was raging in the woods , sending up a dense and darkening volume of smoke . As the hills now loomed up in the flush of the evening sky  --  the sun having but just dipped beneath the wave , it required no great effort of imagination to transform the fiery glow into volcanic light , and to imagine before me one of those grandest of natural phenomena in full actionthe column of smoke , which stretched far heavenward , the seeming ebullition of some veritable crater . The boat lying here for several hours , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory . At the latter is worked a species of novaculite which is found in this vicinity , and is represented as very superior . While here , there arrive a large birch canoe and a boat , full of Chippeways of the Anse . One of them , an old man , has his face tatooed in a horrible manner ; and all , men and women , are painted , and decorated with feathers in their hair and bead-work belts and leggings . Their mode of painting the face is generally by a stripe of vermillion horizontally across the nose and cheeks . They bring for traffic whortleberries and game-venison and pigeons . An old squaw has hanging over her breast four large metallic plates , of circular form , perforated with small holes . The plates are about six inches in diameter , and somewhat convex . Some of the men have the hair wrapped behind with scarlet ribbon , forming a sort of brilliant queue , terminated with two streaming tails formed by the ends of the ribbon . The women have papooses hanging over theit shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or on their backs . There are among them little children large enough to run about , hanging in perfect security over the sides of the boat , playing with their long black hair as it dips in the water , or clapping their little swarthy hands . The canoe was one of the largest class  --  a four-fathom canoe-handsomely constructed , and paintedwith significant characters . In the tist of appropriations made by Congress at tYs They are glad to get whisky in exchange for recent session , it is with pteasure we notice one of $350 ,  --  their commodities , and some of the boat people 000 for this very important object . are vile enough to furnish it in pailfuls . The // whortleberries , which are large and fine , are contained in large baskets or hampers of birchen bark . The iron establishment at Marquette is not at this time in operation , nor , it is believed , any other in the iron region . This is understood to he owing to embarrassing legal difficulties , now in course of adjustment . Leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the varied character of the scenery from which we are receding becomes very interesting . Granite Islet has not a speck of verdure. and bald rocks on the main shore , generally inclining at an angle , alternate with smooth beaches of sand . As we proceed the view changes , open . ingiip toward the north a magnificent outline of hills the most varied and picturesque I have yet noticed . Just now the sky for some ten degrees up is covered with the most airy and delicate little cloudlets , of the same amethystine tints which , as with a halo , invest the peaks running along the coast . The beautiful and reposeful character of the scene , under the calm clear light of the morning  --  the waters spreading tranquilly aWay , is strongly suggestive of that with which we are presented in Italian views-such as of the Bay of Naples . At noon we are in sight of the celebrated " Pictured Rocks , " which now appear to the southeast , some ten miles off . It is said this is neither the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the best advantage . For this purpose we should have gone on the inside of Grand Island , which we omitted , the captain discovering our position too late to order a change of course From here , a portion of the appearance seems like standing columns , such as remind us of the ruins of Tadmor : another portion lower down the lake strongly resembles a walled town . such as is given us in paintings of Asian and Syrian scenery . A little further on rises a mag . nificent temple with Grecian portico , in fact , upon the model of the Parthenon . Still , a little further on , a row of huge masses almost deceive you into the belief of extensive warehouses , and the illusion is assisted by certain other masses which resemble the sails of shipping , together presenting the picture of an extensive commercial mart . These appearances are owing to the white sand cliffs which for some miles bound this part of the coast , and which are more or less invaded by the forest . They appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Cass and Mr. Schoolcraft , in the account of their Expedition to discover the Sources of the Mississippi , in 1820 . That some portion of these appearances may be imaginary and depending upon the eyes of the beholders s*ems evident from the fact that a gentleman by my side can see nothing in them but huge piles of strew ! After dinner we are just opposite the " cave , " or " arch , " and the " chapel , " some five miles off . These are two remarkable features in the Pictured Rocks . We can see them distinctly with the naked eye , but the effect of their vast proportions , their admirable symmetry and beauty , are at this distance lost upon us . From a gentleman on board , who was attached to the first survey of this region under the lamented Doctor Houghton , as well as the more recent one of Foster and Whitney , and who is perfectly famil iar with this locality , I receive some particulars of information , which the distance prevents mc // from gathering personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this gentleman , not less than 100 feet above the lake . It is supported by massive pillars on either hand , which rest in the water , and on the sides of which open other arches West of the grand arch extend a succession of others of less magnitude , from thirty to fifty feet in height . They are generally connected by interior openings . A boat may enter in full sail , and pass through without obstruction . To the spectator whose memories are imbued with the classical , the Cave of Eulus is apt at once to occur . and though he can not suppose this rock in any sense the " prison of the winds , " yet he may readily believe it forms a grand hall for their revelings , when Boreas comes down over the lake . At such a time , how grand to see the waves breaking around these massy pillars  --  to hear the struggling winds and waters ri ) aring and reverberating among these hollow caverns Luciantes ventos , tempestalesque sonoros . " Wi indignantes magno cum murmure rupis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectator impressed by the gr- nd dimensions of the " chapel , " though the " Doric Temple , " as I also heard it called , would seem a more appropriate appellation . Regular walls of rock , rising a hundred feet in height , have as massive and regular a roof , over which is a depth of soil and growth of evergreens . The portal is as wide as the chamber , which in depth has an extent of forty feet-. - somewhat disproportioned , it is true , to its other dimensions , For the best effect on the eye of the spectator , much depends , in viewing the Pictured Rocks , upon the position of the sun , as well as the distance . An evening sun , with a clear atmosphere , and a distance of a mile , brings out the objects more distinctly , while it allows one to catch the lively colors which stain the cliffs , and which tinge and vein the surface in many beautiful and fanciful shapes . These are occasioned by the red and brown oxide of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , too close a view is destructive of those beautiful resemblances which the fancy readily conjures up under the effect of distance . At four o'clock we are opposite the Grand Sable . This is a very picturesque shore , and is owing to a similar cause to the Pictured Rocks . The difference is , that the Sable is moving sand , and is more entirely denuded of vegetation , while the other is mainly a sand rock . The Sable extends some two miles uninterruptedly along the coast , at an elevation of some 400 feet , and is unrelieved by any thing green  --  a scanty growth of firs alone tipping its summits . It reminds one strongly of several similar but not so extensive appearances on Lake Michigan . Of these , the one at the Sleeping Bear is , perhaps , the most remarkable . As one intently regards this extensive harrier of sand , he seems gazing on the confines of some boundless desert  --  the Syrian or Sahara . It is not much , after this , if he almost looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery Bedonin upon its hump-not much if he searches for their white tents upon the sands , and expects to see the glancing of their gay costumes and the whirling of their light djereeds . I should not forget the mention of some beautiful specimens of marble found in the vicinity of Carp River , and which were shown me by the gentleman to whom I lately alluded . It is handsomely veined , and susceptible of a high polish . On a white ground , changing occasionally to a delicate shade of pink , veins of a lively chocolate color are ramified in a most pleasing manner . Other specimens have chocolate for the ground , with curious wavy veins of red blended with huff . Another piece is of a dark purple , varied with spots of the size and shape of a shilling-piece , and of an agreeable shade of yellow . It seems highly probable that the beds indicated by these specimens will be found to furnish some of the finest varieties of American marbles ; such as , at no distant day , with improved means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building purposes . Shades of such delicacy and beauty , as exhibited by some of these specimens , are certainly of rare occurrence . In the evening we have music , violins , and bugles , accompanied by cotillions and waltzing . The amusement seems to be losing its charms , however , as the voyage approaches its end , and the dancing terminates at an early hour . As day breaks , we are at the upper landing of the *ault . Leaving my baggage to follow , I walk down the Portage with Mr. McKnight . This time I find the crowd is all at the other house-where , it is understood , the Governor is a lodger . Remaining at the Sault till afternoon , we have an opportunity of witnessing a review at the Fort , in honor of the Governor . The soldiers , but a small squad , were marched about the due length of time , making the customary salutes , and then dismissed . Their movements were made with the usual precision ; and their arms , which were clean and bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The " London " taking her departure at 2 P.M .. we are all on board , and take leave of the Sault , bidding a reluctant adieu to the white-fish and the siskowit . As we recede from the village , I am more than ever impressed with the beauty of its site . The scenery along the banks of the river is peculiar and interesting , more from . the character of the population , perhaps , than from any marked peculiarities of its own . The river , which is wide below the Rapids , soon contracts to a breadth of little more thgn a hundred yards . The banks , which are low and flat , are cultivated in a limited manner by the Canadian French and Half-breeds . These people live in happy contiguity-the Red Man and his wigwam of birch or cedar , side by side with the log-cabin of his Gallic kinsman . An idle , careless , dreamy life , it is they lead-with no aspirations for any thing better , nor fear of any thing worse , they dance // along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his birchen boat dances upon the glancing stream . Opposite Garden River , some 12 miles from the Sault , we receive our supply of wood . While lying here , a number of the red people row across to us in their boats , generally having some small trafficking to do with the boat 's crew , or otherwise led by curiosity . Among the French who sometimes accompany them , are some prettyish female faces . They generally wear the flat , whose broad brim , while affording such a grateful shade , has so rural and pleasing , nay , even romantic an effect . This is also to he observed as an article of costume at the Sault , where it is much worn by the Indian women , and with a striking improvement in their appearance . Having received our supplies of wood , we resume our descent of the river , and at three o'clock in the morning , nothing worthy of notice having previously occurred , I am wakened up to get ashore at Mackinaw . Not intending any further stay here than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the nighest hotel , which is the Huron House . This is a new hotel , just opened by Mr. Boardman . It is well adapted , and furnishes very satisfactory accommodations . Fortunately , I am not long detained ; and the same evening finds me , with all the speed of a slow boat , steaming up the lake . The wind being stiff from the north , gives us something of a sea . The waves remind me of my first impressions , when , some years ago , I first met in Lake Erie , the sight of a large body of water in motion . The first thing which occurred to me as remarkable , was that the waves should all be running the same way . They still seemed to me like something alive , as whales or dolphins , chasing one another in immense droves . I do n't know why , but I thought more of them as seahorses-green coursers of the deep , with white manes and tails , such as I had seen in illustrations of mythology , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated by Amphitrite , and holding his trident , he glides majestically over the flood , the Nereids and Tritons sporting around him , their temples bound with sea-weed , and making music with rare shells of ocean . I could not rid myself of the idea that I was looking upon herds of foaming coursers during the whole voyage , and seemed still expecting their heads to appear above the water .
