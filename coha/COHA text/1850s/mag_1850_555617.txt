ART . III . - Memoirs of SIR THOMAS FOWELL BUXTON , BART . Edited by his Son , CHARLES BUXTON , Esq. , B. A. Second Edition . London : 1849 . Svo. pp. 614 . IT would be with great reluctance that we should call a man whom we very much respected a " philanthropist . " From the common application of the word it has acquired the most unpleasant associations , and we never hear it without experiencing a series of very disagreeable emotions . There comes up before us the image of a thin man , of a nervous habit and inquisitive disposition ; of a dyspeptic and pugnacious temperament ; whose talents not having been appreciated in the exercise of any useful or ornamental art , has much leisure to talk about very offensive subjects in a very offensive way ; who is always full of bad taste and false logic , apt to be personal , while his facts are as tender as his assertions are hardy . He is not modest , not wise , not useful , not a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " earnest , " and so self-forgetful that he has quite run to seed without knowing it . He possesses only a part of the qualities of charity ; for he " believeth all things " and " hopeth all things , " but he is " puffed up , " and doth " behave himself unseemly . " This , we have been assured by himself and his friends , is a philanthropist . We were skeptical as to the statement . We felt a distrust of the man and the speaker , and a little alarmed . Perhaps our dignity was somewhat hurt at the implication that we , too , in spite of that privacy which our insignificance assures us , in spite of the distance which we have most anx*. iously preserved , were nevertheless made an object of the gentleman 's affection . We thought it cruel to be thus clasped ( even metaphorically ) in his embrace . We supposed it was quite impossible for us to escape ; but we felt both disposed and authorized to adopt the most energetic measures in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who makes speeches for the negroes is a philanthropist . Sir Fowell Buxton made speeches for the negroes . But the syllogism fails . Here at least is an exception , for Sir Fowell Buxton was an excellent and able man . lie was modest , wise , and useful , - very // much of a gentleman , and we should maintain , a great man ; great in purpose , great in action , great in his influence upon great affairs ; timid in prqfession , brave in accomplishment ; hesitant in deliberation , prompt in action ; of a comprehensive mind , " looking before and after ; " genial of heart , open of hand ; ready of access to every influence which should move a man , but when determined , of an energy which guarantied the future . In reading the history of a life like his , the characteristics of the pseudo-philanthropist become more painfully distinct from the contrast . When we observe how , under the guidance of a pure motive , a man has been able to benefit many of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nature to their improvement , we look with increased distrust upon those who pretend , indeed , to follow his example , but whose characters lack the cardinal virtues of temperance , charity , and fairness , and whose action is more harmful to the progress of good than any thing which we know . Is it not , indeed , a miserable sight to see the leadership taken by false guides ; to see present defeat and lasting disgrace brought upon many a good cause by the unfitness of those who conduct it ? Can we believe in the sincerity of those who , professing universal philanthropy , show a total want of every lesser charity ? What title shall we give them , when we remember that " whoever makes truth disagreeable , commits high treason against virtue. ** And here we would express our sense of the admirable manner in which the editor of these Memoirs has performed his task , and of the great value of the book he has published . The narrative is well arranged , simply and concisely written . The writer never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a great deal out of a very little . There is no lagging of interest , but the story moves steadily forward to the end . The editor has avoided those sins of prolixity and excessive eulogy to which biographers are peculiarly prone , and has fully succeeded in his object , as set forth in the preface , to " show , as plainly as possible , what sort of a person my father was , so that the reader should feel as if he had been one of his most intimate friends . " The purpose of the book is not to display Mr. Buxton 's talent , though it was commanding ; nor the part he played in the history of // his country , though it was distinguished ; nor to give a picture of the society in which he moved , though it was highly cultivated and respectable ; but to show his motives , his principles , and his conduct , and to point out , as can be done in the biographies only of a few , bow faithful the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his most profound convictions ; how he kept " the height that he was able to attain. ** In estimating the value of such a biography so written , our only danger is on the side of extravagance . Still we feel constrained to place it in the first rank among works of the greatest value . For there is no higher object ofJiterature than to " teach virtue not to be ashamed , and to turn many to righteousness . " There is no surer means of accomplishing this than the example of a life which gives at once a proof of the possibility of virtue , shows the means of its attainment , and the glorious results of its acquisition . Mr. Buxton was not a man of genius . The original powers of his mind were those which most men possess ; and it is this fact which renders his biography of the greater value , because it is an example applicable to all men . We have the lives of extraordinary men , and they are curious and valuable . But ordinary men see nothing in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They draw no argument from them to influence their own lives . Few men of any one generation excel in those qualities of sensibility , of discrimination , of decision , which make the poet , the philosopher , or the commander . Fewer still are placed in circumstances to become heroes in history . Most men can not be remarkable ; the majority must always be common-place . But all men have characters to develop , and duties to perforni , with such powers as they have , and under the circumstances of their position . And the man who has solved the questions , and performed the duties , that are placed before every individual of his race , has achieved a work of universal usefulness , if not of universal fame . Thomas Fowell Buxton was born at Earl 's Colne , in the county of Essex , England , on the first of April , 1786 . His father , whose name he bore , was high sheriff of the county , a man of kind and active disposition and liberal hospitality . Dying in 1792 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thomas Fowell , the eldest son , thus came under // the sole care of his mother when but six years old . He had already given evidence of a bold and determined character , which needed more firmness of control than is usually exercised over a fatherless boy . One who knew him when young , said of him , " He never was a child ; he was a man when in petticoats . " But his mother was a woman of remarkable energy . Her son described her as " large-minded about every thing ; disinterested almost to an excess ; careless of difficulty , labor , danger , or expense , in the prosecution of any great object . With these nobler qualities were united some of the imperfections , which belong to that species of ardent and resolute character . " She belonged to the Society of Friends ; but , as her husband was a member of the Church of England , her children were baptized in infancy , and she never attempted to convert them to her faith . But her whole influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture , and to imbue their minds with reverence for the Scriptures , and an interest in generous and charitable purposes . This influence had much effect in regulating the character and directing the course of her son until he became of age , when his mother contracted a second marriage with Mr. Edmund Henning , of Weymouth . When only four years and a half old , Fowell Buxton was sent to school at Kingston , where he suffered so severely from ill-treatment and want of food , that his health was impaired , and he was removed , after two years of this peculiarly English discipline , to the school of the celebrated Dr. Charles Burney , at Greenwich . At this school he passed eight years , " without making any great advances in learning . " He was then , as in mature years , remarkably tall ; and this , with the slowness of his mental powers , added perhaps to a certain weight of character even then discernible , gained him the nickname of " Elephant Buxton . " His vacations were spent sometimes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near Weymouth , but more frequently with his mother at Earl 's Colne . Here he was instructed in the mysteries of fieldsports by a faithful gamekeeper , named Abraham Plaistow , a man of whom Mr. Buxton , in riper years , said , - " He had more of natural good sense and what is called mother wit , than almost any person I have met with since : a knack // which he had of putting every thing into new and singular lights , made him a most entertaining and even intellectual companion . He was the most undaunted of men : I remember my youthful admiration of his exploits on horseback . For a time he hunted my uncle 's hounds , and his fearlessness was proverbial . But what made him particularly valuable was his principles of integrity and honor . He never said or did a thing in the absence of my mother of which she would have disapproved . He always held up the highest standard of integrity , and filled our youthful minds with sentiments as pure and as generous as could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such was my first instructor , and , I must add , my best ; for I think I have profited more by the recollection of his remarks and admonition , than by the more learned and elaborate discourses of all my other tutors . He was our playfellow and tutor ; he rode with us , fished with us , shot with us , upon all occasions. ** Living at home , with Abraham Plaistow for his " guide , philosopher , and friend , " was naturally more agreeable to a boy of his age than to be at school ; and he persuaded his mother to allow him to remain . He was now fifteen years old . Several months were passed at this important period without definite object or occupation . He shot , hunted , and fished , and " when no active amusement presented itself , would sometimes spend whole days in riding about the lanes on his old pony , with an amusing book in his hand . " As eldest son , he was almost master of the house ; his naturally strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been softened at school , and he was fast becoming violent , rough , and domineering . " At the same time , his friends attempted to correct the boyish roughness of his manners by a system of ridicule and reproof , which greatly discouraged and annoyed him . " A few months more of idleness , of indulgence of his love of authority , with the discipline of annoyance and discouragement , and the finer parts of his character might have been overshadowed or destroyed ; but " through the kindness of Providence , ( as he used emphatically to acknowledge , ) " he came , at this critical time , under an influence which called out all the higher and kindlier qualities of his nature , and taught him to exercise over his passions and evil tendencies that power which controlled them through his after life , and turned all their strength to the accomplishment of good ends . // John , the eldest son of Mr. Joseph John Gurney , of Earlham Hall , near Norwich , was his friend , and at his invitation Buxton paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn of 1801 . * Mr. Gurney had then been for several years a widower , with a family of eleven children . The three eldest daughters were older than young Buxton ; but his friend John and four sisters were about his age , while three younger hoys filled up the number of a most attractive and remarkable family . Both Mr. and Mrs. Gurney were Quakers , descended from the earliest and strictest me ibers of that sect. 1* ' 1rs . Gurney was of the family of Barclay the Apologist . Both were people of more than ordinary intelligence , liberality , and force of character . But while they adhered most strictly to the weightier matters of the law , they had departed from those severer rules of their ancestors which would interfere with liberal education , or innocent amusement . Their children were taught to dance , sing , and draw . We imagine they were dressed at least as gaily as other children , for we read of Mrs. Fry , who afterwards gave a charm to the most sober costume of the Friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness to the sick , in all the brilliancy of a scarlet riding-habit . Their house had been a favorite resort of much agreeable society , for which Norwich was at this time distinguished , among whom were William Taylor , Dr. Alderson and his daughter Mrs. Opie , Dr. Sayers , and others . But nine years before the period of which we are speaking , Mrs. Gurney had died , leaving her large family to the care of her husband and elder daughters . The characters and talents , which these children afterwards developed , make it easy to account for the strong and beneficial influence which they exerted upon young Buxton . Three of them became authors of works exciting much attention at their publication , and still read with interest . Three became ministers among the Friends . All were active in the duties and charities of private life ; and two of them , Mr. J. J. Gurney and Mrs. Fry , were eminently distinguished among the early reformers of prison discipline , and publicly associated with most of the benevolent works of their time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of person , for eloquence of discourse , and for tact and fascination of manners . We trace among // them a remarkable power and charm of personal presence . It was this , in great measure , which enabled Mrs. Fry to perform the wonders she achieved among the prisoners at Newgate . It was this which , in Priscilla Gurney , was " irresistible in reducing all with whom she conversed under her gentle influence ; " and we get hints of the same power from such notices as are public of the brothers , and some other members of the family . We find its source partly in the quickness and strength of intellect , in the originality and force of character , which they possessed ; but chiefly in a delicate and profound sensibility which distinguished them . Though by this sensibility the eldest brother and a sister were brought to their graves broken-hearted at the loss of wife and son , yet , when wisely controlled and directed , it gave them in their intercourse among men an acuteness and delicacy of perception , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others , which , in all the fine diplomacy of social intercourse , threw the game into their more sensitive and skilful hands . But now they were young , handsome , full of life , and eager in the improvement of their tastes and talents . Earlham Hall wanted no charms to make a home happy . The house was large , old , and irregular , standing in the centre of a park well wooded with old trees . The land was diversified . On the south front of the house stretched a fine lawn , " flanked by groves of trees growing from a carpet of wild flowers , moss , and long grass , " while by it ran the river Wensum , a " clear winding stream , " whose banks , overhung by an avenue of ancient timber trees , were a favorite resort of the young people . In after life , the members of the family differed in their condition , their interests , and their forms of faith . Wilberforce says they contained some " queer combinations , " adding at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is to be esteemed , and loved , and respected too , and coveted . " But amid all their diversities , they could say , with their Quaker sister , that there were " sweet doors of spiritual harmony open among them all ; " and their common home was ever a point of union . There they assembled at the bridal and the birth . There they met around the death-bed and the grave , as one // by one , in prime or blossom or decay , they left the world in which they had led beloved and honored lives . Young Buxton spent two months with the Gurneys . The boy 's age was one in which a deep impression is easily made ; his nature one by which it was firmly retained . He became attached to Hannah Gurney , and returned home with every motive for exertion strong upon him . As it was expected that he would inherit property in Ireland , his mother deemed it advisable that her son should be educated at the University of Dublin , a plan which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions of a youth of fifteen , he writes his mother , that his aversion to her plan " is , ever was , and ever will be invincible ; nevertheless , if you command , I will obey . " Mrs. Buxton did command , and Fowell was , in the winter of 1802 , placed in the family of Mr. Moore of Donnybrook , to be fitted for the college examination . " It was shortly before the Christmas holidays that he took up his abode at Donnybrook , where he found himself inferior to every one of his companions in classical acquirernents ; but he spent the vacation in such close study , that on the return of the other pupils , he stood as the first among them . " This was the beginning of five years spent in Ireland , one being at Donnybrook , and four at Trinity College , Dublin . When there , he forgot his " invincible " aversion , and carrying out all the good resolutions that he had made at Earlham , he formed a character fit to be respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I never looked into a novel or newspaper - I gave up shooting . During the five years I was in Ireland , I had the liberty of going when I pleased to a capital shooting place . I never went but twice . " Thirty years after , when preparing his work on " The Slave Trade and its Remedy , " he worked " day after day , from breakfast till two or three o'clock the next morning , with the interval of only a short walk and meals . I do not think , " he says , " I have worked so hard since I left college . " His only relaxation was an occasional visit to Earlham , where he became engaged to Miss Gurney two years before graduation . Nor were his exertions at the University less successful . He was graduated with the most distinguished honor . Fourteen examinations were held during the college course , at the end of which // a gold medal was presented to those who at each examination had distinguished themselves in every subject , only one failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Historical Society , a debating club in which the students took great interest , silver medals were awarded by the votes of the members , two for eloquence and two for proficiency in history . Buxton took them all . So great was the notice attracted by his success , that he received a proposal from the electors of the University to represent them in Parliament . " No higher token of esteem than this could have been offered to one without wealth or Irish connection , and without the smallest claim upon the consideration of the University , except what his personal and academical character afforded . Such an offer it was not easy to reject , and he was , as he says at the time , extremely agitated and pleased by it . ' He weighed the pleasure , the distinction , the influence promised by the political career thus unexpectedly opened before him ; and he set against these considerations the duties which his approaching marriage would bring upon him . Prudence prevailed , and he declined the proposal . " Amid this honor and success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other claimants came forward , and an expensive lawsuit resulted in defeat . But the disappointment of his expectations of wealth did not postpone his marriage , which took place the next spring after he left Dublin . He was now just of age ; his patrimony had been diminished by certain unfortunate speculations in which his mother bad engaged ; and he found that if he was to obtain wealth , it must be by his own exertions . After full consideration , he determined to give up the plan of studying law , which he had entertained through college , and to establish himself in business . Negotiations to this end were accordingly opened in different quarters ; but nearly a year passed away in an anxious inactivity , particularly harassing to his energetic nature . His eldest child was born at Earlham during the winter ; and in the following spring , Mr. Sampson Hanbury , his uncle , offered him a situation in an extensive brewery establishment with which he was connected , with the prospect of becoming a partner after three years ' probation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July , 1808 , and at the close of the year took a house connected with the brewery , which he occupied for several years . // 340 April , During the first three years of his London residence , his time and thoughts were much occupied by his business ; hut he still found intervals for reading and study . He had still the idea of entering Parliament at some future time , and he attended a debating society , where he met again his classmate North , Henry Grattan , the younger son of the distinguished Mr. Grattan , Spring Rice , Horace Twiss. and others . And he was not content without some occupation hy which he might promote the happiness and well-being of others . He became an acquaintance and friend of William Allen , a Quaker , a distinguished chemist , a man of enlightened benevolence , and of so high a character for intelligence and integrity , that he was appointed one of the guardians of the present queen during her minority . A few months after reaching London , he joined a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public mind to the bad effects and inefficiency of capital punishments . " Although a member of the Church of England , his connection with the Quakers through his mother and the Gurney family was very close and endearing . His Sundays were frequently spent with Mr. and Mrs. Fry ; and for four years after his marriage , he generally attended a Friends ' meeting . By this influence his benevolent principles were strengthened and directed . His brother-in-law , Mr. Samuel Hoare , " hetween whom and himself there existed then and through life , a friendship and close fellowship far beyond what usually results from such a connection , " shared all such pursuits and labors with him . " With them was also linked his own brother Charles , who was settled in London , and was the favorite companion of both . " The following extract from a letter dated September 23 , 1810 , describes his life at this time . " I have passed a very quiet and industrious week , up early , breakfast at eight o'clock , dinner near six , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed over my favorite Blackstone . I read him till near ten last night , and then Jeremy Taylor till past eleven , and could hardly give him up , he was so very entertaining a companion This morning I went to Gracechurch Street meeting ; I was rather late , which made me feel hurried , and prevented my having sufficient time to myself before meeting ; however , I had made a little use of my friend // Jeremy at breakfast , and this and last night 's readings gave me occupation for my thoughts . I saw William Allen , who wants me to call upon him to-morrow , as he says he has found a place for the boys ' school as suitable as if we were to build one . " p. 34 . " In 1811 , Mr. Buxton was admitted as a partner in the brewcry ; and during the ensuing seven years he was almost exclusively devoted to his business . Soon after his admission , his senior partners , struck by his energy and force of mind , placed in his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of management . It would be superfluous to enter into the details of his proceedings , though , perhaps , he never displayed greater vigor and firmness than in carrying through this undertaking . For two or three years he was occupied from morning till night , in prosecuting , step by step , his plans of reform : a single example may indicate with what spirit he grappled with the difficulties that beset him on all sides . " One of the principal clerks was an honest man , and a valuable servant ; but he was wedded to the old system , and viewed with great antipathy the young partner 's proposed innovations . At length , on one occasion , he went so far as to thwart Mr. Buxton 's plans . The latter took no notice of this at the time , except desiring him to attend in the counting-house at six o'clock the next morning . Mr. Buxton met him there at the appointed hour ; and , without any expostulation , or a single angry word , desired him to produce his books , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them himself , in addition to his other duties . Amazed at this unexpected decision , the clerk yielded entirely ; he promised complete submission for the future ; he made his wife intercede for him ; and Mr. Buxton , who valued his character and services , was induced to restore him to his place . They afterwards became very good friends , and the salutary effect of the changes introduced by Mr. Buxton was at length admitted by his leading opponent ; nor , except in one instance , did he ever contend against them again . On that occasion , Mr. Buxton merely sent him a message that he had better meet him in the counting-house at six o'clock the next morning , ' - and the bookkeeper 's opposition was heard of no more . " We itay add , that among other points wanting reform , he found that the men employed were in many instances wholly uneducated . To the remedy of this evil , he took a more direct road than exhortation or advice . He called them together , and simply said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man who can not read and write . " He provided them a schoolmaster , and means of learning , and on the appointed day * // held an examination . Such had been the earnestness to learn that not one man was dismissed . " pp. 39 , 40 . Mr. Buxton continued to reside in London , constantly engaged in the management of the brewery , until the summer of 1815 , when he took a house at Hampstead , that his four children might have the benefit of purer air . The intelligence and energy which he brought to his business did not fail of meeting with a success , which , in the course of several years , enabled him to relax that uninterrupted attention which he had heretofore bestowed upon it , and afforded him leisure for other occupations . He writes to his wife of a plan he had formed , " after a few years , to live somewhere quiet in the country , and go to town for one week in a month . I think that with strict , unsparing rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettlement would be no objection to me , for I do not find that change from one employment to another quite different produces it ; and I fancy that I could brew one hour , study mathematics the next , shoot the third , and read poetry the fourth , without allowing any one of these pursuits to interfere with the others . " This arrangement he in effect carried out , being relieved from attention to the details of business , though he continued through life to have a general supervision of the affairs of the brewery . He avoided the danger to which his earnest nature was perhaps particularly disposed , that of becoming absorbed in his work for his work 's sake , and valuing the intensity rather than the result of his labor . He was busy that he might have leisure , and in acquiring wealth he did not forget the responsibility which came with it . Born of religious parents , and subjected from his childhood to a strong religious influence from those with whom he was most nearly connected , the earlier years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such teaching and example . While in college , he avoided the dissipation prevalent among his companions , partly by his unceasing industry in study , and partly in consequence of certain promises registered at Earlham . While travelling in Scotland with the Gurneys , during one of his vacations , " His attention was drawn with increased earnestness to the subject of religion . When at Perth , he purchased a large Bible , with the resolution , which he steadfastly kept , of perusing a portion // of it every day ; and he mentions in a letter , dated September 10 , 1806 , that quite a change had been worked in his mind with respect to reading the Hoiy Scriptures . Formerly , ' he says , I read generally rather as a duty than as a pleasure , but now I read them with great interest , and , I may say , happiness . ' And again , Some of the happiest hours that I spend here are while I am reading our Bible . I never before felt so assured that the only means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superior Being . ' " The course of his life which we have thus far traced shows that these sentiments led to diligence , sobriety , and charity . With increasing years and powers of mind , his religious principles kept equal growth . In the silent meetings of the Friends , which he attended with Mrs. Fry , he was able " thoroughly to engage himself " in trains of deep and searching thought . " Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven , " was a text " very striking to him . " " It is so serious a thing to be only on a par with the generality of those you see around you ; " and the result of his meditations is , " this evening I have been thinking what I can do for the poor this winter ; I feel that I have as yet done far short of what I ought , and what I wish to do . " Nor had events been wanting by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perth . In 1811 , his youngest brother , Edward , died under very painful circumstances . A wayward boy , he had been sent to sea when fourteen years old as midshipman in an East Indiaman , under the care of his relative , Captain Dumbleton . He left his ship in his first voyage , and entered the king 's service ; and after this change , nothing was beard of him by his friends at home . More than four years had passed by , and " death at sea " had by degrees become accepted as the cause of an unbroken silence , when a letter reached Mr. Buxton from one of his brother 's shipmates , stating that Edward was at Gosport in a dying condition , and earnestly desirous of seeing his family . They were soon by the side of their dying brother , who lingered only long enough to prove how well he was prepared for the change which was at hand . " His sister Sarah , in describing the solemn , and yet peaceful , meeting round the death.bed of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fowell , the head of our family , is a strong support ; and when religious consolation was so much wanted , he seemed most ready to afford it . The power of his influence we deeply felt : it was by far the most striking feature in the past remarkable month . " ' A few years after , he lost , in his brother Charles , his best friend and the companion he most loved . It was a deep and irreparable loss ; the chief joy of his life seemed gone forever , for their characters had harmonized in a remarkable manner . " Twenty years afterwards , in reviewing the leading occurrences of his life , he thus refers to this event : - I know of no tie , that of husband and wife excepted , which could be stronger than the one which united Charles and me . We were what the lawyers call tenants in common ' of every thing . He was , I think , the most agreeable person I ever knew . A kind of original humor played about his conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than that species of humor which provokes loud laughter ; it was not exactly naivet6 , though that comes nearest to it ; it was an intellectual playfulness , which provided for every hour , and extracted from every incident a fund of delicate merriment . He died at Weymouth , in the year 1817 ; and thou knowest , 0 Lord , and thou only , how deeply I loved , and how long and how intensely I lamented him . ' " Thus both education and experience tended to give to Mr. Buxton 's character a strong religious bias . The nature of his mind was such , that he could not stop short of devoting himself to the highest objects , and ruling himself by the highest motives , of which he was capable . If men were , like him , thoroughly in earnest , they would also be thoroughly religious . It is a superficial mind which allows itself to be distracted by objects of attainment inferior to the highest . Devoted earnestness , and a thorough energy which knew no rest except in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buxton ; and he knew , as all men know , where the highest objects are to be sought , and how they are to be found . But this very earnestness in his pursuits was sometimes felt by him to be an obstruction in his path toward that devotion to religion which he knew its claims required . When engrossed in business , he found there was a very large portion " of one 's life , in which one might as well be a heathen . " " How sincerely I do often wish , " he says , " that I could direct this fervent energy about temporals into its proper // channels ; that I could be as warm about things of infinite importance as I am about dust and ashes . " His wish was granted . In the fall of 1813 , he was seized by an illness which brought him to the brink of the grave , and in the course of which he received impressions to which he ever referred much of that ascendency of religion over his mind which guided and blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed that he might have a dangerous illness , provided he was brought by it nearer to God . In such a state of mind , the bodily weakness , the uncertainty of life , the proofs of love from friends , and the very corporeal pains he suffered , served but to free him from the distractions and doubts of life , and enable him to fix a firmer hold upon eternal things . A sense of the " unbounded , the unmerited love " of God , and of the close clustering mercies he had received , filled him with a gladness of heart in which all doubts vanished , all pain was lost , and all fear cast out , while in absolute faith he found perfect peace . At the age of twenty-seven , a man of Mr. Buxton 's firmness does not rise from a sick bed where such impressions have been received , without bearing the stamp ever after . As his health and strength returned , he became still more active in the advancement of benevolent objects than he had formerly been ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meditation and rigorous self-examination , he kept straight his path , maintaining bright and clear before him the things which are unseen , with a sense of their actual reality , which most men attain only in regard to what are called matters of fact . Thus guided , strengthened , and impelled , he had his conversation in this world . As a striking illustration of the remarkable courage and decision which were characteristic of Mr. Buxton 's temperament , we will quote the account given in a letter to his wife , of an adventure which he had with a mad dog . " Spitalfelds , July 15 , 1816 . " As you must hear the story of our dog Prince , I may as well tell it you . On Thursday morning , when I got on my horse at S. IJoare 's , David told me that there was something the matter with Prince , that he had killed the cat , and almost killed the new dog , and had bit at him and Elizaheth . I ordered him to be tied up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I got // into Hampstead , I saw Prince covered with mud , and running furiously , and biting at every thing . I saw him bite at least a dozen dogs , two boys , and a man . " Of course I was exceedingly alarmed , being persuaded he was mad . I tried every effort to stop him or kill him , or to drive him into some outhouse , but in vain . At last he sprang up at a boy , and seized him by the breast ; happily I was near him , and knocked him off with my whip . He then set off towards London , and I rode by his side , waiting for some opportunity of stopping him . I continually spoke to him , but he paid no regard to coaxing or scolding . You may suppose I was seriously alarmed , dreading the immense mischief he might do , having seen him do so much in the few preceding minutes . I was terrified at the idea of his getting into Camden Town and London , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion that justified a risk of life , this was it , I determined to catch him myself . Happily he ran up to Pryor 's gate , and I threw myself from my horse upon him , and caught him by the neck : he bit at me and struggled , but without effect , and I succeeded in securing him , without his biting me . He died yesterday , raving mad . " pp. 57 , 58 . He afterwards mentioned some particulars which he had omitted in this hurried letter . " When I seized the dog , " he said , " his struggles were so desperate that it seemed at first impossible to hold him , till I lifted him up in the air , when he was more easily managed , and I contrived to ring the bell . I was afraid that the foam , which was pouring from his mouth in his furious efforts to bite me , might get into some scratch , and do me injury ; so with great difficulty I held him with one hand , while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glove ; then I did the same with my other hand , and at last the gardener opened the door , saying , What do you want ? ' I 've brought you a mad dog , ' replied I ; and telling him to get a strong chain , I walked into the yard , carrying the dog by his neck . I was determined not to kill him , as I thought if he should prove not to be mad , it would be a great satisfaction to the three persons whom he had bitten . I made the gardener , who was in a terrible fright , secure the collar round his neck and fix the other end of the chain to a tree , and then walking to its furthest range , with all my force , which was nearly exhausted by his frantic struggles , I flung him away from me , and sprang back . He made a desperate bound after me , but finding himself foiled , he uttered the most fearful yell I ever heard . All that day he did nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his jaws ; we threw him meat , and he snatched at it with fury , but instantly dropped it again . // " The next day , when I went to see him , I thought the chain seemed worn ; so I pinned him to the ground between the prongs of a pitchfork , and then fixed a much larger chain round his neck ; when I pulled off the fork , he sprang up and made a dash at me , which snapped the old chain in two ! He died in forty-eight hours from the time he went mad . " pp. 58 , 59 . He was soon called into public action . We have seen that , in the Historic Club at Dublin and at the Academics in London , he had cultivated the power of public speaking . The first time that be addressed a public meeting was in 1812 , at a meeting of the Bible Society in Norwich , to which his brother-in-law , Mr. J. J. Gurney , had engaged him to give his support . His speech was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next which he delivered , in 1816 , at a meeting held at the Mansion House in behalf of the Spitalfield weavers . The winter had set in early and with severity . The silk trade was stagnant ; the price of wheat rose from 55s* 6d. to 103s. 7d. in the course of the year , and the weavers were thrown from that brink of starvation , on which they existed in more prosperous seasons , into absolute destitution . Mr. Buxton and his brother-in-law , Mr. Hoare , seem to have been active in the first movements for the alleviation of this distress* . They postponed their usual visit to Earlham . A public meeting was organized for the purpose of obtaining the necessary funds to supply the most pressing wants . Mr. Buxton 's heart and mind had become thoroughly imbued with the subject . He went to the meeting feeling " very flat , " and after his speech had been delivered , " considered it as a kind of failure . " Other people took a different view of it . Our limits will not allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimen of its eloquence , and we must content ourselves with citing evidence of its effects . " The speech reappeared in publications of the most widely different character . It was republished by the Spitalfields Benevolent Society , as the best means of creating sympathy with their exertions ; it was republished by Hone and the democrats , as the best statement of the miseries permitted under the existing government ; and it was republished by the friends of that government , because , ' said they , it forms so beautiful a contrast to the language of those wretched demagogues , whose infamous doctrines would increase the evils they affect to deplore . ' " By this one meeting at the Mansion House , ' says the report // of the Spitalfields Benevolent Society , X43,369 were raised . ' Two days after it had been held , Lord Sidmouth sent for Mr. Buxton , to inform him , that the Prince had been so pleased by the spirit and temper of the meeting , and so strongly felt the claims that had been urged , that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , Mr. Wilberforce wrote to express the pleasure he felt in his success , and adds , " I anticipate the success of the efforts which I trust you will one day make in other instances , in an assembly in which I trust we shall be fellow laborers , both in the motives by which we are actuated and in the objects to which our exertions will be directed . " Mr. Wilberforce 's anticipations were destined to be realized as fully as even he could wish ; but Mr. Buxton did not obtain a seat in Parliament till more than a year and a half from this time . Meanwhile , he directed his attention to the improvement of the prisons . The subject of prison discipline was not a new one in England at this time , but it was little attended to , and little understood . It was now to receive a vigorous and lasting impulse . But we shall better appreciate what Mr. Buxton really effected , if we glance for a moment at what had been done in the matter before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was appointed to the office of High Sheriff of the county of Bedford a gentleman who was not content that his white wand should be borne in court by a deputy , but who attended to this , as to all other duties , with a scrupulous fidelity . His attention was attracted to abuses which a deputy might have overlooked . He examined the gaol of his county - it was the same in which Bunyan wrote the Pilgrim 's Progress a hundred years before - and shocked at the state of affairs he found , he visited the neighboring counties , in search of an example by which to reform the abuses at home . But he found that what he had taken for an exception was the rule ; and in looking throughout the country for an example , he discovered the universal disorder which existed . Its demonstration was the first step towards its reform ; and in 1777 , he published a book , entitled , " The State of the Prisons in England and Wales , " by John Howard . Public attenti6n was aroused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought before the House of Commons , and some of the abuses which existed were revealed . It was found that the gaol fever , brought on // by want of air and proper food and cleanliness , destroyed many of the prisoners . " From my own observations in 1772 and 1773 , " says Mr. Howard , " I was fully convinced that many more were destroyed by it than were put to death by all the public executions in the kingdom ; " and this was when there were one hundred and sixty offences punishable by death . Another flagrant abuse existed , in the custom of forcing all persons who came into the custody of the gaolers , to pay certain fees to those officers before their release . Howard testified before the House of Commons , that these fees amounted in some cases to more than twenty-fiwe shillings . If the prisoner was unable to satisfy these demands he was taken back to gaol , even though he had been acquitted by the court . Two acts were accordingly passed in 1774 ; one " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring the justices of the peace to order the prisons to be scraped and whitewashed at least once a year , and that the prisoners should be provided with the means of washing themselves ; and the other , " respecting the payment of fees to gaolers , " which enacted that prisoners who were thereafter acquitted or discharged , should be set free in open court , and that the payment of those fees which had been usually demanded should absolutely cease . Had these acts been faithfully carried into execution , they would have done but little towards putting the prisons into a proper condition . But , as the Marquis of Lansdowne afterwards complained , " they did not contain provisions to secure their execution , " an omission very seriously affecting their efficiency . If any gaoler disobeyed the order of the justice , the act provided that he should be fined ; but it provided no punishment for the justice who disobeyed the order of the legislature , and who made no examination of the prison at all . And this neglect became very common , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these acts accomplished but very little towards the removal of the abuses at which they were aimed . But besides these , there were many great evils which remained unnoticed and untouched . There was no provision made for the employment of the prisoners , for their classification , or , in many cases , for the proper separation of the sexes . The debtor was confined with the criminal , and the boy suspected of a misdemeanor was thrown into a // cell with the convicted felon . The safe custody of the prisoner was all that such a system could accomplish , while vice and licentiousness were unrestrained . These defects , their consequences and their remedy , were fully shown by Mr. Howard , who set on foot a plan for the establishment of prisons of a better organization , which should not only provide for the safe custody of the prisoner , but conduce to his reform . The scheme was warmly embraced by Mr. Justice Blackstone , who thought so highly of it that he did not hesitate to say , that if it were properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reformation might be effected in the lower classes of mankind as might in time supersede the necessity of capital punishment , except for very atrocious crimes. ** An act was accordingly passed , in 1779 , to establish two penitentiaries to test the efficiency of the plan . Three supervisors were chosen , to select a proper location for the penitentiary , and to contract for the buildings . Mr. Howard was the first named , and at his stipulation , Dr. Fothergill was added , Mr. Whately making up the number . A difference of opinion arose as to the best location , Mr. Howard and Dr. Fothergill preferring a site at Jslington , while Mr. Whatel ! was strenuous for a spot at Limehouse . While the question was still unsettled , Dr. Fothergill died , and Howard , unable either to change his opinion or to convert Mr. Whately , resigned his office , mortified at perceiving that , at the end of two years , not even a preliminary had been settled . New commissioners were appointed , who agreed upon a location ; but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop . Fifteen years after , it was revived again by a plan proposed by Jeremy Bentham , for a penitentiary which he called the Panopticon , in which all the prisoners were to be visible to the keeper " during every moment of their lives . " The administration favored this project . When Mr. Secretary Dundas was called upon to account for the failure of the former plan , he stated that " it had not been carried into execution from a variety of circumstances ; * ' and when further pressed for an explanation , he gave a short and unsatisfactory reply . This time , a lot of land was purchased and conveyed to Mr. Bentham , who acted for the government ; but delays again occurred , and nothing was done ; so that , in 1810 , Sir // Samuel Romilly had reason for declaring , that " the plan had remained upon the statute book for upwards of thirty years , without any effectual measures having been taken to carry it into efThct . " But why were these crying evils , fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undiminished , through a whole generation of men ? It was because the king constantly opposed the whole movement . He was too good a Tory to relish the reform even of a criminal . Besides , the subject excited disagreeable associations in the royal mind . If it had not been for the American Revolution , the question might never have come up . Before that unpleasant event , the convicts had been quietly transported to the Colonies. * It was partly because this vent was shut , that the penitentiary system was urged . Bentham says too , ( and wrote a book to prove it , ) that the king was personally hostile to him , and opposed the Panopticon on that account . At any rate , in the very first stage of the proceedings , the king 's signature was necessary to a draft for a thousand pounds . He delayed three weeks , and then refused to give it . But the example and instruction which Howard had given the world were not lost . The seed had been sown broadcast , and though some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took root and flourished . Though no general reform was made in the prisons of England , yet in some of the counties , through the exertions of the magistrates , gaols had been erected upon better principles . These better principles were now to receive an impulse they had never felt before ; and the credit of this movement must be given to the Quakers more than to any other class of people , and to the Gurney family more than to any other Quakers . In hi* " Account of the Principal Lazarettos of Europe , " published in 1789 , Howard said , " should the plan take place during my life of establishing a permanent charity under some such title as that at Philadelphia , namely , A society for alleviating the miseries of public prisons , ' I would most readily stand at the bottom of a page as a subscriber of ? 500 . " He It is estimated by Dr. Lang , that fifty thousand convicts were sent to the North American colonies . Franklin argued , that we should be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next year , and it was not till 1815 , * that the example set in Philadelphia was followed in England . In that year , a society was formed for the " reformation of juvenile offenders , " a class which was increasing at an alarming rate . Mr. Buxton and his brother-in-law , Mr. Hoare , were active members . In pursuing their investigations , they found that the grand cause of the increase of crime was the condition of the prisons , which , by bringing young beginners into the most intimate connection with accomplished criminals , were admirably adapted to promote the communication and acquisition of vice . The society therefore assumed the " improvement of prison discipline " as their first object . About Christmas of the next year , Mrs. Fry began her well-directed labors at Newgate . Her object was to relieve the immediate sufferings of the poor women , whom she found half-naked , half-drunk , shameless , and abandoned . She did this , and in doing it accomplished a great deal more . She established , in the most public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline . She showed the worst prisoners in the worst prison in England ( and the world , ) long accustomed to a prison life of vice , idleness , and riot , suddenly converted to industry , order , and sobriety ; and this change effected by ladies unsupported by authority , and acting under many inconveniences . Could there be more striking proof , that human nature when most perverted will still prefer industry to idleness ; when most hardened can still be touched by compassion ; and when most lawless will still own allegiance to that superiority which proves itself by acts of disin .. terested kindness ? It was a wonderful change that was made , when " this hell upon earth " exhibited the appearance of " an industrious manufactory , or a well-regulated family ; " and many persons came to behold what seemed little less than a miracle wrought by some newly discovered agency . And yet the principle by which it was accomplished was an old one , and it was only strange that its application should be so new . Just fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biography of Sir T. F. Buxton , it is stated that " in 1816 , the Society for the Reformation of Prison Discipline was formed . " p. 65 . The report of the Committee of the Society , in 1818 , says , " The Society in 1815 commenced its labors. " p. 10. // of Wakefield effecting similar changes by similar means ; and it is curious to observe bow much more wonderful the fact was than the fiction . Goldsmith was forced to keep within the bounds of probability , which Mrs. Fry went far beyond . For example , when the good Vicar , excited to the highest compassion at the sight of their insensibility , and with all his own uneasiness blotted from his mind , first reads a portion of the religious service to the prisoners , he found his " audience perfectly merry upon the occasion . Lewd whispers , groans of contrition burlesqued , winking and coughing , alternately excited laughter . " But the first day that the school was organized at Newgate , after monitors had been chosen , " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a period of silence , according to the custom of the Society of Friends , the monitors with their classes withdrew to their respective wards in the most orderly manner . " * And afterwards , the vilest tricks are played upon the Vicar ; but in Newgate , " the ladies have always been treated with uniform respect and gratitude. " t The biographers of Mrs. Fry and Mr. Buxton do not agree in awarding the credit of the first impulse to their mutual labors in improving the state of the prisons . In the biography of Mrs. Fry , we are told that " the conversation of these gentlemen , ( Mr. bare and Mr. Buxton , ) who were forming a society for the reformation of juvenile depredators , tended to keep alive in the mind of Mrs. Fry the interest awakened in 1813 ; " ( Vol . I. p. 282 ) - while in Mr. Buxton 's biography it is said , " One day , while walking past Newgate with Mr. Samuel Hoare , their conversation turned upon the exertions of their sister-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prisoners within its walls ; and this suggested the idea of employing themselves in a similar manner . " ( p. 65 . ) We think the precedence must , very ungallantly , be taken by the gentlemen , and that Mr. Buxton 's biographer was misled by the error in the date of the formation of the Prison Discipline Society , which we have just noticed . The first thing the Society did was to collect trustworthy information . They divided the prisons and districts of London among the members of their committee , and examined * Buxton 's Inquiry , p. 130. 30* I Ibid. p. 133. // into the history of the boys whom they found convicted or arraigned . They followed up their inquiries among the boys ' parents and associates ; and they found that , more than the want of education , employment , and food , more than the flash-houses and the neighboring fairs , more than the relaxa-* tion of justice arising from the impossibility of inflicting the inhuman punishments which the law then awarded , - more than all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quents caused by the state of the prisons . " Jt certainly is not too much to say , that amongst children of a very early age , absolute impunity would have produced less vice than confinement in almost any of the gaols in the metropolis and its neighborhood . " The increase of crime was most alarming . By official papers it was shown , that the number both of committals and convictions in the kingdom had more than doubled in the ten years from 1807 to 1817 ; and in 1818 , it appeared that more than one hundred and seven thousand persons had been committed to the gaols of the United Kingdom in the course of the year , a number ' supposed to be greater than that of all the commitments in the other kingdoms of Europe put together . The prisoners were a population in themselves . Their treatment rendered it almost certain that not one should be lost , but that every one who came once within the limit of the prisons should be insured a criminal for the remainder of his life . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to urge on its cure , was the object of the Prison Discipline Society . The prisons of Ghent and Antwerp had long been famous as among the best in Europe ; and to procure the latest information upon the subject , Mr* Buxton and his brother-inlaw crossed the channel in the winter of 1817 . Mr. Buxton was so much struck with the admirable management of the Maison de Force at Ghent , that upon his return he laid an account of it before the London Society . The committee requested him to publish it . " When I sat down to this task , " he says , in the preface to his book , " the work insensibly grew upon my hands . It was necessary to prove that evils and grievances did exist in this country , and to bring home to these causes the increase of corruption and depravity . For this purpose , repeated visits to various prisons were necessary . " In February , 1818 , he published a small book , enti // tied , " An Inquiry whether Crime be produced or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its success was eminent . Attention had already been attracted to the subject by Sir Samuel Romilly 's motions in the House of Commons ; and Mr. Buxton 's book was admirably adapted to increase the interest and direct the attention which was awakening . Its own merits , too , were very great ; accurate and reserved in its statements , clear and logical in its reason* ing , it rose at times to an earnest eloquence which could not fail to excite in the reader the sentiments from which it sprung . It contained , too , the best , and we think the first , account of Mrs. Fry 's most romantic achievements , and pointed out , in a manner that secured attention , the abominable state of many prisons , with the principles and means of their reform . It passed through six editions in the first year of its publication . " It was translated into French , and distributed on the Continent . It even reached Turkey ; and in India , a gentleman by the name of Blair having chanced to read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madras gaols . He found them in a wretched condition , and did not rest till a complete reformation had been effected . " This book served , moreover , as an admirable introduction to the House of Commons , of which Mr. Buxton was chosen member from Weymouth in the spring of the same year . Among the first subjects which came before the new House was the state of the convict*ships , when Sir James Mackintosh took occasion to say , " The question of our penal code , as relating to prison abuses , has been lately brought home to the feelings of every man in the country , by a work so full of profound information , of such great ability , of such chaste and commanding eloquence , as to give that House and the country a firm assurance , that its author could not embark in any undertaking which would not reflect equal credit upon himself and upon the object of his labors . " Nothing could be more complimentary than such a notice of a new member by a colleague so distinguished . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action is shown by an extract from a private paper , written on New Year 's day , 1819 , in which , as had been his custom for several years , he made up a sort of mental balance sheet , with a statement of his progress or deterioration , his // mistakes and oversights , or achievements and gains during the past year , with a formal and distinct plan of action for the year that was to come . " Now that I am a member of Parliament , I feel earnest for the honest , diligent , and conscientious discharge of the duty I have undertaken . My prayer is for the guidance of God 's Holy Spirit , that , free from views of gain or popularity - that , careless of all things but fidelity to my trust , I may be enabled to do some good to my country , and something for mankind , especially in their most important concerns . I feel the responsibility of the situation , and its many temptations . On the other hand , I see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve me from the snares which may surround me ; keep me from the power of personal motives , from interest or passion , or prejudice or ambition , and so enlarge my heart to feel the sorrows of the wretched , the miserable condition of the guilty and the ignorant , that I may never turn my face from any poor man ; ' and so enlighten my understanding , that I may be a capable and resolute champion for those who want and deserve a friend . " The subjects which had most interested him out of Parliament continued to engage him when in it . With the reform of prison discipline that of the criminal law was intimately connected . Both these subjects , especially the latter , had occupied the attention of Sir Samuel Romilly during the ten years previous to his death . This sad event had just occurred ; and as his virtues were universally admired and his character beloved , there was left a duty with his many friends to carry forward his unfinished labors . Men admire the dead more easily than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it is not improbable that , in the silence of his grave , his appeal reached many by whom it had been unheeded in the clamor of debate . The right of a community to punish those who injure its members originates , no doubt , in the natural sense of justice among men . Uncivilized communities and unphilosophical legislators find here a sufficient argument and warrant , which , by reason of the same sense , is neither opposed nor questioned by those among whom it is exercised . Hence the punishment of criminals has existed , in fact , among all societies , while the labor of defining the grounds upon which the right rests , of defending its exercise and analyzing its method and operations , has fallen to the philosophers of a more advanced // state of society . Without referring to more ancient speculations , it is sufficient for our purpose to observe , that the first writer who treated the subject in modern times in a correct and striking manner was the Marquis of Beccaria , who , in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of the principles which he advances are to be found , among others , in the writings of Montesquieu , whom he professedly follows ; but the development of the theory , and its proper application , are due to the Italian philosopher . His treatise was short and masterly . The subject was one which affected every community in Europe ; and the doctrines which it inculcated were those from the neglect of which alniost every state in Europe was at that time suffering . It was therefore warmly received and widely circulated . It was translated into French with a commentary by Voltaire , and spread wherever the language was read , and the authority of the commentator had weight . An English translation soon appeared . But to acknowledge and admire a theory is hardly one step towards carrying it into practice ; and Tuscany and Russia were the only governments which amended their penal codes in accordance with the new rules which had been laid down . Celerity of action is an acknowledged advantage possessed by absolute governments ; but the long postponement of penal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary delays of legislative proceedings . The true cause is to be found in the enormous extent of the evils to be remedied . For the criminal code of England at that time was a monstrous compilation , without form , without organization , without plan ; curious in its combination of defects , wonderful and fearful in the aggregation of its evil qualities ; by turns bloodthirsty and squeamish , exacting and prodigal , puzzling in its conglomerate of contradictions ; here , young but disused ; there , old but in vigor ; in many parts , decrepid , decayed , to all appearance dead , but capable of being roused to sudden and awful action ; unjust itself , the cause of sin in others ; bloodthirsty and capricious , of itself it would have fallen ; but clamped in the chains of custom , its rotten members hung together conspicuous , horrid , an ignominy to the dead , a reproach and offence to the living . " Every punishment which does not arise from absolute // necessity , " says Beccaria , quoting from Montesquieu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus placed upon the only ground where it finds a firm foundation , - that of necessity . Its exercise is an evil , justifiable only because necessary to prevent a greater evil . It is a right under the same law which authorizes a starving man to steal bread ; or a man attacked by violence to take the life which threatens his own . In all these cases alike , the necessity must be plain and evident . It is a plea whose limits are easily defined . Evidently , the necessary stops with the sufficient . Nothing can be necessary for a purpose beyond what is sufficient to accomplish it . In the example we have used , the starving man has a right to steal a loaf of bread ; but if a loaf of bread and a pineapple are lying side by side , and he take the pineapple , he is guilty of theft to an amount equal to the value of the pineapple over that of the bread . He has stolen a value greater than what was sufficient to support life ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeded the powers of his charter . The application of the principle is easy ; - the moment a government inflicts a punishment greater than is sufficient to prevent the crime for which it is awarded , that moment it becomes tyrannical . Thirty years ago , there were two hundred and twenty-three offences punishable by death , according to the statute law of England ; there are now only eight or nine . And this reduced scale of punishment is found to be sufficient ; the old laws , then , were unnecessary , and therefore tyrannical . But we may be required to show , that the Parliament of Great Britain knew the punishments they decreed for their subjects to be more than sufficient before we find them guilty of tyranny . To do this , it is only necessary to quote the statutes . There are certain limits within which is a region of doubt ; on either side of these is certainty ; but within them knowledge can only be attained , in a practical matter , by experience . But the British Parliament grossly erred far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the path plainly pointed out to them by common humanity and common sense , and turned a deaf ear to the teachings which their subsequent experience afforded them . At the beginning of this century , a man in England might be hanged for cutting down a growing tree , for injuring Westminster // bridge , for picking a pocket of any article worth more than a shilling , for wearing a mask on the high road by night , for breaking down the head of a fish-pond , for keeping company with gypsies , for shooting a rabbit in a warren , and for other offences as frivolous . The very statement of the number of capital offences proves the frivolity of an immense majority of them . Can it be urged with any force , that the enlightened Parliament of an enlightened nation could not know , when they awarded these punishments , that they were unnecessary to prevent the offence ; that a much lighter penalty would have accomplished their purpose equally well ? The true account of the criminal legislation of Great Britain is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men over another for whom they had neither sympathy nor care . The unfeeling levity with which bills were passed , creating scores of capital offences , now seems wonderful . Anybody had influence enough to carry such an act through both houses . None opposed ; none discussed . When Burke was rushing through the entry of the House , in haste to keep an appointment abroad , he was called back by one of the servants . There was matter before the House which needed his vote ; it would not detain him a moment ; it was only a felony without benefit of clergy . It is within modern times that a bill was passed appointing capital punishment at once for seventeen different offences , great and trivial . Though punishments were so lavishly enacted , yet , as was natural in a code of laws heaped together without system , many crimes were left without any punishment . We speak not of " forty years since ; * ' it is only half that period since a man could be transported for stealing a handkerchief ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which the property of whole families might depend , he was wholly free from penalty . There were statutes to prevent the stealing or destroying of madder roots , and to protect hollies and thorns in forests ; but the man who stole from a house he had hired could not be punished . " I am sorry , " said Chief Baron McDonald to a man convicted of stealing some plate from a house which he had hired , " I am sorry the laws of England have not provided for your case , for I have no doubt whatever of your guilt . " Could Paley have been aware of these facts , when he defended the existing state of the law , because " the num // her of statutes creating capital offences sweeps into the net every crime , which , under any possible circumstances may meet the punishment of death ? " The net was widely spread for the smaller fry of offenders ; but great criminals found sometimes a weak spot which they might easily break through . These omissions , however , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its inhuman severity . We shall not dwell upon the details of this severity , nor stop to trace into all its ramifications the evils which such a system necessarily brought with it . These evils arose not so much from the execution of the law as from its non-execution . It was declared by high legal authority , that the l*iw at that time existed indeed in theory , but had " almost been abrogated in practice by the astuteness of judges , the humanity of juries , and the clemency of the crown . " But law can not thus be avoided by those who administer it , except by their walking in devious and uncertain paths . The judge , the jury , and the crown , the criminal , the prosecutor , - nay , the whole community , felt the evil of the established wrong , even in the means they were forced to adopt to escape its legitimate results . The almost unlimited severity of the law necessarily caused a discretionary power to be given to the judge , which , from the imperfection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The jury was often placed in the dilemma of either breaking their oaths as jurors , or of acting contrary to the laws of humanity ; and they preferred the latter , calling it " pious perjury . " The criminal knew that his chances of escape were increased by the nature of the law , and was more reckless in committing offences . If convicted , he regarded himseW and was regarded by others , as a martyr to social tyranny . The prerogative of mercy inherent in the crown was , by its extended use , changed to its very opposite . To spare the forfeited life became the rule ; to demand it was the act of the sovereign . And the injured man sat down under his injuries rather than inflict a punishment as disproportioned as revenge itself could imagine . Surely there was reason to pray for " all those whose duty it is to execute justice , " for the law of the land led them into grievous temptations . And the bad influences of this state of the law did not stop with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They spread throughout the whole community , and were not less potent in those results which were unseen and constant , than in those which were often brought to notice . For the law of a n2ation should be its great preceptor . All men should be forced to admire the wisdom which provides the far-reaching rules under which they act . The whole people should be the intelligent instances illustrating these general rules . Society should look for wisdom from its own enacted truth . How great , then , the evil , when that which should instruct must be put aside and virtually annulled , because opposed to the elementary dictates of human nature ! It is not to be supposed that , in the native land of Sir Thomas More , Sir Walter Raleigh , and Lord Bacon , these evils passed unnoticed or unchallenged . The faulty state of the penal law was observed by these and others . The defects and their consequences were clearly pointed out . But the first time that its amendment was brought to the notice of Parliament was in 1750 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain crimes , a committee was appointed by the House of Commons , " to examine into and consider the state of the laws relating to felonies , and to report to the House their opinion as to the defects of those laws , and as to the propriety of amending or repealing them . " The subject was not committed to obscure men , nor to rash theorists , but to the greatest lawyers and statesmen of the time . Among the members of that committee were Mr. Pelham , then Chancellor of the Exchequer , the elder Pitt , Mr. G. Grenville , afterwards Lord Grenville , Mr. Lyttleton and Mr. Charles Townsend , afterwards Secretaries of State , and Sir Dudley Ryder , then Attorney-General , afterwards Chief Justice of England . Two sessions of Parliament were consumed in the investigations to which their subject led , when they recommended the House to adopt the resolution , " that it was reasonable to exchange the punishment of death for some other adequate punishment . " Founded upon a series of resolutions , of which this was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Commons , but the Lords threw it out . We have the authority of Sir James Mackintosh for saying , that " it was not opposed by any of the great names of that day - by any of the luminaries of that House . " // Twenty years after , nearly the same series of events recurred . A similar increase of crime produced a similar alarm , which led to the appointment of another committee , who spent two other years in coming to results like those of their predecessors . Their bill proposed the repeal of eight or ten sanguinary statutes . The Commons accede , the obscurer Lords reject the bill , while Lord Camden and Lord Mansfield , the ornaments of their house , offer it no opposition . It was upon such precedents , that in 1808 , Sir Samuel Romilly began his labors in this branch of legal reform . In the session of that year , he proposed to repeal a statute of the time of Queen Elizabeth , by which the crime of privately stealing from the person was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House of Cornmons , while in the Lords not a word was said upon it . Encouraged by this success , he brought forward , early in 1810 , three bills to repeal as many acts which then punished with death the crimes of stealing privately in a shop goods of the value of five shillings ; of stealing to the amount of forty shillings in dwelling-houses ; and of stealing to the same amount on board vessels in navigable rivers . Of these , the Commons passed the first , rejected the second , and postponed the third . The first bill then went to the Lords , who were less lenient or more watchful . Lord Eldon , Lord Ellenborough , and Lord Liverpool spoke strongly against the measure . Lord Ellenborough was horrified at the prospect of innovation which opened before him . He is even reported to have made a confession most painful to a statesman of ability , who , whatever may be the measure proposed , is supposed to have so commanding a knowledge of affairs as to be able to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a measure proposing to change the punishment of stealing from a shop goods of the value of five shillings , from death to transportation for life , presented to his bewildered gaze a mass of mingled dangers beyond his power to analyze or portray . He had recourse to metaphor . " My Lords , " he cried , " if we suffer this bill to pass , we shall not know where we stand ; we shall not know whether we stand upon our heads or our feet . " No wonder their lordships were alarmed . They rejected the bill by a majority of thirty-one to eleven . // Next year , the same three bills were again brought before Parliament , and now they *tll passed the Commons , but the Lords were inexorable . Lord Ellenborough could not witness the repeal of " laws which centuries have proved to be necessary . " Lord Eldon declared , that he " saw the wisdom of the principles and practice by which the criminal code was regulated ; " while Lord Liverpool " objected not so much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were founded , which might be applied to the whole criminal code . That code , " he said , " had succeeded as well as it was possible for any system of criminal law to succeed . He should , therefore , oppose the bills , which , while he was sure they could effect no good , might be productive of very great mischief . " * In 1813 and 1816 , the bill met with the same treatment . Again brought forward in 1818 , it passed the House of Commons for the fifth time , a few months before the sad death of its able and persevering advocate . We should form but an inadequate idea of what Sir Samuel Romilly really accomplished towards the reform of the criminal law , did we confine our view to the changes in the statute book , which he effected . The influence exerted upon public opinion by his writings and speeches can not be determined ; but it is fair to estimate it from knowing the effect they were fitted to produce , and by observing the change which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however ; may be distinctly noticed . He put a stop to the passage of bills creating new capital felonies ; and he carried through Parliament a preamble which , upon its first introduction , had been warmly and successfully opposed , and which contained an expression of the principle which he deemed to be the cardinal one of all criminal legislation , that the efficiency of punishment depends , not upon its severity , but upon its certainty . The whole reform afterwards accomplished was but the necessary consequence of this principle . * For further arguments of the same nature , see Sydney Smith 's " Noodle 's Oration . " With equal earnestness , Noodle asks , " What would our ancestors say to this , Sir ? How does this measure tally with their institutions ? Are we to put the wisdom of yesterday in competition with the wisdom of centuiies ? If this measure he ri , , ht , would it have escaped the wisdom of our Saxon progenitors , &amp;c. ? Would the Dane have passed it over ? Would the Norman have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now fell into the hands of Sir James Mackintosh , who brought forward a motion for the appointment of a select committee on the criminal law . His motion was seconded by Mr. Buxton , who made upon this occasion his first formal speech in Parliament . In describing the character of his speeches , his biographer says - " Their eloquence was less remarkable than their force . His speeches were not sparkling nor splendid ; their end was utility ; their ornaments , clearness , force , and earnest feeling . He usually bestowed much care in preparation ; not in embellishing the style , but in bringing together supplies of facts , and marshalling them in one strong line of argument . Speaking , as he did , from the heart , and for the most part on subjects which appealed to the feelings as well as the judgment , he sometimes rose into passages of impassioned declamation ; occasionally there was a burst of indignation , and not unfrequently a touch of playful satire ; but the usual character of his oratory was a lucid and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this speech we will make two extracts , partly to give a specimen of his style , and partly for the sake of the information they so strikingly convey . Both illustrate the practical nature of his arguments , and the forcible and ingenious manner in which he presented well-known facts . His object was to show to those who prided themselves upon their conservatism , and who defended the existing state of the laws by what Bentham calls " the wisdom-of-our-ancestors argument , " that the law as it then stood was directly opposed to the old law of England ; for while , at present , a vast number of offences of various degrees of guilt were threatened with death , in earlier days a few crimes only , of great enormity , were deemed worthy of such punishment . " I hold in my hand , " he said , " a list of those offences which at this moment are capital , in number 223 ; the first was made capital in the reign of Edward III , and the last in the present century , comprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , six were enacted in the 150 years from the reign of Edward III . to the death of Henry VII . In the next 150 years , from the accession of Henry VIII . to the accession of Charles II . thirty were enacted ; and in the last 150 years , from the accession of Charles LI . to the present time , eighty.seven . Or // to put it in another point of view . In the reign of the Plantagenets , the number of capital offences created was four ; in that of the Tudors , twenty-seven ; in that of the Stuarts , thirty-six ; in  --  the reign of the House of Brunswick , one hundred and fiftysix . Or to make it still stronger , more crimes have been denounced as capital in the reign of his present Majesty , than in the reigns of the Plantagenets , the Tudors , and the Stuarts combined . " To show the uncertainty of its execution consequent upon the severity of the law , he said , - " You will observe , that every criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felony ; that felony may never be discovered ; if discovered , he may not be suspected as its author ; if suspected , proof may be wanting ; proof being supplied , he may not be apprehended . These are natural chances in favor of the criminal ; they must be calculated at something ; but whether that something be two to one , or one hundred to one in favor of the criminal , is a matter of indifference to my argument . I will put them at that to which I think they most nearly approach , namely , five to one . But I have proved that it is highly probable that the reluctance to prosecut&amp; augments his natural chances of escape ten to one ; that is , what was by nature five to one , becomes fifty to one . I have proved , that the reluctance of juries to convict in capital cases , doubles these chances ; so we have arrived at one hundred to one in favor of the criminal , that he will not be capitally convicted . Being capitally convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved me the trouble of calculating this . It appears that if a criminal be capitally convicted , it is ten to one he will not be executed ; so that we are arrived at this - it is five to one he will not be detected ; fifty to one he will not be prosecuted ; one hundred to one he will not be convicted ; and one thousand to one that the sentence pronounced by the law will never be carried into effect . " Gentlemen will naturally startle at so extraordinary a result . I confess I did so myself when I first considered the subject . I distrusted premises which led to so strange a conclusion . I thought they proved too much ; nevertheless that conclusion is true , and true to a mathematical demonstration . " In spite of the opposition of Government , the motion for the appointment of a committee was carried by a majority of eighteen . Mr. Buxton was included in this committee , as well as in another , appointed nearly at the same time , to examine the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // of these committees occupied his time and thoughts . Three mornings of the week were devoted to one , and three to the other . Caring little about party politics , he voted as he liked , sometimes with Government and sometimes against it , according to his view of the case . " I feel the greatesf interest , " he writes to his friend North , " in such subjects as the Slave Trade , the condition of the poor , prisons , and criminal law : to these I devote myself , and should be quite content never to give another vote upon a party question . " It was not till the year succeeding their appointment , that the committee charged with the inquiry into the working of the criminal laws brought their labors to a close . From their report arose the bill of Sir James Mackintosh for the abrogation of the punishment of death in cases of forgery . The speech which Mr. Buxton delivered upon this bill excited even more notice than that delivered upon the motion for a committee . " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most powerful appeal he had ever bad the good fortune to hear within the walls of Parliament . ' " And in a subsequent debate , Mr. ( now Lord ) Denman remarked , that " more of wisdom , more of benevolence , more of practical demonstration , he had never heard in the course of his parliamentary career , than was contained in the energetic speech of his honorable friend . " The evening after the delivery of this speech , Mr. Buxton received from Mr. Wilberforce the following letter , which gave the direction to the labors of the rest of his life : - " My dear Buxton , London , May 24 , 1821 . " It is now more than thirty.three years since , after having given notice in the House of Commons that I should bring forward , for the first time , the question concerning the Slave Trade , it pleased God to visit me with severe indisposition , by which , indeed , I was so exhausted , that the ablest physician in London of that day declared that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On this I went to Mr. Pitt , and begged of him a promise , which he kindly and readily gave me , to take upon himself the conduct of that great cause . " I thank God , I am now free from any indisposition ; but from my time of life , and much more from the state of my constitution , and my inability to bear inclemencies of weather , and irregularities which close attendance on the House of Commons often requires , I am reminded , but too intelligibly , of my being in such a // state that I ought not to look confidently to my being able to carry through any business of importance in the House of Commons . Now , for many , many years I have been longing to bring forward that great subject , the condition of the negro slaves in our trans-Atlantic colonies , and the best means of providing for their moral and social improvement , and ultimately for their advancement to the rank of a free peasantry ; a cause this , recommended to me , or rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice , and humanity . " Under this impression I have been waiting , with no little solicitude , for a proper time and suitable circumstances of the country , for introducing this great business ; and , latterly , for some Member of Parliament , who , if I were to retire or to be laid by , would be an eligible leader in this holy enterprise . " I have for some time been viewing you in this connection ; and after what passed last night , I can no longer forbear resorting to you , as I formerly did to Pitt , and earnestly conjuring you to take most seriously into consideration the expediency of your devoting yourself to this blessed service , so far as will be consistent with the due discharge of the obligations you have already contracted , and in part so admirably fulfilled , to war against the abuses of our criminal law , both in its structure and its administration . Let me then entreat you to form an alliance with me , that may truly be termed holy , and if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be declared this session ) ; and still more , if , when commenced , I should , ( as certainly would , I fear , be the case , ) be unable to finish it , do I entreat that you would continue to prosecute it . Your assurance to this effect would give me the greatest pleasure - pleasure is a bad term - let me rather say peace and consolation ; for , alas , my friend , I feel but too deeply , how little I have been duly assiduous and faithful in employing the talents committed to my stewardship ; and in forming a partnership of this sort with you , I can not doubt that 1 should be doing an act highly pleasing to God , and beneficial to my fellow creatures . Both my head and heart are quite full to overflowing , but I must conclude . My dear friend , may it please God to bless you , both in your public and private course . if it be His will , may He render you an instrument of extensive usefu*ness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition to say at all times , Lord , what wouldst thou have me to do , or to suffer ? looking to Him , through Christ , for wisdom and strength . And while active in business and fervent in spirit upon earth , may you have your conversation in heaven , and your affections set on things above . There may we at last meet , together with all we most love , and spend an eternity of holiness and happiness complete and unassailable . Ever affectionately yours , " W. WILBERFORCItX " // A charge so important was not lightly to be rejected or assumed ; and it was not till a year and a half after the receipt of this letter , that Mr. Buxton fully resolved upon undertaking it . During that interval , he spent what time he could command in a study of the subject in all its bearings . But before we enter upon any view of this , the great object of his life , let us trace to their conclusion the efforts in which he engaged for the improvement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on gaols ( appointed in 1819 ) published its first report in 1820 , and the government was thereby induced to bring in a bill for consolidating and amending the prison laws then in existence . rJ7hi bill was referred for revision to a select committee , of which Mr. Buxton was a member . " p. 90 . " After much patient investigation , a bill was prepared by the committee , and immediately adopted by the two Houses of Par . liament ; and thus the English gaols , instead of remaining the nurseries and hot.beds of crime , the almost inevitable ruin of all who entered within their walls , ' have become , generally speak . ing , places where the improvement , as well as the punishment of the criminal is attempted . Perfection , of course , is not yet attained ; the new system has been of no avail in those prisons where exertions have not been used to enforce it ; but no man can read the descriptions of the state of gaols from twenty.flve to thirty years ago , and compare them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the extent of the evil and of the reform . " p. 91 . With regard to the reform of the Criminal Law , without following out the particulars of parliamentary warfare , it is enough to say , that Sir James Mackintosh kept the subject constantly in view , and made various efforts to bring about a reform , apparently without success , till Mr. ( now Sir Robert ) Peel , being Secretary of the Home Department , commenced in 1826 his revision of the code , by which it was cleared of many obsolete and barbarous statutes , and the whole body of the criminal law arranged and consolidated . In 1830 , while this work was still going on , Mr. Peel introduced a bill for consolidating the laws relating to forgery , retaining , however , in spite of a strong opposition , the punishment of death in several cases . To express the sense of the men of business in England , that their property would be far safer when protected by a penalty to whose infliction humanity was not // opposed , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a petition which , being quickly sent to the principal towns of the kingdom , received the signatures of firms representing above one thousand bankers . It was presented by Mr. Brougham , and had great effect in procuring a majority in the House of Commons against the punishment of death for forgery . The merciful and intelligent Lords reversed the decision ; but the question was virtually decided by the vote of the Commons ; and no execution for forgery has , since that vote , taken place in Great Britain . " In succeeding years , the infliction of capital penalties was more and more reduced by the efforts of Mr. Ewart , Mr. Lennard , and others , to whose exertions Mr. Buxton always gave , while he remained in Parliament , his strenuous assistance ; and it is satisfactory to know that the number of crimes , now legally punishable with death , is reduced from two hundred and thirty to eight or nine ; and that , practically , no executions now take place in England or Wales , except for murder or attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the great labor and achievement of Mr. Buxton 's life - the emancipatioa of the slaves in the British colonies . His previous exertions , which we have briefly noticed , had developed his powers , displayed his force , and won the respect and confidence of his contemporaries . Wilberforce had seen in him the qualities fit for carrying out those plans , which , as he was conscious , required a younger and more vigorous champion than himself . But our space fails us ; and the hasty sketch which we propose to give of the crowning work of Mr. Buxton 's life must be reserved for our next number .
