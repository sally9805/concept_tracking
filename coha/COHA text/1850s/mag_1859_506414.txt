txt THE VIRGINIANS . BY W. M. THACKERAY . ( FRoar TILE WARRINGTON Ms. ) IN WHICH MY LADY IS ON THE TOP OF THE LADDER . T OOKING across the fire , toward her accuslJtomed chair , who has been the beloved partner of my hearth during the last half of my life , I often ask ( for middle-aged gentlemen have tile privilege of repeating their jokes , their questions , their stories ) whether two young people ever were more foolish and imprudent than we were , when we married , as we did , in the year before the old King 's death ? My son , who has taken some prodigious leaps in the heat of his fox-hunting , says he surveys the gaps and rivers which he so crossed safely over , with terror afterward , and astonishment at his own fool-hardiness in making such desperate ventures ; and yet there is no more eager sportsman in the two counties than Miles . He loves his amusement so much that he cares for no other . He has broken his collar-bone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror ) ; but so has his father ( thinking , perhaps , of a copy of verse , or his speech at Quarter Sessions ) been thrown over his old mare 's head , who has slipped on a stone , as they were both dreaming along a park road at four miles an hour ; and Miles 's reckless sport has been the delight of his life , as my marriage has been the blessing of mine ; and I never think of it but to thank Heaven . Mind , I do n't set up my worship as an example : I do n't say to all young folks , " Go and marry upon twopence a year ; " or people would look very black at me at our vestry-meetings ; but my wife is known to be a desperate match-maker ; and when Hodge and Susan appear in my justice-room with a talk of allowance , we urge them to spend their halfcrown a week at home , add a little contribution of our own , and send for the vicar . Now , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the answer will be ; and hence , no doubt , the reason why I so often consult her . I have but to wear a particular expression of face , and my Diana takes her reflection from it . Suppose I say , " My dear , do n't you think the moon was made of cream-cheese to-night ? " She will say , " Well , papa , it did look very like creamcheese , indeed-there 's nobody like you for droll similes . " Or , suppose I say , " My love , Mr. Pitt 's speech was very fine , but I do n't think he is equal to what I remember his father . " " Nobody was equal to my Lord Chatham , " says my wife . And then one of the girls cries , " Why , I have often heard our Papa say , Lord Chatham was a charlatan ! " On which Mamma says , " How like she is to her aunt Hetty ! " As for Miles , Tros Tyriosve is all one to him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So long as there is good scent , he does not care about the state of the country . I believe the rascal has never read my poems , much more my tragedies ( for I mentioned Pocahontas to him the other day , and the dunce thought she was a river in Virginia ) ; and with respect to my Latin verses , how can he understand them , when I know he ca n't construe Corderius ? Why this note-book lies publicly on the little table at my corner of the fireside , and any one may read in it who will take the trouble of lifting my spectacles off the cover ; but Miles never bath . I insert in the loose pages caricatures of Miles , jokes against him ; but he never knows nor heeds them . Only once , in place of a neat drawing of mine , in China-ink , representing Miles asleep after dinner , and which my friend Bunbury would not disown , I found a rude picture of myself going over my mare Sultana 's head , and entitled " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the fellow to roar with laughter , and all the girls to titter , when I came upon the page ! My wife said she never was in such a fright as when I went to my book ; but I can bear a joke against myself and have heard many , though ( strange to say for one who has lived among some of the chief wits of the age ) I never heard a good one in my life . Never mind , Miles , though thou art not a wit , I love thee none the worse ( there never was any love lost between two wits in a family ) ; though CHAPTER LXXII. // thou hast no great beauty , thy mother thinks thee as handsome as Apollo , or His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales , who was born in the very same year . Indeed , she always thinks Coates 's picture of the Prince is very like her eldest boy , and has the print in her dressingroom to this very day . * In that same year , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , likewise appeared to adorn the world ! My Lord G and his humble servant had already come to a coolness at that time , and , Heaven knows ! my honest Miles 's godmother , at his entrance into life , brought no gold pap-boats to his christening ! Matters have mended since , Laus Deo - Laus Deo , indeed ! for I suspect neither Miles nor his father would ever have been able to do much for themselves , and by their own wits . Castlewood House has quite a different face now from that venerable one which it wore in the days of my youth , when it was covered with the wrinkles of time , the scars of old wars , the cracks and blemishes which years had marked on its hoary features . I love best to remember it in its old shape , as I saw it when young Mr. George Warrington went down , at the owner s invitation , to be present at his lordship 's marriage with Miss Lydia Van den Bosch- " an American lady of noble family of Holland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Then the towers stood as Warrington 's grandfather the Colonel ( the Marquis , as Madam Esmond would like to call her father ) had seen them . The woods ( thinned not a little to be sure ) stood , nay , some of the self-same rooks may have cawed over them , which the Colonel had seen threescore years back . His picture hung in the hall , which might have been his , had he not preferred love and gratitude to wealth and worldly honor ; and Mr. George Esmond Warrington ( that is , Egomet Ipse who write this page down ) , as he walked the old place , pacing the long corridors , the smooth dew-spangled terraces , and cool darkling avenues , felt a while as if he was one of Mr. Walpole 's cavaliers with rufl rapier , buff-coat , and gorget , and as if an Old Pretender , or a Jesuit emissary in disguise , might appear from behind any tall tree-trunk round about the mansion , or antique carved cupboard within it . I had the strangest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ; I imagined tragedies , intrigues , serenades , escaladoes , Oliver 's Roundheads battering the towers , or bluff Hal 's Beef-eaters pricking over the plain before the castle . I was then courting a certain young lady ( Madam , your ladyship 's eyes had no need of spectacles then , and on the brow above them there was never a * Note , in a female hand : " My son is not a spendths-ift , nor a breaker of women 's hearts , as some gentlemen are ; but that he was exceeding like H.R.H. when they were both babies , is most certain , the Duchess of Ancaster having herself remarked him in St. James 's Park , where Gumbo and my poor Molly used often to take him for an airing . Th . W. " wrinkle or a silver hair ) , and I remember I wrote a ream of romantic description , under my Lord Castlewood 's franks , to the lady who never tired of reading my letters then . She says I only send her three lines now , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I may not fatigue your old eyes , my dear ! Mr. Warrington thought himself authorized to order a genteel new suit of clothes for my lord 's marriage , and with Mons. Gumbo in attendance made his appearance at Castlewood a few days before the ceremony . I may mention that it had been found expedient to send my faithful Sady home on board a Virginia ship . A great inflammation attacking the throat and lungs , and proving fatal in very many cases , in that year of Wolfe 's expedition , had seized and well-nigh killed my poor lad , for whom his native air was pronounced to be the best cure . We parted with an abundance of tears , and Gumbo shed as many when his master went to Quebec ; but he had attractions in this country and none for the military life , so he remained attached to my service . We found Castlewood House full of friends , relations , and visitors . Lady Fanny was there upon compulsion , a sulky bridesmaid . Some of the virgins of the neighborhood also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Baroness Beatrix brought a holy brother-in-law of the bench from London to tie the holy knot of matrimony between Eugene Earl of Castlewood and Lydia Van den Bosch , spinster ; and for some time before and after the nuptials the old house in Hampshire wore an appearance of gayety to which it had long been unaccustomed . The country families came gladly to pay their compliments to the newlymarried couple . The lady 's wealth was the subject of every body 's talk , and no doubt did not decrease in the telling . Those naughty stories which were rife in town , and spread by her disappointed suitors there , took some little time to travel into Hampshire ; and when they reached the country found it disposed to treat Lord Castlewood 's wife with civility , and not inclined to be too curious about her behavior in town . Suppose she had jilted this man , and laughed at the other ? It was her money they were anxious about , and she was no more mercenary than they . The Hampshire folks were determined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castlewood House once more open , with beer in the cellars , horses in the stables , and spits turning before the kitchen fires . The new lady took her place with great dignity , and t was certain she had uncommon accomplishments and wit . Was it not written in the marriage advertisements that her ladyship brought her noble husband seventy thousand pounds ? On a beaucosp d'es*prit with seventy thousand pounds . The Hampshire people said this was only a small portion of her wealth . When the grandfather should fall , ever so many plums would be found on that old tree . That quiet old man and keen reckoner began quickly to put the dilapidated Castlewood ac // MASTER MILES WAXEINOTON. counts in order , of which long neglect , poverty , where practicable ; to pure the expenses of the and improvidence had hastened the ruin . The establishment down . He could , somehow , look business of the old gentleman 's life now , and for to every yard of worsted-lace on the footmen 's some time henceforth , was to advance , improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their mend my lord 's finances ; to screw the rents up dinner . A watchful old eye noted every flagon N 7 LI Z. - ( , * - 7W* * // of beer which was fetched from the buttery , and marked that no waste occurred in the larder . The people were fewer , but more regularly paid ; the liveries were not so ragged , and yet the tailor had no need to dun for his money ; the gardeners and grooms grumbled , though their wages were no longer overdue ; but the horses fattened on less corn , and the fruit and vegetables were ever so much more plentiful-so keenly did my lady 's old grandfather keep a watch over the household affairs , from his lonely little chamber in the turret . These improvements , though here told in a paragraph or two , were the affairs of months and years at Castlewood ; where , with thrift , order , and judicious outlay of money ( however , upon some pressing occasions , my lord might say he had none ) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flourishlug arid economical household no one could deny ; not even the dowager lady and her two children , who now seldom entered within Castlewood gates , my lady considering them in the light of enemies-for who , indeed , would like a step-mother-in-law ? The little reigning Countess gave the dowager battle , and routed her utterly and speedily . Though educated in the colonies , and ignorant of polite life during her early years , the Countess Lydia had a power of language and a strength of will that all had to acknowledge who quarreled with her . The dowager and my Lady Fanny were no match for the young American : they fled from before her to their jointure house in Kensington , and no wonder their absence was not regretted by my lord , who was in the habit of regretting no one whose back was turned . Could Cousin Warrington , whose hand his lordship pressed so affectionately on coming and parting , with whom Cousin Eugene was so gay and frank and pleasant when they were together , expect or hope that his lordship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any misfortune which could happen to him , or any souls alive ? Cousin Warrington knew better . Always of a skeptical turn , Mr. W. took a grim delight in watching the peculiarities of his neighbors , and could like this one even though he had no courage and no heart . Courage ? heart ? What are these to you and me in the world ? A man may have private virtues as he may have half a million in the funds . What we du monde expect is , that he should be lively , agreeable , keep a decent figure , and pay his way . Colonel Esmond , Warrington 's grandfather ( in whose history and dwelling-place Mr. W. took an extraordinary interest ) , might once have been owner of this house of Castlewood , and of the titles which belonged to its possessor . The gentleman often looked at the Colonel 's grave picture as it still hung in the saloon , a copy or replica of which piece Mr. Warrington fondly remembered in Virginia . He must have been a little touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , placid forehead . There are certain actions simple and common with some men which others can not understand , and deny as utter lies , or deride as acts of madness . " I do you the justice to think , cousin , " says Mr. Warrington to his lordship , " that you would not give up any advantage for any friend in the world . " " Eh ! I am selfish ; but am I more selfish than the rest of the world ? " asks my lord , with a French shrug of his shoulders and a pinch out of his box . Once , in their walks in the fields , his lordship happening to wear a fine scarlet coat , a cow ran toward him ; and the ordinarily languid nobleman sprang over a stile with the agility of a school-boy . He did not conceal his tremor or his natural want of courage . " I dare say you respect me no more than I respect myself , George , " he would say , in his candid way , and begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and his faults and shortcomings ; and wonder why Heaven had not made us all brave , and tall , and handsome , and rich ? As for Mr. Warrington , who very likely loved to be king of his company ( as some people do ) , he could not help liking this kinsman of his , so witty , graceful , polished , high-placed in the world-so utterly his inferior . Like the animal in Mr. Sterne 's famous book , " Do not beat me , " his lordship 's look seemed to say , " but if you will , you may . " No man , save a bully and coward himself deals hardly with a creature so spiritless . ChAPTER LXXIII . WE KEEP CHRISTMAS AT CASTLEWOOD. 1759 . WE know , my dear children , from our favorite fairy story-books , how at all christenings and marriages some one is invariably disappointed , and vows vengeance ; and so need not wonder that good Cousin Will should curse and rage energetically at the news of his brother 's engagement with the colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his wrath , swearing he would never return . But nobody , including the swearer , believed much in Master Will 's oaths ; and this unrepentant prodigal , after a day or two , came back to the paternal house . The fumes of the marriage-feast allured him : he could not afford to resign his knife and fork at Castlewood table . He returned , and drank and ate there in token of revenge . He pledged the young bride in a bumper , and drank perdition to her under his breath . He made responses of smothered maledictions as her father gave her away in the chapel and my lord vowed to love , honor , and cherish her . He was not the only grumbler respecting that marriage , as Mr. Warrington knew : he heard , then and afterward , no end of abuse of my lady and her grandfather . The old gentleman 's city friends , his legal adviser , the Dissenting clergyman at whose chapel they attended on their first arrival in England , and poor Jack Lambert , the orthodox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been exerted over her in private , were bitter against the little lady 's treachery , and each had a story to tell of his having been enslaved , encouraged , jilted , by the young American . The lawyer , who had had such an accurate list of all her properties , estates , moneys , slaves , ships , expectations , was ready to vow and swear that he believed the whole account was false ; that there was no such place as New York or Virginia ; or at any rate , that Mr. Van den Bosch had no land there ; that there was no such thing as a Guinea trade , and that the negroes were so marty black falsehoods invented by the wily old planter . The Dissenting pastor moaned over his stray lambling-if such a little , wily , mischievous monster could be called a lamb at all . Poor Jack Lambert ruefully acknowledged to his mamma the possession of a lock of black hair , which he bedewed with tears , and apostrophized in quite unclerical language ; and as for William Esmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always freely indulged , even at Castlewood , under his sister-in-law 's own pretty little nose , when under any strong emotion , called Acheron to witness , that out of that region there did not exist such an artful young devil as Miss Lydia . He swore that she was an infernal female Cerberus , and called down all the wrath of this world and the next upon his swindling rascal of a brother , who had cajoled him with fair words , and filched his prize from him . " Why , " says Mr. Warrington ( when Will expatiated on these matters with him ) , " if the girl is such a she-devil as you describe her , you are all the better for losing her . If she intends to deceive her husband , and to give him a dose of poison , as you say , how lucky for you you are not the man ! You ought to thank the gods , Will , instead of cursing them for robbing you of such a fury , and ca n't be better revenged on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All this was very well , " Will Esmond said ; but-not unjustly , perhaps-remarked that his brother was not the less a scoundrel for having cheated him out of the fortune which he expected to get , and which he had risked his life to win , too . George Warrington was at a loss to know how his cousin had been made so to risk his precious existence ( for which , perhaps , a rope's-end had been a fitting termination ) , on which Will Esmond , with the utmost candor , told his kinsman how the little Cerbera had actually caused the meeting between them , which was interrupted somehow by Sir John Fielding 's men ; how she was always saying that George Warrington was a coward for ever sneering at Mr. Will , and the latter doubly a poltroon for not taking notice of his kinsman 's taunts ; how George had run away and nearly died of fright in Braddock 's expedition ; and " Deuce take me , " says Will , " I never was more surprised , cousin , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yonder , for me and my second offered to wager that you would never come ! " Mr. Warringtcn laughed , and thanked Mr. Will for this opinion of him . " Though , " says he , " cousin , t was lucky for me the constables came up , or you would have whipped your sword through my body in another minute . Did n't you see how clumsy I was as I stood before you ? And you actually turned white and shook with anger ! " " Yes , curse me ! " says Mr. Will ( who turned very red this time ) , " that 's my way of showing my rage ; and I was confoundedly angry with you , cousin ! But now t is my brother I hate , and that little devil of a countess  --  a countess ! a pretty countess , indeed ! " And , with another rumbling cannonade of oaths , Will saluted the reigning member of his family . " Well , cousin , " says George , looking him queerly in the face , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , I owe my life to you , or at any rate a whole waistcoat , and I admire your forbearance and spirit . What a pity that a courage like yours should be wasted as a mere court usher ! You are a loss to his Majesty 's army . You positively are ! " " I never know whether you are joking or serious , Mr. Warrington , " growls Will . " I should think very few gentlemen would dare to joke with you , cousin , if they had a regard for their own lives or ears ! " cries Mr. Warrington , who loved this grave way of dealing with his noble kinsman , and used to watch , with a droll interest , the other choking his curses , grinding his teeth because afraid to bite , and smothering his cowardly anger . " And you should moderate your expressions , cousin , regarding the dear countess and my lord , your brother , " Mr. Warrington resumed . " Of you they always speak most tenderly . Her ladyship has told me every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will , aghast . " As much as women ever do tell , cousin . She owned that she thought you had been a little eprss with her . What woman can help lil*-ing a man who has admired her ? " // qwq // qwq " Do n't tink you will , master ! " says Gumbo , grinning . " Hold your tongue , Sir ! He does n't know English ways , you see , and perhaps thinks an old servant has a claim on his master 's kindness , " says Mr. Warrington . The next day , to Warrington 's surprise , my lady absolutely did send a basket of good wine to Lockwood , and a cushion for his arm-chair . " I thought of what you said , yesterday , at night when I went to bed ; and guess you know the world better than I do , cousin ; and that it 's best to keep the old man , as you say . " And so this affair of the Porter 's lodge ended , Mr. Warrington wondering within himself at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her naivett5 and simplicities , and a heartlessness would have done credit to the most battered old dowager who ever turned trumps in St. James 's . " You tell me to respect old people . Why ? I do n't see nothin ' to respect in the old people I know , " she said to Warrington . " They ai n't so funny , and I 'm sure they ai n't so handsome . Look at grandfather ; look at Aunt Bernstein . They say she was a beauty once ! That picture painted from her ! I do n't believe it , nohow . No one shall tell me that I shall ever be as bad as that ! When they come to that , people ought n't to live . No , that they ought n't . " Now , at Christmas , Aunt Bernstein came to pay her nephew and niece a visit , in company with Mr. Warrington . They traveled at their leisure in the Baroness 's own landau ; the old lady being in particular good health and spirits , the weather delightfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached her paternal home , Aunt Beatrice told her companion a hundred stories regarding it and old days . Though often lethargic , and not seldom , it must be confessed , out of temper , the old lady would light up at times , when her conversation became wonderfully lively , her wit and malice were brilliant , and her memory supplied her with a hundred anecdotes of a by-gone age and society . Sure , t is hard with respect to Beanty that its possessor should not have even a life-enjoyment of it , but be compelled to resign it after , at the most , some forty years ' lease . As the old woman prattled of her former lovers and admirers ( her auditor having much more information regarding her past career than her ladyship knew of ) , I would look in her face , and , out of the ruins , try to build up in my fancy a notion of her beauty in its prime . What a homily I read there ! How the courts were grown with grass , the towers broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the tapestries cobwebbed and torn ! Yonder dilapidated palace was all alive once with splendor and music , and those dim windows were dazzling and blazing with light ! What balls and feasts were once here , what splendor and laughter ! I could see lovers in waiting , crowds in admiration , rivals furious . I could imagine twilight assignations , and detect intrigues , though the curtains were close and VOL . XIX. - No. 109. -H drawn . I was often minded to say to the old woman as she talked , " Madam , I know the story was not as you tell it , but so and so " - ( I had read at home the history of her life , as my dear old grandfather had wrote it ) ; and my fancy wandered about in her , amused and solitary , as I had walked about our father 's house at Cas. - tlewood , meditating on departed glories , and imagining ancient times . When Aunt Bernstein came to Castlewood , her relatives there , more I think on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit , than from their desire to po*ess her money , were accustomed to pay .. her great deal of respect and deference , which she accepted as her due . She expected the same treatment from the new countess , whom she was prepared to greet with special good humor . The match had been of her making . " As you , you silly creature , would not have the hei.r*ss , " she said , " I was determined she should not go out of the family , " and she laughingly told of many little schemes for bringing the marriage about . She had given the girl a coronet and her nephew a hundred thousand pounds . Of course she should be welcome to both of them . She was delighted with the little Countess 's courage and spirit in routing the Dowager and Lady Fanny . Almost always pleased with pretty people on her first introduction to them , Madame Bernstein reffoh*d of her niece Lydia 's bright eyes and lovely little figure . The marriage was altogether desirable . The old man was an obstacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat too homely . But he will be got rid of . He is old and in delicate health . " He will want to go to America , or perhaps farther , " says the Baroness , with a shrug . " As for the child , she had great fire and liveliness , and a Cherokee manner which is not without its charm , " said the pleased old Baroness . " Your brother had it-so have you , Master George ! Nous la for*nerons , cette petite . Eugene wants character and vigor , but he is a finished gentleman , and between us we shall make the little savage perfectly presentable . " In this way we discoursed on the second afternoon as we journeyed toward Castlewood . We lay at the King 's Arms at Bagshot the first night , where the Baroness was always received with profound respect , and thence drove post to Hexton , where she had written to have my lord 's horses in waiting for her ; but these were not forthcoming at the inn , and after a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Castlewood . During this last stage of the journey I am bound to say the old aunt 's testy humor returned , and she scarce spoke a single word for three hours . As for her companion , being prodigiously in love at the time , no doubt he did not press his aunt for conversation , but thought unceasingly about his Dulcinca , until the coach actually reached Castlewood Common , and rolled over the bridge before the house . The housekeeper was ready to conduct her ladyship to her apartments . My lord and lady // were both absent . She did not know what bad kept them , the housekeeper said , heading the way . " Not that door , my lady ! " cries the woman , as Madame de Bernstein put her hand upon the door of the room which she had always occupied . That 's her ladyship 's room now . This way , " and our aunt followed , by no means in increased good-humor . I do not envy her maids when their mistress was displeased . But she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in the drawing-room before suppertime with a countenance of tolerable serenity . " How d'ye do , Aunt ? " was the Countess 's salutation . " I declare , now , I was taking a nap when your ladyship arrived ! Hope you found your room fixed to your liking ! " Having addressed three brief sentences to the astonished old lady , the Countess now turned to her other guests , and directed her conversation to them . Mr. Warrington was not a little diverted by her behavior , and by the appearance of surprise and wrath which began to gather over Madame Bernstein 's face . " La petite , " whom the Baroness proposed to " form , was rather a rebellious subject , apparently , and proposed to take a form of her own . Looking once or twice rather anxiously toward his wife , my lord tried to atone for her pertness toward his aunt by profuse civility on his own part ; indeed , when he so wished , no man could be more courteous or pleasing . He found a score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulated Mr. Warrington on the glorious news which had come from America , and on his brother 's safety . He drank a toast at supper to Captain Warrington . " Our family is distinguishing itself cousin , " he said ; and added , looking with fond significance toward his Countess , " I hope the happiest days are in store for us all . " " Yes , George ! " says the little lady . " You 'll write and tell Harry that we are all very much pleased with him . This action at Quebec is a most glorious action ; and now we have turned the French king out of the country , should n't be at all surprised if we set up for ourselves in America . " " My love , you are talking treason , " cries Lord Castlewood . " I am talking reason , anyhow , my lord . I 've no notion of folks being kept down and treated as children forever ! " George ! Harry ! I protest I was almost as much astonished as amused . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conduct , his happiness will be complete , " I said , gravely . Next day , when talking beside her sofa , where she chose to lie in state , the little Countess no longer called her cousin " George , " but " Mr. George , " as before ; on which Mr. George laughingly said she had changed her language since the previous day . " Guess I did it to tease old Madam Buzwig , " says her ladyship . " She wants to treat me as a child , and do the grandmother over me . I do n't want no grandmothers , I do n't . I 'm the head of this house , and I intend to let her know it . And I 've brought her all the way from London in order to tell it her , too ! La ! how she did look when I called you George ! I might have called you George-only you had seen that little Theo first , and liked her best , I suppose . " " Yes , I suppose I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I like you because you tell the truth . Because you was the only one of em in London who did n't seem to care for my money , though I was downright mad and angry with you once , and with myself too , and with that little sweetheart of yours , who ai n't to be compared to me , I know she ai n't . " " Do n't let us make the comparison , then ! " I said , laughing . " I suppose people must lie on their beds as they make em , " says she , with a little sigh . " Dare say Miss Theo is very good , and you 'll marry her and go to Virginia , and be as dull as we are here . We were talking of Miss Lambert , my lord , and I was wishing my cousin joy . How is old Goody to-day ? What a supper she did eat last night and drink ! - drink like a dragoon ! No wonder she has got a headache , and keeps her room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You , too , may be feeble when you are old , and require rest and wine to warm you ! " says Mr. Warrington . " Hope I sha' n't be like her when I 'm old , anyho*v ! " says the lady . " Ca n't see *vhy lam to respect an old womna , because she hobbles on a stick , and has shaky hands , and false teeth ! " And the little heathen sank back on her conch , and showed twenty-four pearls of her own . " Law ! " she adds , after gazing at both her hearers through the curled lashes of her brilliant dark eyes . " How frightened you both look ! My lord has already given me ever so many sermons about old Goody . You are both afraid of her : and I ai n't , that 's all . Do n't look so scared at one another ! I ai n't a-going to bite her head off . We shall have a battle , and I intend to win . How did I serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanny , with their high and mighty airs , when they tried to put down the Countess of Castlewood in her own house , and laugh at the poor American girl ? We had a fight , and which got the best of it , pray ? Me and Goody will have another , and when it is over , you will see that we shall both be perfect friends When at this point of our conversation , the door opened and Madam Beatrix , elaborately dressed according to her wont , actually made her appearance , I , for my part , am not ashamed to own that I felt as great a panic as ever coward experienced . My lord , with his profoundest bows and blandest courtesies , greeted his aunt and led her to the fire , by which my lady ( who was already hoping for an heir to Castlewood ) lay reclining on her sofa . She did not attempt to rise , but smiled a greeting to her venerable // guest . And then , after a brief talk , in which she showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated with the most dastardly tremor , my lord said : " If we are to look for those pheasants , cousin , we had better go now . " " And I and aunt will have a cozy afternoon . And you will tell me about Castlewood in the old times ? Wo n't you , Baroness ? " says the new mistress of the mansion . 0 les ldches que les kommes I I was so frightened that I scarce saw any thing , but vaguely felt that Lady Castlewood 's dark eyes were following me . My lord gripped my arm in the corridor , we quickened our paces till our retreat became a disgraceful run . We did not breathe freely till we were in the open air in the courtyard , where the keepers and the dogs were waiting . And what happened ? I protest , children , I do n't know . But this is certain ; if your mother had been a woman of the least spirit , or had known how to scold for five minutes during as many consecutive days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more humble , henpecked wretch in Christendom than your father . When Parson Blake comes to dinner , do n't you see how , at a glance from his little wife , he puts his glass down and says , " No , thank you , Mr. Gumbo , " when old Gum brings him wine ? Blake wore a red coat before he took to black , and walked up Breeds Hill with a thousand bullets whistling round his ears , before ever he saw our Bunker Hill in Suffolk . And the fire-eater of the 43d now dare not face a glass of old port*vine ! T is his wife has subdued his courage . The women can master us , and did they know their own strength , were invincible . Well , then , what happened I know not on that disgraceful day of panic when your father fled the field , nor dared to see the heroines engage ; but when we returned from our shooting , the battle was over . America had revolted , and conquered the mother country . CHAPTER LXXIV . NEWS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the commencement of the new year , and after a fortnight 's absence ( which seemed like an age to the absurd and infatuated young man ) he returned to the side of his charmer . Madame de Bernstein was not sorry to leave the home of her father . She began to talk more freely as we got away from the place . What passed during that interview in which the battle royal between her and her niece occurred , she never revealed . But the old lady talked no more of forming cette petite , and , indeed , when she alluded to her , spoke in a nervous , laughing way , but without any hostility toward the young Countess . Her nephew Eugene , she said , was doomed to be henpecked for the rest of his days : that she saw clearly . A little order brought into the house would do it all the good possible . The little old vulgar American gentleman seemed to be a shrewd person , and would act advantageously as a steward . The Countess 's mother was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where , no doubt , she had beaten hemp in most of the jails ; but this news need not be carried to the town-crier ; and , after all , in respect to certain kind of people , what mattered what their birth was ? The young woman would be honest for her own sake now : was shrewd enough , and would learn English presently ; and the name to which she had a right was great enough to get her into any society . A grocer , a smuggler , a slave-dealer , what mattered Mr. Van den Bosch 's pursuit or previous profession ? The Countess of Castlewood could afford to be any body 's daughter , and as soon as my nephew produced her , says the old lady , it is our duty to stand by her . The ties of relationship binding Madame de Bernstein strongly to her nephew , Mr. Warrington hoped that she would be disposed to be equally affectionate to her niece ; and spoke of his visit to Mr. Hagan and his wife , for whom he entreated her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding Lady Maria ; begged that her name might never be mentioned , and immediately went on for two hours talking about no one else . She related a series of anecdotes regarding her niece , which , as this book lies open vi*qini6us puerisque to all the young people of the family , I shall not choose to record . But this I will say of the kind creature , that if she sinned , she was not the only sinner of the family ; // and if she repented , that others will do well to follow her example . Hagan , t is known after he left the stage , led an exemplary life , and was remarkable for elegance and eloquence in the pulpit . His lady adopted extreme views , but was greatlyrespected in the sectwhich she joined ; and when I saw her last , talked to me of possessing a peculiar spiritual illumination , which I strongly suspected at the time to be occasioned by the too free use of liquor ; but I remember when she and her husband were good to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many a Pharisee turned away . I have told how easy it was to rise and fall in my fickle aunt 's favor , and how each of us brothers , by turns , was embraced and neglected . My turn of glory had been after the success of my play . I was introduced to the town-wits ; held my place in their company tolerably well ; was pronounced to be pretty well-bred by the Macaronis and people of fashion , and might have run a career among them had my purse been long enough ; had I chose to follow that life ; had I not loved at that time a pair of kind eyes better than the brightest orbs of the Gunnings or Chudleighs , or all the painted beauties of the Ranelagh ring . Because I was fond of your mother , will it be believed , children , that my tastes were said to be low , and deplored by my genteel family ? So it was , and I know that my godly Lady Warrington and my worldly Madame Bernstein both laid their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , with his name , he might marry any body , " says meek Religion , who had ever one eye on heaven , and one on the main chance .

" " But if I had promised her , uncle ? " says I. " Promise , promise ! *these things are matters of arrangement and prudence , and demand a careful look-out . When you first committed yourself with little Miss Lambert , you had not seen the lovely Americ ' *n lady whom your mother wished you to marry , as a good mother naturally would . And your duty to your mother , nephew-your duty to the Fifth Commandment , would have warranted your breaking with Miss L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - What was the Countess 's Dutch name ? Never mind .

I tell the nabob so . We went from the House of Commons one dancing-day and saw them . T was beautiful to see the young things walking a minuet together ! It brought tears into my eyes , for I have a feeling heart , George , and I love my boy " But if I prefer Miss Lambert , uncle , with two-pence to her fortune , to the Countess , with her hundred thousand pounds ? " " Why then , Sir , you have a singular taste , that 's all , " says the old gentleman , turning on his heel and leaving me . And I could perfectly understand his vexation at my not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor did my Aunt Bernstein much like the engagement which I had made , or the family with which I passed so much of my time . Their simple ways wearied , and perhaps annoyed , the old woman of the world , and she no more relished their company than a certain person ( who is not so black as he is painted ) likes holy water . The old lady chafed at my forever dangling at my sweet-heart 's lap . Having risen mightily in her favor , I began to fall again : and once more Harry was the favorite , and his brother , Heaven knows , not jealous . He was now our family hero . He wrote us brief letters from the seat of war , where he was engaged , Madame Bernstein caring little at first about the letters or the writer , for they were simple , and the facts he narrated not over-interesting . We had early learned in London the news of the action on the glorious 1st of August at Minden , where Wolfe 's old regiment was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that famous day . At the same hour , the young General lay in his bed , in sight of Quebec , stricken down by fever , and perhaps rage and disappointment , at the check which his troops had just received . Arriving in the St. Lawrence in June , the fleet which brought Wolfe and his army had landed them on the last day of the month on the Island of Orleans , opposite which rises the great cliff of Quebec . After the great action in which his General fell , the dear brother who accompanied the chief wrote home to me one of his simple letters , describing his modest share in that glorious day , but added nothing to the many descriptions already wrote of the action of the 13th of September , save only I remember he wrote , from the testimony of a brother aid-dccamp who was by his side , that the General never spoke at all after receivinghis death-wound ; so that the phrase which has been put into the mouth of the dying hero may be considered as no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his position on the island , which lies in the great channel of the river to the north of the town , the General was ever hungrily on the lookout for a chance to meet and attack his enemy . Above the city and below it he landed-now here and now there ; he was bent upon attacking wherever he saw an opening . T was surely a prodigious fault on the part of the Marquis of Montcalm to accept a battle from Wolfe on equal terms , for the British General had no artillery , and when we had made our famous sealade of the heights , and were on the plains of // Abraham , we were a little nearer the city , certainly , but as far off as ever from being within it . The game that was played between the brave chiefs of those two gallant little armies , and which lasted from July until Mr. Wolfe won the crowning hazard in September , must have been as interesting a match as ever eager players engaged in . On the very first night after the landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . At midnight the French sent a flaming squadron of fire-ships down upon the British ships which were discharging their stores at Orleans . Our seamen thought it was good sport to tow the fire-ships clear of the fleet , and ground them on the shore where they burned out . As soon as the French commander heard that our ships had entered the river , he marched to Beauport in advance of the city and there took up a strong position . When our stores and hospitals were established , our General crossed over from his island to the left shore , and drew nearer to his enemy . He had the ships in the river behind him , but the whole country in face of him was in arms . The Indians in the forest seized our advanced parties as they strove to clear it , and murdered them in horrible tortures . The French were as savage as their Indian friends . The Montmorenci River rushed between Wolfe and the enemy . Ho could neither attack these nor the city behind them . Bent on seeing whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be assailable , the General passed round the town of Quebec and skirted the left shore beyond . Every where it was guarded , as well as in his immediate front , and having run the gauntlet of the batteries up and down the river , he returned to his post at Montmorenci . On the right of the French position , across the Montmorenci River , which was fordable at low tide , was a redoubt of the enemy . He would have that . Perhaps , to defend it , the French chief would be forced out from his lines , and a battle be brought on . Wolfe determined to play these odds . He would fetch over the body of his army from the Island of Orleans , and attack from the St. Lawrence . He would time his attack , so that , at shallow water , his lieutenants , Murray and Townsend , might cross the Montmorenci , and , at the last day of July , he played this desperate game . He first , and General Monckton , his second in command ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crossed over the St. Lawrence from their respective stations , being received with a storm of shot and artillery as they rowed to the shore . No sooner were the troops landed than they rushed at the French redoubt without order , were shot down before it in great numbers , and were obliged to fall back . At the preconcerted signal the troops on the other side of the Montmorenci advanced across the river in perfect order . The enemy even evacuated the redoubt , it is clear our dear scribe was not the author or and fell back to their lines ; but from these the secretary ) from his head-quarters at Montmoassailants were received with so severe a fire that renci Falls on the 2d day of September ; and on an impression on them was hopeless , and the the 14th of October following , the Rodney cutter General had to retreat . arrived with the sad news in England . The at That battle of Moutmorenci ( which my brother Harry and I have fought again many a time over our wine ) formed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached England , and plunged us all in gloom . What more might one expect of a commander so rash ? What disasters might one not foretell ? Was ever scheme so wild as to bring three great bodies of men , across broad rivers , in the face of murderous batteries , merely on the chance of inducing an enemy strongly intrenched and guarded to leave his position and come out and engage us ? T was the talk of the town . No wonder grave people shook their heads , and prophesied fresh disaster . The General , who took to his bed after this failure , shuddering with fever , was to live barely six weeks longer , and die immortal ! How is it , and by what , and whom , that Greatness is achieved ? Is Merit-is Madness the patron ? Is it Frolic or Fortune ? Is it Fate that awards successes and defeats ? Is it the Just Cause that ever wins ? How did the French gain Canada from the savage , and we from the French , and after which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We are always for implicating Heaven in our quarrels , and causing the gods to intervene whatever the nodes may be . Does Broughton , after pommeling and beating Slack , lift up a black eye to Jove and thank him for the victory ? And if ten thousand boxers are to be so heard , why not one ? And if Broughton is to be grateful , what is Slack to be ? " By the list of disabled officers ( many of whom are of rank ) you may perceive , Sir , that the army is much weakened . By the nature of this river the most formidable part of the armament is deprived of the power of acting , yet we have almost the whole force of Canada to oppose . In this situation there is such a choice of difficulties , that I own myself at a loss how to determine . The affairs of Great Britain , I know , require the most vigorous measures ; but then the courage of a handful of brave men should be exerted only where there is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have examined the town with a view to a general assault : and he would readily join in this or any other measure for the public service ; but I can not propose to him an undertaking of so dangerous a nature , and promising so little success I found myself so ill , and am still so weak , that I begged the general officers to consult together for the public utility . They are of opinion that they should try by conveying up a corps of 4000 or 5000 men ( which is nearly the whole strength of the army , after the points of Levi and Orleans are put in a proper state of defense ) to draw the enemy from their present position , and bring them to anaction . I have acquiesced in their proposal , and we are preparing to put it into execution . " So wrote the General ( of whose noble letters // tack had failed , the chief was sick , the army dwindling , the menaced city so strong that assault was almost impossible ; " the only chance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantage than attacking his intrenchments , and , if possible , to draw him from his present position . " Would the French chief , whose great military genius was known in Eur9pe , fall into such a snare ? No wonder there were pale looks in the City at the news , and doubt and gloom wheresoever it was known . Three days after this first melancholy intelligence came the famous letters announcing that wonderful consummation of Fortune with which Mr. Wolfe 's wonderful career ended . If no man is to be styled happy till his death , what shall we say of this one ? His end was so glorious that I protest not even his mother nor his mistress ought to have deplored it , or at any rate have wished him alive again . I know it is a hero we speak of ; and yet I vow I scarce know whether in the last act of his life I admire the result of genius , invention , and daring , or the boldness of a gambler winning surprising odds . Suppose his ascent discovered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been assuredly , beaten back ? Suppose the Marquis of Montonlm not to quit his intrenched lines to accept that strange challenge ? Suppose these points  --  and none of them depend upon Mr. Wolfe at all  --  and what becomes of the glory of the young hero , of the great minister who discovered him , of the intoxicated nation which rose up frantic with selfgratulation at the victory ? I say , what fate is it that shapes our ends , or those of nations ? In the many hazardous games which my Lord Chatham played , he won this prodigious one . And as the greedy British hand seized the Canadas , it let fall the United States out of its grasp . To be sure this wisdom d'apr*s coup is easy . We wonder at this man 's rashness now the deed is done , and marvel at the other 's fault . What generals some of us are upon paper ! what repartees come to our mind when the talk is finished ! and , the game over , how well we see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a distance of thirty years , t is not difficult now to criticise and find fault . But at the time when we first heard of Wolfe 's glorious deeds upon the plains of Abraham-of that army marshaled in darkness and carried silently up the midnight river-of those rocks scaled by the intrepid leader and his troops-of that miraculous security of the enemy , of his present acceptance of our challenge to battle , and of his defeat on the open plain by the sheer valor of his conqueror-we were all intoxicated in England by the news . The whole nation rose up and felt itself the stronger for Wolfe 's victory . Not merely all men engaged in the battle , but those at home who had condemned its rashness , felt themselves heroes . Our spirit rose as that of our enemy faltered . Friends embraced each other when they met . Coffee-houses and public places were thronged with people eager to talk the news . Courtiers rushed to the King and the great minister by whose wisdom the campaign had been decreed . When he showed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People did not deplore the dead warrior , but admired his euthanasia . Should James Wolfe 's friends weep and wear mourning , because a chariot had come from the skies to fetch him away ? Let them watch with wonder , and see him departing , radiant ; rising above us superior . To have a friend who had been near or about him was to be distinguished . Every soldier who fought with him was a hero . In our fond little circle I know t was a distinction to be Harry 's brother . We should not in the least wonder but that he , from his previous knowledge of the place , had found the way up the heights which the British army took , and pointed it out to his General . His promotion would follow as a matter of course . Why , even our uncle Warrington wrote letters to bless Heaven and congratulate me and himself upon the share Harry had had in the glorious achievement .

" If our boys could come by such deaths as James 's , you know you would n't prevent them from being shot , but would scale the Abraham heights to see the thing done ! Wouldst thou mind dying in the arms of victory , Charley ? " he asks of the little hero from the Chartreux . " That I would n't , " says the little man ; " and the doctor gave us a holiday , too .

As I think of that possibility the whole world is a blank . I do not say were we parted now . It has pleased God to give us tbirty years of union . We have reached the autumn season . Our successors are appointed and ready ; and that one of us who is first called away knows the survivor will follow ere long .

Every one of them sang the same song : and I saw the letters , and burned the whole cursed pack of them years afterward when my mother showed them to me at home in Virginia . Aunt Bernstein was forward with her advice . A young person , with no wonderful good looks , of no family , with no money-was ever such an imprudent connection , and ought it not for dear George 's sake to be broken off ? She had several eligible matches in view for me . With my name and prospects , t was a shame I should throw myself away on this young lady ; her sister ought to interpose  --  and so forth . My Lady Warrington must write , too , and in her peculiar manner . Her ladyship 's letter was garnished with Scripture texts . She dressed her worldliness out in phylacteries . She pointed out how I was living in an unworthy society of player-folks , and the like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion ( Heaven forbid ! ) , but who were deplorably worldly . She would not say an artful woman had inveigled me for her daughter , having in vain tried to captivate my younger brother . She was far from saying any harm of the young woman I had selected ; but at least this was certain , Miss L. had no fortune or expectations , and her parents might naturally be anxious to compromise me . She had taken counsel , etc. , etc . She had sought for guidance where it was , etc . Feeling what her duty was , she had determined to speak . Sir Miles , a man of excellent judgment in the affairs of this world ( though he knew and sought a better ) , fully agreed with her in opinion , nay , desired her to write , and entreat her sister to interfere , that the ill-advised match should not take place . And who besides must put a little finger into the pie but the new Countess of Castlewood ? She wrote a majestic letter to Madam Esmond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the Esmond family , it was her duty to communicate with her kinswoman , and warn her to break off this marriage . I believe the three women laid their heads together previously ; and , packet after packet , sent off their warnings to the Virginian lady . One raw April morning , as Corydon goes to pay his usual duty to Phillis , he finds , not his charmer with her dear smile as usual ready to welcome him , but Mrs. Lambert , with very red eyes , and the General as pale as death . " Read this , George Warrington ! " says he , as his wife 's head drops between her hands ; and he puts a letter before me , of which I recognized the handwriting . I can hear now the sobs of the good Aunt Lambert , and to this day the noise of fireirons stirring a fire in a room overhead gives me a tremor . I heard such a noise that day in the girls ' room where the sisters were together . Poor gentle child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , George , my poor boy ? " asks the General , pacing the room with desperation in his face . I did not quite read the whole of Madam Esmond 's letter , for a kind of sickness and faintness came over me ; but I fear I could say some of it now by heart . Its style was good , and its actual words temperate enough , though they only implied that Mr. and Mrs. Lambert had inveigled me into the marriage ; that they knew such a union was unworthy of n*e ; that ( as Madam E. understood ) they had desired a similar union for her younger son , which project , unluckily for him , perhaps , was given up when it was found that Mr. Henry Warrington was not the inheritor of the Virginian property . If Mr. Lambert was a man of spirit and honor , as he was represented to be , Madam Esmond scarcely supposed that , after her representations , he would persist in desiring this match . She would not lay commands upon her son , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lambert 's own reputation and comfort , she urged that the dissolution of the engagement should come from her family , and not from the just unwillingness of Rachel Esmond Warrington of Virginia . " God help us , George ! " the General said , " and give us all strength to bear this grief , and these charges which it has pleased your mother to bring ! They are bard , but they do n't matter now . What is of most importance , is to spare as much sorrow as we can to my poor girl . I know you love her so well , that you will help me and her mother to make the blow as tolerable as we may to that poor gentle heart .

I ca n't forgive ; not until my days of dotage come , and I cease remembering any thing . " Hal will be home for Easter ; he will bring two or three of his friends with him from Cambridge , " she says . And straightway she falls to devising schemes for amusing the boys . When is she ever occupied but with plans for making others happy ? A gentleman sitting in spectacles before an old ledger , and wrIting down pitiful remembrances of his own condition , is a quaint and ridiculous object . My corns hurt me , I know , but I suspect my neighbor 's shoes pinch him too . I am not going to howl much over my own grief , or enlarge at any great length on this one . Many another man , I dare say , has had the light of his day suddenly put out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to darkness and vague torture . I have a book I tried to read at this time of grief-Howel 's Letters  --  and when I come to the part about Prince Charles in Spain , up starts the whole tragedy alive again . I went to Brighthelmstone , and there , at the inn , had a room facing the east , and saw the sun get up ever so many mornings , after blank nights of wakefulness , and smoked my pipe of Virginia in his face . When I am in that place by chance , and see the sun rising now , I shake my fist at him , thinking , 0 orient Phmbus , what horrible grief au4 savage wrath have you not seen me suffer ! Though my wife is mine ever so long , I say I am angry just the same . Who dared , I want to know , to make us suffer so ? I was forbidden to see her . I kept my promise , and remained away from the house : that is , after that horrible meeting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her window , and watch the lamp burning there ; I would go to the Chartreux ( where I knew another boy ) , and call for her brother , and gorge him with cakes and half-crowns . I would meanly have her elder brother to dine , and almost kiss him when he went away . I used to breakfast at a coffeehouse in Whitehall , in order to see Lambert go to his office : and we would salute each other sadly , and pass on without speaking . Why did not the women come out ? They never did . They were practicing on her , and persuading her to try and forget me . Oh ! the weary , weary days ! Oh ! the maddening time ! At last a doctor 's chariot used to draw up before the General 's house every day . Was she ill ? I fear I was rather glad she was ill . My own suffering was so infernal that I greedily wanted her to share my pain . And would she not ? What grief of mine has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts ? What pain would it not suffer to spare mine a pang ? I sought that doctor out . I had an interview with him . I told my story , and laid bare my heart to him , with an outburst of passionate sincerity which won his sympathy . My confession enabled him to understand his young patient 's malady ; for which his drugs had no remedy or anodyne . I had promised not to see her , or go to her : I had kept my promise . I had promised to leave London : I had gone away . Twice , thrice I went back and told my sufferings to him . He would take my fee now and again , and always receive me kindly , and let me speak . Ah , how I clung to him ! I suspect he must have been unhappy once in his own life , he knew so well and gently how to succor the miserable . He did not tell me how dangerously , though he did not disguise from me how gravely and seriously , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing-that I would marry her , and brave every chance and danger ; that , without her , I was a man utterly wrecked and ruined , // and cared not what became of me . My mother had once consented , and had now chosen to withdraw her consent , when the tie between us had been , as I held , drawn so closely together , as to be paramount to all filial duty . " I think , Sir , if your mother heard you , and saw Miss Lambert , she would relent , " said the doctor . Who was my mother to hold me in bondage ; to claim a right of misery over me ; and to take this angel out of my arms ? " He could not , " he said , " be a message-carrier between young ladies who were pining and young lovers on whom the sweet-heart 's gates were shut ; but so much he would venture to say that he had seen me , and was prescribing for me , too . " Yes , he must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be sure , on the very day when he had kept his promise to me . He said she seemed to be comforted by hearing news of me . " She bears her suffering with an angelical sweetness . I prescribe Jesuit 's bark which she takes ; but I am not sure the hearing of you has not done more good than the medicine . " The women owned afterward that they had never told the General of the doctor 's new patient . I know not what wild expressions of gratitude I poured out to the good doctor for the comfort he brought me . His treatment was curing two unhappy sick persons . T was but a drop of water , tobesure ; but then a drop of water to a man raging in torment . I loved the ground he trod upon , blessed the hand that took mine , and had felt her pulse . I had a ring with a pretty cameo head of Hercules on it . T was too small for his finger , nor did the good old man wear such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in hopes that she might see it , and recognize that the token came from me . How I fastened upon Spencer at this time ( my friend of the Temple who also had an unfortunate lovematch ) , and walked with him from my apartments to the Temple , arid he back with me to Bedford Gardens , and our talk was forever about our women ! I dare say I told every body my grief . My good landlady and Betty the housemaid pitied me . My son Miles , who , for a wonder , has been reading in my MS. , says , " By Jove , Sir , I did n't know you and my mother were took in this kind of way . The year I joined I was hit v* bad myself . An infernal little jilt that threw me over for Sir Craven Oaks of our regiment . I thought I should have gone crazy . " And he gives a melancholy whistle , and walks away . The General had to leave London presently on one of his military inspections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given my word that I would not seek to present myself at his house , I kept it , availing myself , however , as you may be sure , of the good physician 's leave to visit him , and have news of his dear patient . His accounts of her were far from encouraging . " She does not rally , " he said . " We must get her back to Kent again , or to the sea . " I did not know then that the poor child had begged and prayed so piteously not to be moved , that her parents , divining , perhaps , the reason of her desire to linger in London , and feeling that it might be dangerous not to humor her , had yielded to her entreaty , and consented to remain in town . At last one morning I came , pretty much as usual , and took my place in my doctor 's frontparlor , whence his patients were called in their turn to his consulting-room . Here I remained , looking heedlessly over the books on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , which speedily emptied itself of all , save me and one lady who sate with her vail down . I used to stay till the last , for Osborn , the doctor 's man , knew my business , and that it was not my own illness I came for . When the room was empty of all save me and the lady , she puts out two little hands , cries in a voice which made me start , " Do n't you know me , George ? " And the next minute I have my arms round her , and kissed her as heartily as ever I kissed in my life , and gave way to a passionate outgush of emotion the most refreshing , for my parched soul had been in rage and torture for six weeks past , and this was a glimpse of heaven . Who was it , children ? You think it was your mother whom the doctor , had brought to me ? No . It was Hetty.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
