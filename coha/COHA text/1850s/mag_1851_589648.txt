Popular Portraits with Pen and Pencil . March , POPULAR PORTRAITS WITH PEN AND PENCILS LAWRENCE KEARNY , CAPTAIN U. S. NAVY . IT has always been a feature in* our magazine , to bring forward the portraits and biographical sketches of such individuals as have merited and won the esteem of their countrymen ; and we can not conceal our opinion , that such a course has been eminently advantageous to our readers , in giving them a concise and clear statement of the merits of men whose names have become " familiar to the ear as household words . " Men of talent , who have associated their names with deeds of greatness , and to whom popular attention has been attracted-men of genius who are toiling up- " The steep where Fame 's proud temple shines afar , " are pointed out in this portion of the Review , that their constituents and the world may perceive their merits , and encourage them in their efforts . For this purpose , we have not chosen any distinct class or party , but have selected our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have become worthy of distinction . True , the political party whose doctrines we espouse and maintain , has provided the greatest number of subjects ; but still , the army , the bench and the bar , have each been represented . Heretofore , the navy alone , of all our national institutions , has been glanced over ; but we propose to remedy this defect , by introducing to our readers with every opportunity , the names of such Naval Officers as have served their country with energy and ability . High on the list stands the subject of our present sketch , as will be demonstrated by the facts and circumstances we are about to detail . Lawrence Iearny was born at Perth Amboy , Middlesex county , New Jersey , on the 30th of November , 1789 . His father , Michael Kearny , was the fourth son of Philip Kearny , who died in 1775 . Michael Kearny married , in 1774 , Elizabeth Lawrence , the sister of the celebrated Captain Lawrence , who commanded the United States frigate Chesapeake , and who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . B. M. frigate Shannon . Mr. Kearny died in 1779 , having had eight sons , seven of whom survived him . The subject of the present sketch was the youngest child . Three of these children have been seamen . Michael , who sailed from New-York in 1799 , bound for the West Indies , and has never been heardfrorn ; James , who sailed from the West Indies in 1811 , and whose fate has been involved in like mystery ; and Lawrence , of whom we are now writing . Under these circumstances , it appeared a strange infatuation that led the latter to dare an element which had proved so unfortunate to two members of his family . As to this entrance into the navy , a motive may be found ; upon referring to that period , we find the date of his warrant is immediately after the unprovoked attack upon the Chesapeake , and the impressment of some of her crew . To this it may be supposed that some interest attached , for , to // say nothing of other great questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the British navy , and kept there four years , during the war with France . After a course of academic studies , Mr. Kearny , fired with the enthusiasm which was then excited by naval exploits , urged on by the fact of his brother 's impressment , and allured by the prospect of a speedy war with Great Britain , growing out of vexed questions , among which was the " right of search , " enrolled his name upon the navy list , and was en tered as a midshipman July 24th , 1807 . He was ordered to New-York , and joined the gun-boat No. 39 , in the flotilla under command of Commodore J. Rogers . In this capacity , and upon this station , he served during the " Non Intercourse " and " Embargo " difficulty . The " gun-boat " system was a kind of service , and a measure of government , in no wise calculated to inspire young officers with either pride or love of the service ; neither did it afford to elder officers a proportionate increase to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Tripoli , and that with France , had built up for them . It was the reverse of everything great and noble , and shed about as little credit on the country and her institutions for defence , as it did glory or renown upon the naval actors themselves , who , obnoxious to the commercial interests , hooted at in the streets , and scandalized and insulted by every one , could not do otherwise than conceive a distaste for a service unproductive of anything , except unmerited insult . The true defenders of a country are more than mere mercenary wretches ; they are actuated by higher principles , and soar to nobler purposes ; ever ready to shed their blood in their country 's service , they , naturally enough , - look for generous sympathy in return . But where , on the contrary , they reccive only insult and contumely , it is not to be wondered that they should lose the higher actuating principles , and seek to escape a servitude , contemptible , if not ignominious . It may be easily imagined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1809 , to join the Constitution frigate , then starting for a cruise along the coast , from which vessel he was transferred to the President frigate , in the same service . In 1810 , we find him on board the U. S. Schooner Enterprise , bound for New-Orleans , under command of B. F. Reed . The Enterprise sailed from New-York October 10th ; but , before she had been out many days , met with a heavy gale , and being dismasted and otherwise crippled , put into Norfolk in distress ; her officers and crew proceeded to Charleston in the Schooner Ploughboy , and , shortly afterwards , the former vessel , having been repaired , reached the same place under command of Lieut . Johnston Blakely . Mr. Kearny again joined this vessel , and remained in her , cruising upon the Southern station , until the winter of 1811 , when she returned to Washington , was hauled up and converted into a brig . In June , 1812 , under the command of Licut . Blakely , she sailed from Washington , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New-Orleans . It is a somewhat curious coincidence that , upon the 18th of June , 1812 , the very day on which war was declared against Great Britain , the Enterprise spoke the British frigate Southampton , and sloop of war Sappho , in the Gulf Stream , off the Bahama Islands . Mr. Kearny was then among her officers . Had this circumstance occurred a few days later , it is more than probable that the vessel would have been captured , and her officers , crew and passengers made prisoners of war . // However , to proceed , the vessel arrived safely at New-Orleans , but in August , 1812 , in a hurricane , she was thrown high and dry upon the Leve&amp; below the city ; after this , Mr. Kearny proceeded to St. Mary 's , Ga. , *nd thence upon leave to Washington , asking an appointment to the frigate Constitution , then being fitted for sea . This application was unsuc*essful , the vessel having her full complement of officers and men- but he Iras ordered to the command of the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , S. C. lmmediately upon his arrival at Charleston , Mr. Kearny assumed his first command . He was not destined to long inactivity , for he almost immediately started in pursuit of a British pri*ateer , ( the Brilliant , fifteen guns , ) off Bull 's Bay . While in pursuit of that vessel , he fell in with one of his majesty 's frigates , and , from being a pursuer , turned into a fugitive , and was chased into Port Royal , S. C. It was only by unceasing vigilance , and the appliance of an acute knowledge of navigation , that he escaped from his formidable enemy . Upon his arri*val at Charleston , Mr. Kearny was superseded in the command of the Caroline by Commander J. D. Henly , and ordered to the Schooner Ferret , of six or eight guns . In this vessel he cruised upon the southern coast , until February 2d , 1813 , when the Ferret fell in with two British Sloops of War , was chased into Stone Inlet , ran upon the bar at that place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaping . Mr. Kearny then took command of the Schooner Nonsuch , of fourteen guns . His cruise in this vessel was not of long duration . Her escape from one of the enemy 's frigates , the Lacedemonian , was somewhat miraculous . The chase was long ; occasionally , shot from the enemy 's bow guns passed by , and sometimes over , the Nonsuch ; but the latter vessel pursued her course directly towards the land , into shoal water , and near the breakers , where it was evident the frigat6 could not follow her . She had been lightened by throwing her battery into the sea , and thus enabled to approach nearer the shore . When the enemy was rapidly approaching , a heavy squall from the land , and the danger of too near an approach to the shoals , forced the frigate to tack , and taking advantage of this movement , the schooner escaped . In tacking , the frigate fired a parting broadside , in the hope of reaching the schooner ; but the squall had laid her over nearly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height that the shot passed over the schooner 's masthead , and fell harmless on the shore . Our subject , then a lieutenant commanding , under a commission dated March 6th , 1813 , was ordered by Commander John 1-I . Dent to command the flotilla of galleys and barges , in which service he continued until the close of the war , in 1815 . It was while in this position that his services assumed a greater degree of importance , and won for him a considerable distinction . It is a fact well known , that , during his connection with the squadron on the southern station , very little , if any , valuable goods were plundered by the enemy . Of course , we do not claim the entire merit of this for one officer , but we will not hesitate to assert , that Mr. Kearny was second to none in efficiency and vigilance . One particular instance of his gallantry we can not avoid mentioning , and abler hands than ours having already given it publicity , we take the liberty of extracting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1813 , while Captain Dent was at the North Edisto , he obtained information that a party of officers and men , belonging to the // IHebrus , ' Captain Palmer , was watering on one of the islands near the vicinity , and he directed Mr. Lawrence Kearny to proceed outside with three barges to cut them off , while a party of militia endeavored to assist them by land . The frigate was at anchor out of gun-shot ; but , as soon as she perceived the design of the Americans , she fired guns , and made other signals of recall , when two of the boats pulled towards her , and a tender that contained a strong party , attempted to pull out also . Fortunately , the wind shifted. , bringing the Hebrus to windward of the American barges , it is true , but the tender to leeward of them . Discovering his advantage , Mr. Kearny determined to make a dash at the latter , regardless of the frigate , and the two boats that were pulling off . The Hebrus , perceiving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest exertions to save her . Shots were fired at her own cutters to drive thent back to the assistance of the tender , and a third boat was sent from the frigate with the same object . She also opened he ! fire on the American barges with some effect , one of her shots taking off the head of a man at Mr. K6arny 's side . But this gallant officer , disregarding everything but his object , laid the tender close aboard in tho steadiest manner , and carried her off directly under the guns of the frigate to which she belonged . The Hebrus ' launch was also taken , the people having hurried aboard the tender when the alarm was given . rrhe latter had a carronade and six brass swivels in her , besides other arms . Mr. Kearny made about forty prisoners on this occasion . The Hebrus intercepting his return by the way he had come out , he carried his prize to the South Edisto . A few days later , Mr. Kearny , in the launch of the Hebrus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured a tender belonging to the Severn , having on board between thirty and forty men " Handsomer exploits of the sort were not performed during the war. *** " The services and professional character of Captain Kearny , who is still living , are much better known to the navy than to the country . This gentleman was put in situations of command and responsibility , soon after he entered the service , in 1807 ; and , while a lieutenant , he , probably , had commanded vessels longer than any captain on the list . He commanded the Enterprise many years , as a lieutenant , and , before he was made a master and commander , had passed about ten years in separate commands . In the Mediterranean , at * much later day , it was said of this officer , that his ship , the Warren , 20 , had done more to suppress piracy , than alt the other vessels , French , English , American , and Russian , united . Captain Kearny 's mother was a sister of the regretted Lawrence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the enterprise first mentioned was one of great difficulty and danger ; the close proximity of the frigate , and the superiority of numbers and armament in the enemy 's boats , were sufficient in themselves to have deterred many a young officer from the hazardous experim.ent , which , in this instance , terminated so successfully . In Niles ' Register , vol. vii. , p. 382 , for February 11 , 1815 , we find published a dispatch from Commander Dent to the Hon. Secretary of the Navy , giving an account of the same exploit . Having already extracted Mr. Cooper 's account , we will give only such portions of the dispatch as present facts not already mentioned . By the latter , it appear that the ' action took place on a Sunday afternoon , and Mr. Dent observes , " After a running fight of one hour and a-ha If , * and in the act of boarding , I had the satisfaction to see the tender surrender . " And also says , " Lieutenant Kearny , the officers and men engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor to their * James Fennimore Cooper 's Naval History , Vol . LI. , p. 276 , &amp;c. t Note , by the same anthor. // country and themselves . Although they had to continue so long under the fire of the frigate , nothing could divert them from their object . " The treaty of peace , which was declared February 15th , 1815 , restored quiet to the army and the navy , and put an end to a succession of brilliant victories , both by sea and land . The American navy , which , in the commencement of the war of 1812 , had been the butt for British ridicule , had become the most formidable opponent to her claim for supremacy upon the seas ; and the many actions which had taken place among them , the Constitution and Guerrierre , the Hornet and the Peacock , the Constitution and Java , and the same vessel with the Cyane and Levant , had given ample evidence that , if not her superior , we were at least her equal in naval skill and bravery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acknowledged this fact , and , were our limits sufficient , we would illustrate this assertion by copious extracts . Our limits will not allow us to follow Captain Kearny through his various commands ; it is sufficient to say that he was almost constantly in active service . As commander of the Brig Enterprise , he was engaged in the suppression of piracy in the West Indies ; it was through his efficiency that the gang of the notorious Gibbs , afterwards gibbetted at New-York , was broken up , some taken , and all dispersed . Every nook and corner of the islands was penetrated by his vessels , and nothing escaped his observation . The American Ships Aristides and Lucies , and the English ship Larch , which had been attacked and plundered by the pirates , were re-captured and restored to their owners . His services as commander of the Enterprise , covered a period of at least seven yearsequal to three ordinary cruises , and he won for himself golden honors in every quarter . Our rapid survey now brings us down to 1826 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Sloop of War Warren , and ordered to the Mediterranean . The Greeks , at that time rio longer controlled by the Turks , were committing constant deprcdations upon the Austrians , the allies of their old masters the Turks , and eventually upon the commerce of all nations . The triumphant success of this cruise is already a matter of history ; we have be&amp;re quoted the remark of Mr. Cooper , and his word is an authority that needs but little corroboration . The merchants of Smyrna , in an address to Mr. Kearny , acknowledged the obligation his active services had conferred upon them . XVhile in pursuit of the pirates , his habit was , during the day , to lay by under furled sails , and at anchor , but after nightfall to make sail , and directing his course to their rendezvous , fell upon them in their fancied security , at a moment when least expected . When in the Levant , in 1827 , he gave notice to the authorities of Miconi , that unless the American property plundered and deposited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were given up to him , he should bombard the town . There was no need in carrying out the threat to its full extent , for energetic measures of this nature seldom fail in producing their object . After a few guns had been fired , the plunder was restored , and the pirates given up . We find the following in the report of this cruise , now on file in the Navy Department " 25th . Off Milo , heard of the robbery of American brigs Rob Roy and Cherub ; same day chased a piratical ten gun brig belonging to Carabusa , and sunk her at the island of Argentiera , crew making their escape into the moun // tains ; cut away her masts , and stripping her of sails and rigging , left her under water . " 28th At Syra , found the Cherub , and to*k possession of her , &amp;c . Proceeded to Miconi , leaving the Cherub in possession of the Lexington ; on the 29th , between Tino and Miconi , fell in with the Austrian brig Silence-robbed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of the Lexington . " Nov. 1st . Came to in the harbor of Miconi , and on this and the succeeding day recovered some sails and property taken from the Cherub , and two cases of opium taken from the Rob Roy ; also , the sails and rigging of the brig Silence , before mentioned . Four men were brought off by the inhabitants , and one taken by us in the mountains , accused of piracy . Took possession of a boat belonging to the pirates living in the town , which we afterwards burnt . " The same report also contains a list of the prizes captured from the pirates , but we have not space to introduce it . It is sufficient to say that the pirates were dispersed , their strongholds broken up , and commerce , relieved of piratical depredations , was resumed with vigor , and carried on with success . " Subsequently , in 1839 , we find Capt . Kearny in command of the frigate United States , and , in 1840 , on board the frigate Potomac at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil , in command of this frigate , was appointed by the President of the United States to command the East India squadron , and the vessels , composing that squadron , viz. : the frigate Constellation ; and the sloop of war Boston , were sent to him at that place , with the orders of the department , in relation to the object of his cruise . Upon reference to these orders , we find the principal objects stated , the protection of American merehants and American commerce , as well as the suppression of opium smuggling under our flag . He raised his broad pennant in the harbor of Rio Janeiro ; and it may not be uninteresting to our readers to know that this was thefirst instance in our history where a broad pennant was raised on a foreign station . On the 9th of of March , 1841 , the Constellation and Boston sailed from Rio ; and upon arriving at the Cape of Good Hope , it was found that the standing rigging of the former vessel was very defective , and needed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 20th of July , the vessels made sail , and in August following arrived at Johanna , one of the Comoro Islands , under the dominion of King Selim . Upon his arrival , Commodore Kearny addressed a letter to that I ) otentate , thanking him , in the name of this Government , for his acts of kindness towards American traders , and stating , in reply to a request , that he should furnish him with arms and munitions of war , " that the United States , being at pence with all nations and allied to none , the Government does not permit its officers to interfere in foreign wars ; or , by furnishing arms and munitions of war , to strengthen the military power of one party to the injury of the other. ** The reply to this letter being very curious from several causes , we subjoin a translation of it , which we find in Senate Document l*9 , 29th Congress , 1st Session , from the original now on file . " MAssAMODO , ISLAND OF JORANNA , September , 1841 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , because I have been , and always Wish to be , useful to your nation . I do all in my power to aid your citizens who visit my harbors for health or refreshments , and Johanna itself , I tvish you to think , does not belong to myself only , but to you and your citizens . I have had a long unjust war with my uncle , which war has injured my people very mucl* and during that time , I lost the greatest part of my munitions of war ; and hope that , having always been useful to your citizens , you will have the nobility and generosity of heart to assist rue in my present unfortunate conditior. , by the aid of some powder , muskets and lead , that I may continue to shield my people who alone look to me for protection . Wishing yourself and your country all happiness , and that you may long continue in peace and prosperity with all the world , I remain your faithful friend . " // This remarkable epistle , which tenders to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not responded to by a seizure ; on the contrary , aLthough advantageous to our interests , the Commodore not only resisted the temptation , but absolutely refused the invitation . He continued his cruise , pausing at Q*allah Battoo and Singapore Roads , and about the 8th of April , 1842 , anchored at Macao Roads , from which place , on that date , he made his report to the Department . This report encloses a notice he had caused to be published , stating " that the United States Government does not sanction the smuggling of opium on this coast , under the American flag , in violation of . the laws of China . " From this fact , it appears that , after the suppression of " opium smuggling " under the British flag , our national standard had been used to cover the proscribed trade ; and great credit is due this officer for the prompt measures taken by him to suppress a desecration of our flag , and a violation of our national principles . This notice , accompanied by a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to the Imperial Court , and called forth an edict to the Hqng merchants from " Ke , Minor Guardian of the Heir Apparent , President of the Board of War , Governor of the provinces Kwangtung and Kwang-se , " requiring the merchants to make known that the Government entertained a high regard " towards men from afar , " that no suspicion ' existed of any sinister motives on the part of the newly arrived vessels of war , and recommending a trade , " &amp;c . Immediately upon the arrival of the squadron at Macao Roads , several American merchants addressed Commodore Kearny through Mr. Delano , in relation to grievances received , and desiring him to obtain redress for them . In this connexion , we may take occasion to observe the inefficiency of the consular establishment in China ; however competent and persevering a consul might be , he could command but little regard to his applications , unless * backed by a heavy man-of-war . " Observing this , the Commodore addressed a letter to the Secretary of State ( Daniel Webster ) , calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which letter is now on file in the State Department . Upon receiving the letters we have mentioned , he inquired into their merits and determined upon bringing them before the Imperial Government . Another thing attracted his attention , a treaty was about being made between the Chinese and the British , and it was feared that , unless strictly guarded , our commercial interests might suf1i*r . Upon all previous occasions , communications to the government were made through the Hong Merchants , and every effort to procure satisfaction had proved fruitless . These wily merchants had either entirely suppressed the letters entrusted to them , or had represented them in such a manner as to give an unfavorable impression ; the motives for their doing so were plainly apparent ; they well knew that if damages were adjudged to aggrieved parties , the amount must come out of their treasuries . Before any communication was made , the Constellation proceeded to Whampoa , and , upon his arrival there , the Commodore despatched Licut . J. G. Reynolds , accompanied by Dr. Parker , a resident of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the commercial interests of the United States should receive consideration , and " their citizens , in that matter , be placed upon the same footing as the merchants of the nation most favored . " Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining ac // cess to the government officers , but the letter was at length placed in the hands of an officer of the rank of colonel . To this letter the following reply was received : " To Commodore Kearny , &amp;j'c. : " Ke , Guardian of the young prince , member of the Board of War , member of the Imperial Cabinet , and Governor of the two Kwang Provinces , states , in reply to the subject of the 10th of the 9th month , ( 13th October , ) that I have received your polite communication relating to the English commerce . I , the Governor , have ever hitherto treated the merchants of every nation with the same kindness . Moreover , the Americans who have come to Canton , have had free commerce , month after month , and year after year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other nation ; and that they have been respectfully observant of the laws , is what the august Emperor has clearly recognized , and I , the Governor , also well know . How , then , should I not rather on the cessation of difficulties with the English , wish to show favor to them ? " Now , I have ordered the Hong Merchants , with the said English nation 's merchants , to devise beforehand , and to wait the arrival , in Canton , of the Imperial Commissioners , Great Ministers of State . When I shall have received the newly-devised regulations concerning the free trade of the English , then I , the Governor , together with the Lieutenant-Governor and Tartar-General , will immediately deliberate upon the proper adjustment of the regulations , and will make a representation to the Emperor , that he may hear and direct what shall be done . " Decidedly it shall not he permitted that the American merchants shall come merely to have a dry stick , ( that is , their interests shall be attended to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed than to look up to the heart of the great Emperor , in his compassionate regard towards men from afar , that Chinese and foreigners , with faith and justice , may be mutually united , and for ever enjoy'reciprocal tranquillity ; and that it may be granted to each of the resident merchants to obtain profit , and to the people to enjoy life and peace ; and universally to participate in the blessings of great prosperity , striving to have the same mind . " This is my reply . " Communication was also made in regard to the claims of the merchants , who had addressed Commodore Keariy , in relation to grievances they had suffered , and losses they had sustained . The manner of sending these letters to the governor created quite a consternation among the Hong Merchants , who endeavored to re-open the former channel of communication-through their own hands ; but the impropriety of that system had been discovered , and was thereafter discarded . This last letter , it will be perceived , gave the promise of *t speedy treaty , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and place us in the same commercial position about to be enjoyed by Gient Britain . At a period a few months later , the same subject was resumed , and a still more positive promise given ; this second promise was not called forth by any new request , but was made a portion of a letter in reply to one regarding reparation for injuries sustained by Augustine , Heard &amp; Co. , American merchants . It will speak for itself . " On a former occasion , the Governor received your honor the Commodore 's communication , requesting him , in his behalf , to solicit the favor of the august emperor , to allow merchants of his honorable nation to trade upon the same terms // as those granted to merchants of other nations , ' &amp;c . As in duty bound , the Governor , having already addressed the emperor clearly upon the subject , waited the corning of the High Commissioners at Canton , where they were in concert to attend to the foreign relations ; but the Tartar General , Eleepie , having arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , most unfortunately , on account of disease , he went out of office ' ( i. e. deceased ) , so that whatever may be just and equal in the trade of each nation remains unsettled . It is , therefore , necessary to wait the arrival of his successor ; and when some plan is adopted , then a personal interview may be held with your honor the Commodore , and face to face , the relations between the two countries may be arranged , and the same be reported to the Emperor . This is my reply . " A reply was sent to this letter , stating that the Commodore had not power to negotiate a treaty with the Chinese , but that he should transmit their communication upon that subject to his Government for their action , and that they . might appoint some officer who would have full power to enter into the proposed treaty . And further stating , that the Governor was mistaken in supposing him to be asking a favor , for that he was , on the contrary , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , during which we need note little else , except the capture of the Arid , a noted opium smuggler under the American flag , and other prompt measures to suppress that illicit traffic , and a trifling correspondence , which may be found on the files of the Navy Department ( also partly published in the Senate Document already referred to ) , Commodore Kearny sailed from Macao , and , in June , 1843 , arrived at Honolula , Oahu , Sandwich Islands . Here a correspondence took place between Kamehameha III. , the King , and the Commodore . It appears that the former , under pressure of adverse circumstances , and to discharge certain large demands upon him , had made a provi.sional cession , under protest , of his dominions , to Capt . Lord George Paulet of H. B. M. ship Carysfort , and that no provision had been made respect* ing the rights and interests of the United States , or her merchants . Upon receiving this information , Commodore Kearny dispatched to his Majesty Kamehameha , and to Capt . Lord George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notifying them that he would hold them respectively liable for all injuries to American merchants and American commerce . The King replied to this protest , stating the circumstances under which the cession had been made , and expressing a belief that his dominions would very shortly be restored to him . On the day succeeding to this reply , the principal American merchants at Honolula , hearing that the Commodore intended continuing his cruise , united in an address , begging him to remain until the affairs of the islands should assume a more settled aspect , or until the arrival of other United States ships of war , " that may be adequate to the maintenance of those interests which the Government of the United States is disposed to cherish and maintain . " To gratify as far as possible the wishes of his countrymen , he remained at Honolula for some time , but the period for which his crew had been engaged was fast expiring , and before any definite settlement had been made , left the islands ; after touching at Monterey , he arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The engagement of his crew expired May 1st , the next morning . Since this time , he has been waiting orders . // Not to interrupt our narrative , we omitted stating that in January , 1835 , Captain Kearny was married to Miss Josephine Hall , of NewYork , a lady highly esteemed for the elegance of her personal attractions , and the accomplishments of her mind . By this marriage he has had one son , named James Lawrence Kearny , after his uncle , Captain Lawrence . Mrs. Kearny died in 1849 . It can not be expected that in this hasty sketch we should have given full justice to the subject of it ; in truth we have passed over many years with few words , and left unnoticed many glorious actions ; but we have faithfully endeavored to make the best use of our space , and to point out those circumstances which have been attended with results beneficial to the general interests of our country ; as , for instance , his long defence of the southern coast against the plundering expeditions of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pirates both in the West Indies and the Mediterranean , and his prominent services in opening an intercourse with the Chinese government-an intercourse which has since become matured , and is daily adding wealth to our merchants , and to our revenue . There is not now in the United States Navy any officer who has seen a greater amount of sect service than Captain Kearny ; upon reference to the Navy Register for 1850 , we find that during forty-two years connection with the navy , he has been twenty-four years and three months in service upon the seas . The service of Captain John Downes is placed at exactly the same length of time ; and upon further reference , we find that the nearest approach to either of these is Captain Wadsworth , who has seen twenty-four years of sea service . Both of these last named entered the service several years previous to Mr. Kearny . Thus the services of this gentleman have extended over the greatest portion of the last half century , and we are happy to say , he is still as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essayed to describe , should an opportunity for like exploits occur . In person , Captain Kearny is of medium height and heavily built ; for his countenance we refer our readers to the excellent portrait which accompanies this sketch ; it is open , *enerous , and intelligent , still it bears unmistakable impress of force of character and energy of mind . His manners are affable and easy , always heightened by good humor and mirthfulness , or , to give a still more easily recognised description , he is a " gentleman of the old school , " untouched by the desecrating foppery and self-conceit which forms so great a part in the characters of most gentlemen of the present day . Still in the prime of life , enjoying excellent health , and possessing a reputation for upright integrity , unflinching courage , and consummate ability , the like of which has fallen to the lot of but few , we can not believe that hL services have ended ; we still expect to find his name mingled with great actions , which shall confer upon himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country more endurable honors , and increased prosperity .
