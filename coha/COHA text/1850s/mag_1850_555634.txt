txt ART . V. - The Ways of the Hour ; a Tale . By J. FENIMORE COOPER , Author of " The Spy , " " The Red Rover , " &amp;c . New York : George P. Putnam. 1850 . L2mo. pp . SF2 . MR . COOPER as a novelist is but the ghost of his former self . He committed literary suicide at least ten years ago ; and the volume now before us , though it bears his name , certainly affords no proof of his resurrection , or the restoration of his facplties . We are provoked enough to doubt tile asseveration of the title page ; The Ways of the Hour is not written by the author of The Spy ; it is a lame and impotent caricature of that author 's manner , exhibiting and exaggerating all his faults , but showing none of his excellencies , and not animated by one spark of his genius . With some glaring defects of manner , with ill-jointed and most improbable plots , feeble delineations of character , and an abundance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed so many striking merits , as fairly to earn for him , for a while , the title of the American novelist . His strength consisted chiefly in his descriptive power and his skill as a narrator . Many of the scenes and incidents created an interest hat was almost painful . The escape of the pedler spy with a squadron of Virginia light-horsemen at his heels , the chase of an American frigate by an English squadron , the wreck of // the Ariel , the defence of the island at Glenn 's Falls against a troop of savages , and the battles of Lexington and Bunker 's Hill as witnessed by Lionel Lincoln , are passages almost unmatched for power , vivacity , and scenic effect , by any novelist except Scott . The remainder of the story through which these fine sketches were distributed was generally a curious piece of patchwork , the best quality of which was negative ; it did not avert the reader 's attention from the incidents , and land or sea views , which alone were worthy of it . Characters supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interminable conversations with each other about nothing at all ; these were necessary , indeed , for the progress of the story , but they were none the less incumbrances .. Mr. Cooper never invented but two probable and interesting characters in his life , - Long Tom Coffin and the Leatherstocking ; and the latter of these , as if to show how much the writer was delighted with his success , was made to figure in about six different novels , at as many stages of his supposed life . This poverty of invention in character , and the almost total want of humor and pathos , are the probable causes why even the most successful productions of our author would seldom bear a second reading . They were commonly laid aside after the first perusal , with a feeling that the whole stock of amusement which they could afford had been exhausted . Mr. Cooper 's literary existence properly terminated with the publication of The Monikins , a novel of which it is not possible to say much , as we have never read it , and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of a lamentable series of fictions , the scenes of which were supposed to take place on European ground , and to embody the results of the author 's observation while abroad . The good-natured and much-enduring public , slow to forget an old favorite , read them all through in the vain hope of finding somewhere a touch of the author 's unrivalled power of description . But the first individual , who made the same benevolent attempt upon The Monikins , dislocated his jaws before completing the second chapter ; and no one has dared to repeat the experiment . Of the novels which have come after it , amounting on the average to at least one in each year , it is enough to say that they are written by a shade of Mr. Cooper , who represents very fairly his bad taste , his garrulity , and his // prejudices , but bears no likeness of his manlier features . Many of them are not novels , or romantic fictions , in the proper sense of the term , but tedious arguments , or querulous pleas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the imaginary slights or wrongs which the author has suffered . He has had the misfortune , apparently , to quarrel with the world , or with that small portion of the world with whom the location of his property brings him immediately in contact . He has thought proper to carry on this war with his own peculiar weapons , by publishing a series of stories , which appear to be very bitter village satires . P. P. , clerk of our parish , has seemingly quarrelled with the minister , the doctor , the lawyer , and the representative to Congress ; and he seeks to gain his revenge by gibbeting them all in print . But he has succeeded in manifesting his purpose , much more than his power , to wound ; he has shown bad policy , bad temper , and bad taste . If his satirical strokes are really directed against individuals , as they appear to be , the intended victims are shielded from harm by their own insignificance . The world at large does not know , and can not know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. is pilloried under the appellation of Saucy Williams , or that Mrs. Pope represents the garrulous and silly busybody , Mrs. C. These worthy individuals are no more personalities in the world 's eye than so many letters of the alphabet . We would not do Mr. Cooper any injustice . We know nothing of the grounds of his dispute with his neighbors , nothing of the causes which have brought upon him the enmity of many newspaper editors , or have involved him in a long succession of lawsuits . It is even possible that he has not alluded to these personal matters in his rece9t novels , but that the ill-favored pictures in them are only types of a class , not portm'aits of individuals . If so , our ground of censure is only shifted , not taken away . If he has not quarrelled with a particular society , he has quarrelled with all North America ; if these sketches are not libels upon individuals , they are libels upon his countrymen at large . They are ebullitions of ill nature , petulant manifestations of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like our American works and ways . But he can not censure them in the spirit of a philosopher or a humorist ; he can only croak and // growl . Consequently , his sketches of character abound in marks of had temper and savage exaggeration , without being enlivened by a single stroke of wit or playful fancy , or evincing any power of grotesque and humorous combination . Hence , they appear , as we have said , like personal satires or libels ; their aspect is neither truthful nor complaisant . They are not imaginative portraitures of American life in general , but sour caricatures , it matters not whether of persons or classes . It is no unusual thing for a writer to lose both his fancy and his humor , when he loses his temper . Dickens is an eminent instance . In general , he is very good-humored ; he laughs at the follies , prejudices , and vices of his countrymen , and thereby does much to amuse , and something to amend them . His caricatures , when most severe , are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were drawn from the life , the victims themselves would be compelled to laugh . Mr. Squeers , the brutal and ignorant schoolmaster , Mr. PecksniW the quintessence of hypocrisy and selfishness , appear so comical from the very exaggeration of their evil qualities , that the reader can not find it in his heart to hate them ; he even conceives a sneaking kindness for these scamps , and heartily wishes their reformation . But Mr. Dickens had the misfortune to quarrel with the people of this country , or perhaps we should say , that our countrymen had the misfortune to incur his displeasure , because at first they very foolishly made an idol of him , and then , when he asked them to give him solid pudding in place of empty praise , by passing a law of international copyright , which would have added many thousands a year to his income , they rather gruffly refused , and some of the newspapers even began to abuse him . Mr. Dickens went home in a towering rage , and forthwith wrote a novel for the express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most ardent admirers will hardly deny , that the American chapters in Martin Chuzzlewit are the feeblest portion of the book , that they are both spiteful and dull . The writer 's genius deserts him here , because he is more intent upon wreaking his anger , than upon gratifying his love of the ludicrous . Mr. Jefferson Brick , the New York editor , Mrs. Parkins 's boarding house , Col. Thompson , and Eden , the frontier settlement , are dull and gross caricatures . They have a foundation in truth ; they probably come quite as near to real // life as do most of the writer 's English sketches ; but they are conceived in a spirit so bitter and resentful , that Momus himself could hardly laugh at them . They are excrescences upon the story , the progress of which is impeded by their presence ; and the reader can not avoid execrating the unlucky chance that induced either Martin Chuzzlewit or Mr. Dickens ever to cross the Atlantic . Most of the characters intended to be humorous or satirical in Mr. Cooper 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent novels , may be classed with the very feeblest of Mr. Dickens 's American creations They are coarse and spiteful caricatures , not relieved by a single ray of wit or fancy , neither humorous nor grotesque , but stiW sprawling , and unnatural , like the figures which children cut out of card paper . A rude likeness can faintly be distinguished in them , just as the awkward semblance of two legs , two arms , and a head , on one of these card figures , proves that it was intended to represent a man . Mr. Cooper 's style is so prosy and diffuse that we can with difficulty find a passage short enough to he transferred to our pages , which shall at the same time show the justice of our criticisms . But a portion of the following conversation between Squire Dunscomh and Squire Tiinms may serve to show what opinion our author entertains of American lawyers , American courts of justice , and American newspapers . " Take a seat , Mr. Timms , " said Dunscomb , motioning to a chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erately proceeded to light a cigar , not without pressing several with a species of intelligent tenderness , between his thumb and finger . " Take a seat , sir ; and take a cigar . " Here occurred the great tour de force in manners of Squire Timms . Considerately turning his person quartering towards his host , and seizing himself by the nose , much as if he had a quarrel with that member of his face , he blowed a blast that sounded sonorously , and which fulfilled all that it promised . Now a better mannered man than Dunscomb it would not be easy to find . He was not particularly distinguished for elegance of deportment , but he was perfectly well.bred . Nevertheless , he did not flinch before this broad hint from vulgarity , but stood it unmoved . To own the truth , so large has been the inroad from the base of society , within the last five.and.twenty years , on the habits of those who once exclusively dwelt together , that he had got hardened even 11 * // to this innovation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we intend never to touch upon the subject again , we shall say distinctly that Mr. Tirnms blowed his nose with his fingers , and that , in so doing , he did not innovate one half as much , to-day , on the usages of the Upper Ten Thousand , as he would have done had he bloxved his nose with his thumb only , a quarter of a century since . Dunscomb bore this infliction philosophically ; and well he might , for there was no remedy . Waiting for Timms to use his handkerchief , which was produced somewhat tardily for such an operation , he quietly opened the subject of their interview . " So the grand jury has actually found a bill for murder and nrson , my nephew writes me , " Dunscomb observed , looking inquiringly at his companion , as if really anxious for further intelligence . " Unanimously , they tell me , Mr. Dunscomb , " answered Timms . " I understand that only one man hesitated , and he was brought round before they came into court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . " " Money saves more cases than it damns , Timms ; and no one knows it better than yourself . " " Very true , sir . Money may defy even the new code . Give me five hundred dollars , and change the proceedings to a civil action , and I 'll carry any thing in my own county that you 'll put on the calendar , barring some twenty or thirty jurors I could name . rPl*ere are about thirty men in the county that I can do nothing with - for that matter , whom I dare not approach . " " flow the deuce is it , Timms , that you manage your causes with so much success ? for I remember you have given me a good deal of trouble in suits in which law and fact were both clearly enough on my side . " " I suppose those must have been causes in which we horseshedded ' and pillowed ' a good deal . " " Horse-shedded and pillowed ! Those are legal terms of which I have no knowledge ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country customs , too , for that matter . A man might practise a long life in town , and know nothing about them . The Halls of Justice are not immaculate but they can tell us nothing of horse-shedding and pillowing . They do business in a way of which we in the country are just as ignorant as you are of our mode . " " Have the goodness , Timms , just to explain the meaning of your terms , which are quite new to me . I will not swear they are not in the Code of Practice , but they are in neither Blackstone nor Kent . " // Horse-shedding , Squire Dunscomb , explains itself . In the country , most of the jurors , witnesses , &amp;c. , have more or less to do with the horse-sheds , if it s only to see that their heasts are fed . Well , we keep proper talkers there , and it must he a knotty case , indeed , into which an ingenious hand can not thrust a doubt or an argument . To he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits summed up under a horse-shed in one day ; and twice as many opened . " " But how is this done ? - do you present your arguments directly , as in court ? " Lord bless you , no . In court unless the jury happen to be unusually excellent , counsel have to pay some little regard to the testimony and the law ; but , in horse-shedding , one has no need of either . A skilful horse-shedder , for instance , will talk a party to pieces , and not say a word about the case . That s the perfection of the business . It s against the law , you know , Mr. Dunscomb , to talk of a case before a juror - an indictable offence - but one may make a case of a party 's general character , of his means , his miserly qualities , or his aristocracy ; and it will be hard to get hold of the talker for any of them qualities . Aristocracy , of late years , is a capital argument , and will suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can bring . Only persuade the jury that the plaintiff or defendant fancies himself better than they are , and the verdict is certain . I got a thousand dollars in the Springer case , solely on that ground . Aristocracy did it ! It is going to do us a great deal of harm in this murder and arson indictment . " " It is wonderful , Squire , how many persons see the loose side of democracy , who have no notion of the tight ! But , all this time , our client is in gaol at Biberry , and must be tried next week . Has nothing been done , Squire , to choke off the newspapers , who have something to say about her almost every day . it s quite time the other side should be heard . " " It is very extraordinary that the persons who control these papers should be so indifferent to the rights of others as to allow such paragraphs to find a place in their columns . " " Indifferent ! What do they care , so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rather suspect that a certain reporter has taken offence ; and when men of that class get offended , look out for news of the color of their anger . Is n't it wonderful , Squire Dunscomb , that the people do n't see and feel that they are sustaining low tyrants , in two thirds of their silly clamor about the liberty of the p*ress ? " " Many do see it ; and I think this engine has lost a great deal // of its influence within the last few years . As respects proceedings in the courts , there never will be any true liberty in the country , until the newspapers are bound hand and foot . " " You are right enough in one thing , Squire , and that is in the ground the press has lost . It has pretty much used itself up in Duke 's ; and I would pillow and horse-shed a cause through against it , the best day it ever saw ! " " By the way , Timms , you have not explained the pillowing process to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do that , sir . You know how it is in the country . Half a dozen beds are put in the same room , and two in a bed . Waal , imagine three or four jurors in one of these rooms , and two chaps along with em , with instructions how to talk . The conversation is the most innocent and nat'ral in the world ; not a word too much or too little ; but it sticks like a bur . The juror is a plain , simple-minded countryman , and swallows all that his room-mates say , and goes into the box next day in a beautiful frame of mind to listen to reason and evidence ! No , no ; give me two or three of these pillow-counsellors , and I 11 undo all that the journals can do , in a single conversation . You 11 remember , Squire , that we get the last word by this system ; and if the first blow is half the battle in war , the last word is another half in the law . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by jury . " " All this is very wrong , Timms . For a long time I have known that you have exercised an extraordinary influence over the jurors of Duke 's ; but this is the first occasion on which you have been frank enough to reveal the process . " This extract shows very clearly what was Mr. Cooper 's purpose in writing the whole book . It was not his object simply to amuse his readers by an entertaining fiction . He wished to write a dissertation on the American mode of rendering justice in a court of law ; and because he doubted his powers of obtaining an audience , or finding readers , if he pursued this purpose in a straightforward way , by writing an avowed essay upon the subject , he concocts a story , and invents characters , with especial reference to this end , and attempts to smuggle in truth , or what he considers as truth , under the garb of fiction . He says explicitly in his preface , " the object of this book is to draw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that beset us ; more particularly , in connection with the administration of criminal justice . " The book , accordingly , is a hybrid ; a portion of it is to be judged // upon the principles of criticism which are applicable to the composition of prose fiction ; the remainder is to be tried by the force of the arguments alleged against the practice of trial by jury in a democracy . Objections urged against it in the former respect may be answered by the plea , that it is avowedly argumentative and discursive in character ; that it is not a novel , but an essay . If its egregious misstatements and exaggerations are exposed , the answer is ready , that it is a work of imagination , not of fact . We admit the justice of both allegations ; we have shown that it is prosaic and dull as a fiction , and we proceed to show that it is imaginative and unfounded in its statements of fact . The plot of the novel is awkward and improbable enough ; but as it is the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury , we must endeavor to give an abstract of it . A house in the village of Biberry , New York , inhabited by an aged and childless couple of the name of Goodwin , takes fire in the night-time , is burned to the ground , and , as is supposed , the two old folks lose their lives in the flames . The charred remains of two human beings are found in the ruins , and though so much injured that the sex can not be distinguished , are finally pronounced to be the corpses of old Peter Goodwin and his wife . The skulls of both are fractured ; and as they were side by side when found , and the fracture was of the same character and in the same part of the head in the two cases , it is concluded that they were both murdered by one blow , and that the house was then set on fire to conceal the crime . Suspicion falls upon a mysterious young woman , known only under the evidently assumed name of Mary Monson , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boarder , and who was with difficulty rescued on the night of the fire . She is beautiful and accomplished , and it soon appears , moreover , that she is very rich , or at least , that she has almost an unlimited command of money for present exi* , encies ; yet she refuses to communicate to any one her real name , her previous history , or her motives for coming to Biberry . The possession of such advantages , and her refusal to gratify the impertinent curiosity of the villagers , creates a strong prejudice against her , which is strengthened by one really suspicious circumstance . Mrs. Goodwin was a miser , who kept a private hoard of gold in an old stocking , // which was usually deposited in the drawer of a bureau , though her vanity induced her often to take it out , and make a show of it to the wondering gossips , ber neighbors . This bureau was saved from the flames , and when its drawers were opened before the coroner 's jury , the stocking with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present as a witness before the coroner ; and , as she was known to have a considerable sum in gold in her possession , she was desired to produce her purse for inspection . After this purse had been passed from hand to hand among all the persons in the room , the coroner finds in it a foreign gold coin , somewhat peculiar in appearance , and notched on the edge , which two of the witnesses present swear they had recently seen among the other contents of Mrs. Goodwin 's old stocking . Mary Monson is then committed to jail on a triple charge of robbery , murder , and arson . Dr. McBrain , a benevolent and acute physician of the city of New York , who was present at the coroner* s examination , and had timidly expressed his doubt whether the two skeletons produced could he those of Peter Goodwin and his wife , inasmuch as he thought they were both the remains of females , is struck with the gentle and lady-like manner of the accused , with her friendlessness , the evident prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which she was arrested . He interests his friend Tom Dunscomb , the great New York counsellor , in her favor ; and the latter generously takes charge of her defence without a fee . But the demand upon his charity does not seem to be very urgent , as the lady gives an extravagant fee to Timms , a greedy and selfish pettifogger , who is employed by her as junior counsel , and also expends large sums , at his instigation , in trying through paid agents to turn the tide of public sympathy against the prosecution . Dunscomb is an eccentric old bachelor , and a profound lawyer , who finds his chief amusement in grumbling at all the innovations which the State of New York has recently made in the practice of her courts , and in laughing at his friend Dr. McBrain for marrying a third wife . A nephew and niece of Dunscomb , and a daughter-in-law of the physician , also appear on the stage ; but as they have nothing to do but to talk , and their presence does not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say no more about them . // The conduct of Mary iVionson becomes more and more mysterious . Though imprisoned on a capital charge , she contrives to enjoy most of the corpforts and luxuries of life her cell is carpeted , and furnished with a harp and other rich articles ; and as she has obtained hy money a set of false keys , she leaves the prison whenever she pleases at night , always taking care to return to it before morning . Her chief pleasure seems to consist in arranging with Lawyer Timms , for whom she has a hearty contempt , though he is in love with her , a set of maneuvres designed to operate on public opinion respecting her case , as an offset to those which are unscrupulously practised by the prosecution . Her trial at length comes on , and after proceedings which are detailed at length , and most of which are in defiance of the first principles of law and the ordinary rules of criminal proceedings , she is found guilty and sentenced to death for the murder of Peter Goodwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her than what we have already related , and " the great la*vyer , " Dunscomb , shows himself a ninny and an ignoramus in the conduct of her cause . Just after her sentence is pronounced , Peter Goodwin makes his appearance in court alive and hearty , to the great astonishment of the jury and of his old acquaintances . Mary Monson has known of his existence all the while , and by means of her agents has kept him secreted by keeping him half drunk , in order that she rriight have the glory of being falsely convicted of murder and arson , and thereby proving the imbecility of American courts of law . It is further made to appear , that no crime at all had been committed , except that of larceny by Mrs. Burton , a witness for the government , who had stolen the stocking with its * , olden contents just after the bureau was removed from the burning house . The fact also comes to light that Mary Monson is insane , and so not responsible for any act , though her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the management of her trial , - qualities in which she certainly beats the great lawyer Dunscomb all hollow . " The fire was accidental , as has been recently ascertained by circumstances it is unnecessary to relate . Goodwin had left his wife , the night before the accident , and she had taken the German woman to sleep with her . As the garret-floor above this pair was consumed , the plough fell , its share inflicting the blow // which stunned them , if it did not inflict even a greater injury . That part of the house was first consumed , and the skeletons were found , as has been related , side by side . In the confusion of the scene , Sarah Burton had utile difficulty in opening the drawer , and removing the stocking . She fancied herself unseen ; hut Mary Monson observed the movement , though she had then no idea what was abstracted . The unfortunate delinquent maintains that her intention , at the time , was good ; or , that her sole object was to secure the gold ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treasure gradually excited her cupidity , until she hegan to hope that this hoard might eventually become her own . The guilty soonest suspect guilt . As to " the pure , all things are pure , " so it is with the innocent , who are the least inclined tosuspect others of wicked actions . Thus was it with Mrs. Burton . In the commission of a great wrong herself , she had little difficulty in supposing that Mary Monson was the sort of person that rumor made her out to he . She saw no great harm , then , in giving a shove to the descending culprit . When looking into the stocking , she had seen , and put in her own pocket , the notched piece , as a curiosity , there being nothing more unusual in the guilty thus incurring unnecessary risks , than there is in the moth 's temerity in fluttering around the candle . When the purse of Mary Monson was examined , as usually happens on such occasions , we had almost said as always happens , in the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the justice of the land , much less attention was paid to the care of that purse than ought to have been bestowed on it . Profiting by the neglect , Sarah Burton exchanged the notched coin for the perfect piece , unobserved , as she again fancied ; hut once more the watchful eye of Mary Monson was on her . The first time the woman was ohserved by the last , it was accidentally ; but suspicion once aroused it was natural enough to keep a look-oi*it on the suspected party . The act was seen , and at the moment that the accused thought happy , the circumstance was brought to bear on the trial . Sarah Burton maintains that , at first , her sole intention was to exchange the imperfect for the perfect coin ; and that she was induced to swear to the piece subsequently produced , as that found on Mary Monson 5 person , as a literal fact , ignorant of what might be its consequences . Though the devil doubtless leads us on , step by step , deeper and deeper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this particular , the guilty woman applied a flattering unction to her conscience , that the truth would have destroyed . " The true name of Mary Monson is Madame de Larocheforte . She was American by birth , the granddaughter of a lady who had jilted Dunscomb in his youth , and bequeathed a // touch of insanity to all her descendants . She had married a Frenchman of rank , much older than herself , whom she hated , and soon abandoned , taking refuge under a false name in the State of New York , where the laws , according to our author , permit married women to leave their husbands , and allow them the separate management of their property . And this wild and improbable tale , of the conviction of a mad woman for the murder of a person still alive , for arson committed on a dwelling-house which was accidentally fired , and for stealing gold which was actually stolen by the chief witness for the prosecution , - of her conviction under evidence which would hardly have authorized a justice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper 's ground for impugning the fairness of our courts of law , and for affirming that the institution of trial by jury " is totally unsuited to a democracy ! " There may be defects and evils in the administration of criminal justice in our country , but this , certainly , is not the way to expose or amend them . Our author is most unhappy in selecting a ground of complaint against the action of juries in America . No one can justly accuse them of undue severity . Their tendency , it is notorious , especially in capital cases , is to acquit , when both the law and the evidence require a conviction . From a natural unwillingness to have any share in taking away human life , from increased doubts as to the equity and expediency of capital punishment , and from involuntary sympathy with a person pleading for his life when the whole force of the government seems to be arrayed against him and striving to produce a conviction , the jury often seem disposed to take the bit in their teeth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the testimony . They usurp the prerogative of the pardoning power , and often say " not guilty , " when they mean only that the criminal ought " not to be punished . " In order to save their consciences and their oaths , we have often wished that the Scotch practice might be introduced into the English common law , so that the jury might be allowed to return a verdict of " not proven , " when the evidence did not absolutely compel them to say either " guilty " or " not guilty . " At present , the " reasonable doubt , " of which they are told the prisoner must have the benefit , is often made to cover most unreasonable and illegal scruples . The case of the Booms , who // were tried and convicted in Vermont , over thirty years ago , for the murder of their brother-in-law , who subsequently made his appearance alive , is about the only one which we can recollect that affords even a coloring of probability to Mr. Cooper 's extravagant fiction ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in justification of their blunder , that they had relied mainly on the confessions which the accused , from some inexplicable motives , were induced to make . There is no pressing necessity to answer our author 's arguments , or to defend an institution so ancient and so much honored as the trial by jury . We admit there is some force in his remark , that in a monarchy , where the jury stand between the sovereign and the people for the protection of the latter , such a tribunal is more useful and more likely to be just than it is in a democracy , where the people themselves are the sovereign power . And yet this distinction is not so important as it seems ; for the unity of " the people , " even in the wildest democracy that ever existed , is only fictitious , - a mere figure of speech . In our own country , a jury commonly represents the opinion of the disinterested and unimpassioned multitude sitting in judgment upon the contending claims of individuals . It is true , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state , and that the jury also form a portion of the same sovereign power ; but we must recollect that this sovereign is not one , but many , and therefore does not sit as a judge in its own cause . Its unity is fictitious its multiplicity is real . The jurymen in this country are usually no more biased in favor of the government , because it is a government of the people , than they are in favor of the accused , who also is one of the people , one of themselves . Nay , because the government is in a great degree a unit , while the people are many , and though they elect the government , they are still ruled and repressed by it during its term of office , the sympathies of the jury are more likely to be with the accused than with the accuser . It is only in very few cases that the excitement against a supposed criminal becomes so universal and overwhelming , as to rob him of the chance of a fair trial . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of rooted prejudice or personal dislike . The care with which a jury is selected , not by any means on the principle of universal suffrage , but by putting // the names only of respectable householders into the box ; the searching questions that may be put by the counsel on both sides to every one who is drawn by lot , before he is allowed to try a particular cause ; and the separation of the jurymen , for the most part , from popular influences during the time of the trial , together with the solemnity of the oath that is administered to them , and of the charge which they receive from the bench , are very efficient safeguards against prepossession and malice . We respect , we honor , the judges , who he ( e kept the ermine of office quite as unsullied in this country as in Great Britain . If they were appointed , as before , quamdiu se l$ene gesserint , we should be quite willing to place the issue of every trial in their hands , after the common fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judiciary among us , of late , has been seriously impaired in several States , by causing the judges to be elected by popular *vote , and to hold office only for a short term of years . It would be very perilous , under such circumstances , to give them the whole power and responsibility , instead of allowing them to share it , in each case , with a small number of persons chosen by lot from the community at large , and representing not only the authority , but the average intelligence and the sense of justice , of the whole people . It will require much weightier arguments than any which Mr. Cooper has adduced to shake our confidence in an arrangement which seems equally deserving of respect for its antiquity and its adaptation to the wants of the present age .
