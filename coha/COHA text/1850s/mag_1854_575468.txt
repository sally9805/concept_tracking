txt A SOUTHERNER 'S VIEW OF THE SUBJECT . T *present aspect of American poliinvites reflection and calm discussion . The issues which have formerly divided our people into two great parties have passed , or are rapidly passing away . Upon no single question of present practical moment can either the whig party or the democratic party be rallied in unbroken phalanx . The life of their organizations is gone . The age presents new issues , in comparison with which the old shibboleths fade into insignificance ; and , under new banners , with new devices , the yeomanry of the country are rallying . We have arrived at a stand-point in history when it behooves every patriot man to pause and reflect . The living present imposes the weightiest responsibilities ; the past is teeming with instruction ; and the future is radiant with hope . Three-quarters of a century bound the horizon of the former , but the piercing eye of faith seeks , in vain , a limit in the long vista of the latter . Yet , to the more despondent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not illumine every footprint of the future . America , however , expects every man to do his duty ; and if we are but true to the sacred trust He has devolved upon us , our confidence is strong that in His own good time the Spirit of our fathers ' God will move above the troubled waters with creative power , evolving light from darkness . The old political parties of our country are just now thoroughly disorganized . The necessity for new issues , and a rearrangement of the elements of warfare , is manifest to the most casual observer . Hence , the rapid progress of a secret society which has recently made its appearance among us , and for which its more sanguine friends anticipate , at no distant day , a controlling influence in the counsels of the Confederacy . So far as we can gather its objects , the organization rests upon a single idea of federal policy . The amendment of the naturalization laws , so as to require a longer residence in the applicant for the rights of American citizenship , seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish this , though we doubt it . Whether they do or not , the VOL IY. - 41 organization , we are satisfied , will l'c ephe'neral in existence , and abortive in result . We readily admit , the excessive provocation which animates their efforts . The indecent and habitual intrusion of popery , as a political element , into all our elections of late years , naturally suggests the proscription of its adherents and sympathizers ; and the disgusting truckling of our political aspirants to the prejudices of our alien population , indicates the propriety of a counterpoise elemeat at the polls . The Know-Nothings have already exercised a salutary influence , to some extent , in developing the genuine American sentiment of our people  --  a sentiment which both parties , from prudential considerations , have concurred in suppressing . Were they content to maintain a secondary position , this influence might be extended and perpetuated ; but , in aspiring to the control of the State and Federal Governments , they seal their early ruin . We do not make issue with them upon the propriety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not suffice to accomplish the end they have in view . Many of the States confer the elective franchise upon resident aliens prior to their naturalization . That may or may not be a violation of the Constitution , but it clearly indicates that the concurrence of all the State Governments in the legislation suggested , is essential to its success . We presume , the most sanguine KnowNothings dare not hope for contemporaneous success in each of the thirty-one States of the Confederacy . Their actual strength is already , we believe , vastly over-estimated , and will diminish , we are satisfied , as rapidly as it has arisen . The spell of mystery with which their proceedings are invested is potent for temporary effect . Curiosity will introduce among them many whose reason they might in vain addres* . So soon , however , as the charm of novelty is dissipated , there will be numerous desertions from their ranks ; and so there should be , as long as their secresy is maintained . The obvious impropriety of secret political societies is a burden under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stagger into // success . The disorganization of the party may be anticipated at no very distant day , and with the disorganization will come a recoil disastrous to its upholders now . Popery will gloat over the abortion as her triumph . The foreign vote will be ten times as exacting as it has ever been ; and KnowNothingism will see the evils she professes it her mission to remedy , enhanced and perpetuated by herself . The present aspect of the slavery agitation seems to present a much more probable basis for permanent party strife . The elements of anti-slavery appear inclined to harmonize their differences , and concentrate their strength for one grand and persevering assault upon the vested rights of the South . With the instinct of self-preservation , her sons are preparing to ignore past differences , and unite for the conflict . With a front unbroken , save here and there by a single traitor , they await the shock . Come when it may , or how it may , the South is practically a unit at last . The institution of African slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the adoption of the Federal Constitution . It was even then so thoroughly interwoven with their domestic polity , that the entire and absolute control over the subject was reserved to themselves . We need not say that all the powers of the Federal Government are derived by grant from the States , and that the entire grant is contained in the provisions of the Federal Constitution . In that instrument we look in vain for any grant or any covenant divesting the individual States of their inherent rights to regulate the whole subject as in their wisdom may seem most expedient . But three clauses refer to the subject . One was a compromise in the apportionment of representation between the Slave States and the Free States ; another contains the explicit and solemn covenant for the return of fugitive slaves ; and the third empowers the Federal Government , after 1808 , to prohibit the African slave trade . Contemporary history , in confirmation of the pregnant negative of the grant , informs us that more extensive powers were carefully and cautiously avoided . The inquiry may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever intruded into the arena of federal politics ? Certainly the Sooth never brought it there ; and no less certainly its introduction indicates bad faith somewhere . But of this more anon . There it is : to that extent the aggression is complete . Early in their colonial history , slavery was introduced into the colonies . The mother country-that same England which so recently received the authoress of " Uncle Torn 's Cabin " with open arms - encouraged the importation of slaves from Africa , and in spite of the protests and remonstrances of the colonies fastened the system upon them . In Virginia , and perhaps in other colonies , the legislatures essayed to prohibit the traffic ; but in every instance the negative of the Royal Governor interposed to protect it . The preamble to the first Constitution of Virginia enumerates this among other prominent causes of complaint against the King of England-provoking her rel ) udiation of his rule . When the independence of the colonies was established , the prohibition of the African slave trade was still with her a favorite measure of policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she desired to empower and require the new government to place the traffic under the ban of law . But to this Massachusetts and New York demurred . With the exclusion of European competition they reckoned upon a monopoly of the profits of the trade , and earnestly opposed its suppression . With the aid of South Carolina and Georgia , they extorted a respite for twenty years . The predominant sentiment of the Slave States called for the immediate abolition of the traffic , and that sentiment ought to have been respected . Even then , however , the South was not permitted to regulate her domestic institutions for herself . For nearly one quarter of a century she was forced to receive into her bosom a population she then believed an enemy to her peace , and an impediment to her prosperity . New England avarice fastened upon her that institution , for the existence of which New England fanaticism now makes war against her . Abolition never grew upon New England soil till the year that doomed her favorite traffic had passed : but , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sturdy growth . The slave trade was suppressed in 1808 . In 1814 , the Hartford Convention denounced the slave power of the South , and suggested a crusade against the compromises of the Constitution . We readily admit that the general sentiment of the colonies , during the revolutionary era , was adverse to alavery ; // and nowhere did that sentiment prevail more extensively than in the South . With that devotion to abstract principle which has ever characterized her , Virginia , in donating an empire to the Confederacy , exacted a covenant for the perpetual exclusion of her own institutions . An impression almost universally existed that slavery was to be but temporary in its duration . The slave States cheerfully assented to the antislavery provisions of the ordinance of 1787 . Their policy was the immediate prohibition of the foreign trade , and the number of slaves among them was not more than sufficient to supply their own pressing demands . Had importation from abroad then ceased , abolition might have been practicable and easy . But that twenty years of respite did its work effectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen of the South saw their hopes decay . The destiny of the South was fixed against her will . Sister States , who had repudiated slavery as an incubus upon them , and professed to regard slave-holding as a violation of the " perennial principles of right , " ignored their professions , and for filthy lucre 's sake , imposed slavery upon hcr , perpetuating among her people the " sin " of the slavehoider and the " misfortune " of the slave . Abolitionism claims to be the party of progress . So did Jacobinism , and with equal propriety . The one as little as the other conceals the features of the ass under the skin of the lion . Robespierre and Saint Just were as loud in their protestations of loyalty to the principles of 76 as Garrison and Sumner ; and , if not as honest , were quite as rational . The American Jacobins are not unlike their French prototypes . Blood and carnage , fraternal discord , and civil war are as rashly courted now as in 1793 . They differ in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm to spend its fury in their own midst . The fanatics of America sow the seed of strife abroad , and gloat in coward malignity over the anticipated triumph of a servile insurrection , from the hazards of which distance protects them . The one no less than the other rilicules the teachings of experience and revelation . The God of the Bible is not the God of equality , and Abolitionism rejects him as disdainfully , if not as openly , as Jacobinism . The infidel spirit of this anti-slavery crusade is at once its damning crime and the unerring index of its failure . The printing-press , with which Voltaire designed to overthrow the Bible , is now publishing its words of life and truth to a world of sin and death . Man may not with impunity thrust himself against the bosses of Jehovah 's buckler . Anti-slavery direetly impugns either the wisdom or benevolence of our Saviour , for its interpolations into the inspired code of morals presume the inefficiency of his morality to accomplish the end for which it was designed . Abolition preachers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they fail to denounce slavery at a distance . The Son of God lived and moved in a slaveholding country and a slaveholding age , and from his sacred lips slavery never received a single rebuke . If they be right , could he have been the God-man ? Some short time since , a friend was discussing the Maine liquor law with an ultra temperance man , and in the course of conversation he adverted to the miracle at the marriage in Cana of Galilee . The prompt reply was , " I have always regarded that the greatest indiscretion Jesus ever committed . " The shocking blasphemy of the expression is a key to the radical ' principle of more than one ism of the day . It is the vain effort of human pride to amend the work of divine wisdom . The spectacle of foolish man thus passing judgment upon his God , and pronouncing him incompetent for the accomplishment of his holy purposes , and assuming them for himself , will , when properly considered , yet awaken in all sections of our country a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us with the besom of destruction . We do not pretend to impute infidelity to all abolitionists . Many of the best of our northern brethren , we know , have been misled into their ranks by names and abstractions . Slavery , as it exists in the South , is not known to a fraction of the people of the North . Misrepresented and distorted as it has been , we have , perhaps , reason for congratulation in the existence of any class among them willing to do us justice . We speak now of the creed , and not of its professors . It is a legitimate offshoot from that school of sentimental piety that assumes to try the mysteries of the Godhead by the standard of human comprehension , consistently denying the divinity of the Saviour and the inspiration of the Bible . In the pulpits of that faith it finds an appropriate place . The heresiarchs of // Socinianism do their master 's work as effectually , if not as openly , in preaching abolitionism , as they do in preaching Unitarianism . But its intrusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abolition has nothing in consonance with its high and holy mission . The unwary watcher on the walls of Zion who tampers with the monster is recreant to his trust , and false to his Master . If , as a Christian , his heart recoil not from the serpent ; if , as a citizen , the possible calamities of disunion and civil war have no terrors for him , let him , in his individual capacity , speed on the hellish work ; but , in the name of a common Christianity and a common manhood , we have a right to demand that he profane not the Christian pulpit . In the uncompromising consecration of the sacred desk to its heaven-ordained work is the hope of a lost and ruined world . When the passions of earth intrude there , society trembles to its centre , and devils revel at the prospect . Hell will hold a carnival when the genius of abolition furls her wings in triumph over the " broken and dissevered fragments of a once glorious Union ; " but if , amid her dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal prostitution of the pulpit , the walls of Tophet would ring with even a wilder joy . Had the States never formed a Confederacy , this abolition war could never have assumed a threatening aspect . The North would not have ventured to encourage an agitation , the inevitable effect of which would have been continual war with her neighbors . But protected , as she has been , by the existence of a bond of apparently permanent union , a fanatical crusade against us has been in open and shameless contempt of the covenant fostered and encouraged . It originated in no morbid affection for the slave . In its beginning , as it is now in its meridian , it was purely and exclusively a question of l ) oliticalpower . The war of 1812 had been initiated under the auspices of a Southern President , and with the cordial co-operation of the Southern members of Congress . New England bitterly opposed the var ; and upon that question the leaders of the old Federal party , then in a state of decadence , hoped to rally once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectants of the Presidency were Southern men . The Democratic party were in power , and its policy and affiliations were mainly Southern ; hence the Federal policy of arousing a sectional feeling  --  a policy which first found open expression in the treasonable resolves of the Hartford Convention . The suggestion there was to amend the Federal Constitution , so as to deprive the South of the representation of threefifths of her slaves . But the managers of the Hartford cabal mistook their strength and over-shot the mark . The stench of treason attached itself to their deliberations , and sank every participant in them to " a political damnation so deep that the hand of resurrection never did reach them . " Their suggestion was obviously impracticable , inasmuch as it could only be accomplished by the aid of ' several of the slave States . It was enough , however , to indicate the gathering of the storm , which in a few years burst with all its fury upon a peaceful and happy people . Missouri was about completing her territorial pupilage , and asked permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union . As a component part of the territory of Louisiana , it was slave territory when we acquired it , and so it had continued . Her application was objected to , unless she would assent to repudiate her Southern institutions and abolish slavery , as a preliminary to her admission . The passions and prejudices of the people of the North were roused by the most inflammatory and insidious appeals , until the whole body of the Northern representation in Congress ranged themselves in solid phalanx . The principle asserted was most odious to the South , and at war with the whole spirit of the Constitution . In vain did she demand the warrant for prescribing terms to the incipient State , and especially for stigmatizing her and hers by exacting as the condition of admission the repudiation of an institution interwoven into her social polity . The Federal Government is the creature of the States . All her powers are derived by express grant , and are limited in their character . The Constitution confers upon Congress the right to admit new States ; but , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the original thirteen . Theoretically , Ohio and Kentucky , California and Florida are as much the creators of the General Government as Virginia or New York . The essential principle of the Constitution is , entire and absolute equality among all the States . If Congress can impose terms , // then every new State may come in upon a different footing . From one she may exact an obligation to admit negro suffrage - another she may require solemnly to repudiate this or that construction of controverted clauses of the Constitution . To-day she may impose slavery upon one , and to-morrow she may demand its abolition in another . There is no limit outside of the express provisions of the Constitution to the discretion of Congress . The Constitution does not profess to define the powers of the State ; in express terms it provides that , " the powers not delegated to the United States by itself , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States , respectively , or to the people . " The anti-Missouri heresy , however , proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted or reserved to the State-such ? 8 the equality of representation in the Senate -- may be prohibited by Congress to the new State . The United States are required to guarantee to every State a republican form of government , but it is a form only , when its institutions and laws are modelled to accommodate the will of others than the governed . Where is the grant of power necessary to enforce the observance of the terms ? Suppose a State admitted this year upon the condition of abolishing slavery convenes a new convention next year and re-establishes it . What then ? Can Congress resolve her out of the Union ? Can the General Government abolish slavery in her limits ? If not , of what avail was the original restriction . Surely , if that was constitutional , the framers of that instrument would have provided some means to enforce the observance of her faith by the covenant-breaking State . A bill was originated in the House of Representatives , authorizing the people of Missouri to form a constitution and State government , and after the insertion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unanimous vote of the Southern representatives . In the Senate , upon motion of Mr. Thomas , of Illinois , the prohibition clause was stricken out , and in lieu of it was inserted the so-called Missouri Compromise , which was nothing more , nor less , than a prohibition of slavery for all future time in the territory outside of the limits of Missouri and north of her southern boundary , accompanied with a provision for her admission on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatsoever . As an alternative proposition to the other , the Southern men , generally , sustained the compromise proposed by Mr. Thomas , and with the aid of a few conservative men from the north , passed it through both Houses of Congress . There has latterly been considerable discussion as to the paternity of this measure , and the responsibility of its adoption has been variously imputed to the North or the South , as best suited the temporary purposes of the writer or speaker . It is not , however , we think , a subject for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative , and the South as certainly accepted the compromise in preference to the prohibition . We do not consider this , however , a matter of vital moment at this date . It is , in our judgment , a plain and palpable usurpation of power , and we regret that the South ever did accede to it . Then was the appropriate time to meet the aggression , if not successfully elsewhere , at the point of the bayonet and the muzzle of the cannon . Resolute and unyielding resistance then would have strangled the monster in its cradle . In pursuance of the act of Congress , the people met , adopted a Constitution , and organized a State government . When Congress reassembled , the Senate promptly passed a resolution declaring Missouri a member of the Confederacy . In the House , however , it encountered most vehement opposition . The compromise made the year previous was openly repudiated , and Missouri refused the admission to which the public faith was plighted . Exception was taken to a clause in her Constitution , empowering the legislature to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretext her entrance into the Union was resisted . A similar provision existed then in Massachusetts , and at this day in Indiana and Illinois . The true objection was elicited upon a proposition of Mr. Mallory , of Vermont , to amend the resolution , by inserting , as a preliminary to her admission , a requisition upon Missouri to alter her Constitution and abolish slavery . Upon the call of the ayes and noes , 61 representatives from the North voted aye , and but 33 no . The former compromise was repudiated by the House , and new concessions were demanded . Upon motion of Mr. Clay , a joint committee of 28 on the part of the House , and 7 on the part of the Senate , was appointed to consider the subject . They reported a resolution providing for // Dec. the admission of Missouri upon a fundamental condition , viz. : that the clause in her Constitution relative to free colored emigration into the State should never be construed to authorize the passage of an act by which any citizen of either of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges to which he was entitled under the Federal Constitution . To this fundamental condition Missouri was required to declare her assent by an act , it the nature of a solemn compact with the United Stat* , and upon the receipt of an authenticated copy of such act , the iPresident was authorized to issue a proclamation declaring her a State . The proposition of the joint committee passed both houses , and Missouri , having complied with the requisition , Mr. Monroe issued his proclamation August 10 , 1821 . Thus Missouri was really admitted upon the compromise proposed by the committee . It is true that the new requisition amounted to no more than a declaration of fidelity to the Constitution . But that matters not . It was imposed upon her as a condition of her admission into the Union , and was in flagrant violation of the pledge of the previous session to admit her upon an equal footing in all respects whatsoever with the original States . This was the first violation of the 3fi0 30 ' compromise , and especially heinous , as withholding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus disposed of at length , the public mind settled down into quiet acquiescence . Abolition sank into obscurity-we had nearly said contempt ; but it was only slumbering . An unfortunate discussion of the subject in the Virginia legislature in the winter of 1831-2 , consequent upon an insurrection of slaves in the county of Southampton , in the progress of which , 55 whites , of all ages , sexes , and conditions , were brutally massacred , infused new life into the abolitionists , and renewed the agitation . It may be well imagined that the Southampton affair awakened the most intense feeling throughout the limits of Virginia ; and in the legislative session of the ensuing winter many of the calmest and ablest of her citizens were open and avowed advocates of prospective emancipation . Propositions to that effect were discussed with warmth and ability . Appearances indicated the existence of a large and influential , if not controlling party favorable to abolition : and had the fanatics of the North not interposed , success might have crowned their efforts in a few years . Negrophilism abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions . Soon after this , began abolition organizations and anti-slavery conventions in the northern cities . The press was forced into service to misrepresent and distort our institutions and our people . The mails were loaded with incendiary documents . The most fiendish appeals to the passions of the slave were sought to be distributed among us by inclosing them to free negroes and hired emissaries in our midst . Under cover of the sanctity of private correspondence , diabolical suggestions for a repetition of the Southampton outrage were secretly pressed upon the contented slaves of the South . The facilities of cominunication afforded by a common government , established " to insure domestic tranquillity ; to provide for the common defence , and promote the general welfare , " were abused to assail the South in her Achilles ' heel . Abolition Munchausens devoted their imaginations and their energies to the concoction and extensive circulation in the North of the grossest misrepresentations of the Southern people . A friend has frequently related to us a conversation he held , about this time , with a very intelligent and well-informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a political press at the seat of government . The present state of Northern feeling upon the slavery question was predicted at that day with almost historic accuracy . Our friend then entertained the prevalent impression of his Southern brethren that the agitation was confined to a small and contemptible faction , and combated the despondency of the oxeditor . But his faith was not a little shaken when presented with a specimen of the literature with which the agitators were then busily flooding the country . One of the tracts professed , in its outset , to discard all the exaggerated stories which were related of Southern cruelty , and indulged in expressions of virtuous indignation against the abolitionists for the infliction of such outrage upon their brethren at the South . The author professed as his design , the recital of simple and unvarnished facts , not of rare occurrence , but so frequent and common that no fair-minded Southern man would for a moment call in question their truth . And after these hypocritical professions // he proceeded to relate the most shocking cruelties and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unvarying incidents of Southern life . The truthful narratives were embellished with engravings to elicit the attention and arouse the passions . Upon one page was a large plate of a hunting scene in the South ; in the foreground an umbrageous oak ; beneath it a prostrate human body , surrounded by a pack of hungry and wolfish dogs , while at a distance appeared the hunter riding off with his gun carelessly thrown over his shoulder . The accompanying narrative was to the effect that a gentleman in the South , having lost a slave , contented himself with informing a neighbor , who had a fancy for negro hunting , and placing him at liberty to enjoy whatever sport the chase of ' the fugitive might afford . Accordingly he assembled his hounds and sallied forth . After some time he discovered the fugitive in the branches of an oak , when he deliberately levelled his gun and fired . The shot took effect , and as the poor negro fell , the blood-hounds rushed upon him to complete the work of death and destruction . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to witness the mutilation , and he leisurely rode away . In another place , under the head of anecdotes , the author says that a friend of his , recently returned from a jaunt to the South , informed him that while visiting a friend , a young lady of the , family fell down and knocked out all her teeth . A very handsome mulatto slave , blest with fine teeth , who was employed about the house , was called in , and a sufficient number of hers extracted to supply the place of those lost by her young mistress . With such stories as these the pamphlet was filled ; and this , our friend was informed , was but a sample of the publications then in process of dissemination among the children and less enlightened classes of Northern society . The seed was sowing , and we reap the harvest . Another phasis of the abolition agitation was presented incessantly upon the floor of Congress . Not a session elapsed without the presentation of innumerable petitions from men , women , and children in the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cruelty , and overthrow our institutions . In reference to these petitions , we are frank to confess that we always re gretted the policy of the South . There was no wrong done to the abolitionist in refusing to receive his petition ; but the adoption of a standing rule of the House of Representatives to that effect , afforded his sympathisers in Congress the opportunity for continual agitation , and gave to him somewhat of the odor of martyrdom . The 21st rule we always considered a blunder ; but it is mere nonsense to assail the South for it . Admit all that may be urged against it , and was it more than a Roland for an Oliver ? If it did abridge constitutional rights , it abridged those of none besides a faction who were trampling upon hers . We have neither time nor inclination to dwell here . The South has more grievous causes of complaint than the reception of abolition petitions . The continual agitation of the 21st rule in the House of Representatives was practically more efficient of mischief against her than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so it was designed . The agitators but needed a pretext to assail the South . Theme were political reminiscences ever present with some to point , with the bitterness of disappointed hopes , the shafts of hate and malice , and those who treasured them might forsake a friend , but never forgot a foe . The annexation of Texas in 1845 , is the starting-point of another epoch in the history of Abolition . The territory of Texas was originally included in the Louisiana purchase , but surrendered to Spain by the provisions of the Florida treaty . Mm- . Benton -- high authority with the Free Soilers , though , we confess it , not very conclusive upon us-says in his recent ponderous tome , that it was unnecessarily sacrificed by the Southern advisers of Mr. Monroe , to conciliate the Free Soil sentiment of that day . Of course its re-acquisition met with violent hostility from the same quarter . But the sovereign will of the people commanded it , and the deed was done beyond recall . It is needless now to examine the propriety or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if we would , we can not displace her . She is in too , under the provisions of a solemn covenant for her subdivision into five States , whenever in her judgment her population may be large enough to render division expedient-such of the new States as lay south of 860 80 ' , with or without slavery as their people may desire , and those to the north of that line , // Dec. according to the provisions of the Missouri restriction , flon-slaveholding . The South promptly acceded to the insertion of the Missouri Compromise , if she did not suggest it , though she was to be the necessary loser . Her faith , however , was pledged , and the faithlessness of her enemies was not then so palpably evinced as to release her from the obligations of the bond . The Mexican war soon succeeded the annexation of Texas . We always considered the war a consequence of the blundering of Mr. Polk 's administration . A wise and cautious Executive might not have been able to avoid it ; but a wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Taylor at the time , and under the circumstances , that the unfortunate order was given . So thought the great statesman of South Carolina , whom the fanatics of the North choose to regard as the embodiment of the pro-slavery sentiment of the South . During the progress of the war , it became manifest that the prilQiple upon which the war party proceeded-that of demanding indemnity for the past and security for the future-necessarily involved the necessity of acquiring new territory . For this the South was not responsible . Her people were divided upon the propriety of the war , though to her credit be it said , never upon the propriety of maintaining the honor of the American flag , or the safety of the American soldier . The Democratic party was the war party ; and as it had been before , so was it still the predominant party in the South . In the North as in the South , it was commnitted to the acquisition of territory . The friends of the President suggested that Congress should place under his control two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty of peace . Then sprang forth the workirenowned Wilmot Proviso . Mr. David Wilmot , of Pennsylvania , who had cast his maiden vote in Congress for the 21st rule  --  and alone of the Pennsylvania delegation voted for the repeal of the tariff of 1842-moved the adoption of a proviso to the effect , that , in the event of the acquisition of territory , slavery should be for ever prohibited therein . The proviso was adopted , and the resolution in this form more than once passed the House of Representatives ; but the proviso effectually defeated the passage of the bill . A treaty of peace was finally negotiated without the aid of the two or three millions , and subsequently ratified by the Senate . By that treaty , in addition to the territory in dispute between Texas and Mexico , we acquired California , a portion of New Mexico , and Utah . Prostrate as poor Mexico was , we could have wrested from her such terms as we might have chosen to dictate . But , as compared with the precedents of our voracious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactions . After the ratification of the treaty , immediate efforts were made to provide governments for our newly acquired territory , but the slavery question aborted every effort . Upon this rock the two Houses of Congress continually split . The House of Representatives repeatedly passed the Wilmot Proviso ; but , as in days gone by , we looked to the Senate and looked not in vain . Firm in the maintenance of the rights of the minority section , that glorious body refused to accede to the demands of Abolition . The South presented an undivided fiont . All parties and classes of her people united in resisting the threatened aggression , and her representatives gave honest expression to her deliberate and well-considered sentiment . She had contributed with her blood and her treasure to acquire the soil from which it was proposed for ever to exclude her institutions and her property . She asked no favors-she demanded nothing but her right . A small but gallant band of constitutional allies from the North , stood with her in the breach . Breasting the tide of fanaticism which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ears of their own people the magnanimous counsel of Aristides to the Athenians : " You have the numerical power , but it is unjust to exercise it . " For awhile , our Northern brethren seemed " deaf to the voice of justice and consanguinity . " From Legislature after Legislature they sent up their God-speed to the agitators at the Capitol , until finally young Iowa stood alone among the non-slaveholding States , without the taint of abolition upon her skirts . Upon the other hand , the slave States were cementing their bonds of union among themselves , and upon the altar had sworn the one to the other , that " at all hazards , and to the last extremity , " they would resist the threatened aggression . Upon the floor of Congress , they over and over again tendered the olive branch , and it was uniformly spurned . Asking only for her rights , she proposed to submit the whole matter at issue to the arbitrament of the // Supreme Court , but that was refused . She proposed to extend the Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large proportion of the territory , and left her interests in the remainder subject to the hazards of adverse judicial decisions . The terms of the Missouri act were confined to the territory acquired from France ; but their scope and design was to draw a dividing line between the slave and the free States , and good faith required the extension of the line through the Mexican acquisisitions . The South denies , it is true , the authority of Congress to exclude her from any portion of the public domain ; but for the sake of peace and harmony she was willing to concede the power , or , in other words , to exclude herself from a portion , if by such concession she could purchase exemption from assault . But even this offer was spurned , not once or twice , but oftener still . While the Mexican acquisitions were still under consideration , Oregon came forward to apply for a territorial government . As a portion of the Louisiana purchase , lying altogether North of 360 30 ' , the compromise of 1820 provided for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the insertion of the prohibition in the bill establishing a territorial government . Mr. Burt , of South Carolina , however , to test the feelings of the North in reference to the Missouri Compromise , proposed to add to the prohibition the words , " inasmuch as the whole of the said territory lies north of the line of 360 30 ' , north latitude , " or something to the same effect . His motion was rejected by the almost unanimous negative vote of the Northern members . The Missouri Compromise was thus deliberately repudiated by the North , and the prohibition of slavery in Oregon , by virtue thereof , relinquished to nccomplish the same end by the equally effectual and more satisfactory dictum of a despotic majority . In this form the bill passed the House against the unanimous negative vote of the Southern members , and in the Senate would have failed , but for the desertion of Mr. Benton , of Missouri , and Mr. Houston , of Texas . President Polk sanctioned the bill , accompanying it with an explanatory message , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Missouri line , and intimating his intention to veto any bill imposing the Wilmot Proviso upon territories south of 36* 30 ' . Of all the acts of his administration , this we consider most censurable . It was a serious mistake . The North had repudiated the covenant , and it was no less than silly to concede to her advantages to which she was entitled under it , in the face of her own emphatic and deliberate warning , that she meant not to discharge any obligations imposed upon her thereby . Congress adjourned on the 3d of March , 1849 , having failed to provide for the government of the new territory . The discovery of the immense mineral wealth o* California had already attracted thither an unexampled influx of population ; and the military government which , exneeessitate rei , survived the war , was altogether insufficient for the effectual protection of life and property . Under these circumstances her people assumed the responsibility of organizing a State Government . A convention of delegates regularly elected by her people assembled in San Francisco , and agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their constituency . The South had always contended for the right of the territories in adopting State governments , to select for themselves such institutions as they might prefer , and it was supposed that her repugnance to the Wilmot Proviso would impose no obstacle on her part to the admission of California with a free Constitution . Her enemies , therefore , brought their batteries to bear upon the people of the territory , and by significant threats indirectly accomplished their purpose . The peculiar situation of the territory rendered the early establishment of a permanent government a matter of unusual moment ; and , to avert the delay which attended the application of Missouri for admission into the Union , the Southern emigrants acquiesced without a struggle in the exclusion of their own people . The paper boundaries assumed for the new State embraced an area ample enough to form two or three more ; and the Convention was urged to make them coterminous with the grant of the Mexican treaty . Thus , under abolition influence , the denizens of a small section of the new territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense area as yet uninhabited . To this the South objected , and no fairminded man can assail her for inconsistency . She was always ready to authorize the formation of a State government in the settled territory , and to accompany that authority with a pledge for the admission of the new State , with // Dec. or without slaves , at her own option . From the deliberate and unbiased verdict of her people  --  the South never asked-never desired an appeal . When Congress re-assembled in Decernber , the Senators and Representatives from California presented themselves with the Constitution of their State , asking her admission into the Union , and their own recognition as her constitutional representatives , in the councils of the Confederacy . The whole country was lashed into a state of intense excitement . The representatives of the South came commissioned by their constituents to resist the Wilmot Proviso even to the disruption of the Union . For more than one month the House of Representatives was entirely disorganized . A portion of the Southern wing of the dominant party refused to acquiesce in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own party , because they distrusted him upon this question  --  and the result vindicated the wisdom of their course . The diffioulty was only obviated , at length , by an alteration Gf the rules requiring a majority vote to elect . The resolute attitude of the South began to be known and appreciated . The Northern masses were awakened to a true sense of the condition of the country . Under Abolition auspices they had been led blindfold to the brink of the precipice , until now , from the deep abyss below , the rattling of the crumbling earth beneath them broke on their unwilling ears . Aifrighted and horror-struck at the blackness of the darkness before them , they shrunk back . Disunion and fraternal war were but a step in advance , and that step was half taken when the true men of the North rallied in their might to the rescue . Fanaticism raved and ranted , but Northern patriotism trampled the monster . The Wilinot Proviso was consigned , by the overwhelming voice of the people , to the tomb of the Capulets ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and permanent adjustment of the Slavery question , in all its Federal aspects was commanded . What are familiarly known as the compromise measures of 1850 were the result . They were five in number viz. : First , the act to admit the State of ' California into the Union . Second , the act organizing the territory of Utah . Third , the act organizing the territory of New Mexico , and providing for the adjustment of the disputed boundary with Texas . Fourth , The act to provide more effectually for the return of fugitive slaves . And Fifth , The act suppressing the slave trade in the District of Columbia . The Northern vote was unanimously in favor of the first and the last- so was the Southern vote with reference to the fourth . The second and third were sustained and passed by a combination from both sections , against an active and energetic opposition from the ultra-Northern and ultra-Southern members , combined . The objections to the admission of California have been set forth already . Good faith required the establishment of a territorial government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unembarrassed by extraneous influence , and a guarantee that their own wishes in regard to slavery , be they what they might , should be respected . Practically , this would perhaps have availed the South little . It would , however , have been no more than a proper concession to her constitutional rights , as well as an appropriate recognition of the principle of Federal non-intervention . Had the South been allowed fair play , in the first instance , we think it more than probable that California would now be a slave State . Nor do we consider it altogether certain that she may not be so yet . Abolition , in its mad haste , has overreached itself , for in investing the State with the attributes of sovereignty , she has effectually released her from its own grasp . The act organizing the territory of Utah is remsrkable in but one respect . It contains no Wilmot Proviso ; but in express words embodies the great principle of non-intervention in its fullest and broadest terms . It had been a favorite position with the anti-slavery men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in slaves were still in force , and that without positive legislation the new acquisitions were entirely free soil . Upon the other hand , the South contended that the United States held the territory under the Constitution for the joint and equal benefit of all the States ; and was bound to recogaize and protect therein , the property of all-and inasmuch as our slave laws were inconsistent with the Mexican law , that the latter was necessarily repealed or superseded . The South had previously manifested her confidence in the strength of this position by an almost unanimous support of the Clayton compromise , which proposed to submit the matter as a propo // sition of law , to the arbitrament of the Supreme Court of the United States . Nevertheless the idea had been extensively diffused that the Mexican law was still in force - and slaveholders , thereby warned that , in venturing with their property upon the public domain , they hazarded its loss . To remedy this disadvantage the South asked the amendment of the bill by a disclaimer of the validity of the Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed amendment , many of the Southern representatives voted against it . The repeal of the Mexican law , however , seems virtually admitted by the bill-for juris* diction is vested in the courts , to determine suits involving title to slaves , and the territory is guaranteed admission into the Union , with or without slavery , as her Constitution may prescribe . In the organization of a territorial government for New Mexico , peculiar difficulties presented themselves . The preposterous idea of admitting her as a State with the anti-slavery restriction , possessed the imaginations of but few . The administration had acted upon the presumption that , by inciting her people to imitate the example of California , the admission of both as free States could be accomplished ; and , under executive influence , the farce of adopting a Constitution , and electing senators and representatives , was enacted by the handful of men who inhabited Santa Fe and its neighborhood . That , however , was of little moment . But there was a question involved in the organization of a territorial government which , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was annexed to the United States she claimed that her boundary extended to the Rio Grande , while Mexico asserted for her then province of New Mexico , a claim as far east as the Nueces . Every one , at all familiar with the history of our country , is well aware that the cause of our war with Mexico was the armed occupation , by the United States , of this disputed territory . Acting upon the claim of Texas , Mr. Polk gave the order for General Taylor 's advance from Corpus Christi , and then followed the collisions at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma . The Congress of the United States endorsed the act of its executive , and resolving that " whereas war existed by act of Mexico " in invading the State of Texas , and shedding American bloed upon American soil , provided i*or its effectual prosecution upon our part . Thus , in the most solemn manner , was the faith of the United States pledged , by its various departments of government , to recognize and defend the territorial claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico was the ostensible cause of the war she waged against a weak and almost defenceless neighbor . Yet , no sooner is that neighbor prostrated , and compelled to relinquish her claims , than , under Northern influence , the United States is made to assunte the disgraceful position of denying the validity of the title for which she fought . In recurring to this phasis of the struggle of 1850 , who , that feels within his bosom the beating of an American heart , can suppress the instinctive blush of shame ? The object for which the public faith was thus set at naught , was kindred in baseness to the act itself . Texas was a slaveholding State , and to her soil the citizen of the South and the North was alike a welcome visitant . It ; however , she could be despoiled of her territory , the power of the Federal Government might be invoked to exclude her , and her sister States of the south , therefrom . Texas prepared to maintain her rights by force . She felt that she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong in the consciousness of a righteous cause , she was advancing to the contest . The sympathies of the whole South were with her ,  --  and , had a blow been struck , their sons would have rallied around her . Virginia and the Carolinas ,  --  Georgia and Tennesseeaye , every slave State in the Union would have made her quarrel theirs ; - and no human ken could have foreseen the result . Happily the danger was averted ,  --  not , however , as it should have been , by a magnanimous secession of the Federal Government . Texas was bribed into peace . With the sword in one hand and the purse in the other , the United States extorted an unwilling cession of her soil . The common treasury of the Union , to which we of the South , unquestionably , contribute our full quota , was robbed of ten millions of dollars to dismember a slave State , and put at hazard our rights in millions of acres . Is it wonderful that , against such an outrage , the true men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the bill establishing a territorial government for New Mexico , repudiating the Wilmot Proviso , and guaranteeing her admission into the Union as a // slave State , if she so willed , the Texas bribe became the law of the land . Of the remaining two measures , the one was designed as a concession to the fanaticism of one section  --  the other was a tardy recognition of the rights of the other . The abolition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia , is practically of little consequence to the South . With us , the buying and selling of slaves for gain is no more reputable an employment than it is considered in the North ; and if it could be , it would long since have been suppressed . It is , however , a necessary incident to the institution . There is much of evil associated with the best condition upon earth . In every community and in every society there is much that is necessary to be done which the benevolent heart would rather not be forced to witness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devised penalties which , in punishing the criminal , never bear with them heavier burdens to the innocent . If the slave is sold to-day at the caprice of a heartless master , so , in another circle of society , the heartless master finds his counterpart in the brutal husband or father , and the unhappy slave his fellowsufferer in the heart-broken wife , or the unfriended child . it ; in the South , the bankruptcy of the master compels the reluctant sale to the slave dealer , and the forced severance of the negro 's ties ,  --  in the North a like misfortune to the father tears from the fireside of home the unhappy boy , and flings him rudderless on the ocean of life . The feeling heart need but look around within the narrow circle of its own immediate observation , to find enough of human woe and suffering to awake its liveliest sympathies . The people of the South are not callous to human misfortune . If they be not all like the good Samaritan of our Saviour 's parable , and we assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in challenging , throughout the world , comparison with them in all works of genuine charity . The negro 's sorrows are not unheeded by his Southern brother of a fairer hue . With less of ostentation , but with more of deep and heartfelt interest , he ministers to his necessities . Southern philanthropy does not vent itself towards the negro in words , and words only . However , we digress . We have no regrets that the slave shambles have been excluded from the District , but the exercise of the power to suppress the traffic , is , to us , fearfully ominous of future evil . This subject , however , is now rarely noticed . The law is upon the statute-book ,  --  openly , and we believe rigidly , enforced . But its fellow-statute is less fortunate . From the hour of the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law down to the present time , scarcely a week has elapsed that its nullification has not been urged as a Christian duty . In scarcely one single instance has the law been executed quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one victim of an infuriated mob clamors still from the ground for vengeance . As far as nine out of ten of our stolen slaves are concerned , the law is practically a dead letter . In spite of its provisions they cower securely under the shelter of abolition saints , whose decalogue is abridged into the single command , " Thou shalt steal thy neighbor 's slave , and defame thy neighbor 's name . " Yet their surrender is " nominated in the bond . " Men of the North 1 the Constitution , which secures to you all that you and yours hold dear , imposes upon you this duty . It may be an unpleasant one - it need not be so . The great apostle of the Gentiles obviously thought he did his Master service when restoring the fugitive Onesimus to Philemon . Yours must be a tender conscience that revolts from acts that Paul esteemed duties . " It is nominated in the bond . " Remember that . Contemporary history assures us , and your own jurists tell us , that without it that bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have the consideration therefore . In the peace and security of your fireside , in the exemption from the heavy and oppressive burdens that grind the poor of other lands into dust , in your growing and flourishing towns , in all the elements of material prosperity and comfort that surround you , in the dividends with which your cotton mills fill your pockets , in your unrestricted intercourse with the South , pouring , as it does annually , into your lap millions of dollars , in the pride with which you boast your American citizenship , iu all that is near and dear to your heart . *s men and as Amecans , you have your price . We give it you ,  --  we will defend it for you in times to come , as we have done in days gone by . But give us ours . Be honest . Honesty is the best policy ; but he did not err much who quaintly said , the man who is honest because it is the best polic ' , is half-way to a knave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it // is just . Yourfaith is plighted . It is not to the features of the law that you really object . You say the trial by jury , habeas corpus , &amp;c. , are denied the fugitive , and hence the law is unconstitutional . So say no lawyers , no judges , except the oracles of a faction , and the Mansfields of Wisconsin . No question was ever broached upon which the bench has so often spoken , and with such little variance . The constitutional question does not relieve you . The bill is constitutional . The trial by jury is a pretext , and so you know it is . Need you be told for the hundreth time that there is not a slave State in the Union that does not offer the fugitive , if he will have it , a jury trial to test his identity or his freedom , and the sympathies of our juries are always with the negro ? You only wish the jury trial , to increase the chance of escape to the slave . You know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly slaves , and , consequently , you do not really so much apprehend mistake . T is to defraud the owner . Be frank with yourselves , if no others . You complain that the States , and not the General Government , are bound by the constitutional provision . Be it so . Will you assist in enacting a State law , honestly designed to satisfy the requirements of the Constitution ? No ; - you do not wish to deliver up the slave . But reflect upon your obligations . Is it right for you to share the benefits , and pay not the price ? Do you reflect that every slave you refuse to return is stolen from your Southern brother ? It is so ,  --  and stolen , too , under the aggravation of violated confidence . On the faith of your promise to return them , the opportunity to steal them was afforded . An Englishman can not , with impunity , despoil us of our property ; but you can . Our unsuspecting confidence in your covenant-faith invested you with the peculiar opportunities you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you can not comply with the requirements of the Constitution , then strike for disunion in an open , a manly , and an honest way . If you do not this# but still retain the slave , you are false to the most sacred obligations . We do not design to deal in denunciation , for we are well aware of the immense influence of prejudice upon the formation of individual opinion respecting matters of most palpable character . We do not believe that broken faith is meditated by one in a thousand of our Northern brethren who pander to the fanaticism of abolition ; and if considerations like these were more frequently pressed home upon them the effect would be a happy one . We state nothing but fact when we affirm the obligation to return the fugitive slave . He that runs may read it . Not an officer of any State in this Union can enter upon the discharge of his duties before solemniy swearing to comply with the contract . We can not swear allegiance to the Constitution by piecemeal . As a whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , we have to take it . The trappings of office in this land sit uneasily on the shoulders of an honest abolitionist . Bitter it may be , but upon the Evangely of Christ must he swear to return the fugitive to his owner . To the Searcher of all hearts and the God of all truth must he appeal to witness the sincerity with which he pledges his immortal soul for the fulfilment of the obligation . It is no light matter to appeal solemnly to heaven , and human depravity wears no blacker aspect than when premeditated falsehood accompanies such an appeal . Ye abolition officebearers , your quarrel is not now with us . It is with Him whose vengeance you have voluntarily invoked , for refusing to return the fugitive slave . Your covenant obligations may hang heavy upon your souls ; but you have assumed them for yourselves , and appealed to heaven as the witness . You may not release yourselves from them . Repeal the law you can not ; but , if you could , it would not avail . T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South will not release you . From that obligation ye may not escape , save by a complete disruption of the Confederacy . But one straight path of duty is marked out for him whose conscience revolts at the work . It is in resolute , unvarying and uncompromising war against the Union . His convictions necessarily make him a traitor to the Confederacy . He who loves the Union must hate abolition . Away , then , with the hypocritical cant of making the free North a hunting ground for slaves , and reducing Northern freemen to a level with bloodhounds , &amp;c. , &amp;c . A truce to this clamor about the unconstitutionality of the law . The repudiation of the Wilmot proviso in the territorial bills was simply a triumph of principle . Very little idea // was then , or is now , entertained of the establishment of slavery in Utah , or New Mexico ; but no congressional interdict excludes the South . The great principle of State rights , for which we have always contended , is recognized in its full extent by the guarantee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own institutions for herself . In this particular , and in this particular only , did the South really gain in the adjustment of 1850 . The Fugitive Slave Bill was but an amendment of an existing law , designed to carry into effect a plain and uncontroverted provision of the Constitution . It is eminently useful in many respects ; but , like its constitutional basis , depends for its efficacy upon principles of good faith and good neighborhood , which legislalation can not create . But in the triumph of State sovereignty , not territorial sovereignty ( for the power to exclude us is only vested in the people when organizing as a State ) , a controverted question was settled , and it was settled for all coming time upon the principles of the Constitution and of equal right . The era of federal interdicts was closed when a despotic majority repudiated the Missouri Compromise , even in its application to the Louisiana purchase , by rejecting the proposed amendment of Mr. Burt , of South Carolina , to the Oregon hill , in 1848 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . The South tendered the olive-branch more than once again ; but her spirits were broken and her hopes were crushed . This , however , was her ultimatum . The Missouri restriction , or none , was the alternative she proposed , and we have no regrets attendant upon the acceptance of the latter . The recent act of Congress , organizing the territories of Nebraska and Kansas , was the equitable consequence of the legislation of 1850 . The distinguishing feature of this act was the clause declaring the Missouri restriction originally unconstitutional and superseded as a principle of compromise by the adjustment of 1850 . It must have been not a little amusing to those who have watched the progress of political events in this country , for the past five years , to observe the apparent earnestness and sincerity with which this bill was assailed , as a breach of plighted faith . Men and parties who , in 1850 , had not a word of respect to utter for any compromises  - -  who studiously repelled the idea of recognizing the binding character of any pledges made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 86* 80 ' , because " some historical recollections " made those figures bear with them " an implication , " were , a few moons since , clamoring upon the floor of Congress for this same line of 36* 30 ' , as the consecrated boundary of free soil . This silly cry of broken faith is simply absurd . We have shown , in the previous brief r&amp;umt* of legislation upon this subject , that the South endeavored , but endeavored ineffectually , to perpetuate the Missouri line . She contended that good faith required its extension *o the Pacific ; but , not only did the North refuse to extend , but solemnly repudiated it as binding on the original territory of Louisiana , and excluded the South from Oregon by numerical strength . Against the earnest remonstrances and protest of the South , that line was practically abrogated-when her enemies vainly imagined themselves full strong enough to exclude her entirely . They forced upon her the hazards of another settlement  --  and to the principles of that settlement , every consideration of justice and fdr dealing requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . did not expect ; but , from the candid and fair-minded men of the North , we do look for early and entire acquiescence . We know there are many who esteem the Nebraska bill equitable and just , and the discomfiture of Abolition an appropilate recompense for its faithlessness in the past , who nevertheless deprecated its introduction , and indulge in jeremiades over its passage . They are of that class of timid conMervatives who tremble at the slightest ruffle upon the surface of the waters . Theirs is an **29;148;TOOLONG harmless in private lifebut in public affairs the source of , uncounted ills . John llampden , at the exchequer bar , resisting the arbitrary exactions of a would-be despot , found as little sympathy from their anti-types as did Stephen A. Douglas from them when , in the Senate chamber of the Union , he married his name to , and staked his fortune upon , the great constitutional principle of Federal non-intervention . The last , as the first , may leave his fame to posterity . They will do him ample justice . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The present storm is but temporary in duration . There is more of thunder than of lightning in its clouds . Peculiar cir // cumatances have contributed to the apparent success of the agitators : and none more so than the present disor-. ganization of political parties . The defeat of General Scott by so overwhelming a majority , established the necessity of a re-organization of the political elements-and the blundering policy of the administration , in its efforts to arnalgamate the opposing factions of the majority , had already , in a great measure , obliterated old party lines . The introduction of a new subject of engrossing interest , involving necessarily intense sectional feeling , afforded under these circumstances too good an opportunity to be lost by the discontented spirits who hung upon the out-skirts of the old parties . Hence , as a very natural consequence , the fusion now in progress , striking terror by the apparent strength of abolition into the hearts of the despondent . We confess that the success of the agitators has surpassed our expectations-hut we do not despond . Our confidence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assaults of its internal , as well as external foes . We can not but believe that a higher destiny than we have ever yet approximated , is reserved in the counsels of Omnipotence for our Republic . Our trust is reposed undoubtingly on Him whose mighty arm , in days gone by , bath gotten us the victory . It is fashionable just now to declaim against the aggressions of pro-slavery , and to speculate upon the ulterior designs of the South . A recent able writer , in reviewing the parties and politics of our country , very adroitly puts forward the pro-slavery party , as the successful party of our history , and ttributes to the South ulterior designs , well calculated as represented to awaken antagonism in the North . It is the old fable of the fox and the lamb in another form . The aggressions of pro-slavery have this extent , and no more , that within the limits of her constitutional rights , she has resisted with more success of late than formerly , the advance of her assailants . The ulterior design of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to content herself with nothing less than equality in the Union , or independence out of it . Unwelcome as to her is the thought of separation from her Northern sisters , Abolition has forced her to count the cost ; and if aggression is not to be stayed , she is prei*ared for the worst . She has within herself the elements of a commercial independence and material prosperity , which a kind Providence has vouchsafed to none other upon earth . With the command of the mouth of the Mississippi , and the monopoly of the cotton trade of the world , she may laugh the puny efforts of her enemies to scorn . We know that there are men at the North who believe that this Union is indissoluble , and contemptuously ridicule the idea of Southern secession . They profess to believe , and perhaps do believe , that the veneration for the Union lies too deep seated in the hearts of our people to be eradicated by any legislation . It is a fatal error , kindred in its origin , it may be in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its brightest jewels . That man has studied American character and American l ) istory to little purpose , who vainly imagines that with our people , the halo of past glories can obscure the sense of present wrong . Had we been easily defrauded of our rights by pleas of such nature , these States had been still appendages to the ocean-girt isle . With her we had in common , " the language of Shakespeare , the code of Blackstone , and the creed of Christ , " and the blood-stains of common battle fields had scarce dried upon the vestments . The assumptions of the British parliament were practically far less obnoxious to the Southern colonieM , than are now the dogmas of Abolition . Their mother was kinder then than their sisters now . But Old England bent the bow too far , and New England " may profit by her example . " The same spirit that in 76 made the cause of Boston the cause of all , still exists among us . Rouse not the lion from his lair . We would live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are content that by-gones be by-gones . But there can be no peace until the North agrees to let the slavery question alone . If slavery be the sin and evil they conceive it , it is all ours ; to borrow the words of a fanatical preacher in the West- " ours by solemn compact ; our small-pox , our cholera , our plague , our leprosy . " The writer to whom we have previously referred , admits that some years since " every intelligent and judicious Northener was glad to concede that slavery was a system exclu*ively within the control of the States . " We beg to know what new light has dawned upon them , to modify their construction // Dec. of constitutional right . If no assault upon slavery in the States be designed , why this warfare against the entrance of the South into the territories ? Has there been any other single question presented to our people , upon which sectional lines have been drawn ? Combinations of men from the North and the South have sustained , and similar combinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective tariffs , and every contested measure of federal policy . Upon this single question is the South a unit . The worm , when trodden under foot , will turn upon the oppressor , and the unanimity of the South here is explicable upon the instincts of self-defence . The interdiction of slavery in the territories is avowedly designed as an indirect blow at the same institution in the States , from direct attacks upon which , all , save the most radical fanatics , admit that the Constitution protects us . The policy of Abolition is to encircle us with a cordon of free States , and thus to confine us in the limits of the present slave territory , until the increase of that class of our population shall coerce emancipation , if not amalgamation . We do not desire to dwell upon the dark future which the success of such a policy foreshadows . By Southampton and Hayti the South is forewarned , and forewarned , she is forearmed . We had designed to notice the impudent claim which is asserted for " the outcast republicans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own property , because " our form of society can never advance beyond a semi-barbarism . " We envy not the heart that could conceive , or the tongue that could utter such a sentiment , libelling as it does , without discrimination , the whole body of a Christian community . However , the statement of the proposition carries with it to every fair-minded man its own reply , and time and space admonish us to hurry to a close . We have endeavored to discuss this question calmly and philosophically ; and to the sober reason of our readers-to the calm thinkers of the North-we appeal . What good has been accomplished , and what good may be accomplished by this war against us ? As for the evil it may yet evoke , no man can anticipate its extent . It should be enough for every patriot and every Christian to know that in this matter is involved the perpetuity of the American Union . There is no room for concealment or disguise . In no spirit of idle gasconade-in no ebullition of temporary passion  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South protests her high resolve . No apparent excitement pervades the masses of her people . Upon the Nebraska question she maintained , throughout , an unusual silence . Not loud in its expression , but deep and strong is the feeling that animates her masses . With the intensest interest they gaze from a distance on your fields of political strife , and await the result in anxious suspense . The issue is now fairly joined , and fidelity to the Republic admits of no neutrality . Abolition hangs boldly out her banner , inscribed with these treasonable devices - THE REPEAL OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW-THE RE5TORATION OF THE MIssouRI COMPROMIsE - No MORE SLAVE STATES-NO MORE SLAVE TEHEITOHIES . Under its folds are rallying an imposing array . T is idle to close the eye to the peril of the day . Sectionalism is arming for a struggle of life or death . No sane man imagines that success , in any of her designs , is consistent with the stability of the Union . When the North shall repudiate her constitutional obligations , by repealing an act to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitutionwhen the defunct restrictive policy of excluding us and ours from the common territory of the Union shall be revived - when the covenant with Texas shall be ignored  --  and the hand of fellowship be refused to an incipient State , unless she rejects our socinl polity-when thus a circle of fire is forming around us , and the preponderance of the hireling States to an extent sufficient to amend the Constitution , and invest the Federal Government with control over our institutions-ensured at no distant daywhen all , or either of these events shall occur , the time for separation will have more than arrived . If upon them or either of them our Northern brethren are madly bent , we had better part , while we may part in peace .
