// qwq THE improvements of modern ingenuity in chemistry and mechanics may be attributed to a very simple cause , acting in conjunction with the superior intelligence of the northern races ; to the prevalence , namely , of the idea of general utility , or of the adaptation of nature to man , of the matter to the spirit . Until ingenuity and machinery shall have done their best , we can not regard the destiny of man , the master of inferior natures , as fn , lly accomplished . The hard and refractory substances of the earth , the chemical operation of rain , air , and sunbeams , the force of winds and waters , and the powers of life and of decomposition , of fire , electricity , and attraction , must be thoroughly mastered . Every comfort for the prolongation of life , every aid to health and physical happiness must be secured , and its art and science perpetuated in books and in tradition , for the happiness of men in this life . It is the duty of living creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may resemble their beneficent Creator in the n*aking of good and useful works . It is only necessary to show that any thing is conducive to happiness ; immediately it becomes important and meritorious . All things may be measured by that rule , from the doctrines of Christianity to the arts of agriculture and mechanics . All things are indeed not equally enjoyed by all , but all things are enjoyed by great multitudes ; and the distaste of one or of many persons for this or that comfort or luxury , is no evidence against it . There are a few who eat no bread , and others who have no ear for musical sounds ; but music is not therefore less the consoler , nor bread the sustainer of life . Let us then remove ourselves from the sect of Utilitarians , and pass into the higher intellectual grade of those whose aim it is to promote happiness and comfort in every shape and every degree . The arts of music , of poetry , and of representation by forms and colors , have in all ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the life , of nations . Poetry and music , the vehicles of inspiration , and painting of historic honors , convey purer and more elevated emotions of delight than the finest arts of cookery or upholstery . Those who have improved them  --  the Mutons , Raphaels , and Mendelssohns of modern times , and the Homers and Phidiases of antiquity-receive great honor in history , net for any abstract reason , but simply because their works continue in after ages to please and console humanity . When we compare the pictures of our own artists with the hideous daubs of Mexico , the notion presents itself of an intelligence greatly superior and cultivated in our own race . Our pictures give pleasure ; they please all , // qwq ear , though not deaf , enjoys no music . The dull palate has no delicacy of taste ; the dull eye requires flaunting colors to excite it . Nature does all things , well or ill , with indifference ; she causes the seed to grow and become a tree , or she destroys it with a frost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deformity of nature 's operations , by a peculiar vision , the faculty of imaginative taste , of imaginative seeing and hearing , which , through the medium of the senses , looks into the life , and discovers the utility and beauty or the mischief and deformity that lie in all things . We hold it necessary to the artist that he should possess a powerful faculty of discrimination between the beautiful and sublime , and the deformed and vulgar that he sees in men and nature . Whether he must be a sublime or beautiful person himseLt ; is a question we need not meddle with ; enough that , with a powerful talent of discrimination in all that gives pleasure or pain , through impressions made upon the eye and ear , the first condition is satisfied for the making of an artist . What is immediately painful or pleasing to the mind , is also agreeable or disagreeable to the sense . There is no music in a succession of horrid sounds , and no picture in a collection of dirty shadows . It is consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense ; as needful to him as a delicate touch to the violinist , or a susceptible wrist to a piano player . He mus*have cultivated his perception of shadows , boundaries , and colors , of distances and airy perspectives , as the violin player has cultivated touch . The faculty must be strong by nature , and stronger by education . Nor will it be less necessary for him to have cultivated a naturally lively imagination to the highest perfection , so that no ordinary critic can decide against him in regard to what is or is not beautiful in nature . To know also , by his active analytic senses , the combinations of shadows and colors that produce those general effects upon the mind which we call beauty , deformity , siblimity , commonness , those curious adhesions of the sublime and common which are styled ridiculous , or those that amuse without alarming or disgusting the imagination , but move only laughter and the humorous feelings , must be as well known to him . He must be able to build or construct an assemblage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one of them , or he can not be esteemed an artist . It is not enough that he perceives the beauty of a particular landscape , and can put it in all its colors and shadows on the canvas ; he must recognize its parts , describe the merit of each feature in relation to the others , and must be able to construct another landscape on the canvas , or another human face , more beautiful even than any of the originals . Trees , rocks , rivers , nose , eyes , lips , the mouth , the hand , the stature , all colors and their tints , must be the alphabet and vocabulary of his art-language , with which , and the phrases of nature , he will compose a poem of forms and colors-a work of pictorial art . By natural talent and fine observation he collects the detail ; by his imaginative power he works out the ideal . The one is nothing without the other . Imitation without the ideal of beauty is no better than a laborious kind of daguerreotyping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the best of imitators . Though imitation is pleasing in itself , it is so evidently a work of sense , and so imperfect when executed by the hand , that very few are content with it . It is impossible to imitate correctly the changes of light upon a landscape , or those of expression in the human face ; for these , if followed , melt into one another , and reduce all imitations to a meaningless mixture or neutrality ; like a muddy mixture of colors , in which the singleness and purity of living expression is utterly lost . The same face is one thing now , and the next moment it has changed . The same landscape has never the same light for a single minute of the day , and each day differs from its predecessor . The imitator is reduced to the copying of what is called " still life , " flowers , dishes , plate , the interiors of rooms , metals and precious stones ; and even here the variations of his own perception deceive him ; the yellow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the pulses of the heart , and no picture or object is the same before and after a hearty meal , or a fit of melancholy or laughter . Clearly , an artist must have ideas . He must be able to fix a piece of human beauty or of landscape pleasure in his mind 's eye , and keep it there as firmly as a moral sentiment . But he can not hold it unless he himself // is endowed with steadiness of purpose . The ideas of great painters are very fixed and still ; they grow , like crystals , from an unchangeable nucleus . Pictures are made as trees grow , by the development of a germ ; and so also are they painted . The art itself is learned in this way , and not by the study of any chains of detail . The artist may first study noses , then eyes , and then other features in succession : it is very well for his hand to do this ; he acquires thereby a certain skill , and it will help him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it brings him no nearer to his purpose . A tree is not a multitude of leaves , no more , indeed , than a picture is a multitude of little dabs of paint . To lay on one dab of paint requires some skill of hand , and to know how to copy a leag some skill of imitation , and that is all . A tree at a thousand yards ' distance does not show leaves to the painter , but only masses of shadows and lights ; no one tree is like another , nor will any good artist paint a tree from nature , unless he intends it for a portrait of the Charter Oak . Ideas of trees , ideas of noses , eyes , lips , ideas of all living objects , ideas of mountains , lakes , and of all the elements of view , are present in the mind of the young artist , long before the anatomy of a leaf or of a human body has appeared to him . The delicate idea , the germ , so to speak , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more strictly a feeling than a thought. * As , to an artist of fine susceptibility , the tone of a bell will suggest a musical composition , so will a flash of scenery , passing through the mind , and awakening certain harmonies of color , and of light and shade , suggest a composition to the melodist of the eye , the true painter . The picture does not appear to him with all the details of features , or of leaves , rocks , and rivers ; no more than the first conception of the PRIDE of the fallen Archangel was attended , in the imagination of Milton , with all the colors , lights , and shadows of the Paradise Lost . A momentary flash of imaginatio*i , a glimpse , if we may so speak , of the Prince of Darkness standing on the mount , from which he cursed the sunlight ; a dnsk shadow of sorrowful eclipse over the beauty of the fair earth ; the feeling of his purpose , the destruction of the noblest work of the Almighty ,  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germ or nucleus of his work ! Let the idea of maternal love , the mother and the infant , rise , pure and powerful , in the vivid , but slow and grasping imagination of the artist ; it is caught on its way through spirit-land , and made the living soul of a picture . The detail growing out of this first conception belongs to it , as the leaves and flowers to the tree it germinates in a form ; it has no outline , it is a balance of lights and shadows , harmonized and gradated ( there is no other word ) in the figure and features , the attire and localities of the artist 's own experience , or in the simple drapery and naked space of a classical school . How , then , does he achieve it ? The admirable inventions of the chemists have removed out of his path almost every mechanical obstacle . The pure colors and their transparent vehicles , as solid and as durable as glass ; delicate pencils , and the white and solid plane of the canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful and tender , is evanescent and marvellously delicate ; he must fix it in light and shade , and that speedily , or it may never rise again to him in as sweet a form as now . With a mind charged but not weakened by the rich conception , the idea of maternity , divine and eternal in its essence , he suffers his imagination to assume the form that embodies it in all its purity and simplicity : the figures of a woman and an infant , in some attitude suggested by the first form of the idea , are put in light outlines , mere guides for the hand , to be presently obliterated by lights and shadows that express form , and speedily thrown upon the canvas ; or if the artist is of a slow and cautious temper , they are sketched in , line by line ; memoranda , leaves of growth , showing the gradual expansion and embodiment of the feeling in a form proper to its expression . This artist is no experimenter ; what he intends to do , he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , orderly , solid , and harmonious . The ground is marked out , he has now to lay the foundation . Light and shade , that body , of which imagination is the soul ; color , the ornament and pleasure of that body , the garment and splendid drapery of pictured thought , like the expressed meaning and the rhythmic flow of poems , must be chosen and composed with a skill and power adequate to the idea . Nature makes all together ; form , body , // and color , grow up and expand together equally . Art , on the other hand , as it is analytic and exclusive in its study and choice , so also it creates and achieves separately the several parts of the unity it wishes to produce ; and to this , too , it is necessitated by the nature of its materials , proceeding from the idea to the outline ; from the outline to the body , in which outline disappears , or rather in which it is absorbed ; and finally , from the naked body to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and body are together taken up and transfigured . In the first idea , as in the embryo , all the conditions of the work are predetermined , and receive their unity , as in the seed we find the species and character of the tree . Its life is feeling , the sentiment of love taking shape in the workings of imagination ; and as beauty is the natural figure of love , beauty becomes its vehicle in art ; and just in proportion as its sensuosity and passion is more solid and complete , it seeks more the aid of color to give it warmth and life . The invention of a picture does not differ in its principle or its method from the invention of a new art or of a new machine ; it is only in the feeling that prompts them that we find their true difference . The one gives pleasure to the faculties of economy , and pleases by the physical comfort it secures ; the other addresses the heart , and charms by the pure and full expression of a n&amp;tural emotion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception of a want , or of a natural obstacle to be subdued for the general advantage of men , and which is now harshly and cruelly interposed between desire and life , between the goods of life and their enjoyment . His aim is to discover the means by which the air and earth , the water , the fire , and the steel , may be persuaded to perform a certain work , hitherto painfully and laboriously performed by human hands , or the slow labor of animals . His object is rather to subdue the pains and increase the com*rts of all men equally ; and by accomplishing this , he secures for himself also the right to live , and is justified in his own dsmands upon the labor of others . The artist , on the other hand , binds himself to satisfy , not the wants of the body , but the desire of the heart , of which the true delight and urgent necessity is to find expression for its feelings and ideas . He that can satisfy this longing for expression is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a picture or a poem , a piece of music or a statue ; it is art in many shapes , expression making choice of many different vehicles , addressing the mind through different senses . Language , being in general the most powerful and copious organ of expression , has been employed in all ages to embody the sublimest emotions , and those who have so employed it , rank first in the heraldry of genius . Next to these , in modern times , we rank the painters and statuaries , who have embodied in marble or in color the greater passions of the human and divine nature . These two classes of artists have more than satisfied the world , have even surpassed and far exceeded the expectations of men . Every thing that is godlike in humanity has been embodied in the majesty of words , and in the dignity and beauty of painted and sculptured forms . They carry us beyond ourselves ; and in seeking consolation from their expressions , we find ourselves elevated into a region of sublime passions , whose truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we attribute inspiration to those who had the power of expressing them . And yet , we can not tell to what height even we ourselves might attain , were all obstacles removed and all difficulties overcome . Naure is the same , we know , and offers to the modern artist as grand and beautiful a field as to those of antiquity . Modern ingenuity has removed a thousand hindrances in the way of the painter . The passions of the heart and the noble impulses of the better nature are in no wise changed . If we can not express them in such a style as will satisfy the desires of others , it is our own fault ; either a fault of ability , which we are unwilling to admit , or a fault of aim , which , without shame , we may allow . In the invention and production of a fine picture , a degree of knowledge and of labor is involved , which must absorb the entire force and intelligence of the artist . In the conception , or first idea , there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes first , as of heroism , generosity , pity , or parental love ; the pleasure of the landscape , the joys of conviviality , the passions , the griefs , in all their mixtures and phases . The artist is already familiar with these , or // with the one , at least , which he wishes to express . If not familiar with it , he can not give to it the spirit and tone of originality ; it will be false and studied , or stiff and affected . Of false and stiff pictures a great number are painted by artists of merit even in our country , because they have not the courage or the pride to avoid that which they can not do well . They are thus driven into the open field of plagiarism , and compose pictures in which there is only a theatric appearance of sentiment , and not the true and natural expression of it . Pictures of this class excite only a transient admiration , from their merit as " imitations of nature , " or of other artists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be original must be also thoughtful and observant . He must be accustomed to meditation , in order to acquire the power of bringing up into the clear light of thought , natural images of the passions , and landscape scenes fitted to that phase of rural sentiment or pastoral feeling which he intends to express . The forms of nature are firmly impressed upon the fibre of his brain ; he has only to call them out of the cavern of memory , where they lurk since childhood , and the trees , rocks , mountains , clouds and lakes , the sweet traces of tenderness on the human countenance , will come forth kindly , and accurately guide his hand in the composition of his work . It is not necessary for the landscape painter to have a tree b*ore him in order that he may design a tree . Thousands of trees , scraggy and low , or overarching and majestic , the first deep and highly colored impressions of childhood , are printed in the dark chamber of the brain . He may correct the deficiencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nature for design , nature will joke with and delude him . Her scenes are indeed the originals of his thoughts , but she does not offer them to him in a permanent form ; her landscapes are mere dissolving views , a thousand in an hour . He must imitate her in the material , but the composition is his own , and is merely the vehicle of a sentiment . He must observe her laws and select her instances , but he must not attempt to copy her moving features . She offers her variety to him , but looks to him for the exercise of a choice and of a power as varied and creative as her own . Standing before the blank canvas , laboring in the expression of a feeling , he will discover , to his own astonishment , that the line of beauty lives in his hand ; and with no other aid from present nature than the mere proportion , a beautiful outline , clear , sweet and expressive , will appear to him as if by magic . If he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given to his work the air and merit of originality . The picture is begun with free and temporary outlines , the first hints , notes , and memoranda of the work . The outlines of the master are simple edges of shadows . In nature there are few hard boundaries ; bad artists , on the contrary , begin with and exhibit them in every stage  --  a good artist in no stage-of the work . The idea is now fixed ; it remains only to develop it . Imagination is satisfied ; the senses must have their turn , the detail must be laid in . First , the detail of form and of relief ; and by what better or more rapid method can these be developed than by a simple black and white , a pure chiaroscuro , light and shade , worked carefully and strongly , over the entire canvas ? Every thing solid , the ribs and skeleton of the picture may be completed in this second stage . Painting being the art of giving to a flat surface the hollowness , the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective . First , there is the perspective of outline , or geometrical perspective . Not the ridiculous " linear " kind , so called in works of drawing and the encyclopaxlias . The straight lines of this false perspective have no existence in nature , and are not of the slightest value in art . The lines of horizontal edges and level surfaces , above and below-as , for example , those of a long wall , along which the eye glances towards the horizon-are truly logarithmic curves ; they sag , drop down , or swell upwards , and do so less and less as we regard them at greater distances , and do not by any means plunge straight into a vanishing point , as we see them drawn in those choking performances called " first books , " and " easy lessons in drawing , " works by which the most promising artistic talent may be , and doubtless is , every year extinguished in many hundreds of young persons . To become an artist , it is first necessary to unlearn all that has been taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern drawing-master , with his mise // rable little " finished sketches , " bits of rocks , ears , noses , and " linear perspectives ; " the latter of which he is careful to teach separately , for the reason that it is a thing by itself ; and can not be applied . Wonderful ! exclaims the well-meaning , and otherwise " highly intelligent " teacher of youth , that so many thousands are taught dr*wing by the best masters , and so few ever attain the practice of art ! The reason is not far to seek : young pupils who learn " linear " perspective and the art of drawing in hard outline , have learned literally nothing . They know nothing of shadows , nor of the entireness or unity of a picture ; not even the faintest attempts are made to teach them these things , and , after years of lessons , the most they can do is to copy line for line the cold and shallow sketehes of a drawing-master . Setting aside the falseness of " linear " perspective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what is called " sketehino* " as taught by Mr. Rubbery , the fashionable drawing-master , let us consider the method of his teaching . Young persons who are taught music are not made to play tunes , nor the first five or six notes of a cavatina* as a lesson ; the music teacher who wishes to advance his pupil , does not set for a lesson the six middle notes of a miserable tune , nor even two or three measures of an overture ; but the drawing-master does what is fully equivalent to this , when he employs his pupil in " sketching , " from some " drawing-book , " a stump of a tree or a cluster of scratchy leaves . The drawing-master sickens his unhappy pupil over " outlines , " for the sake , he will tell you , of " cultivating his eye for proportion . " When the pupil looks at objects in nature , he sees no outlines , but only shadows and lights ; his knowledge is consequently of no use to him , and he must forget all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even a draughtsman . Two methods of drawing are employed by genuine artists in their work : by one , they lay in the shadows on a light ground ; by the other , they lay in the lights upon a dauk ground ; and in every picture both methods are used alternately , as the case may require . Pupils of drawing-masters learn Aeither ; for if the charcoal or the crayon is placed in their hands , they are employed , for the most part , in imitating the lines of a crayon lithograph placed before them as a copy ; and when they have learned to do this perfectly , it is supposed that *they have learned to draw . On the contrary , their studies have vitiated the artistic faculty , and henceforth they will produce only bad copies or worse modifications of their originals . They can not represent any thing , much less compose a picture from an idea of their own . The music-master does not teach his pupil to play " sketches " of airs , marking here a note and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret of harmony ; nor does he drill her on the jews-harp , but always with the best and fullest instrument he can gain access to . The drawing-master and his pupils do what is quite as absurd , however , for they use the lead-pencil , the poorest of all drawing instruments , instead of the charcoal , the pen , or the color-brush ; and neither he nor his unfortunate pupils ever reach the idea of light and shadow , the harmony of representative art . To scratch , scrub , and sketch , to rub out bad work and put in worse , to make outlines , and labor at that scraggy style of delineation called in drawing-books " the picturesque , " is the occupation of their wasted hours for months , and even years , and they do not become artists ; though , if they have taste and moderate application , they would , in the same time , have become excellent musicians ; for the reason that the music-master knows how and what to teach . Pupils who have acquired a moderate facility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to observe the harmonies , the lights and shadows of music , in the scales and chords composed for them by great teachers , are immediately introduced to Mozart or Beethoven , or even to Handel , and their enthusiasm and delight are extreme . Soon they hope to give others the pleasure they enjoy , and become performers . The drawing-master , on the contrary , never imagines it is possible to teach his pupil the elegances and sublimities of the great painters , though he can obtain all the works of the very best of them , engraved equal to the originals , as far as regards drawing , light and shadow , and composition . He himself even does not pretend to keep company with Rubens or Angelo , even while his brother , the music-teacher in the next room , is absorbed in Haydn or Mendelssohn . He keeps down among his scratchy picturesque , as he styles it , in the region of English drawingbooks , and is well satisfied to indicate a rail fence , a stone cottage , or a ragged sheep , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing nor teaching , but a substitutein short , an expensive humbug , which gives pleasure to no one , and profit only to those who teach . Dismissing the drawing-master for the present , with his legion of perspiring pupils , and fleeced and disappointed patrons , let us return to the studio of the free and diligent artist , who , it may be , is an amateur , but who proceeds , for all that , upon right principles , and with a clear purpose . He is dissatisfiad with his skill in detail , and turns aside to exercise his hand . He is provided only with a bit of charcoal , the finest tool ever discovered for the production of shadows . Let us observe his proceedings . Wishing to acquire freedom of wrist in the delineation of the human figure , he has before him a plaster bust , or a statue , to draw from . He confines the light , causing it to fall in such a manner as to throw out the features in a bold relief . Points of light strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , and touch places where there is no light ; he must cover , with his dark and powerful pencil , what nature has hidden in her shadows , leaving what she has revealed . He works boldly , and almost carelessly , for over him the drawing-master has no power , and his wrist is not spellbound by the iron destiny of outline . The shadows go in roughly ; one by one , all are touched , and gradually strengthened and graded . The semblance of the object before him is forcibly drawn upon the paper . He repeats the process upon the same object , working from different points of view ; the freedom of his hand increases ; and after a few weeks , or even days , of this free labor , he finds that his drawing has improved , and that he is able to cope with the subject or idea . He does not make a Separate study of proportion , for this element of form is learned with light and shadow , and is embraced in it . He is not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he grapples first with the first difficulty , and lets others be overcome as they may . His study is for effect , and not for correctness ; correctness may satisfy the critics , but it does not affect the passions or the sentiments , and therefore he subordinates it . Master of the figure , he is ready to develop it upon the canvas , after the interior model of his thought . To aid memory and avoid the minor difficulties of drawing , and to give a clear and substantial frame-work , if we may so speak , to his ideal , he provides a sitter , " or living model ; not for copy , for now he is not painting a portrait , but to overcome , as we have already said , the minor difficulties , and to suggest the lesser details . Let us suppose that he has adopted the is ? iethod of Bartolomeo , and works out the entire piece in black and white with the brush before using color . This method has great advantages ; the entire force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it before the veil of color is drawn over this ground ; the material is exceedingly plastic and delicate , and takes every shade or gradation that may be required . The second kind of perspective , that of light and shadow , is here to be made out . The delusion of outline , the distinctness of the forms of objects , the contrasts of light and shade , and the expression or feature of every thing , is blurred or hazed over and softened by distance ; the intervals between all are filled with a kind of indistinctness , represented by grayness . Detail is lost . Shadows become gray spots , and lights turn to mere nebulosities . Here begin the serious difficulties of the art , as regards manipulation . By the proper sizes given to the objects , the first or true geometrical perspective was made out . By indistinctness of feature and softening of contrasts , the second kind was perfected . Here are two kinds of perspective already , both requiring the artistic eye , and great observation and judgment , to perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perspective of color . The progress of genius , and of art , is from generals to particulars , from the ideal to the actual , from the design to the detail ; as the tree grows from the germ to the bud , and by gradual unfolding to leaf , stem , flowers , and fruit . The first observations of the child are of masses of color , and of light and shade , and from these even to old age , particulars accumulate , until they hide and overwhelm the generalities . The genuine artist adopts the method of nature , for he masters first the general idea , and he proceeds in the education of his own talent from boyhood to manhood by that method : perfection comes of itself with the accumulation of experience . In like manner began and moved onward the great schools of art . // Beginning with mere termirti , corner-posts , on which a head was rudely carved , the Greek ideal added more and more of the detail toward the fuller expression of its thought , but always keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Phidias , and from Phidias to the artists who wrought at Rome under imperial patronage , becoming more and more minute , until they attained to portraiture , at the expense , at last , of the ideal itself . Italian painting in the days of Dante lived in the pale ideal of angelic beauty , and was developed in particulars by slow degrees , ending in the minuteness and mannerism of the later schools . American painters for the most part , and with only a few brilliant exceptions , begin at the reverse , and think they have become painters by the accurate representation of forms and colors from nature , without reference to the ideal . Hence we have as yet no school of art , but only a superior kind of Chinese fidelity ; the ideal is cherished only by a few , and the inferior talent of Europe surpasses us , because it adheres , both in form and color , in some degree to the methods of antiquity . Nature indicates a method congenial to the human intellect by her system of color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape into distances , where minuteness and detail are mostly lost . In the perspective of color we have a wonderful example of this method ; for in distan*e , all colors fade into blue , violet and azure , the colors of air , of distance , and of uncertainty ; the air comes down over the landscape even to the middle ground ; and in composing the solid skeleton of rocks and trees , in light and shade , without color , or in monochrome and white , only the foreground can be freely composed ; the colors alone , the transparencies of foliage , air , and clouds , making the principal merit of an air picture , as distinguished from a group of figures , or a piece of still life . Red gives body to the colors of the foreground , green and yellow prevai , l over the middle , and the distances pass away into azures . In sunset views , again , the scale is repeated . Red and orange burn on the horizon among dusky clouds , and the zenith is violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , then , we find our third order of perspective ; in color , from red to orange , thence to yellows olive , azure , violet ,  --  and repeated in the heavens . In the perspectives of color , the painter has a wonderful power given him of distancing all things in their just degrees by the imposition of transparent blue , in very thin films , over his body colors . The sides of mountains in shadow , in the distances of an air picture , are of all tints of azure and cerulean , through which the solid greens of foliage , and the reds of earth and rocks , make a very faint impression upon the eye , an impression which diminishes regularly with the distance , because it is the nature of these colors to lose their intensity with their distance . 1 . The painter is already familiar with the true " linear perspective , " as distinguished from the false , ( if unhappily he has been taught the latter at school ; ) he can order the heights and sizes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their distance . He is now master of the first kind of perspective , that which is expressed by points and lines . 2 . He has also noticed and can express the perspectives of light and shade , the softenings given by remoteness , ( not by mist , ) and the greater dependence to be placed on the imagination in distant objects . Lie will not make out the minutke of his objects in the middle ground , as if they were to be seen in miniature ; he will consider the power of the eye itself as it is clouded by remoteness . His picture is not to be seen through a telescope ; the excess of detail will either be lost , or it will drag the distances into the middle ground and the middle into the foreground . Figures far off will look like pigmies , and trees like shrubs , if they are overwrought , and the perspective of light and shade forgotten . 3 . The perspective of color requiring in the foreground the solid and comparatively opaque body colors of objects firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalence of blue , increasing in force with distance . It requires also that shadows shall have the accidental or harmonic hues appearing in them more decidedly as they are intended to appear more remote . The tinge of blue , communicated to all the shadows that relieve an orange or golden light , the tinge of clear green for a red light , and the veil of yellow changed by darkness into // green from purple lights , are strongly manifested in a well-managed landscape , as the eye traverses its perspectives . 4 . Even with all these , the full perspective of a picture is not made out . The density of air carrying a mist with it , obscures all objects more and more as they grow remote ; and this " air perspective " requires a peculiar skill to give it delicacy . Many painters rely exclusively upon this air perspective for atmospheric distances , being for the most part ignorant of the powerful perspective of color , having , indeed , heard nothing of it from others , and rarely discovering its laws themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole picture , as they say , to distance and soften , but it only obscures . Others rely upon a coat of oil , carrying an even body of transparent color , diffused over all objects ; and this , too , is only a species of sand cloud or material obscuration , and dulls the finest workmanship of the hand . Mist or air perspective will be seldom needed to give distance , if the color is justly managed , and the tints preserved in their transparency . The combined effect of the three first kinds of perspective  --  the " geometric " or true linear , that of light and shadow , and that of color-will give , with a perfectly clear air , an effect of distance equal to that of a reflection in a mirror ; and we see pictures so painted as to produce this illusion , but only by the best hands . The effect of all is due to the nature of the human eye , and may be styled th. physiological kinds , while the misty obscuration , sometimes and falsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more as a defect than as a merit ; being in fact the interposition of opaque particles between the eye and the object , like a cloud of dust . Beautiful effects are doubtless attained by it , but it is a monstrous trick of many painters to rely upon it altogether . To produce all of these effects , ( and we could point out several pictures by American artists which show them very beautifully and in full combination , ) it is clear , some method must be used in the laying on ? f color . A mixture of the primary colors , red , yellow , and blue , produces a neutral tint , which is muddy and unfit to be applied on canvas . One of the principal differences , pointed out by Merim6 in his admirable work on color , between the pictures of the old Italian school and the majority , of those of our day , is in the mixed and muddy colors of the one , and the clear transparency and vigor of the other . Nature and the art of chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in their purity . The colors of nature are clear and powerful , but they are never pure ; hardly in a March sky is clear red visible ; and in the human figure , every color is a medium , or rather a blending of all ; a circumstance which occasions great trouble and perplexity to those painters who imagine they are to mix tints of nature upon the palette before laying them upon the canvas . It is generally forgotten , too , that the tints of nature are transparent : thus , in a tree , the green of leaves is seen through the yellow cuticle of the leaf ; the blood of the skin glows through the skin itself , which is of a delicate yellow . To produce even a tolerable imitation of these effects , it becomes necessary to use the primary colors in the ancient manner , namely , to use them pure , to lay them one upon an other , selecting the most violent and powerful colors , and tempering one by the superposition of another . Leaves of trees may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper ground ; the ground , shining through , tempers the harshness , and gives the tender hue of vegetation . The strength and brilliancy of the chemical colors is quite lost and useless when mixed together promiscuously . Certain mixtures are indeed allowable , as of blue with yellow , of any prim*try color with any other ; but the double colors , orange , purple , and green , can not be mixed with their complementary primaries without producing an opaque and senseless neutrality . Let rich and glaring colors be laid in all their brilliancy upon the canvas ; then let their complementary tints be applied over them , and the transparent neutrality of nature is attained , and full power is given to the color of the picture . The aid rendered by the chemist is thus not thrown away , but fully and gratefully acknowledged by the artist . A great deal is said about toning and glazing , by superficial painters . By the process of toning , a uniform tint is glazed over the entire surface of the picture , so that all is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much improved by this operation ; its defects are hidden , and its harsh // ness corrected ; but the distances are brought near , the foreground distanced and the middle ground obscured , the finest harmonies of shadows and lights utterly obliterated . The shadow of a white house in a middle ground , under a yellow sunlight , is invariably of a pure ultramarine blue . Let us consider what would be the fate of this exquisite aerial harmony of golden lights and w*ure shade under the monotonizing process of glazing or toning . It is destroyed , and with it all the fine distances . If the picture is rightly painted from the first layer to the last , it will have the tone proper to it , without any superficial glazing of transparent color . If it is a golden sunset , let the shadows be " toned , " if you please , with azure ; the lights will now shine with double brilliancy . They were harsh and unpleasant , made of violent colors , now they are agreeable and harmonious . Hogarth has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bad one lies in the use of blue ; and we agree with him so far as to admit that a painter who can not mark the retreating surfaces of flesh and the shadows of a landscape with blue , without spoiling them , has not learned to finish a picture . It is impossible to fix the limits of illusion to which the art of painting may be carried , when the natural principles of coloring shall be recognized and acted on . The present haphazard of the palette being once discarded , and a rule adopted for the orderly building S up if we may *o phrase it , of a picture , incredible rapidity ' and finish will be attained . We subdue nature , says Lord Bacon , by observing her laws ; we aiso represent her by that process . Would one good artist and ingenious colorist devote himself to a study of the methods by which effects of color and distance are produced in nature , and by that study attain to an inviolable system of coloring , that should have its rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our days with a vigor far beyond all the productions of Italy . Already in certain pictures , by different hands , at the exhibition of the Art Union , we see the evidence of successful labor in this great department of art . A clear and beautiful style of coloring is slowly gaining the ascendency over the miserable palette style of the daubers , mixers and glazers . Clear harmonies , pure skies , transparent carnations , and deep shadows may be discovered in a few pieces . We may be satisfied with this advance : we have no fears for the art of painting in America , if it continues . The ideas of our best artists are generally fine and elevated ; and the mind of an educated American citizen may surely be compared , in force , power , and dignity of conception , to that of the European . We are now fighting with gross matter , working our way through mechanical obstacles ; when we have attained the requisite brilliancy and purity of color , we shall have leisure to look about us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
