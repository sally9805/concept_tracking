In the story of OSCAR is portrayed the career of a bright but somewhat headstrong boy , who was over-indulged by his parents , and who usually managed to " have his own way , " by hook or by crook . The book is designed to exhibit some of the bad consequences of acquiring a wayward and lawless spirit , and of falling into indolent , untruthful , and disobedient habits . These are its main lessons , intermingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less importance to the young . Winchester , Mass . ADVERTISEMENT . " PRECEPTS MAY LEAD BUT EXAMPLES DRAW . " " THE AIMWELL STORIES " are designed to portray some of the leading phases of juvenile character , and to point out their tendencies to future good and evil . This they undertake to do by describing the quiet , natural scenes and incidents of everyday life , in city and country , at home and abroad , at school and upon the play-ground , rather than by resorting to romantic adventures and startling effects . While their main object is to persuade the young to lay well the foundations of their characters , to win them to the ways of virtue , and to incite them to good deeds and noble aims , the attempt is also made to mingle amusing , curious , and useful information with the moral lessons conveyed . It is hoped that the volumes will thus be made attractive and agreeable , as well as instructive , to the youthful reader .

HUNTING FOR BIRDS ' NESTS . OSCAR . CHAPTER I. A KITCHEN SCENE . Bridget , the Irish servant girl , had finished the house-work for the day , and sat down to do a little mending with her needle . The fire in the range , which for hours had sent forth such scorching blasts , was now burning dim ; for it was early in October , and the weather was mild and pleasant . The floor was swept , and the various articles belonging in the room were arranged in their proper places , for the night . The mistress of the kitchen ,  - -  for Bridget claimed this as her rank , if not her title ,  - -  was humming a queer medley of tunes known only to herself , as her clumsy fingers were trying to coax the needle to perform some dextrous feat that it did not seem inclined to do in her hands . What she was thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , her revery was suddenly disturbed , and the good nature that beamed from her face dispelled , by the noisy clattering of more than one pair of little boots on the stairs . In a moment , the door opened with a jerk and a push , and in bounded three boys , with as little display of manners or propriety as so many savages might exhibit . The oldest directed his steps to the closet , singing , as he peered round among the eatables : " Eggs , cheese , butter , bread ,  --  Stick , stock , stone-dead . " " Biddy , " he continued , " I ' m hungry -- give me something to eat , quick . " Bridget paid no attention to this demand , but only twitched her needle with a little more energy . " I say , Biddy , " continued the boy , " what did you have for supper ? Come , give me some , I ' m half starved . " " And why did n't ye come when the supper was ready , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye wo n't ate with the rest , it 's not me that will wait upon ye , Master Oscar . " " Well , " continued Oscar , " if you wo n't help me , I guess I can help myself . Ralph , what did you have for supper ? " The boy addressed named over several articles , among which were cake and mince-pie , neither of which could Oscar find in the closet . " Where did you put the pie , Biddy ? " he inquired . " It ' s where ye wo n't find it , " replied Bridget , " that 's jist where it is . " " I bet I will find it , come now , " said Oscar , with a determined air ; and he commenced the search in earnest , prying into every covered dish , opening every drawer and bucket , and overhauling and disarranging every part of the closet . Bridget was just then in too irritable a mood to bear this provoking invasion of her realm with patience . In an angry tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he took no notice of the command . She repeated the order , making it more emphatic by calling him a " plague " and a " torment , " but he did not heed it . Then she threatened to tell his parents of his misconduct , but this had no effect . Oscar continued his search for some minutes , but without success ; and he finally concluded to make his supper of bread and butter , since he could find nothing more tempting to his appetite . The fact was , Oscar was getting in the habit of being absent from his meals , and calling for food at unseasonable hours , much to the annoyance of Bridget . She had complained of this to his mother several times , without effect ; and now she thought she would try a little expedient of her own . So , when she cleared away the supper-table that evening , before Oscar came home , she hid away the cake and pies with which the others had been served , and left only bread and butter in the closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rummaging for the hidden articles , had made her half an hour 's extra work , in putting things to rights again . As Oscar stepped out of the closet , after his solitary supper , he moved towards the youngest of the other boys , saying : " Here , George , open your mouth and shut your eyes , and I ' ll give you something to make you wise . " George declined the gift , but Oscar insisted , and tried to force it upon him . A struggle ensued , and both rolled upon the floor , the one crying and screaming with anger , and the other laughing as though he considered it good fun . George shut his teeth firmly together , but Oscar succeeded in rubbing enough of the mysterious article upon his lips to enable him to tell what it was . It proved to be a piece of pepper , a plate of which Oscar had found in the closet . This little experiment , however , did not leave George in a very pleasant frame of mind . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouting . Oscar called him a " cry-baby , " for making such a fuss about a little bit of pepper , which epithet did not aid him much in forgetting the injury he had received . After awhile , quiet and harmony were in a measure restored . Ralph and George got their school-books , and began to look over the lessons they were to recite in the morning ; but Oscar not only remained idle , himself , but seemed to try to interrupt them as much as possible , by his remarks . By-and-bye , finding they did not take much notice of his observations , he took from his jacket pocket a small tin tube , and commenced blowing peas through it , aiming them at his brothers , at Bridget , and at the lamp . Ralph , after two or three had taken effect on his face , got up in a pet , and took his book up stairs to the sitting-room . George scowled and scolded , as the annoying pellets flew around his head , but he did not mean to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soon lost her patience , as the peas rattled upon the newly-swept floor . " Git away with yer pays , Oscar , " said she ; " do n't ye be clutterin ' up the clane floor with ' em , that 's a good b'y . " " They ai nt ' pays , ' they are peas , " replied Oscar ; " ca n't you say peas , Biddy ? " " I do n't care what ye call ' em , " said Bridget ; " only kape the things in yer pocket , and do n't bother me with ' em . " " Who ' s bothering you ? " said Oscar ; " me ' pays ' do n't make any dirt -- they ' re just as clean as your floor . " " Ye ' re a sassy b'y , that 's jist what ye are . " " Well , what are you going to do about it ? " " Faith , if it was me that had the doin ' of it , I bet I ' d larn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I had to bate yer tin times a day . " " You would n't , though , would you ? " said Oscar ; and he continued the shower of peas until he had exhausted his stock , and then picked most of them up again , to serve for some future occasion . He had hardly finished this last operation , when his mother , who had been out , returned home . As soon as she entered the kitchen , George began to pour out his complaints to her . " Mother , " he said , " Oscar ' s been plaguing us like everything , all the evening . He got me down on the floor , and rubbed a hot pepper on my mouth , and tried to make me eat it . And he 's been rummaging all round the kitchen , trying to find some pie . And then he went to shooting peas at us , and he got Bridget real mad , and Ralph had to clear out , to study his lesson . I told him --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied his mother ; " I am sick of hearing these complaints . Oscar , why is it that I ca n't stir out of the house , when you are at home , without your making trouble with Bridget or the children ? I do wish you would try to behave yourself properly . You are getting the ill-will of everybody in the house , by your bad conduct . I really believe your brothers and sisters will begin to hate you , before long , if you keep on in this way . For your own sake , if for nothing more , I should think you would try to do better . If I were in your place , I would try to keep on good terms with my brothers and sisters , if I quarrelled with everybody else . " Oscar made no reply to this , and the subject was soon dropped . His mother was too much accustomed to such complaints of his misconduct , to think very seriously of them ; and he was himself so used to such mild rebukes as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boys , who all slept in one chamber , soon retired for the night ; but Oscar took no further notice of the occurrences of the evening , except to apply the nickname of " mammy 's little tell-tale " to George -- a title of contempt by which he often addressed his little brother . I am afraid that the title of " tell-tale " was not wholly undeserved by George . True , he often had just cause of complaint ; but he was too ready to bring whining accusations against his brothers and sisters , for every trifling thing . He complained so much that his mother could not always tell when censure was deserved . It had become a habit with him , and a dozen times a day he would go to her , with the complaint that Oscar had been plaguing him , or Ella had got something that belonged to him , or Ralph would not do this or that . George , who was the youngest of the children , was at this time seven years old ; Ralph was two years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , was about half way between thirteen and fourteen . They had two sisters . Alice , the oldest , was fifteen years of age , and Eleanor , or Ella , as she was commonly called , was about eleven . The father of these boys and girls was a shop-keeper in Boston . His business required so much of his attention , that he was seldom with his family , except at meal-times and nights . Even in the evening he was usually at the shop ; but when it so happened that he could remain at home after tea , it was his delight to settle himself comfortably down in the big rocking chair , in the well-lighted sitting-room , and to muse and doze , while Alice sang , and played upon the piano-forte . He had so many other cares , that he did not like to be troubled with bad reports of his children 's conduct , This was so well understood by all the family , that even George seldom ventured to go to him with a complaint . The management of domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she consulted her husband in regard to these matters only when grave troubles arose . I have thus briefly introduced to my readers the family , one of whose members is to form the principal subject of the following pages . CHAPTER II . OSCAR IN SCHOOL . The school which Oscar attended was held in a large and lofty brick building , a short distance from the street on which he lived . His brothers attended the same school , but his sisters did not , it being only for boys . The pupils numbered four or five hundred -- a good many boys to be together in one building . But though belonging to one school , and under the control of one head master , they did not often meet together in one assembly . They were divided into eight or ten branches , of about fifty scholars each , and each branch had its own separate room and teacher . There were however , only four classes in the whole school ; and a this time Oscar was a member of the first , or highest class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building , in which the entire school assembled on exhibition days , and when they met for the practice of singing or declamation . There were lively and merry times in the vicinity of the school-house , I can assure you , for half an hour before the opening of school , and for about the same length of time after the exercises closed . Four hundred boys can not well be brought together , without making some stir . Every morning and afternoon , as the pupils went to and from school , the streets in the neighborhood would for a few minutes seem to swarm with boys , of every imaginable size , shape , manners , dress , and appearance . Usually , they went back and forth in little knots ; and with their books and slates under their arms , their bright , happy faces , their joyous laugh , and their animated movements , they presented a most pleasing sight ,  --  " a sight for sore eyes , " as a Scotchman might say . If anybody disputes this , he must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most prompt and punctual of scholars , used occasionally to go to school in season to have a little fun with his mates , before the exercises commenced . One day , entering the school-room a little before the time , he put on an old coat which his teacher wore in-doors , stuck a quill behind his ear , and made a pair of spectacles from some pasteboard , which he perched upon his nose . Arranged , in this fantastical manner , he seated himself with great dignity in the teacher 's chair , and began to " play school-master , " to the amusement of several other boys . It so happened that the teacher arrived earlier than usual that day , and he was not a little amused , as he suddenly entered the room , and witnessed the farce that was going on . Oscar jumped from his seat , but the master made him take it again , and remain in it just as he caught him , with his great-coat , pasteboard spectacles and quill , until all the scholars had assembled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . This afforded fine sport to the other boys , but Oscar did not much relish the fun , and he never attempted to amuse himself in that way again . Illustration : Playing Schoolmaster I am sorry that this harmless piece of roguery is not the most serious charge that candor obliges me to bring against Oscar . But to tell the truth , he was not noted either for his studious habits or his correct deportment ; and there was very little prospect that he would be considered a candidate for the " Franklin medals , " which were to be distributed to the most deserving members of his class , when they graduated , the ensuing July . And yet Oscar was naturally a bright and intelligent boy . He was quick to learn , when he applied himself ; but he was indolent , and did not like to take the trouble of studying his lessons . Whenever he could be made to take hold of a lesson in earnest , he soon mastered it ; but the consciousness of this power often led him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then perhaps something would happen to prevent his preparing himself at all . A day or two after the " kitchen scene " described in the preceding chapter , Oscar was sitting at his desk in the school-room , with an open book before him , but with his eyes idly staring at a blackboard affixed to one of the walls . The teacher watched him a moment , and then spoke to him . " Oscar , " he said , " what do you find so very fascinating about that blackboard ? You have been looking at it very intently for several minutes -- what do you see that interests you so ! " Oscar hung his head , but made no reply . " Are you ready to recite your geography lesson ? " continued the master . " No , sir . " " Why do you not study it , then ' " " I do n't feel like studying , " replied Oscar . " Very well , " said the teacher , quite pleasantly ; " if you do n't feel like it , you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped out to the platform on which the teacher 's desk was placed . " There , " continued the master , pointing to a blackboard facing the school , " you may stand there and look at that board just as long as you please . But you must not look at anything else , and I would advise you not to let me catch your eyes turning either to the right or the left . Now mind and keep your eyes on the board , and when you feel like studying let me know . " Oscar took the position pointed out to him , with his back towards the boys , and with his face so near the blackboard , that he could see nothing else without turning his head -- an operation that would be sure to attract the attention of the master . At first he thought it would be good fun to stand there , and for awhile the novelty of the thing did amuse him a little . When he began to grow weary , he contrived to interest himself by tracing out the faint chalk-marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the blackboard . This afforded employment for his mind for a time ; but by-and-bye he began to grow tired and uneasy . His eyes longed to see something else , and his legs were weary of standing so long in one position . He wondered , too , whether the boys were looking at him , and whether they smiled at his strange employment . At last , after doing penance about an hour , his exhaustion got the better of his stubbornness , and on informing the master that he thought ho could study now , he was permitted to take his seat . After returning to his desk , Oscar had but little time to finish learning his geography lesson , before the class was called out to recite . As was too often the case , he was but half prepared . The subject of the lesson was New York State . Several of the questions put to Oscar were answered wrong , either wholly or in part . When asked what great lakes bordered on New York , he replied : " Lake Erie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , and correctly answered , Oscar exclaimed : " That 's what I meant -- Erie and Ontario ; but I was n't thinking what I said . " This was somewhat of a habit with Oscar . When he " missed " a question , he was very apt to say , after the next boy had answered it , " I knew , only I could n't think , " or , " I was just going to say so . " Another question put to him was , whether the water of the great New York lakes was fresh or salt . Oscar replied that it was salt . It is but justice to add , how ever , that nothing was said in the lesson of the day , on this point , although the question had occurred in a previous lesson . Noticing that several of the boys laughed at Oscar 's blunder , the teacher remarked : " That was a very foolish answer , Oscar , but you are not the first nor the wisest person that has made the same mistake . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is said that all their war vessels intended to navigate the lakes , were furnished with tanks and casks for carrying a full supply of freshwater ; and I have been told that an apparatus is still in existence in one of the Canadian navy yards , which the English government sent over , some years ago , for distilling fresh water from Lake Erie . But an American school-boy of your age ought to know better than this , if an English lord of the admiralty does not . These great lakes are among the remarkable features of our own country , and every American child should know something about them . I should suppose , " continued the teacher , " that a boy who could afford to look steadily at nothing for an hour , might take a little pains to inform himself about so common a matter as this , so as not to appear so ridiculous , when a simple question is asked him . " Before the lesson was concluded , Oscar made still another mistake . There was an allusion in the lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense amount of property in New York city was destroyed . When the teacher asked him how many buildings were said to have been consumed , he replied : " Three hundred and fifty -- five hundred and thirty -- no , three hundred and fifty . " " Which number do you mean ? " inquired the master . " I ai nt sure which it is , " replied Oscar , after a moment 's hesitation ; " it 's one or the other , I do n't know which . " " You are about as definite , " said the teacher , " as the Irish recruit , who said his height was five feet ten or ten feet five , he was n't certain which . But are you sure that the number of buildings burnt was either three hundred and fifty , or five hundred and thirty ? " " Why -- yes -- I -- believe -- it was one or the other , " replied Oscar , hesitatingly . " You believe it was , do you ? Well , I believe you know just nothing about the lesson . You may go to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question ; and after school I will hear you recite it , and remember , you will not go home until you can recite it . " The class continued their recitation , and Oscar returned to his seat , and commenced studying the lesson anew . It was already late in the afternoon , and as he did not like the idea of stopping after school , he gave pretty close attention to his book during the rest of the session . About fifteen minutes after the school was dismissed , he told the teacher he was prepared to recite , and he succeeded in getting through the lesson with tolerable accuracy . When he had finished , the teacher talked with him very plainly about his indolent habits in school , and the consequences that would hereafter result from them . " I would advise you , " he said , " to do one of two things ,  - -  either commit your lessons perfectly , hereafter , or else give up study entirely , and ask your father to take you from school and put you to some business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , if you will only give your attention to it ; but I despise this half-way system that you have fallen into . It is only wasting time to half learn a thing , as you did your geography lesson this afternoon . You studied it just enough to get a few indistinct impressions , and what little you did learn you were not sure of . It would be better for you to master but one single question a day , and then know that you know it , than to fill your head with a thousand half-learned , indefinite , and uncertain ideas . I have told you all this before , but you do not seem to pay any attention to it . I am sorry that it is so , for you might easily stand at the head of the school , if you would try . " Oscar had received such advice before , but , as his teacher intimated , he had not profited much by it . If anything , he had grown more indolent and negligent , within a few months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inquiry : " What did you think of the blackboard , Oscar ? Do you suppose you should know it again , if you should happen to see it ? " " What do you mean ? " he inquired , feigning ignorance . " O , you ' ve forgotten it a'ready , have you ? " continued Ralph . " You do n't remember seeing anything of a blackboard this afternoon , do you ? " " But who told you about it ? " inquired Oscar ; for though both attended the same school , their places were in different rooms . " O , I know what 's going on , " said Ralph ; " you need n't try to be so secret about it . " " Well , I know who told you about it -- 't was Bill Davenport , was n't it ? " inquired Oscar . Willie and Ralph were such great cronies , that Oscar 's supposition was a very natural one . Indeed , Ralph could not deny it without telling a falsehood , and so he made no reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a contemptuous tone : " The little , sneaking tell-tale -- I ' ll give him a good pounding for that , the first time I catch him . " " You ' re too bad , Oscar , " interposed his brother ; " Willie did n't suppose you cared anything about standing before the blackboard -- he only spoke of it because he thought it was something queer . " Seeing Oscar was in so unamiable a mood , Ralph said nothing more about the subject , at that time . CHAPTER III . PAYING OFF A GRUDGE . The morning after the events just related , as Ralph was on his way to school , he fell in with Willie Davenport , or " Whistler , " as he was often sportively called , by his playmates , in allusion to his fondness for a species of music to which most boys are more or less addicted . And I may as well say here , that he was a very good whistler , and came honestly by the title by which he was distinguished among his fellows . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , before they became threadbare , which gave his whistling an air of freshness and novelty that few could rival . It was to this circumstance -- the quality of his whistling , rather than the quantity -- that he was chiefly indebted for the name of Whistler . Nor was he ashamed of his nickname , as he certainly had no need to be ; for it was not applied to him in derision , but playfully and good-naturedly . Whistler and Ralph were good friends . There was a difference of between two and three years in their ages , Whistler being about twelve years old ; but their dispositions harmonized together well , and quite a strong friendship had grown up between them . A very different feeling , however , had for some time existed between Oscar and Whistler . They were in the same class at school ; but Whistler studied hard , and thus , though much younger than Oscar , he stood far before him as a scholar . This awakened some feeling of resentment in Oscar , and he never let slip any opportunity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On their way to school , on the morning in question , Ralph told Whistler of Oscar 's threat , and advised him to avoid his brother as much as possible , for a day or two , until the affair of the blackboard should pass from his mind . Whistler heeded this caution , and was careful not to put himself in the way of his enemy . He succeeded in eluding him through the day , and was on his way home from school in the afternoon , when Oscar , who he thought had gone off in another direction , suddenly appeared at his side . " You little tell-tale , you , " cried Oscar , " what did you tell Ralph about the blackboard for ! I ' ll learn you to mind your own business , next time , you mean , sneaking meddler . Take that -- and that , " he continued , giving Whistler several hard blows with his fist . The latter attempted to dodge the blows , but did not return them , for this he knew would only increase the anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and strength , as well as in the art of fisticuffs , that he could do just about as he pleased with him . The affray , however , was soon brought to an unexpected end , by a gentleman who happened to witness it . Seizing Oscar by the collar of his jacket , he exclaimed : " Here , here , sir ! what are you doing to that little fellow ? Do n't you know enough , you great lubber , to take a boy of your own size , if you want to fight ? Now run , my little man , and get out of his way , " continued the stranger , turning to Whistler , and still holding Oscar by the collar . Illustration : The Assault . Whistler hesitated for a moment between the contending impulses of obedience and manliness ; and then , drawing himself up to his full stature , he said , with a respectful but decided air : " No , sir , I have n't injured him , and I wo n't run away from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fellow , " continued the gentleman , somewhat surprised at the turn the affair was taking . " What is your name , sir ? " " William Davenport . " " And what is this boy 's name ? " " Oscar , " replied Willie , and there he stopped , as if unwilling to expose further the name of his abuser . " Well you may go now , Oscar , " said the gentleman , relinquishing his hold ; " but if you lay your hands on William again , I shall complain of you . " The two boys walked off in opposite directions , the gentleman keeping an eye upon Oscar until Whistler was out of his reach . A little knot of boys was drawn together by the circumstance just related , among whom was George , Oscar 's youngest brother . He witnessed the attack , but knew nothing of its cause . As he went directly home , while Oscar did not , he had an opportunity to report to his mother and Ralph the scene he had just beheld . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding day , which led to the assault ; for , seeing Oscar 's unwillingness to have anything said about it , he had not mentioned the matter to any one at home . Ralph was a generous-hearted boy , and in this case was actuated by a regard for Oscar 's feelings , rather than by fear . Oscar did not come home that night until after dark . As he entered the sitting-room , Alice , who was seated at the piano-forte , broke short off the piece she was playing , and said , looking at him as sternly as she could , " You great ugly boy ! " " Why , what 's the matter now ? " inquired Oscar , who hardly knew whether this rough salutation was designed to be in fun or in earnest ; " do n't I look as well as usual ? " " You looked well beating little Willie Davenport , do n't you think you did ? " continued his sister , with the same stern look . " I ' m perfectly ashamed of you -- I declare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as that . " " I do n't care , " replied Oscar , " I ' ll lick him again , if he does n't mind his own business . " As Oscar did not know that George witnessed the assault , he was at a loss to know how Alice heard of it . She refused to tell him , and he finally concluded that Whistler or his mother must have called there , to enter a complaint against him . Pretty soon Mrs. Preston entered the room , and sat down , to await the arrival of Oscar 's father to tea . She at once introduced the topic which was uppermost in her mind , by the inquiry : " Oscar , what is the trouble between you and Willie Davenport ? " " Why , " replied Oscar , " he ' s been telling stories about me . " " Do you mean false stories ? " " Yes -- no -- not exactly false , but it was n't true , neither . " " It must have been a singular story , to have been either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one story , I should like to know what it was . " " He told Ralph I had to stand up and look at a blackboard an hour . " " Was that false ? " " Yes , " said Oscar , for in replying to his mother , of late , he had usually omitted the " ma'am " ( madam ) which no well-bred boy will fail to place after the yes or no addressed to a mother ; " yes , it was a lie , for I need n't have stood there five minutes , if I had n't wanted to . " " Did you stand before the blackboard because you wanted to , or was it intended as a punishment for not attending to your lesson ! " " Why , I suppose it was meant for a punishment , but the master told me I might go to my seat , whenever I wanted to study . " " Then , " said Mrs. Preston , " after all your quibbling , I do n't see that Willie told any falsehood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had any idea of injuring you , when he told Ralph of the affair . He only spoke of it as a little matter of news . But even if he had told a lie about you , or had related the occurrence out of ill-will towards you , would that be any excuse for your conduct , in beating him as you did this afternoon ! Do you remember the subject of your last Sabbath-school lesson ? " Oscar could not recall it , and shook his head in the negative . " I have not forgotten it , " continued his mother ; " it was on forgiving our enemies , and it is a lesson that you very much need to learn . ' If ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses , '  - -  that was one of the verses of the lesson . It is noble to forgive , but it is mean to retaliate . You must learn to conquer your resentful spirit , or you will be in trouble all the time . I shall report this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember what he promised you , when you had your fight with Sam Oliver ? " Oscar remembered it very distinctly . On that occasion , his father reprimanded him with much severity , and assured him that any repetition of the fault would not go unpunished . Mr. Preston soon came in , and as the family sat at the tea-table , he was informed of Oscar 's misconduct . After scolding the culprit with much sharpness , for his attack upon Willie , he concluded by ordering him immediately to bed . Although it yet lacked two hours of his usual bed-time , Oscar did not consider his punishment very severe , but retired to his chamber , feeling delighted that he had got off so much easier than he anticipated . Indeed , so little did he think of his father 's command , that he felt in no hurry to obey it . Instead of going to bed , he sat awhile at the window , listening to the music of a flute which some one in the neighborhood was playing upon . Presently Ralph and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came up to keep him company . They amused themselves together for some time , and Oscar quite forgot that he had been sent to bed , until the door suddenly opened , and his father , whose attention had been attracted by the noise , stood before him . " Did n't I tell you to go to bed an hour ago , Oscar ? " he inquired . " Yes , sir . " " Why have n't you obeyed me , then ? " " Because , " said Oscar , " I ' ve got a lesson to get to-night , and I have n't studied it yet . " " If you ' ve got a lesson to learn , where is your book ? " inquired his father . " It ' s down stairs ; I was afraid to go after it , and so I was trying to coax Ralph to get it for me . " " O , what a story ! " cried George ; " why , father , he has n't said one word about his book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremity , had hastily framed a falsehood , trusting that his assurance would enable him to carry it through . And he would probably have succeeded but for George ; as Ralph , in his well-meant but very mistaken kindness for Oscar , would not have been very likely to expose him . But the lie was nailed , and Oscar 's bold and wicked push had only placed him in a far worse position than he occupied before . His father , for a moment , could scarcely believe his ears ; but this feeling of astonishment soon gave way to a frown , before which Oscar cowered like a sheep before a lion . Mr. Preston was a man of strong passions , but of few words . Having set forth briefly but in vivid colors the aggravated nature of Oscar 's three-fold offence , his attack upon Willie , his disobedience when ordered to bed , and the falsehood with which he attempted to cover up his disobedience ,  - -  he proceeded to inflict summary and severe chastisement upon the offender . It was very rarely that he resorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case where it was imperatively demanded . Silence reigned in the boys ' chamber the rest of the night . Oscar was too sullen to speak ; Ralph silently pitied his brother , not less for the sins into which he had fallen than for the pain he had suffered ; and George was too much taken up with thinking about the probable after-clap of this storm , to notice anything else . Oscar was fond of his bed , and was usually the last one of the family to rise , especially in cool weather . On the morning after the occurrences above related , he laid abed later than usual even with him . His father had gone to the store , and the children were out-doors at play , before he made his appearance at the breakfast-table . He sat down to the deserted table , and was helping himself to the cold remnants of the meal , when his mother entered the room . Oscar noticed that she looked unusually sad and dejected . After sitting in silence a few moments , she remarked : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not sleep half an hour last night , and now I am not fit to be up from my bed -- and all on your account . I am afraid your misconduct will be the death of me , yet . I used to love to think how much comfort I should take in you , when you should grow up into a tall , manly youth ; but I have been sadly disappointed , so far . The older you grow , the worse you behave , and the more trouble you make me . Do you intend always to go on in this way ? " Oscar nervously spread the slice of bread before him , but made no reply . His mother continued her reproofs , in the same sad but affectionate tone . She appealed to his sense of right , to his gratitude , and to his hopes of future success and respectability in life . She described the sad end to which these beginnings of wrong-doing would inevitably lead him , and earnestly besought him to try to do better , before his bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pale , haggard cheeks , down which tears were slowly stealing , touched the feelings of Oscar . Moisture began to gather in his eyes , in spite of himself . He tried to appear very much interested in the food he was eating , and to look as though he was indifferent to what his mother was saying . And , in a measure , he did succeed in choking down those good feelings which were beginning to stir in his heart , and which , mistaken boy ! he thought it would be unmanly to betray . Yes , he was mistaken -- sadly mistaken . Unmanly to be touched by a mother 's grief , and to be moved by a mother 's tender entreaties ! Unmanly to acknowledge that we have done wrong , or to express sorrow for the wrong act ! Unmanly to resolve to resist temptation in the future ! Where is this monstrous law of manliness to be found ? If anywhere , it must be only in the code of pirates and desperadoes , who have renounced all human laws and ties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to start as soon as he had finished his breakfast . Had he not stifled the better promptings of his heart , and thus done violence to his nature , he would not have left his mother without assuring her that he felt sorry for his misconduct ; for he did feel some degree of regret , although he was too proud to acknowledge it . His mother , however , saw some tokens of feeling which he could not wholly conceal , and she left him with a sad heart , but with the hope that at least some faint impression had been made upon him . And , indeed , some impression was made upon Oscar 's heart . The feeling of sullenness with which he awoke , had subsided into something resembling " low spirits . " Nor was this all the effect his mother 's conversation had upon him . As he lay awake in the morning , he had planned the secret destruction of a beautiful sled which had been given to George , the winter previous , and which was very precious in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean and revengeful design . Little George thus escaped the dreaded " after-clap , " but he never knew what a blow it would have been , nor how near he came to feeling its full force . CHAPTER IV . THE HOTEL . One of Oscar 's most intimate companions was a boy of about his own age , named Alfred Walton , who attended the same school with him . Alfred 's father was dead ; but he had a step-father , whom he called father , and with whom he lived . His home was to Oscar a very attractive one ; for it was a public house , and had large stables and a stage-office attached , and was usually full of company . Alfred 's step-father was the landlord of the hotel , and of course he and his young friends were privileged characters about the premises . Oscar and Alfred were together a great deal of the time , when out of school , and quite a warm friendship existed between them . On Wednesday and Saturday afternoons , and during the other play hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel premises , or riding on the coaches with Alfred . He only regretted that he could not stay there altogether ; for he thought it must be a fine thing to live in such a place , where he could do pretty much as he pleased , without anybody 's interference . Such , at least , seemed to be the privilege of Alfred ; for everybody , from his step-father down to the humblest servants , appeared to have too much other business on their hands to give much attention to his boyish movements . Oscar made many acquaintances at the hotel , not a few of which were anything but desirable for a boy of his age and character . He was on chatty terms with all the stage-drivers , hostlers , and servants about the premises , and also got acquainted with many strangers who stopped there for a season . He was very fond of listening to the stories of the drivers and other frequenters of the stage-office , and he would sit by the hour , inhaling the smoke of their cigars , admiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked . Much of this conversation was coarse and even vulgar , such as a pure mind could not listen to without suffering contamination , or at least a blunting of its delicate sensibilities . It is a serious misfortune for a youth to be exposed to such influences , but Oscar did not know it , or did not believe it . Among the hangers about the stable , was a queer fellow who went by the name of Andy . His real name was Anderson . He was weak-minded and childish , his lack of intellect taking the form of silliness rather than of stupidity . Indeed , he was bright and quick in his way , but it was a very foolish and nonsensical way . He was famous among all the boys of the neighborhood , for using strange and amusing words , and especially for a system of spelling on which he prided himself , and which is not laid down in any of the dictionaries . He afforded much sport to the boys , who would gather around him , and give him words by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he would mis-spell the most simple words , was quite amusing to them . He never hesitated , nor stopped to think , but always spelt the given word in his peculiar way , just as promptly as though he did it according to a rule which he perfectly understood . One Saturday afternoon , as Oscar and Alfred were looking about the stable , Andy suddenly made his appearance , and asked them for a bit of tobacco . Both of the boys , by the way , wished to be considered tobacco-chewers , and usually carried a good-sized piece of the vile weed in their pockets , though it must be confessed that the little they consumed was rather for appearance sake , than because they liked it . They also smoked occasionally , for the same reason . " You must spell us a word or two , first , " said Alfred , in reply to Andy 's request . " No , I ca n't stop -- got important business to negotiate , " replied Andy . " Yes , you must , " continued Alfred ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy . " Spell hotel , " continued Alfred . " H-o-e-t-e-l-l-e . " " Spell calculate , " said Oscar . " **30;2370;TOOLONG , that ' ll do , " continued Andy . " No , spell one more word -- spell tobacco , and you shall have it , " added Alfred . " **28;2402;TOOLONG hand over the ' baccy . ' " " I have n't got any -- have you , Oscar ? " said Alfred Oscar fumbled in his pockets , but there was none to be found . " You mean , contemptible scalliwags ! " exclaimed Andy , " why did n't you tell me that before ? You catch me in that trap again , if you can ! " and he walked off in a passion , amid the laughter of Oscar and Alfred . " Let 's go and see the pups , Alf , " said Oscar , after they had got done laughing over the joke they had played upon Andy . Alfred 's step-father had a fine dog of the hound species , with a litter of cunning little pups . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a corner of the yard , adjoining the stable , with a rough covering to shelter them from wind and storms . The pups were now several weeks old . There were five of them , and a fat and frolicksome set they were too . As the boys approached them , they were frisking and capering as usual ; tumbling and rolling over one another , climbing upon the back of their mother , and pulling and barking at the straw . Their mother , whose name was Bright , sat watching their gambols with a very affectionate but sedate look . Perhaps she was wondering whether she was ever so mischievous and frisky as these little fellows were . When the pups looked up and saw the boys , they stopped their fun for a time , for they were not yet much accustomed to company . Bright , however , knew both Alfred and Oscar ; and as she was a dog of good education and accomplished manners , she did not allow herself to be disconcerted in the least by their presence . " You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , did you , Oscar ? " inquired Alfred . " No ,  - -  has he , though ? " asked Oscar . " Yes , he has . I knew I could make him say yes , and so I teased him till he did . He ' s going to pick out one , to keep , and I ' m to have all the rest . " " That 's first-rate , " said Oscar ; " and you ' ll give me one , wo n't you ? " " Yes , you may have one , " replied Alfred ; " but do n't tell the boys I gave it to you , for I mean to sell the others . " " Then I ' ll pay you for mine , " continued Oscar ; " I can get the money out of father , I guess . " " No , you sha n't pay for it , for I meant you should have one of them , if you wanted it , " replied Alfred . " Thank you , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After looking at the dogs awhile , and canvassing their respective merits , they happened to notice that one of the drivers was about starting off with his coach . " Halloo , Mack ! " cried Alfred , " where are you going ! " " To the depot , " replied the driver . " Let 's go , Oscar , " said Alfred ; and both boys ran for the coach , the driver stopping until they had climbed up to his seat . A ride of five minutes brought them to the depot , where the driver reined up , to await the arrival of a train , which was nearly due . Many other carriages , of various kinds , were standing around the depot , for the same purpose . Oscar and Alfred rambled about the building and adjoining grounds , watching the operations that were going on ; for though they had witnessed the same operations many times before , there is something quite attractive about such scenes , even to older heads than theirs . On one track , within the depot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was crawling along , carefully examining the running gear , and giving each wheel two or three smart raps with a hammer , to see if it had a clear and natural ring . These cars had lately arrived from a distant city , and must undergo a careful scrutiny before they are again used . If any break or flaw is discovered , the car is sent out to the repair-shop . On another track , the men were making up the next outward train . The particular baggage and passenger cars that were to be used , had to be separated from the others , and arranged in their proper order . Another track was kept clear , for the train that was soon to arrive . Two or three locomotives , outside of the depot , were fizzing and hissing , occasionally moving back or forward , with a loud coughing noise , or changing from one track to another . The bell of the looked-for train was at length heard . The engine , as it approached , was switched upon a side-track , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their course until the brakes brought them to a stand in the depot . The passengers now swarmed forth by hundreds -- a curious and motley crowd of men , women , and children ; good-looking people , and ill-looking ones ; the fine lady in silk , and the rough backwoods-man in homespun ; the middle-aged woman in black , with three trunks and four bandboxes , and the smooth-faced dandy , whose sole baggage was a slender cane . The cars were at length emptied of their living freight , and most of the passengers had secured their baggage . Those who wished to ride , had mostly engaged seats in the various hacks and coaches , whose drivers accosted every passenger , as he got out of the cars , with their invitations to " ride up . " Alfred and Oscar now started to look after the stage-coach in which they rode to the depot . They found it loaded with passengers and baggage , and the driver was talking with two small lads , of from twelve to thirteen years of age . " Here , Alf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellow I want , but I thought you had gone . These boys want to go to the hotel , but I have n't room to take them . They say they had just as lief walk , and if you ' ll let them go with you , I ' ll take their trunk along . " This was readily agreed to . The driver made room for the trunk on the top of the coach , and the young strangers started for the hotel , in company with Alfred and Oscar . As they walked along , they grew quite sociable . The two new-comers ,  - -  who , by the way , were quite respectable in their appearance ,  - -  stated that they belonged in one of the cities of Maine , and had never been in Boston before . They were brothers ; and both their parents being dead , they said they were on their way to the west , where they had an uncle , who had sent for them to come and live with him . They had a good many questions to ask about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city some the next day , as they must resume their journey on Monday . Alfred said he would go with them , and show them the principal sights ; and Oscar , too , would have gladly volunteered , were it not that his father required him to go to church and the Sabbath-school on that day , and to stay in the house when not thus engaged . The boys had now reached the hotel , where the trunk had already arrived . A room was appropriated to the young guests , and Alfred and Oscar conducted them to it , and remained awhile in conversation with them . By-and-bye , the oldest of the strangers asked Alfred if he would go and show them where they could buy some good pistols . Alfred readily agreed to this , and the four boys started off towards the shops where such articles are sold . On their way through the crowded streets , the new-comers found much to attract their attention . They seemed inclined to stop at every shop window , to admire some object , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make their purchase . Here , amid the variety of pistols that were exhibited to them , they were for a time unable to decide which to choose . At length , however , aided by the advice of Alfred and Oscar , they picked out two that they concluded to buy . They also purchased a quantity of powder and balls , and then desired to look at some dirks , two of which they decided to take . Some fine pocket-knives next arrested their attention , which were examined , and greatly admired by all the boys . The oldest of the strangers , who did all the business , concluded to take four of these , and then settled for all the articles purchased . The bill was not very small , but his pocket-book was evidently well supplied , and he paid it with out any difficulty . After they had left the store , the oldest boy gave Oscar and Alfred , each , one of the pocket-knives , to pay them for their trouble , as he expressed it . They were much pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their afternoon 's adventure . They were a little surprised , however , that their new friends should think it necessary to invest so largely in weapons of defence ; and on their hinting this surprise , the boy who purchased the articles said , with a careless , business-like air : " O , we ' ve got to travel a good many hundred miles , and there ' s no knowing what rough fellows we may fall in with . But give me a good revolver and dirk , and I bet I will take care of myself , anywhere . " The seriousness with which this brave language was uttered by a boy scarcely yet in his teens , would have made even Alfred and Oscar smile , but for the consciousness of the new knives in their pockets . It was now quite dark , and on coming to a street which led more directly towards his home , Oscar left the other boys , with the promise of seeing them again Monday morning . CHAPTER V. THE YOUNG TRAVELLERS . The Sabbath came , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Alfred , and the boys whose acquaintance he had made the afternoon previous ; but there was little chance for him to join them in their walks on that day . He could not absent himself from church or the Sunday-school , without his parents ' knowledge ; and Mr. Preston had always decidedly objected to letting the children stroll about the streets on the Sabbath . Oscar felt so uneasy , however , that in the afternoon , a little while before meeting-time , he left the house slyly , while his father was upstairs , and walked around to Alfred 's . But he saw nothing of the boys , and was in his accustomed seat in the church when the afternoon services commenced . The next morning , Oscar rose earlier than usual , and as soon as he could despatch his breakfast , he hurried over to the hotel . The travellers had concluded to defer their journey one day longer , that they might have a better opportunity to see Boston ; and when Oscar approached them , they were trying to persuade Alfred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rambles . They immediately extended the same invitation to Oscar . Both he and Alfred felt very much inclined to accede to their proposition , but they were pretty sure that it would be useless to ask their parents ' consent to absent themselves from school for such a purpose . The point to be settled was , whether it would be safe to play truant for the day . Seeing that they hesitated , the oldest boy , whose name was Joseph , began to urge the matter still more earnestly . " What are you afraid of ? " he said ; " come along , it 's no killing affair to stay away from school just for one day . You can manage so that nobody will know it ; and if they should find it out , it wo n't make any difference a hundred years hence . Come , now , I ' ll tell you what I ' ll do ; if you two will go around with us to-day , I ' ll give you a quarter of a dollar apiece . " Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their request , and the four boys started on their tramp . It was not without many misgivings , however , that Oscar decided to accompany them . With him , the chances of detection were much greater than with Alfred . No brothers of the latter attended school , to notice and report his absence . With Oscar , the case was different , and he did not see exactly how his truancy was to be concealed from his parents and teachers . But as Alfred was going with the boys , he finally concluded that he , too , would run the risk for at least half a day , and trust to luck to escape punishment . It was decided to go over to the neighboring city of Charlestown , first , and visit the Monument and Navy-Yard , both of which the young strangers were quite anxious to see . Joseph , the oldest and most forward , began to be on quite intimate terms with Oscar and Alfred . He threw off every restraint , and laughed and talked with them just as if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his profanity . Neither Alfred nor Oscar , I am sorry to say , was entirely free from this wicked and disgusting habit ; but they had made so little advance in this vice , compared with their new friend , that even they were slightly shocked by the frequent and often startling oaths of Joseph . The younger lad , whose name was Stephen , appeared to be quite unlike his brother . Though sociable , he was less gay and more reserved than Joseph , but he seemed to be much interested in the novel sights that met his eye at every step . On their way , the boys came to a cellar which was occupied by a dealer in fruits and other refreshments . Around the entrance were arranged numerous boxes of oranges , apples , nuts , candy , and similar articles , to tempt the passer-by to stop and purchase . The owner was not in sight , and Joseph , as he passed along , boldly helped himself from one of the boxes , taking a good hand-full of walnuts . On looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running up the cellar steps , and concluded that he , too , had better quicken his pace . He accordingly started on a brisk run , the other boys joining in his flight . The man , who happened to witness the theft from the back part of the cellar , soon saw that pursuit would be useless , and contented himself with shaking his fist , and uttering some anathemas which were inaudible to those for whom they were intended . " That was a pretty narrow escape , was n't it ? " said Joseph , after they had got a safe distance from the man . " It was so , " replied Alfred ; " and it was lucky for you that he did n't catch you . " " Why , what do you suppose he would have done ? " " He would have taken you up for stealing , I guess , for he looked mad enough to do anything , " said Alfred . " Stealing ? Pooh , a man must be a fool to make such a fuss about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew a boy , " said Oscar , " who stole a cake of maple sugar from one of these stands , and his father had to pay two or three dollars to get him out of the scrape . " " I would n't have done it , " said Joseph ; " I ' d have gone to jail first -- that ' s just my pluck . " " But the boy did n't do it -- it was his father that paid the money , " added Oscar . " O , then , I suppose the boy was n't to blame , " said Joseph , with all seriousness ; as though he really believed that somebody was to blame , not for stealing the maple sugar , but for satisfying the man who had been injured by the theft . They were now upon one of the bridges which cross Charles River , and connect the cities of Boston and Charlestown . After passing half-way over , they stopped a few minutes to gaze at the scene spread out around them . Oscar and Alfred pointed out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued their walk without interruption until they reached the Monument grounds , on Bunker Hill . After examining the noble granite shaft which commemorates the first great battle of the American Revolution , they threw themselves down upon the grass , to contemplate at their leisure the fine panorama which this hill affords on a clear day . After lingering half an hour around the Monument , they turned their steps towards the Navy-Yard . On reaching it , they found a soldier slowly pacing back and forth , in front of the gate-way ; but he made no objection to their entering . Joseph and Stephen , who had never before visited an establishment of this kind , were first struck by the extent of the yard , and the air of order and neatness which seemed everywhere to prevail . They gazed with curiosity upon the long rows of iron cannons interspersed with pyramids of cannon-balls , piled up in exact order , which were spread out upon the parks . Then their wonder was excited by the dry-dock , with its smooth granite walls , its massive gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest frigate . The lofty ship-houses in which vessels are constructed , and the long stone rope-walk , with its curious machinery , also attracted their attention . So interested were they in these things , that nearly two hours elapsed before they started for home . On their way back to the hotel , Joseph entertained Alfred and Oscar with some incidents of his life . His mother , he said , died when he was quite young . His father went to sea as the captain of a ship , two years before , and had never been heard from . He had rich relatives , who wanted him to go to West Point and be a cadet , but he did not like to study , and had persuaded them to let him and Stephen go and live with their uncle at the west , who had no boys of his own , and wanted somebody to help him to manage his immense farm . Such , in brief , was Joseph 's story . On their return route , the boys were careful to avoid passing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all his pluck and bravery , he did not care about meeting the man whose displeasure he had excited a few hours before . It was twelve o'clock before the boys reached the hotel . Oscar , during the latter part of the walk , had been unusually silent . He was thinking how he should manage to conceal his truancy , but he could not hit upon any satisfactory plan . The more he reflected upon the matter , the more he was troubled and perplexed about it . He might possibly hide his mis-spent forenoon from his parents , but how should he explain his absence to his teachers ? He could not tell . He decided , however , to see his brothers before they should get home from school , and , if they had noticed his absence , to prevail upon them to say nothing about it . " You ' ll be back again after dinner , Oscar ? " said Alfred , as his friend started for home . " Yes , " replied Oscar , with some hesitation ; " I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't intend to go to school this afternoon , do you ? " inquired Alfred . Oscar did not reply , but hastened homeward . He soon found Ralph and George , but as neither of them spoke of his absence from school , he concluded that they were ignorant of it , and he therefore made no allusion to the subject . After dinner , Oscar had about half an hour to spend with Alfred ; for he felt so uneasy in his mind , that he had decided not to absent himself from school in the afternoon . He had gone but a short distance when he met his comrade , who had started in pursuit of him . " Well , " said Alfred , " we ' ve been taken in nicely , that 's a fact . " " Taken in -- what do you mean ? " inquired Oscar . " Why , by those young scamps that we ' ve been showing around town . " " I thought they told great stories , " said Oscar ; " but what have you found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that they are the greatest liars I ever came across -- or at least that the oldest fellow is , " replied Alfred ; and he then went on to relate what transpired immediately after Oscar left them , on their return from Charlestown . The landlord , it seems , requested the two strange boys to step into one of the parlors ; and Alfred , not understanding the order , accompanied them . They found two men seated there , the sight of whom seemed anything but pleasant to Joseph and Stephen . These men were their fathers -- for the boys were not brothers , and Joseph 's account of their past life and future prospects was entirely false . They had run away from home , and the money which they had so profusely spent , Joseph stole from his father . The men , who had been put to much trouble in hunting up their wayward sons , did not greet them very cordially . They looked stern and offended , but said little . Joseph was obliged to deliver up his money to his father , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , " said Oscar , when Alfred had concluded his story , " I did n't believe all that boy said , at the time , but I thought I would n't say so . " " Nor I , neither , " said Alfred . " I guess he did n't expect his father 's ship would arrive so suddenly , when he tried to stuff us up so . " " Did your father know you went off with them in the forenoon ? " inquired Oscar . " Yes , but he did n't care much about it . He told me I must go to school this afternoon , and not stay away again without leave . " The rules of the school required a written note of excuse from the parents , in case of absence . Neither of the boys was furnished with such an excuse , and after a little consultation , they concluded that their chances of escaping punishment would be greatest , if they should frankly confess how they had been duped and led astray by the young rogues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They supposed that the peculiar circumstances of the case , coupled with a voluntary confession , might excite some degree of sympathy , rather than displeasure , towards them . To make the matter doubly sure , it was arranged that Alfred should speak to the master about the matter before school commenced . When the boys reached the school-room , they found the master already at his desk . He listened with interest to Alfred 's story of the runaways , and was evidently pleased that he had so frankly confessed his fault . As the hour for commencing the afternoon session had arrived , he told Alfred and Oscar they might stop after school , and he would take their case into consideration . The afternoon passed away , without any unusual occurrence . When school was dismissed , the teacher called Alfred and Oscar to his desk , and gave them some excellent advice in regard to forming acquaintances , and yielding to the solicitations of evil associates . He told them that the deception which had been practiced upon them , should serve as a lesson to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange and unknown boys , but should choose their associates from among those whom they knew to be of good habits . He also earnestly cautioned them against yielding to the enticements of those who would persuade them to do wrong . He told them that whenever they laid the blame of their faults upon others , they made a sad confession of their own moral weakness . They must often encounter temptations , and evil examples and influences , even if they took pains to avoid them ; but they were not obliged to yield to these influences . They must learn to resist temptation , or they would speedily be swept away before it . Having faithfully pointed out their error and danger , the teacher dismissed the boys . They listened respectfully to his advice , and , when they were beyond his hearing , chuckled over their escape from a species of admonition that might have proved far more feeling and affecting , if not more salutary , than the kindly-meant reproof which had been administered to them . The leniency of the teacher , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their offence ; for Alfred had so artfully represented the facts of the case , as to make their truancy appear in a milder light than it deserved to be regarded . CHAPTER VI . WORK . " Oscar , go down cellar and get some coal , " said Mrs. Preston one evening , when the fire was getting low . " I ' m reading -- you go and get it , Ralph , " said Oscar , without looking up from the newspaper in his hand . " No , I sha n't , " replied Ralph ; " I ' ve done all your chores to-day , and I wo n't do any more . " " Tell Bridget to bring it up , then , " added Oscar , his eyes still fastened upon his paper . " Oscar , " said Mrs. Preston , sharply , " I told you to get it , and do you obey me , this minute . Bridget has worked hard all day , and Ralph has already had to do several errands and jobs that you ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ask them to get the coal . You have done nothing but play , when you were out of school , since morning , and now , when I ask you to do a trifling thing , you try to shirk it upon somebody else . I do wish you would break yourself of your laziness , and have a little consideration for other people . " Oscar reluctantly obeyed his mother 's order . Indeed , it was seldom that he was very prompt to obey , when any kind of labor was required of him . He had a peculiar knack of getting rid of work . If he was directed to do a thing , he was almost sure to try to coax Alice , or Ella , or Ralph , or Bridget , or somebody else , to do it for him . He never taxed his own legs , or hands , or muscles , when he could make use of other people 's . This lazy habit was a source of no small anxiety to his mother , and was a constant annoyance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to get it , " said Mrs. Preston , in a pleasant tone , when Oscar returned with the coal . " I hope it did n't hurt you much . " " I was n't afraid of its hurting me , " said Oscar " but I was reading , and did n't want to stop . " " I am afraid that is only an excuse , " replied his mother . " It has really got to be a habit with you to call upon somebody else , whenever you are told to do a thing . We have all noticed it , a hundred times , and you alone seem to be blind to it . In a year or two , when you are old enough to leave school , and go to a place , what do you suppose you will be good for , if you keep on in this way ? Why , the man who should take you into his employ , would have to hire another boy on purpose to wait upon you . " " It is just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alice . " It was only this morning that Bridget was scolding , because you wanted to be waited upon so much . She says you make her more trouble than all the rest of us together . " Oscar could not deny these charges , and so he said nothing , but appeared to be reading his newspaper very intently . Mr. Preston came in soon after , and the family sat down to tea . " Oscar , " said Mr. Preston , " next week is vacation , is it not ? " " Yes , sir , " replied Oscar . " Well , I shall want you in the store a part of the time , " continued his father . " Frank is going home to spend Thanksgiving , and as it will be a busy week with us , we must have somebody to take his place . " " Why ca n't Henry do the errands while Frank is away ? " inquired Oscar . " Because Henry will have as much other work as he can attend to , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let Frank go off at such a time , " said Oscar , pettishly . " It is not necessary that you should see , " replied his father . " I can manage my business without any advice from you , and I do n't want you to call me to account for what I do . I have given Frank a vacation , and I shall expect assistance from you -- that is all it is necessary for you to know about it . " Frank was the errand-boy in Mr. Preston 's shop . Henry , upon whom Oscar wished to lay the burden occasioned by Frank 's absence , was a young clerk , who had formerly served as chore-boy , but was now quite useful as a salesman . It was evident , from Oscar 's looks , that he did not much relish the idea of taking Frank 's place for a week . His mother , noticing this , said : " Why , Oscar , I thought you and Frank were good friends , and I should suppose you would be willing to relieve him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his mother nearly a year , and it is natural that he should want to go home and spend Thanksgiving . If you were in his place , and he in yours , do n't you think you should like the arrangement your father proposes ? " " I suppose I should , " replied Oscar ; " but it 's hard for me to lose my vacation , for the sake of letting him have one . " " You will not lose all your vacation , " said his father " If you are lively , you can do all I shall want you to do in four or five hours , and have the rest of the day to yourself . " " And I ' ll help you , too , " said Ralph , who was always ready to offer his assistance in such a case as this . " Thanksgiving week " soon arrived , and the busy note of preparation for the approaching festival was heard throughout the house . Bridget was invested with a new dignity , in the eyes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pie-crust , the eggs and the milk , the fruit and the spices , that were to be compounded into all sorts of good things . The house was filled with savory odors from the oven , and long rows of pies began to fill up every vacant space in the closet . Mrs. Preston was busy , superintending the operations of the household ; while Alice and Ella rendered such assistance as they could , in the chopping of pie-meat , the paring of apples , the picking of raisins , &c.; The boys , for their share , had an unusual number of errands to run , to keep the busy hands inside supplied with working materials . Oscar , however , was released for the week from all home chores , in consideration of his engagements at the store . Oscar did not find his duties as temporary store-boy quite so irksome or disagreeable as he anticipated . The work was light , and the novelty of it served to offset the confinement , which he had dreaded more than anything else . With some assistance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , and still have several hours each day for play . He also had an opportunity to learn some useful lessons during the week . One morning , his father sent him up-stairs to sweep out a room which was devoted to a certain branch of the business . Happening to go into it an hour or two after , Mr. Preston observed that it was in a dirty state , and called to Oscar to get a broom and sprinkler , and come up . " I told you to sweep this room out , " said he , as Oscar made his appearance ; " did you forget it ? " " I have swept it , " said Oscar , in a tone of surprise . " You have ? " exclaimed Mr. Preston , with an air of incredulity ; " I guess you are mistaken . You may have shaken the broom at it , but I do n't think you swept it . See there -- and there -- and there , "  - -  and he pointed out numerous little heaps of dirt , and scraps of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he continued , " let me show you how to sweep . In the first place , always sprinkle the floor a little , to prevent the dust flying , as I told you a day or two ago . You omitted that this morning , did n't you ? " " Yes , sir , " replied Oscar . " Well , just remember it hereafter , for the dust injures the goods . There ' s water enough , now pass me the broom , and I ' ll show you how to handle it . Look , now -- that ' s the way to sweep -- get all the dirt out from the corners and crevices , and along the edges , and under the counters . Use the broom as though you meant to do something , and were not afraid of it . There , that ' s the way to sweep clean -- so -- and so , " and Mr. Preston continued his explanations and illustrations , until he had swept the entire floor . " There , now , does n't that look better ? " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is worth doing at all , it is worth doing well -- that 's the true doctrine , Oscar . I hope you wo n't get in the habit of making half-way work with whatever you undertake . If I never expected to do anything but sweep chimneys or dig clams for a living , I would do it thoroughly and faithfully . Of all things , I despise a lazy , slovenly workman . " It was a very common thing with Oscar to slight his work , when he could not get rid of it entirely . This was partly the result of a want of interest in it , and partly the result of habit . The child who performs a task reluctantly , will not be very likely to do it well . The day before Thanksgiving , as Oscar was on his way to the store , after dinner , he met Alfred Walton . " You ' re just the chap I ' m after , Oscar , " said Alfred ; " I 'm going out to Cambridge , all alone in a wagon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jump in and go , wo n't you ? " This was a tempting invitation to Oscar , but he did not see how he could accept it . He was needed at the store more than ever , that afternoon , but it was too bad to lose such a fine chance to enjoy himself . Alfred was in a hurry , and could not stop long for him to consider the matter . So he concluded to run home , and ask his father 's permission , while Alfred went and got the horse ready . But when he got home , his father had left . He found Ralph , however , who readily agreed to take his place at the store , for the afternoon ; and on the strength of this arrangement , he hurried to the hotel and rode off with Alfred . It was a mild , pleasant afternoon , and the boys had a fine ride . Alfred had been among horses so much , that he understood their management pretty well , and was a very good driver . He prided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to steer through the narrowest and most crooked passage-ways , such as abound in the contracted and crowded streets of a city . When they reached the broad avenues of Cambridge , he allowed Oscar to take the reins awhile , at his request . Alfred 's step-father had been out to Cambridge , in the forenoon of the same day , and had purchased a horse at the cattle-market which is held weekly at that place . As he was obliged to return home by the cars , he left word that he would send out for the horse , in the afternoon . This was Alfred 's errand . After several inquiries , the boys found the man who sold the horse . Having examined the new purchase , and freely expressed their opinions of the animal 's " points , " they hitched his halter to the wagon , and set out for home . The sun was rapidly descending , when the boys reached the hotel stable . Oscar , who felt somewhat uneasy about his absence from the store , turned his steps in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He found all hands very busy , and for a long time no one appeared to notice him . At length his father happened to come to the part of the shop where he was , and asked him where he had been all the afternoon . Oscar proceeded to explain the cause of his absence , but Mr. Preston was in too much of a hurry to listen to his long excuses , and so he cut him short , and told him , in not very pleasant tones , that Ralph had done the work , and he ( Oscar ) might go home again , just as soon as he pleased -- a privilege of which he quickly availed himself . At the tea-table , that evening , Mr. Preston expressed his displeasure with Oscar 's conduct in very pointed terms . Oscar now explained the circumstances of his going away -- his attempt to get his father 's consent , and the promise of Ralph to supply his place . But the explanation did not satisfy Mr. Preston . He said Oscar knew he was needed that afternoon , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to have thought of it . Even if Ralph was willing to do his work , he did not like his putting so much upon his younger and weaker brother . He then complimented Ralph for his industry , and his willingness to make himself useful , and held him up to Oscar as a pattern he would do well to imitate . He concluded his lecture to the latter , by drawing from his pocket a quarter of a dollar , and presenting it to Ralph , as a reward for his services . This touched Oscar 's feelings rather more than his father 's reproofs . He thought to himself that he had performed as much work in the store as Ralph , to say the least , and was therefore as much entitled to a reward as he . There was this difference , however , which he entirely overlooked : Oscar did his share of the work reluctantly and from compulsion ; Ralph did his cheerfully and voluntarily , and solely for the purpose of making himself useful . CHAPTER VII . THANKSGIVING-DAY . Thanksgiving-Day had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , not the least important , in the eyes of the children , was a visit from their grandmother , Mrs. Lee , who arrived the evening previous . She was the mother of Mrs. Preston , and lived in a distant town in Vermont . She had not visited the family for several years , and the children and their parents were all very glad to see her once more . She was much surprised to find how the young folks had grown since she last saw them . Alice had shot up into a young lady , Oscar , who she remembered as " a little bit of a fellow , " was a tall boy , Ella , too , was quite a miss , and Georgie , " the baby , " had long since exchanged his frock for the jacket , trowsers , and boots , of boyhood . All these changes had happened since their grandmother 's last visit ; and yet she was just the same pleasant , talkative old lady that she was years ago . The children could not discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her well-remembered face . Illustration : Thanksgiving Market Scene . After breakfast , their grandmother proceeded to unpack her trunk . From its capacious depths she drew forth sundry articles ,  - -  specimens of her own handiwork ,  - -  which she distributed among the children , as gifts . They were all articles of utility , such as warm , " country-knit " mittens and socks for the boys , and tippets and stockings for the girls . A large bag filled with nuts , and another of pop-corn , were also among the contents of the trunk , and were handed to the children to be divided among them . In accordance with an agreement made the day before , Oscar soon left the house , and went in search of Alfred . Having found him , they set out for South Boston , in company with two or three boys , to witness a shooting-match got up by a man who worked about the stable . The spot selected for the sport was a retired field , where there was little danger of being interrupted . On reaching the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lads already engaged in the cruel amusement ; for the mark was a live fowl , tied to a stake . The company assembled were of a decidedly low order , and Oscar at first felt almost ashamed to be seen among them . Smoking , swearing , betting , and quarrelling , were all going on at once , interspersed with occasional shouts of laughter at some vulgar joke , or at the fluttering and cries of a wounded fowl . Sometimes a poor chicken would receive several shots , before its misery would be terminated by a fatal one . When one fowl was killed , a fresh one was brought forth . Each man who fired at the mark , paid a trifling sum for the privilege , and was entitled to the fowl , if he killed it . Oscar and his young companions lingered around the grounds for an hour or two , familiarizing themselves with scenes of shameful cruelty , and breathing an atmosphere loaded with pollution and moral death . The repugnance which Oscar at first felt to the party and its doings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself fired one or two shots , with a rifle which was lent to him . Oscar reached home before the hour for dinner . As he entered the sitting-room , his mother , who had missed him , inquired where he had been all the forenoon . " I ' ve been with Alf , " he replied . His mother did not notice this evasion of her question , but added : " Why do you want to be with Alfred so much ? It seems to me you might find better company . I ' m afraid he is not so good a boy as he might be . I do n't like his looks very much . " " Why , mother , " said Oscar , " Alf is n't a bad boy , and I never heard anybody say he was . I like him first-rate -- he ' s a real clever fellow . " " He may be clever enough , but I do not think he is a very good associate for you , " replied Mrs. Preston . " Who ought to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar , with a pertness for which he was becoming a little too notorious . " I see Alf every day , but you do n't know hardly anything about him . At my rate , I ' ll risk his hurting me . " Oscar 's grandmother looked at him with astonishment , as he uttered these words . He felt the silent rebuke , and turned his head from her . " Well , " added Mrs. Preston , " if Alfred is not a bad boy himself , I do not believe that the kind of people you spend so much of your time with , around the hotel-stable , will do either you or him any good . The lessons a boy learns among tavern loungers do not generally make him any better , to say the least . I wish you would keep away from such places -- I should feel a good deal easier if you would . " The subject was dropped , and dinner ,  - -  the event of Thanksgiving-day , in every New England home ,  - -  soon began to engross the attention of the household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young . The children forgot all their little , fanciful troubles , and the traces of care were chased from their parents ' brows for the hour . The afternoon was stormy , and the children amused themselves with in-door sports . After tea , however , Oscar asked his father for some money , to buy a ticket to an entertainment that was to take place in the evening . But both his parents thought he had better stay at home , with the rest of the family , and he reluctantly yielded to their wishes , coupled with the promise of a story or two from his grandmother , about old times . A cheerful fire was burning in the grate , when the family returned to the parlor , from the tea-table . The lamps were not yet lit , although the gray twilight was fast settling down , and the ruddy coals began to reflect themselves from the polished furniture . Mrs. Preston was about to light the lamps , when Ella exclaimed : " No , no , mother , do n't light the lamps -- let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories will seem twice as romantic . You do n't want a light , do you , grandmother ? " " No , " said the grandmother , " I can talk just as well in the dark . But I do n't know as I can tell you any very interesting stories . I ca n't think of anything now but what you have already heard . That 's just the way when I want to tell a story . If I was all alone , I should think of lots of things to tell you . " " Ca n't you tell us something about the Indians ?  - -  I like to hear about them , " said Oscar . " You would like to know how they served naughty boys , would n't you ? " inquired his grandmother ; and if the room had not been quite so dark , Oscar would have seen something like a roguish twinkle in her sober gray eye , as she spoke . " O yes , grandmother , " interrupted Ella , " that will suit him , I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell us what they did to their bad boys , and perhaps we shall learn how to serve Oscar . " " And while you are about it , grandmother , " said Oscar , " tell us what they did to naughty girls , too . " " I do n't know how they punished girls , " said the old lady ; " but I have heard it said that when they wished to punish a boy very severely , they made him lie down on the ground , upon his back . They then put their knees on his arms , and held his head back , while they took into their mouth some very bitter stuff , made from the roots of a certain plant , and squirted it into the boy 's nose . They kept repeating the dose , till the poor fellow was almost strangled , and I suppose by that time he was cured of his fault . " " Pooh , was that all ? " said Oscar ; " I thought something terrible was coming . " " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than once , " replied his mother ; " but if you think it is so pleasant to take , perhaps your father will give you a taste of it , one of these days , if you do not behave better than you have done of late . " " Did you ever get frightened by the Indians , grandmother ? " inquired Ralph . " No , " replied the old lady ; " there were plenty of them around , when I was a little girl , but they had got to be quite civil , and we were not afraid of them . I wish I could remember all the stories my mother used to tell me about them -- they were plenty and troublesome , too , in her day . I recollect one fight that took place in our neighborhood , when she was young . One evening , a man who was returning from another settlement , happened to discover a party of Indians , making their way very quietly up the river in their canoes , towards our little village . He watched their movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them see or hear him . When they got within about half a mile of the settlement , they pulled their canoes ashore , and concealed them among the bushes . They meant to creep along very slowly and slily , the rest of the way , and then fall suddenly upon the whites , and murder and plunder them before they could know what the matter was . But the man who discovered them hurried on to the settlement , and gave the alarm . Ten men was all he could muster , for there were but a few families in the town . These men armed themselves , and by the time they were ready for action , the Indians had already begun their work of plunder . " But the Indians were not cunning enough for the white folks , that time . The settlers formed themselves into two parties -- one of seven and one of three men . The three men went down very cautiously to the Indian 's landing-place , and after cutting slits in their bark canoes , they hid themselves , and awaited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party made such a furious and sudden attack upon the enemy , that the Indians thought they were assailed by a force far superior to their own , and so they fled as fast as they could . When they reached the landing-place , they jumped pell-mell into their canoes , and pushed out into the stream . Now they thought they would soon be out of the reach of harm ; but , to their astonishment , the canoes began to fill with water , and were entirely unmanageable . The three men in ambush now began to attack them , and pretty soon the other seven came to their aid , and in a little while the Indians were all shot or drowned , and not one of the party escaped , to inform their kindred what had befallen them . The stream on which this happened is called Laplot River . Laplot , they say , means ' the plot , ' and a good many people think the river got its name from the stratagem of the settlers , but I do n't know how that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another story . " Let me see , " said his grandmother ; " did I ever tell you about Widow Storey 's retreat , in the Revolution ! " " No ma'am , " said Oscar ; " I 've read about General Burgoyne 's retreat ; but I never heard of Widow Storey before : who was she ? " " O , it was n't that kind of a retreat that I meant , " said his grandmother ; " but I will tell you who she was . She lived in Salisbury , some twenty or thirty miles from where I belong . Her husband was the first man who settled in Salisbury , but he was very unfortunate . After he had worked hard , and got a log cabin ready for his family , it took fire , and was destroyed ; and he himself was killed by the fall of a tree , soon after . But his widow was a very smart woman ; and though she had eight or ten small children , she moved on to the place her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a hundred acres of land to encourage and reward her . She worked just like a man , and did n't mind chopping down trees , and cultivating the soil , with her own hands . But by-and-bye the Revolution broke out , and as there were British soldiers in the neighborhood , she was afraid they would make her a visit . She fled several times to another town , where there was less danger ; but after awhile a new idea entered her head , and she proceeded to carry it out , with the aid of a man who lived near her . The idea was , to construct a hiding-place , where the British could not find them , if they should pay her a visit . They selected a spot on Otter Creek , and dug a hole right into the bank , horizontally . The hole was a little above the water , and was just large enough for a person to crawl into . It was so covered up by bushes that hung from the bank , that a stranger would not notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of which was covered with straw . Good comfortable beds were prepared , and here the families found a secure retreat , until the danger was past . " " That was complete , " said Oscar ; " but I should think the British might have tracked them to their retreat , for it 's likely they had to go home pretty often , to get food , and look after things . " " Yes , " added his grandmother ; " but they reached their retreat by a canoe , so that no footsteps could be seen leading to it ; and they were careful not to go out or in during the day-time . I have heard my brother James tell about it . I believe he saw the very hole once , where they went in . " " Uncle James was a famous hand for telling stories , " remarked Mrs. Preston . " I shall never forget what a treat it was to me , when I was a child , to have him come to our house . I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming , and coax him to tell me a good lot of stories before he went off . I can remember some of them even now . He used to tell a story of a crabbed old fellow , who was very much annoyed by the boys stealing his apples . So , after awhile , he got a spring-trap , and set it under the trees , to catch the young rogues . But the boys got wind of the affair , and the first night he set it , they picked it up , and very quietly put it on his door-step , and then went back to the orchard , and began to bellow as though they were in great distress . The old man heard the uproar , and started out , in high glee at the idea of catching his tormentors ; but he hardly put his foot out of the door , before he began to roar himself , and he was laid up a month with a sore leg . " " That was old Zigzag , " said the grandmother ; " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  what a funny name ! " exclaimed Ralph . " That was n't his name , although he always went by it , " added the old lady . " He was a very odd character , and one of his peculiarities was , that he never walked directly towards any place or object he wished to reach , but went in a ' criss-cross , ' zigzag way , like a ship beating and tacking before a head-wind . He was a hard drinker , and was almost continually under the influence of liquor , and perhaps that was the cause of his singular habit . He was a terribly ugly fellow , when he was mad , and the boys used to tease him in every possible way ; but wo to them if he got hold of them . He lived all alone , for he never had any wife or children ; and he would not allow anybody to enter his house , on any account , but always kept the door locked . If his neighbors had business to transact with him , he would step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the severest weather , he would not let them cross his threshold . He never would speak to or look at a woman , and would always avoid meeting them , if possible . Poor fellow , he had a dreadful end . He was missing for several days , and at last some of the town's-people broke into his house , and found him dead , with his head badly burned . They supposed he was intoxicated , and fell , striking his head upon the andiron , which stunned him ; and while he lay helpless , he was so badly burned that he soon died . And that was the last of poor old Zigzag . " " There was another story Uncle James used to tell , about the naming of Barre , in Vermont ; do you recollect it , mother ? " inquired Mrs. Preston . " Yes , indeed , and I ' ve heard old Dr. Paddock tell it many a time . He was there , and saw it all . The people did n't like the name of their town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new one , and so they met together in town-meeting , to talk the matter over . One of the leading men came from Barre , Massachusetts , and he wanted the town to take that name . Another prominent citizen came from Holden , Massachusetts , and he insisted that the town should be called Holden . The people liked both of these names well enough , and it was finally determined that the question should be decided by a game of boxing , between these two men . So the meeting adjourned to a new barn , with a rough hemlock plank floor , and the contest commenced . After boxing awhile , one of them threw the other upon the floor , and sprang upon him at full length ; but the one who was underneath dealt his blows so skilfully , that his opponent soon gave in ; and rolling the Holden man out of the way , he jumped up and shouted , ' There , the name is Barre ! ' and Barre it hasten , to this day . The next day , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor to extract from his back the hemlock splinters he had received while struggling on the barn floor . " Thus the evening was beguiled with stories , mingled with a few songs by Alice and Ella , and a few favorite airs upon the piano-forte . Before the hour of retiring arrived , even Oscar was quite reconciled to the loss of the evening 's entertainment away from home which he had promised himself . CHAPTER VIII . GRANDMOTHER LEE . Mrs. Lee , the grandmother of the Preston children , remained with the family for several weeks , after Thanksgiving . Her visit was , on the whole , a pleasant one , though there were some shadows thoughtlessly cast over it by the children . Age had somewhat impaired her sense of hearing , but yet she always wanted to understand everything that was said in her presence . Often , when the children were talking to each other in a low tone , she would ask them what they were saying . Ella did not like these interruptions , and was the first to complain of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , " I do wonder what makes grandmother so inquisitive . I really believe she thinks we are talking about her all the time . I ca n't open my mouth , but she wants to know what I said . Do n't you think she is getting childish , Alice ? " " Why , Ella ! " exclaimed Alice , in astonishment , " I should think you would be ashamed to speak so of your poor old grandmother . What do you think mother would say if she knew what you said ! " " I ca n't help it , " replied Ella ; " I do n't see why grandmother need be so curious about every little thing that 's said . I mean to ask her some time when I have a good chance . " " I should think you had better , Miss Impudence , " said Alice ; " perhaps she would like to have you give her some lessons in good behavior . " Alice did not for a moment suppose that her sister meant to speak to their grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ella . A day or two after this , as several of the children were talking among themselves , the attention of the old lady was arrested . She could not hear distinctly what they said , but Oscar took a prominent part in the conversation ; and a moment after , on his leaving the room , she asked Ella what he wanted . " O , it was n't anything that you care about , grandma'am , " replied Ella . " Is that the way your mother teaches you to answer questions , Ella ? " inquired Mrs. Lee , in a mild , reproachful tone . " No , no , grandmother , " replied Alice , with considerable earnestness ; " I shall tell mother how impudently she spoke to you . A boy has given a little dog to Oscar , and that was what he was telling us about , just before he went out . " " Why , grandmother , " added Ella , " I did n't mean to be impudent ; but I ' ve noticed that you always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not talking to you , and mother says that is n't polite . " " I am much obliged to you , my dear , " replied her grandmother , very meekly ; " after I have taken a few more lessons from you , perhaps I shall know how to behave . " The feelings of the old lady were more hurt by the rudeness of Ella , than her mild rebukes indicated . Alice felt bound to inform her mother of what had taken place ; and Mrs. Preston was greatly mortified , on learning that her little daughter had spoken so impudently to her aged mother . She apologized for Ella , as well as she could , by saying that she was naturally forward and impulsive . At noon , when the children returned from school , she called Ella into a room by herself , and talked with her about her conduct . At first , Ella tried to justify herself ; but after awhile her better nature triumphed , and she felt heartily ashamed of her treatment of her grandmother . To think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to teach her aged grandmother politeness , and in such an uncivil way , too ! No wonder she hung her head in shame . To be candid , perhaps Ella 's grandmother was a little too inquisitive to know what was going on around her . But this was one of the infirmities of old age which were slowly stealing upon her , and which the young should regard with pity and forbearance , but never with a censorious spirit . Ella was really a good-hearted girl , when her generous feelings were aroused . From that day , she treated her grandmother with marked kindness and respect ; and her unfortunate attempt to rebuke the venerable woman was never alluded to again . Among the articles which Mrs. Lee brought from the country , for the children , was a small bag of corn for popping . One evening , George happened to think of this corn , which none of them had yet tried ; and partly filling one of his pockets from the bag , he slipped quietly into the kitchen , and commenced popping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen but himself , and putting a handfull of corn in the wire popper , it soon began to snap and jump about , the hard , yellow kernels bursting forth into light and beautiful milk-white balls . But by-and-bye the savory odor of the corn found its way up stairs , and Ella and Ralph ran down to get their share of the treat . George had put the corn upon the table to cool , as fast as it was popped ; but when he heard footsteps approaching , he scrambled it into his pocket as quick as possible . " Halloo , popped corn ! Give me some , Georgie , wo n't you ? " said Ralph . " And me , too , " added Ella . " No I sha n't , either , " said George ; " I popped it for myself . " " You 're real stingy , " replied Ella ; " but no matter , Ralph and I will pop some for ourselves . Where is the bag ? " " You must find it for yourselves -- I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gathered the last of his popped corn into his pocket , badly burning his fingers , in his anxiety lest his brother or sister should get hold of a kernel or two . Ella and Ralph commenced searching for the bag of corn , but they could not find it . They looked in every place where they supposed it might be , but in vain . Their mother had gone to bed with a sick headache , or they would have ascertained where it was from her . At length they gave up the search , and returned to the sitting-room , in no very pleasant frame of mind . " I do declare , George , " said Ella , " you are the meanest boy I ever heard of . " " Why , what is the matter with George ? " inquired his grandmother . " He ' s been popping some of the corn you gave us , " replied Ella ; " and he wo n't give us a kernel of it , nor tell us where the bag is , so that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , " said Mrs. Lee , " that is too bad ; I would tell them where the corn is , for I intended it as much for them as for you . " " I do n't care , " said George ; " they 've called me mean and stingy , and now they may find it for themselves . " " We did n't call you mean and stingy till you refused to tell us where it was , " added Ella . " If I could find it , I guess you would n't get another kernel of it , " said Ralph , addressing George ; " I 'd burn it all up first . " " No , no , Ralph , that is wrong , " replied his grandmother . " The corn is n't worth quarrelling about . If George wants to be selfish , and keep it all to himself , I ' ll send down some more for the rest of you , when I go home . But I guess Georgie does n't mean to be selfish , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague you a little , that 's all . He ' ll tell you where he found the corn , pretty soon . " George , who was growing uneasy under this combined attack , now retreated to bed , leaving his grandmother more astonished than ever at his obstinacy . " There , " said Alice , " it 's of no use to try to drive or coax him out of his selfishness . Mother says he ' ll outgrow it by-and-bye , but I do n't see as there is any prospect of it . You know what made him so selfish , do n't you , grandmother ? " " I am afraid he has been humored too much , " replied Mrs. Lee . " Well , he has been , " added Alice ; " but you know when he was little , he was very sick for a whole year , and the doctor said he must n't be crossed any more than we could help , for crying and fretting were very bad for him . So he had his own way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we had to give it to him , and let him break it to pieces , for he would scream as loud as he could , if we refused him . This was the way he got to be so selfish ; and now he thinks we must humor him just as we did when he was sick . " " There is some little excuse for him , if he fell into the habit when he was very young and sick , " observed Mrs. Lee ; " but he is old enough and well enough now to know better , and ought to be broken of the fault . " " Father and mother have tried to break him of it , " replied Alice , " but they have not succeeded very well yet . They have talked to him a good deal about it , but it does no good . " The next day , the children found the bag of corn , and their mother told George she should punish him for his selfishness by not letting him have any more of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus George , in trying to get more than his share , actually got less than the others did . It was about this time that Oscar came into possession of the pup which Alfred Walton had promised him two or three weeks before . He at first had some difficulty in obtaining the consent of his mother to bring it home . She thought it would be troublesome , and tried to dissuade him from taking it ; but Oscar 's heart was so strongly set upon the dog , that she at length reluctantly assented to its being admitted as an inmate of the family . Fastening a string to the neck of the dog , Oscar led him to his new home , where he received every attention from the younger members of the family . Quite a grave discussion at once ensued , as to what the name of the new-comer should be . Each of the children had a favorite name to propose , but Oscar rejected them all , and said the dog should be called " Tiger ; " and so that became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tige . " Illustration : Tiger 's Countenance . Tiger had grown very rapidly , and was now about twice as large as he was when Alfred promised Oscar one of his litter of pups . He was a handsome fellow , especially about the head , as you may see by his portrait . At times , he looked as old and grave as his mother ; but for all that , he was a great rogue , and there was very little dignity or soberness about him . He was brim-full of fun , and would play with anybody or anything that would allow him to take that liberty . He would amuse himself for hours with an old shoe or rag that he had found in the street , and it seemed as if he never would get tired of shaking , and tearing , and biting it . This disposition sometimes led him into mischief , in the house ; but he was always so happy , so good-natured and so affectionate , that it was difficult to blame him very hard for his misconduct . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Tige was about , he would seize it in an instant , and she would have to work hard to get it away from him . She kept her work in a bag , which she usually hung upon the back of a chair ; but one day , the little rogue pulled the bag down upon the floor , and had its various contents scattered all about the room , before the old lady noticed what he was doing . These mischievous pranks were very amusing to Oscar , and he set all the more by Tiger , on account of this trait in his character . The other members of the family , too , seemed to enjoy the sport he made ; and it was easy to see that even old Mrs. Lee , though she pretended to be angry with the dog for his mischievousness , was in reality pleased with the attentions he bestowed upon her and her knitting-work . Oscar 's grandmother usually retired to her chamber , soon after dinner , to take a short nap . One noon , after she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog 's mischievousness , Oscar thought he would play a joke upon the old lady ; so , on rising from the dinner-table , he carried Tiger up to her bed-room , and shut him in . He wanted to conceal himself somewhere , and witness the surprise of his grandmother , when she should open the door , and the dog should spring upon her ; but it was time to go to school , and he could not wait . It so happened that Mrs. Lee did not take her nap so early as usual that day . When she did go to her chamber , Tiger , impatient of his long confinement , sprang out so quickly , that she did not observe him . But such a scene as met her gaze on entering the chamber ! The first thing that caught her eye , was her best black bonnet lying upon the floor , all crumpled up and torn into shreds , looking as though it had been used for a football by a parcel of boys . She entered the room , and found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling upon it ; while towels and other articles were scattered about in confusion . The cloth upon the dressing-table had been pulled off , and the articles that were kept upon it were lying upon the floor , including a handsome vase , which , in the fall , had been shattered to pieces . There was in the chamber a stuffed easy-chair , the covering of which was of worsted-work , wrought by Mrs. Preston when she was a young girl . This chair , which was highly valued as a relic of the past , was also badly injured . A part of the needle-work , which had cost so many hours of patient toil , was torn in every direction , and some of the hair , with which the cushion was stuffed , was pulled out , and scattered about the floor . As soon as Mrs. Lee had fully comprehended the extent of the mischief , she went to the stair-way , and called her daughter . A glance satisfied Mrs. Preston that Tiger must have been there ; and she was confirmed in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into the kitchen , just after Mrs. Lee went up . But they could not tell how the little rogue got shut into the room . They concluded , however , that some of the children did it by accident , or that the dog slipped in unperceived when Mrs. Lee came out from the chamber before dinner . Oscar did not go directly home from school , but as soon as he entered the house , he learned what Tiger had done , from the other children . He felt sorry that what he intended as a harmless joke , should end in so serious a matter ; but he determined that no one should know he had a hand in it , if he could prevent it . He regretted the destruction of property , but this feeling did not cause him so much uneasiness as his fear of losing his dog in consequence of this bad afternoon 's work . His mother , as soon as she saw him , inquired if he had been to his grandmother 's chamber that noon . He replied that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and he answered in the negative . His mother questioned him still further , but he denied all knowledge of the matter . It was not very hard work for Oscar to tell a lie , now , for practice makes easy . He could do it , too , in such a plausible and seemingly innocent way , that it was difficult to believe he was deceiving you . His falsehoods , in this instance , were readily believed ; and as all the other children denied having any knowledge of the affair , it was the general conclusion that Tiger must have obtained admittance to the chamber accidentally and unperceived . When Mr. Preston came home to tea , and saw what the dog had done , he was very angry with poor Tiger , and told Oscar he must sell him or give him away , for he would not have such a mischievous animal about the house another day . A day or two after , Mrs. Preston replaced the articles belonging to her mother that had been injured , and the excitement about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of his pet ; but he was careful not to let him stay in the house much of the time especially when his father was at home . " Oscar , " said his grandmother a day or two after as he came into the kitchen with Tiger , " I thought your father told you he would n't have that dog around here any more . " " O , he did n't mean so , " replied Oscar ; " he was mad when he said that , but he ' s got over it now . Besides , I do n't let Tige stay in the house much . " " A good dale ye cares for what yer father says , " remarked Bridget , who was never backward about putting in a word , when Oscar 's delinquencies were the subject of conversation . " You shut up , Bridget ,  - -  nobody spoke to you , " replied Oscar . " Shet up , did ye say ? Faith , if ye do n't git shet up yerself where ye wo n't git out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older , it ' ll be because ye do n't git yer desarts . Ye ' re a bad b'y , that ye are , an '  --  " " There , there , Biddy , " interrupted Mrs. Lee , " I would n't say anything more -- it only aggravates him , and does no good . But , Oscar , " she added , " I ' m sorry you do n't pay more attention to what your father says . It 's a bad habit to get into . I knew a disobedient boy , once , who came to the gallows ; and I ' ve known several others who made very bad men . " " But you do n't call me disobedient , do you , grandma'am ? " inquired Oscar . " I do n't know what else to call it , " she replied , " if your father tells you to do a thing , and you take no notice of it . " " But father does n't want me to give Tige away -- I do n't believe he ' s thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were you , " replied his grandmother , " I would ask his consent to keep the dog . If he did n't mean what he said , that night , you will be safe enough in asking him . " But this was a kind of reasoning that Oscar could not appreciate . If he could carry his point just as well without his father 's formal consent , he thought it was useless to ask any such favor . As long as he could keep his dog , it was all the same to him whether his father withdrew his command , or silently acquiesced in his disobedience of it . But grandmother Lee 's visit was drawing to a close , and early one bright , cool morning , in the latter part of December , the coach called , to take her to the railroad depot ; and after a few kisses , and words of affectionate advice , and lingering good-byes , she departed on her homeward journey . Of those she left behind , next to her own daughter , the saddest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , missed the pleasant face of her good old grandmother . CHAPTER IX . WINTER SPORTS . It was now mid-winter , and a few inches of snow lay upon the frozen ground , sufficient to make pretty fair sleighing for a few days , and to afford good coasting for the boys on the hill-sides . The favorite place for this amusement , among the boys in Oscar 's neighborhood , was the Common . Here they always found good , long , smooth coasting-places , when there was any snow on the ground ; and there was no danger of tripping up foot passengers , or getting under the heels of the horses , or being tapped on the shoulder by a policeman , which often happened to boys who coasted down the steep streets of the city ,  - -  a practice , by the way , prohibited by a city law . Oscar had a handsome new sled , which was a new year 's present from his father . It was long and narrow , the two steel-shod runners projecting forward far beyond the top or seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light blue , and varnished . Upon the sides , in gilt letters , was its name -- CLIPPER ; and upon its top it bore the initial of Oscar 's name , with an ornamental device . It had what a sailor would call a decidedly rakish look , and was really a fast as well as a stylish " team , " to use the term by which Oscar usually spoke of it . It even eclipsed George 's small but elegant sled , which , the winter previous , had been regarded as the ne plus ultra of sled architecture . Ralph 's sled , by the side of these , presented a very cheap and antiquated appearance , and it was seldom that he took it with him to the Common . He often borrowed Oscar 's , however , when it was not in use for his elder brother , with all his faults , was not selfish boy , but was willing to lend his property to others , when he was not using it himself . One pleasant Wednesday afternoon , a portion of the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph obtained leave to take the " Clipper " with him to the Common . George also went with him with his sled . The coasting is very good , and some hundreds of boys are enjoying it . Long lines of sleds , freighted with from one to three or four juveniles , are dashing down in various directions from the Beacon Street mall ; and an odd collection of juveniles and sleds it is , too . There comes a chubby , red-faced lad , with his exact counterpart , on a smaller scale , clinging on behind him with one hand , and swinging his cap with the other . Their sled is called the " Post-Boy , " and it seems to " carry the males " very expeditiously . Close at their heels is a pale , poetic youth , lightly skimming over the inclined plane upon a delicate craft that looks like himself , and which he calls the " Mystery . " Here comes a rude , unpainted sled , with two rough but merry youngsters lying prone upon it , one over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air in a most lively manner . Anon goes by an aristocratic-looking craft , bearing upon it a sleek and well-dressed boy , whose appearance speaks of wealth , indulgence , and ease . His sled is appropriately named the " Pet ; " but in gliding down the icy track it strikes a tree , and its pampered owner is sent sprawling upon his back , in a very undignified way , while his " Pet " gives him the slip and soon finds the bottom of the hill . Poor fellow ! we wonder if this is an omen of what is to befall him in sliding down the hill of life . And here comes the " Clipper " itself , with our Ralph seated proudly upon it , and apparently enjoying the fleet and beautiful sled as much as though it were really his own . And there , too , comes George , with his pretty " Snow Flake ; " and close behind him are the " Tempest , " and the " Yankee Doodle , " and the " Screamer , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and the " Racer , " and a host of other craft , of every imaginable appearance , and strided by all sorts of boys . Ralph and George spent an hour or two upon the Common . Nothing occurred to mar their pleasure till just before they started for home , when Ralph met with an adventure that sadly ruffled his temper . He was descending the hill upon his sled , when another craft , having two boys upon it larger than himself , managed to run into him . The " Clipper " being lightly loaded , the other sled descended with greater impetus ; and the force of the collision , together with a vigorous kick from the stout boots of one of the boys , overturned Ralph upon the steepest part of the hill . He quickly picked himself up , and , forgetful of self , his first care was to see whether Oscar 's sled had sustained any damage . When he beheld the marks of the rough encounter , in the form of sundry ugly scratches upon the polished sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes ; and it was some time before he noticed that he himself bore upon his hands and knees several unmistakable tokens of the collision . Ralph knew very well that the collision was not accidental . The kick of the boy who guided the sled , and the hearty laugh of both its occupants , when Ralph was overturned , satisfied him that he had been run down purposely . He did not know the names of the boys , having only met them occasionally on the Common . They soon came along again , on their way up the hill , and Ralph asked the owner of the sled why he run him down . " Because you got in our way , " replied the boy . " No , I did n't , " said Ralph ; " there was room enough for you to go by , but you steered out of your course , and gave my sled a kick , too . " " Do n't you tell me I lie , you little snipper-snapper , " answered the boy " or I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . " " See what you did , " continued Ralph , pointing to the scratches on the " Clipper ; " " I should n't care anything about it , but the sled is n't mine . I borrowed it of my brother , and it had n't a scratch on it when I took it . " " Pooh , " said the other boy , " that does n't hurt it any . I ' ll be bound it will be scratched worse than that , before the winter ' s over . If you get in my way with it again , I shall serve it worse than I did this time . " The boys passed on their way , and Ralph and George , whose " fun " had been thus suddenly and unjustly spoiled by their insolent and domineering companions , concluded to return home . Poor Ralph dreaded to meet Oscar ; but yet he hunted him up , as soon as he got home , and told him what had befallen the beautiful sled . Oscar was very angry when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all blame in the matter , and declared that he would pay back the boy who had thus taken advantage of his weakness . He knew the offender , from Ralph 's description , and from the name of his sled , which was the " Corsair . " He even proposed to go directly to the Common , and settle the account at once ; but Ralph , in whose heart revenge held a very small place , persuaded him out of the notion . But Oscar , unlike Ralph , was not the boy to forget or forgive an injury . A day or two after the occurrence just related , while coasting on the Common , he fell in with the boy who run into his brother . Keeping his eye upon him until he could catch him a little aside from the other boys , when the favorable moment came , he suddenly dealt him a severe blow , which nearly knocked him over , accompanying it with the remark : " There , take that for running down my little brother , when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other boy , without saying a word , sprang at Oscar , and , for a moment or two , blows and kicks were freely exchanged . But though they were about of a size , it was evident that Oscar was the stronger or most resolute of the two , and his antagonist soon gave up the contest , but not until he had been pretty roughly handled . Other boys soon came flocking around , to whom Oscar explained the cause of the assault ; but his antagonist denied all knowledge of the affair for which Oscar had attacked him . An angry war of words ensued , but the excitement finally subsided without any further resort to blows , and Oscar returned home , well pleased with his adventure . One of Oscar 's favorite winter amusements was skating . Early in winter , as soon as the little pond on the Common was frozen over , he might be seen gliding over the smooth ice ; but later in the season , when there was good skating on " Back Bay , " he preferred that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied him in his skating excursions , and seemed to enjoy the sport as much as his master did . It was amusing to see him try to make a short turn , in running upon the ice . He would slide some distance before he could change his course . Oscar would often plague him , when he was in full chase after his master , by suddenly turning upon his skates , and taking a contrary direction , leaving Tiger to get back as he could . But an event happened , one day , that almost wholly cured Tiger of his fondness for this kind of sport . He was gaily tripping over the ice , by the side of his young master , when the latter suddenly turned about , and Tiger , in his haste to follow him , slid directly into an air-hole . This was probably the first time he had enjoyed so extensive a cold bath ; and as he was not a water-dog , it is not surprising that he was terribly frightened . His piteous cries brought Oscar to his relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he found his half-drowned canine friend . He was floundering and paddling about in the water , now lifting himself almost out , upon the edge of the ice , and now slipping off again , and plumping over-head in the uncomfortable element ; his intelligent countenance , in the meantime , wearing the impress of despair . But Oscar soon helped him from his disagreeable position . Finding himself on his legs again , he did not resume his sport ; but , shivering with cold , and dripping with water , almost at the freezing point , and with his head hanging downward , and his tail drooping between his legs , he started towards home -- a wiser and a sadder dog . When Oscar got home , he found the family some what alarmed for his own safety . Tiger had arrived some time before , and as it was evident that he had been overboard , and as he was known to have gone off with his master , Mrs. Preston felt some anxiety , not knowing but that both Oscar and the dog had broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his account of Tiger 's misfortune served to amuse the children for the rest of the day . As for Tiger himself , he seemed heartily ashamed of the part he had played , and could hardly be persuaded to leave the chimney-corner for a moment , or even to look up , when the children inquired for his health . " I do n't see what good air-holes do . I wonder if anybody knows what they are for , " exclaimed Ralph , as the children and their mother were seated around the sitting-room table in the evening . " They are traps set to catch skaters , I suppose , " said Oscar . " And dogs , " added Ella . " But do n't you know what they are for , Alice ? " continued Ralph . " Yes , " replied Alice , who had studied natural philosophy at school , " they are the breathing holes of the fishes . Fishes ca n't live without air , any better than we can ; and a pond or river frozen over solid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a room from which all fresh air was shut out would be to us . You can sometimes catch fish very easily by cutting a hole in the ice , for if they feel the need of air , they will rush right up to the opening . " " But how are the air-holes made ? " inquired Ralph . " I believe , " replied Alice , " that they are generally made by springs that bubble up from the bottom . These springs come from the earth , and the water is so warm that it gradually thaws the ice over them . The fish often finish the process by jumping up through the ice before it has entirely melted . When the cold is very intense , and these springs have frozen up , some of the water is absorbed by the earth , which leaves a vacuum or empty space between the ice and the water ; and then the ice gives way under the weight of the atmosphere , and air is admitted into the water beneath . " " Well , I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar ; " they ' re troublesome enough to skaters . Jim Anderson skated right into one the other day , and came pretty near getting drowned . But I always keep my eyes open for them . I never got into one yet . " " You can not be too careful when you are on the ice , " remarked Mrs. Preston . " I felt so uneasy , that I was just going to send Ralph in search of you , when you got home . " After that day it required considerable coaxing to induce Tiger to go upon the boys ' skating-ground . He manifested a decided preference to remain upon the shore , and look on ; and when he did venture to accompany his master , he kept close by his side , and travelled over the treacherous ice with a degree of circumspection , which said very plainly , " You wo n't catch me in that scrape again , master Oscar ! " But there was nothing that the boys enjoyed more at this season of the year , than a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during this month . It came on in the evening , and the next morning , when they arose , their basement windows were more than half buried up in snow , and the drifts , in some places , were higher than Oscar 's head . The streets were deserted and almost impassable . Thick crusts of snow hung over the roofs of the long blocks of houses ; while the blinds , windows , doors and balustrades were heavily trimmed with the same delicate material . The huge banks which stretched themselves along the street and sidewalk , were as yet undisturbed ; for the few passers-by had been glad to pick their way through the valleys . The wind roared and piped among the chimneys and house-tops , and whisked through narrow passage-ways , and whistled through the smallest cracks and crevices , in its merriest and busiest mood . Now it would scoop up a cloud of snow from the street , and bear it up far above the house-tops , and then it would repay the debt by gathering a fleecy wreath from some neighboring roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm still continued with unabated severity , and the air was so full of snow , that one could hardly see the length of the street . After a hasty breakfast , the boys tucked the bottoms of their trowsers into their boots , and sallied forth , to explore the half-buried streets . And now the light snow-balls began to fly thick and fast , and every few moments , one and another would measure his full length in some deep drift , which for a moment almost buried him from sight . Tiger , who accompanied them , entered fully into the sport , and very good-naturedly received his share of the snowballs and snow-baths . But their exercise was too violent to be continued a great while . They soon returned home , coated with snow from head to heel , and the cheeks of the boys glowing with health and enjoyment . " After you get rested , Oscar , " said Mr. Preston , who was just leaving for the store , " I want you to shovel a path in front of the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The storm is n't over yet , and if I make a path , it will fill right up again . " " No it wo n't , " replied his father . " I do n't think it will storm much longer ; and the snow is so light , now , that you can shovel it easily , but if you leave it till noon , it maybe trodden down hard . You need not clean off the whole side-walk now ; only make a comfortable passage-way , and perhaps I will help you finish the job at night . " Oscar still thought it would be a waste of labor to shovel a path then , and he did not evince any haste in obeying his father 's order . After loitering about the house a long time , he took the shovel , and worked lazily at the path for awhile . Although he only undertook to cut a narrow passage-way through the drift in front of the house , he worked with so little spirit , that when the time came for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task . He asked permission to stay at home and finish his path , but his mother did not think this necessary , and refused her consent . So he went to school , and in the meantime the storm died away , and the clouds dispersed . Towards noon the door-bell rang , and on Bridget going to answer it , a little printed paper was handed to her , directing the occupant of the house to have the snow removed from his sidewalk within a given number of hours . After school , Oscar thought no more of his path , but went off with Alfred Walton , and did not go home until dinner-time . He had but little time now to shovel snow ; but his father told him to be sure and come home directly from school , in the afternoon , and not to play or do anything else until the sidewalk was cleared off . Oscar accordingly went home after school , and resumed his work . He found that the snow was trodden into such a solid icy mass , that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was not the boy to hurt himself with hard labor , and although he kept his shovel at work in a leisurely way , he did not accomplish much , except the removal of a little snow that had not got trodden down . Wearied at length with his feeble and fruitless efforts , he returned into the house , saying to his mother : " There , I ca n't get the snow off the sidewalk , and it 's of no use to try . It 's trodden down just as hard as ice . Besides , if I should shovel it all off , there will be an avalanche from the top of the house to-night , that will bury the sidewalk all up again . The snow is sliding off the roofs , all around here ;  - -  have n't you heard it , mother ? " " Yes , I thought I heard it , " replied Mrs. Preston ; " but if you ca n't get the snow off the sidewalk , you had better speak to your father about it , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hire somebody to do it for you . It must be got off as soon as possible , for the police have notified us to attend to it . " In spite of this advice , Oscar neglected to speak to his father in regard to the matter , and no one else happening to think of it , nothing was said about it . The next morning , he chopped away upon the ice a little while , but getting tired of it , he soon abandoned the job , and went to play . When Mr. Preston came home to dinner , an unusual cloud was on his brow ; and as soon as Oscar came in , the cause was explained . " Oscar , " he said , " why did you not shovel the snow from the sidewalk , as I told you to , yesterday morning ? " " I tried to , " replied Oscar ; " but it was trodden down so hard , I could n't get it off . " " But you should have done it before it got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday morning . That would have saved the rest from getting trod down , and at noon you could have finished the job . Why did you not do as I told you to ? " " I did begin to make a path , " replied Oscar ; " but I did n't have time to finish it , and when I got home from school , the snow was all trodden down hard . " " Did n't have time ? " said his father ; " what do you tell me such a story as that for ? You could have made all the path that was necessary in fifteen or twenty minutes , if you had been disposed to do it . By neglecting to obey me , you have got me into a pretty scrape . I have had to go before the Police Court , this forenoon , and pay a fine and costs , amounting to over five dollars , for your negligence and disobedience . And now , " he added , " you may try once more , and see if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at you have done dinner , take the hatchet and shovel , and go to work upon the sidewalk ; and do n't you leave it until the ice is all cleared off . As sure as you do , I will dust your jacket for you when I come home to-night , so that you will not forget it for one while . " Oscar thought it best to obey his father this time . It being Saturday , school did not keep , in the afternoon , and he had ample time to complete the task , although it was time which he intended to spend in a different way . Ralph , however , volunteered his assistance , and before the middle of the afternoon , the task was finished . CHAPTER X. APPEARANCES . Those who impose upon the weak , sometimes get punished for their meanness in an unexpected manner . This truth was very effectually impressed upon Oscar , one March morning , as he was going to school . The streets were in a very bad condition , being several inches deep with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as " slosh . " Just before reaching the school-house , he overtook two little boys with a sled , and throwing himself upon it , he compelled them to drag him along . It was hard sledding , and the boys naturally objected to drawing such a heavy load ; but Oscar kept his seat , and compelled them to go on . For a few minutes , he rode along very quietly , although his span of youngsters , who were continually muttering to themselves , did not seem to enjoy the sport as well as he did . But , by a dexterous movement , they soon balanced the debtor and creditor account . Giving the sled a sudden jerk and lurch , in one of the sloppiest places they had met with , their lazy passenger was thrown backward into the mud , and imprinted a full length picture of himself in the yielding material . The incident happened almost in front of the school-house , and as Oscar rose from the mud , he was greeted by the shouts and laughter of a hundred boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were passing at the time , joined in the laughing chorus ; and one , who had observed the whole affair from the beginning , told Oscar the boys had served him just right . Illustration : The Overturn . Ralph came to the relief of his brother , and having wiped off as much of the mud and water from his back as he could , with a handkerchief , Oscar started for home , wet to his skin . He was keenly sensitive to any mortification of this kind , and it was a bitter pill for him to appear in the crowded streets in such a plight . He imagined everybody he met or overtook was staring at him , and laughing at the figure he cut , and he wanted to hide his face from their sight . He never went home from school so fast before ; but when he had changed his dress , and washed the dirt from his hands and face , it was too late to return . In the afternoon , when he made his appearance at school , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stick-in-the-mud , " and had to stand a most remorseless fire of wit , pleasantry , and ridicule the rest of the day , both at home and in the street . Oscar thought quite as much as was proper of outward appearances . He was commendably neat in his personal habits , and was seldom caught with dirty hands and face , or uncombed hair , or soiled and ragged dress . He loved to dress well , too , and no amount of persuasion could induce him to wear a garment , if he fancied it did not set right , or was much out of fashion , or had an old and patched-up look . In such a case , nothing but the stern arm of authority was sufficient to overcome his prejudices . " There , " said his mother one evening , after spending some time over one of his jackets , which had become a little worn at the elbows ; " there , that will last you a spell longer , and look almost as well as it ever did , too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked very well ; but his eye rested upon a slight patch upon one of the elbows , which entirely spoilt it for him , although it had previously been a favorite garment . " It 's too small for me , " he said ; " why ca n't you keep it for Ralph ? " " No , you need n't keep it for Ralph , " quickly replied the owner of that name ; " I have n't had anything but your old clothes to wear for a year or two , and I should think it was my turn to have some of the new ones , now . Make him wear that out , mother , wo n't you ? " " Yes , I intend he shall wear it awhile longer , " replied Mrs. Preston . " It looks well enough for any body . " " But see that detestable patch , " said Oscar ; " I do n't want to wear that to school ; folks will think I have borrowed one of Ben . Wright 's old jackets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was the son of a poor widow , and was the most be-patched boy in Oscar 's class , at the head of which he stood . As he had nothing to recommend him but fine scholarship , exemplary deportment , and a good character , in school and out , he was a boy of little consequence in the eyes of Oscar . " I wish you were worthy to wear one of Benny 's old jackets , " replied Mrs. Preston . " If you were half as good a boy as he is , I would not complain . But you need not be afraid that anybody will mistake you for him , even if you do wear a patched garment . " " I believe you think Ben . Wright is a little angel , " said Oscar , who never liked to hear his humble but diligent classmate praised . " I think he has some traits that you would do well to imitate , " replied his mother . " I shall think I am imitating him , when I get that thing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluding to the jacket . " There , that will do , Oscar , " replied Mrs. Preston , " You 've said enough about the jacket ; do n't let me hear another word of complaint . I took a great deal of pains to mend it neatly , and it looks well enough for you or any other boy . You may put it on to-morrow morning , and do n't you leave off wearing it till I tell you to . " Oscar nodded his head in a way that seemed to say , " You ' ll see how long I wear it ; " but his mother did not observe the motion . He had a short and easy way of getting rid of garments that he disliked . Somehow other they were sure to waste away in a much faster manner than those he had a fancy for ; or , perhaps they would be rendered suddenly useless , by some mysterious accident . But he would never admit that their period of usefulness had been purposely shortened , though suspicions of this kind were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , and took a seat by the fire He pulled out his watch to wind it up , as was his custom just before bed-time , when Oscar said : " Father , I wish you would buy me a watch . Frank King , and Bill Andrews , and Charlie Grant , and almost all the large boys that I know , have got watches , and I should think I might have one too ; why ca n't I , father ? " " What do they do with watches ? " inquired Mr. Preston . " Why , what does anybody do with them ? They carry them to tell the time of day , of course , " replied Oscar . " And to make a display of watch-chain , " added his father . " No , that is n't it , " replied Oscar ; " but it 's convenient to have a watch with you . You do n't know how I ' m plagued to tell what time it is , sometimes . It would make me a good deal more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school this morning , but it was n't my fault , for I did n't know what time it was until I got to the school-house , and found that the boys had all gone in . " " When I was of your age , " said Mr. Preston , " boys never thought of carrying watches , and yet they were taught to be as punctual as the clock , in their attendance at school . If I had been tardy , and tried to excuse myself by saying that I had no watch , I should have got laughed at by the whole school . But where were you this morning , that you did not know when it was school-time ? " " Over to Alf . Walton 's . " " And could n't find a time-piece about the premises ? " " Why -- no -- I -- forgot --  " replied Oscar , somewhat embarrassed by the question . " Just as I supposed , " added his father ; " you got along with that boy , and forgot all about your school ; and it would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen watches in your pocket . " " O no , father , " said Oscar ; " for if I ' d had a watch about me , I should have looked at it . " " Well , " added Mr. Preston , " if you do n't care enough about punctuality to take a little trouble to ascertain what time it is , when you have an engagement , I do n't think a watch would help you any in acquiring the habit . You have n't made out a very strong case . " " No , " remarked Mrs. Preston , " he wants a watch for show , and not punctuality ,  - -  that 's plain enough . He has just been making a great fuss because I put a little bit of a patch on the elbow of his jacket . He is getting to be quite fastidious , for a gentleman of his size . " " If you would think a little less of outside appearances , Oscar , " continued his father , " and a little more of inward character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite so much at fault as it is now . If you judge of boys or men by the cloth and watches they wear , and select your companions accordingly , you will soon find that you have got a pretty set of friends . And so , too , if you think you can secure the good opinion and respect of the world , merely by dressing well , you are greatly mistaken . You must learn to judge people by their characters , and not by their dress or appearance . If I could see you trying to form a good character , I should care very little what sort of garments you wore . I would buy you a watch , or anything else in my power , if it would only make you behave better . In fact , I will make you a handsome offer now , if you wish . " " Well , what is it ? " inquired Oscar . " I will agree to give you a nice watch , in six months from this time , if you will do three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? " inquired Oscar ; " are they things that I can do ? " " Certainly , " said Mr. Preston ; " you can do them if you will only try . The first is , that you render prompt obedience to your parents , during these six months . Is n't that within your power ? " " Yes , sir , " replied Oscar , somewhat reluctantly . " The second is , " continued Mr. Preston , " that you behave toward your playmates and all other people in such a way , that no serious complaint shall be made against you . Can you do that , if you try ? " " Yes , sir , I guess so , " replied Oscar . " And the last condition is , that you give sufficient attention to your studies to gain admission to the High School , at the end of the term . Is that in your power ? " " I suppose it is , " said Oscar . " You admit , then , that you can keep these conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , will you do it ? " That was a hard question for Oscar to answer . He hesitated , and twisted about in his chair , and at length replied : " Why , I do n't suppose I should make out , if I tried . " " No , you certainly would not , if that is your spirit , " replied his father . " You can not accomplish anything unless you have some confidence that you can do it , and firmly resolve to try . You just admitted that you could keep these conditions , but it seems you are not willing to make the attempt . You want a watch , but you do n't intend to obey your parents , or to conduct yourself properly , or to attend to your lessons , for the sake of getting it -- that 's what you mean to say , is it not ? " Oscar remained silent . " I am sorry , " continued his father , " that you will not take up with my offer ; for though I do not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important that you should reform some of your habits . You are getting to be altogether too wayward and headstrong , as well as vain . " " If I get into the High School next summer , may I have the watch ? " inquired Oscar . " No , " replied his father , " not unless you comply with the other conditions . But I want you to remember what I told you the other day , that if you do n't get into the High School at that time , I shall send you to some boarding-school away from home , where you will be made to study , and to behave yourself too . If strict discipline can do anything for you , you shall have the benefit of it , you may depend upon that . " Oscar was now two-thirds of the way through his last year in the school he attended . His parents were anxious that he should go through the High School course of studies , and , indeed , he had applied for admission to that school the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was still some doubt whether he would succeed any better at the next examination ; and in case of his failure , his parents had decided to send him to a boarding-school in the country . But there was nothing very alarming to him in the idea of going into such an establishment , notwithstanding all his father said of the strict discipline to which he would be subjected . There would be a novelty about it , he imagined , that would make it quite pleasant . Consequently , he cared very little whether he was accepted as a High School pupil or not . CHAPTER XI . THE MORAL LESSON . Oscar had the name among his fellows of being a shrewd and sharp boy at a bargain ; and , like too many men who have acquired a similar reputation , he was not over-scrupulous in his manner of conducting his business operations . If he could drive a profitable trade , it mattered little how he did it ; and if somebody else lost as much as he gained by the bargain , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . So he reasoned , and so constantly did he act on this principle , that , to tell the truth , his integrity was by no means unimpeachable among his comrades . It was a very general opinion , that in many of their boyish games , such as marbles , he would cheat if he could get a chance ; and the notion was equally prevalent , that in a bargain , he was pretty sure to get decidedly the best end . Oscar was very desirous that his dog Tiger should wear a brass collar , by way of ornament and distinction . All other respectable dogs bore upon their necks this badge of ownership , and he thought it highly important that Tiger should be on a good footing with his canine friends . But how to get the collar , was the question that perplexed him . He had asked his father to buy it , and met with a flat refusal . He had even called at several shops , and inquired the price of the coveted article , but it was hopelessly beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several days , for when he took a notion that he wanted a thing , it was hard to reason or drive him out of it . His thoughts and his dreams were of brass dog-collars , and his talk among his companions run upon the same theme . At length , while prosecuting his inquiries , he happened to learn that a little boy who attended his school , owned just such a collar as he wanted , and had no dog to wear it . Here was a chance for a speculation . Oscar lost no time in seeing this boy , and in getting his lowest price for the collar , which was fifty cents . This was much less than the price at the shops , and Oscar thought his father might be induced , by this fact , to let him have the money to purchase it ; but Mr. Preston did not think Tiger needed any such appendage , and Oscar 's request was again denied . Oscar now set his wits to work to devise a way of buying the collar , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of " goods and chattels , " which he called his own , to see what there was he could exchange for the article he wanted . His eye soon fell upon a brass finger ring , and his plan was quickly formed . The ring had been tumbled about among his playthings for a year or two , and was now dull and dingy ; but he remembered that he once cleaned and polished it , so that it looked very much like gold , so long as the lustre lasted . He subjected it to this process again , and it soon looked as well as the plain gold ring he wore upon his finger , which it somewhat resembled in size and color . Substituting it for the gold ring , he wore it to school that afternoon ; and a little negotiation , after school was dismissed , settled the business -- the coveted dog-collar was his ! Indeed , so craftily did he conduct the bargain , that he made the other boy throw in a pretty ivory pocket-comb to boot ! The little boy who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Oscar usually wore ; and , in truth , Oscar did give him to understand , in the course of the barter , that it was fine gold , a point on which the other boy did not appear to have much doubt . Oscar did not dare to tell any one what a good bargain he had made , for fear that the other boy would hear of it . Tiger appeared with a handsome collar around his neck the next morning ; and all the explanation any one could get from his young master was , that he " traded for it . " A week or two elapsed before Oscar 's victim discovered the imposition that had been practiced upon him . The ring , which had been proudly worn , at length began to look dim and brassy ; and on being submitted to careful inspection , it was pronounced by competent authority to be not worth one cent . The owner was of course indignant , and he went at once to Oscar , and demanded a return of the collar and comb . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bargain , " said he , " and there ca n't be any backing out , after it 's all settled . You agreed to the trade , and now you must stick to it . " " But it was n't a fair bargain , " said the other boy ; " you told me the ring was gold , and it is nothing but brass . " " No , I did n't tell you it was gold , " replied Oscar . " You imagined that . And I did n't tell you it was the one I wore either , you imagined that too . It was my other ring that I said was gold , and I told you it cost two dollars , and so it did . I never told you this ring was gold ,  - -  I recollect perfectly about it . " " Well , you know I supposed it was gold , or I would n't have traded for it , " replied the boy ; " and besides , you made me think it was gold , whether you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your look-out , " said Oscar . " When a man sells a thing , he is n't obliged to run it down . You must look out for yourself when you make a bargain -- that 's what I do . " " I should think you did , " replied the other ; " and I guess I shall remember your advice , if I ever trade with you again . There 's your old ring : now give me back my collar and comb , " he continued , handing the ring to Oscar . " I sha n't do any such thing , " said Oscar , and he refused to take the ring , and turned upon his heel , leaving the other boy in no very pleasant state of mind . " Then you ' re a great cheat and a swindler , " cried the victim , gathering courage as Oscar retreated . " And you ' re a little greeny , " replied Oscar , with a loud laugh . Oscar had prepared his mind for this explosion of indignation , and though he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over with . He regarded the transaction which led to it as a shrewd business operation , to be chuckled over , rather than repented of ; and he had no idea of spoiling it all , by undoing the bargain . In Oscar 's school , it was customary for the first class ( of which he was a member ) to devote the first half hour of every Monday morning to a lesson in morals . In these lessons , the duties which we owe to God , to ourselves , and to one another , were explained and enforced . Although a text-book was used , the teacher did not confine himself to it , in the recitations , but mingled oral instruction with that contained in the printed lessons , often taking up incidents that occurred in school , to illustrate the principle he wished to establish . It so happened that on the Monday morning after the occurrence just related , the subject of the moral lesson was dishonesty . The various forms of dishonesty ,  - -  theft , robbery , fraud , &c., -- were; explained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then proceeded as follows : " A gentleman was riding in the cars , one evening , when a newsboy passed through the train , and he purchased a paper , giving the boy by mistake a gold eagle instead of a cent . The boy noticed the mistake , but said nothing about it . Albert , you may tell me what you think of that boy 's conduct . " " It was dishonest , " replied Albert ; " because he knew that the money did not belong to him , and yet he kept it . " " But did not a part of the blame belong to the man who made the mistake ? " inquired the teacher . Albert , after thinking a moment , replied : " He was to blame for his carelessness , but not for the boy 's dishonesty . " " You are right , " said the teacher . " The boy was guilty of stealing , just as much as if he had picked the man 's pocket , or broken into his house . But suppose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , it had only been a few cents ,  - -  how then ? " " It would have been just the same , " replied the boy . " But what if the man was very rich , and would never feel the loss , while the boy was poor , and needed the money ? " " That would have made no difference , " replied Albert . " Very good , " continued the teacher ; " when an honest man discovers a mistake in his own favor , he always hastens to rectify it . He will receive only what he is entitled to . Robert , " he added , addressing an other pupil , " how is it with regard to lost articles ? " " When we find anything that has been lost , " replied the boy addressed , " we should try to ascertain the owner , and return the article to him . " " Is there any guilt in neglecting to do this ? " " Yes , sir , it is a kind of dishonesty . " " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often punish men for this very offence , for it is a species of theft . And how of borrowing articles , and neglecting to return them ,  - -  is that honest ? " " It is not , " replied Robert . " Oscar , " continued the teacher , " you may give your opinion of this case : suppose one of your acquaintances wants a certain article belonging to you , and by way of barter , offers you a finger-ring for it . You take it for granted that the ring is gold , but a week or two after the bargain is concluded , you discover that it is of brass , and of no value what ever . The other boy knew all the while it was brass , and also knew you supposed it was gold . What should you say of such a transaction ? Was it honest ? " Oscar turned red , and looked confused , as this question was put to him . It was a minute or two before he made any reply , and then he said , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me it was gold , I do n't see as he was to blame . " " But we will suppose there was no need of his telling you so , " added the master ; " we will suppose he managed the bargain so adroitly , that you never suspected he was not dealing fairly with you . In that case , should you think he had acted honestly towards you ? " " No , sir , " replied Oscar , but it came out with the utmost reluctance . " Certainly not , " said the teacher ; " it is dishonest to take advantage of another 's ignorance , or simplicity , or necessity , in a bargain . Overreaching in trade is often dignified with the name of shrewdness , but , for all that , it is contrary to the rule of honesty . And now I have one more question to ask you : After you have discovered how your comrade has imposed upon you , what should you expect of him ? " Oscar made no reply . " Should you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir , " he replied , in a scarcely audible voice . " Of course you would , " continued the master ; " and if he refused , he would deserve double punishment . " Several other forms of dishonesty were then considered , such as the following ;  - -  withholding from another his just dues ; contracting debts which we know we can not pay , or making promises we know we can not fulfil ; wasting or injuring the property of others , &c.; In concluding , the teacher remarked , that it was not very pleasant to feel that we had been wronged and cheated ; but there was another feeling , a thousand-fold more to be dreaded -- the feeling that we have wronged and cheated others . And so ended the moral lesson for that morning . The particular bearing of this lesson upon Oscar , and the pertinency of the " case " he was called to decide upon , were not generally known to the class , though their suspicions might have been somewhat excited by his confusion , and his reluctance to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed of Oscar 's dishonest bargain by the boy who suffered from it , and he chose this way to impress upon him the immorality of the transaction . He concluded , however , to give him an opportunity to make a voluntary restitution , and so no further reference was made to the matter . Oscar was wise enough to heed the warning . Before night , the brass dog-collar and the ivory pocket-comb were returned to their rightful owner . CHAPTER XII . SICKNESS . " You have got a bad cold , Oscar , " said Mrs. Preston one evening towards the close of winter , as Oscar came in from his play , and was seized with a coughing spell . " And no wonder , " she added , on glancing at his feet ; " why , do you see how wet the bottoms of your pantaloons are ? I should like to know where you have been , to get so wet -- it is strange that you will not keep out of the water . " " I should like to know how anybody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to your knees , " said Oscar . " I could walk about the streets all day without going over my shoes , " replied his mother , " and so could you , if you tried to . I believe you go through all the mud-puddles you can find , just to see how wet you can get . But it wo n't do for you to sit down in this condition . Take off your wet boots , and run up stairs and put on a pair of dry pantaloons and some dry stockings , and then you may sit down to the fire and warm yourself . " " I do n't want to change my pantaloons and stockings , " said Oscar ; " I ' ll take off my boots and dry myself -- that will do just as well . " " No it wo n't , " replied his mother ; " you had better change your clothes , for you 've got a real bad cold now , and I do n't want you to get any more . Come , do you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dry clothes . " Oscar paid no attention to the command , but after removing his wet boots , sat down before the range to dry his feet and legs . Such instances of disobedience were too common in the family to attract any special notice , and Mrs. Preston said nothing more about the matter . Oscar , that afternoon , had been down to the shores of Charles River , near Cambridge Bridge , with Alfred Walton and several other boys . They had been amusing themselves upon the ice that had formed along the edge of the river , and which was now breaking up . They loosened some of the large cakes , and set them floating off upon the current towards the ocean . It was in this way that Oscar got his feet so wet . The next afternoon , when school was dismissed , Oscar , forgetting his wet feet and his cold , went again to the same place , with several of his cronies . Tiger also accompanied the party , for his master seldom went anywhere without him , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous day , with shoving off large blocks of ice into the stream , and with running rapidly over floating pieces that were not large enough to bear them up . Sometimes they narrowly escaped a ducking , so venturesome were they ; and all of them got their feet pretty thoroughly soaked . It happened , after awhile , that a cake of ice upon which the boys were all standing , got disengaged from the shore , unperceived by them , and commenced floating into the river . They were all at work upon another ice-block , trying to push it off , and did not notice that they were going off themselves , until they were several feet from the shore . The distance was too great to leap , and the water was so deep that none of them dared to jump off from their precarious footing . " Well , this is a pretty joke , " said one of the boys , with some appearance of alarm . " I should like to know how we are going to get out of this scrape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out of it ? " replied Oscar . " I do n't , for one -- we shall have a first-rate sail down into the harbor ; sha n't we , Alf ? " " The tide will take us right under the bridge , and I ' m going to climb up one of the piers , " said Alfred , who appeared to be thinking more of a way of escape than of the pleasures of the trip . " Pooh , I sha n't get off there , " said Oscar . " I ' m in for a sail , and if the rest of you back out , I sha n't . You ' ll go too , wo n't you , Tom ? " Before Tom could answer , they all began to notice that their ice-cake gave signs that the burden upon it was greater than it could safely bear . The swift current began to whirl it about in a rather uncomfortable manner , and it was gradually settling under water . They all began to be very much alarmed -- all but Tiger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who looked up into the boys ' faces with an expression of curiosity , as though he wanted to say : " I wonder what mischief these little rogues are up to now ? " Several people who were crossing the bridge now noticed the perilous situation of the boys , and stopped to look at them . As soon as Alfred noticed them , he cried out slowly , at the top of his voice : " Halloo , there ! send us a boat , will you ? we ' re sinking ! " Illustration : Afloat on the Ice . There was some doubt whether the people on the bridge understood the cry , and the other boys repeated it as loud as they could , in the meantime also trying to manifest their want by signs and gestures . Some of the spectators upon the bridge , who were now quite numerous , shouted back in reply ; but the boys , being to their windward , could not understand what they said . Their frail support was now moving rapidly along , and whirling about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk so low that they were all standing in the water , and they expected it would shortly break to pieces and precipitate them all into the river . There were four of them upon the cake , besides the dog . The two youngest boys began to cry with fright ; but Oscar and Alfred , though they were as much alarmed as the others , did not manifest it in this way , but were looking anxiously towards the bridge and the shore for relief . The boys were not long kept in this dreadful state of suspense ; for pretty soon they discovered a boat putting out towards them from the end of the bridge . There were two men in it , each of whom was plying an oar . They called out to the boys not to be frightened , and in a few minutes they were alongside the fugitive ice-cake , whose living freight was safely transferred to the boat . The boatmen then pulled for the wharf from which they came , and the rescued party had the pleasure of standing once more upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they forgot to thank the men who had taken so much trouble to rescue them . They were not ungrateful however ; though it would have been better if their words as well as their looks had expressed the sentiment they felt . As soon as they reached the wharf , the men advised them to run home and dry themselves , which they proceeded to do . When Oscar reached home , he was so hoarse , from hallooing , that he could not speak aloud . When his mother heard of his exposure , and saw how wet he was , she was much concerned for him . She wished him to change his damp clothing , but he did not think it necessary , and instead of complying with her desire , he sat down to the fire and dried himself . He had but little appetite for supper ; and a headache coming on in the evening , he retired to bed early . Before dong so , however , he took a dose of medicine which his mother had prepared , to " throw off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in his troubled dreams , Oscar had floated to sea upon a small piece of ice , and , after a long agony , foundered alone in fathomless waters -- he awoke in the morning feeling very strangely . Every few moments a cold chill ran through his body , that made him shiver until the bed trembled beneath him . His head ached badly , and there was also a pain in his back . He tried to raise himself up , but his arms had lost their strength , and he was barely able to support himself a moment upon his elbow . By-and-bye his brothers , who slept in the same room in another bed , got up , and Oscar informed them that he was too weak to get off the bed . They soon called in their father and mother , who , after looking at the sick boy , concluded to send for a physician . After breakfast , Ralph was despatched for the doctor , who soon arrived , and was conducted into Oscar 's chamber . Seating himself upon the bedside , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to talk with him very pleasantly , asking him various questions about his feelings , the manner in which he took cold , &c.; Having ascertained all the facts and symptoms of the case , he told the family he thought Oscar was suffering from an attack of lung fever , and he then gave directions as to the manner in which the disease should be treated . He also wrote a recipe for some medicine , to be procured at the apothecary 's . The terms used in it were Latin , and very much abbreviated , besides , so that they were unintelligible to Mrs. Preston ; for this is a custom among physicians , that has come down from ancient times . Seeing Mrs. Preston was in some doubt about the prescription , he explained to her what the articles were that composed it , and the effect they would have upon the patient . After the doctor had gone , it was decided to remove Oscar into another chamber , in a lower story , where he would be more comfortable , and where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Wrapping him up warmly in the bed-clothes , his father took him in his arms , and carried him to the room he was to occupy for the present . In spite of his medicine , Oscar continued to grow worse , through the day . He longed for night to come , that he might go to sleep ; but when it came , it did not bring with it the refreshing slumber of health . Short naps and troubled dreams alternated with long , weary hours of wakefulness ; and the sun , at its next rising , found him sicker than before . The pains in his head and chest were more severe ; his skin was hot and dry ; his cheeks were flushed with fever ; he breathed with difficulty , and his cough had become quite distressing . He felt cross and fretful , too , and nothing that was done for him seemed to give him satisfaction . He was unwilling that any one should attend upon him , except his mother , and refused to receive his food or medicine from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent from his room more than a few moments , when he was awake , he would insist upon her being called back . But though Oscar would not allow his mother to leave him , she did not suit him much better than the other members of the family . It was with considerable difficulty that she could coax him to take the medicines the doctor had ordered . Then she was obliged to deny him all forms of nourishment , except a little gum-arabic water , an arrangement at which he complained a good deal . Oscar 's fever continued to run for more than a week , the violence of the disease increasing from day to day . Then a favorable change took place , and the doctor told him the fever had turned , and he was getting better . For a day or two before this , however , he was very ill ; so ill , indeed , that he submitted to whatever the doctor ordered , without a word of complaint . He felt that there was danger , and he dare not stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To this , perhaps , he owed the favorable turn the disease had taken ; for had he refused to take his medicines , as he did at the commencement of his sickness , or even had he only engaged in a fruitless but exhausting contest with his mother , the scale might have turned the other way , and the fever ended in death . Getting better ! That was the best news Oscar had heard for many a day . He almost wanted to kiss the lips that spoke those encouraging words . He always liked Dr. Liscom , but never so well as at that moment . It was good news to all the household , too , and flew quickly from one to another . In fact , the children grew so jubilant over it , that their mother had to remind them that Oscar was yet too sick to bear any noise in the house . " O dear , " said George , " I ' ve got tired of keeping so still . How long will it be before we can make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before I can sing , and practice my music-lessons , mother ? " inquired Ella . " And how long before Oscar can go out and play ? " inquired Ralph , more thoughtful for his sick brother than for himself . " I ca n't tell , " replied their mother ; " you must all keep still a few days longer , for Oscar is very weak now , and the noise disturbs him . The doctor thinks it will take several weeks for him to get fully well , but he will soon be able to sit up , I hope . " The next morning , Oscar felt decidedly better , and so he continued to improve day by day . But his old impatience soon began to return . He grumbled every time the hour returned to take his drops , and he fairly rebelled against the food that was prepared for him -- a little weak gruel , when his appetite was clamoring for a hearty meal of beef and potatoes ! During his sickness , many little delicacies had been sent in to him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was still debarred by the inexorable doctor . He teased his mother to let him have things the doctor had forbidden , and was offended with her when she refused . He thus made a great deal of unnecessary trouble and suffering for his mother , who had served him so devotedly through this sickness that her own health was giving way . A day or two after his fever turned , Oscar wished to sit up in a chair , and begged very hard to be allowed to get up from the bed . " Why , Oscar , " said his mother , " you could not sit up two minutes , if I should put you in a chair . You have no idea how weak you are . " " No , I ai nt weak , " replied Oscar ; " I bet you I can walk across the room just as well as you can -- you do n't know how strong I ' ve grown within a day or two . Come , mother , do let me get up , will you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " answered Mrs. Preston . " If you should try to stand up , you would faint away as dead as a log . It will be a week before you are strong enough to walk about . " " I believe you mean to keep me sick as long as you can , " was Oscar 's unfeeling reply . " I am tired almost to death of laying a-bed , " he added , and the tears began to gather in his eyes . His mother felt hurt by these words , but she attributed them to the weakening and irritating influence of disease , and forgave them as quickly as they were uttered . She even yielded to his wishes so far as to offer to let him sit up in bed a little while . He gladly acceded to the proposal , and putting his arms around her neck , she slowly raised him up ; but he had no sooner reached an upright position than his head began to " fly round like a top , " and he was very glad to be let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for the day . It was a fine April morning when Oscar was first taken up from his sick bed , and placed in an easy chair , well lined with blankets and comforters . This was a memorable event in his life , the first time he sat up after nearly three weeks ' confinement to his bed . He was dragged to the front window , from which he could see the people upon the street below . How familiar , and yet how strange , everything and everybody looked to his sick eyes ! And then , to have his toast and drink set before him upon a corner of the table , where he could help himself , and eat and drink with some comfort ,  - -  was n't that " grand , " to use his own expressive term ! Oscar 's recovery was now pretty rapid , but his mother had to watch him very sharply , to prevent him from running into excesses , to which his impatience continually prompted him . It was hard to make him realize that there was yet some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for several weeks to come . CHAPTER XIII . GETTING WELL . Oscar had reason to remember the first time he went down stairs , after his fit of sickness . It was in the night-time . He awoke , feeling quite hungry ; for he was yet kept on a spare diet , which was far from satisfying the cravings of his appetite . He was alone in his room , and all the rest of the family were asleep . A lamp was burning dimly in the fire-place of his chamber , and the door that led into his mother 's room was open , that she might be ready , at the least sound of alarm . After thinking the matter over a few minutes , and satisfying himself that no one in the house was awake , he determined to go down stairs in quest of something to eat . " What is the use of starving a fellow to death , because he has been sick ! " he said to himself . " I might as well die one way as another ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm bound to have it . I ' ve lived on slops and toasted bread three weeks , and I ca n't stand it any longer . " He accordingly got up , and taking the lamp , stole very cautiously into the entry , and down stairs , having nothing but his night-clothes upon him . The snapping of the stairs , under his tread , was the only noise that was heard , and this did not awake any of the household . He proceeded at once to the kitchen closet , and commenced helping himself with a free hand to its contents . He began upon a dish of corned beef and vegetables , from which he partook quite liberally . He then hastily swallowed a piece of mince-pie , and a slice or two of cake , when , the night air beginning to feel chilly , he hurried back to bed . This last operation was by no means so easy as he had imagined it would be . His knees were very weak and " shaky , " and it seemed as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go up stairs . He was alarmed , and would have given up the attempt , and called for help , but for the dread of being caught in such a flagrant act of disobedience . So he persisted in his efforts , and finally reached his chamber , quite exhausted . After a heavy and troubled sleep , Oscar awoke in the morning , feeling quite wretchedly . As soon as his mother entered the room , her quick eye detected the unfavorable change ; but he did not seem inclined to complain much of his feelings , and appeared averse to conversing about them . She ascertained , however , after awhile , that Oscar was more feverish than he had been , that he had a severe pain in his chest , and that his cough was worse . Many were the surmises thrown out , by his father and mother , as to the probable cause of this change in his symptoms ; but as for himself , he seemed entirely at a loss to account for the mystery , and left them to form their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three times a week , was sent for after breakfast . When he arrived , he questioned Mrs. Preston very closely as to the manner in which the patient had been treated , and he also addressed many inquiries to Oscar ; but he learned nothing from either that could account for the renewed attack of fever . He sat a few moments , in a thoughtful mood , seemingly at a loss what to say , when Oscar , who had complained much of nausea for the last half hour , began to show symptoms of vomiting . A basin was brought , and the contents of his stomach were quickly discharged into it . The mystery was now explained . Mrs. Preston looked on in silent astonishment , while the doctor could hardly repress his anger at this exhibition of the contents of his patient 's stomach . There were great pieces of unmasticated meat and potato , mixed up with a porridge of half-dissolved pie and cake , the whole forming a medley of hearty and indigestible substances , that would have taxed the strong stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor , turning to Mrs. Preston , when Oscar got through , " what does all this mean ? " " I know not ; you must ask him , " replied Mrs. Preston . The same question , put to Oscar , brought from him a reluctant confession of the last night 's folly . When he had concluded , the doctor arose , and taking his hand , said : " I will bid you good-bye . It 's of no use for me to attend upon you any longer , if you abuse my confidence in this way . If you want to kill yourself I wo n't stand in your way . Good morning . " Before Oscar recovered from his astonishment , the doctor had reached the entry . Addressing his mother who was following him , he said : " Call him back , mother -- tell him I wo n't do so again -- call him back . " The doctor heard the message , and returned . " I will consent to prescribe for you only on one condition , " he said ; " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I tell you to . You must take the medicines I order , and eat only what I tell you to , or I will have nothing more to do with you . Do you agree to that ? " " Yes , sir , " replied Oscar . The doctor resumed his seat , and felt the patient 's pulse . He had not yet got entirely over his irritation , and , turning to Mrs. Preston , he remarked : " If the patient was a little stronger , my first prescription would be a smart external application of birch or ratan ; but , as it is , we shall have to omit that for the present . You need not think you will escape punishment , however , " he continued , turning to Oscar . " This scrape of yours will put you back more than one week and if you are not careful you may never get your health again . You may trifle with the doctor , but you ca n't trifle with the lung fever . " The doctor then gave directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not until he had again warned him against leaving the room without his mother 's consent , or eating any articles forbidden by her . Oscar found no opportunity after this to evade the commands of the doctor , had he been so disposed , for some one was always with him by day and night . Still , his recovery seemed to have been checked very much by his relapse , and the doctor 's skill was taxed pretty severely to bring the fever to a favorable termination . As it was , his attempt was not fully successful ; for the fever , in spite of all he could do , left behind it a cough , and a weakness of the lungs , which gave Oscar 's parents no little alarm at times . For a fortnight after his midnight supper , Oscar allowed his mother and the doctor to do just as they pleased with him . He yielded to their wishes , and their orders were law to him . At the end of that time the doctor discontinued his regular visits . Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant weather ; but his cough rendered prudence still very necessary . His confinement , however , was daily growing more irksome , and sometimes he disregarded the positive commands of his parents by going out when the weather was unsuitable . One morning , a menagerie , or collection of wild beasts , was to enter the city in grand procession . There were to be several elephants and camels on foot , besides hundreds of other animals ( invisible ) in carriages . There was also to be a mammoth gilt chariot , filled with musicians , and drawn by ever so many horses . The procession was to pass very near the street where Oscar lived , and he intended to go and see it ; but when the morning came , there was a cold , drizzling rain , with an uncomfortable east wind , and his mother told him he must not think of going out . He did think of it , however , and not only thought of it , but went . While his mother was up stairs , he quietly slipped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass . There he waited about an hour , until he became thoroughly wet and chilled , and then returned home , without seeing the sight ; for the showmen had shortened their intended route on account of the storm . He entered the house , vexed by his disappointment and the uncomfortable plight he was in ; and when his mother mildly reproved him for his conduct , and entreated him to be more careful of himself , he only replied that he did not wish to live , if he must be shut up in the house all the time . This act of imprudence and disobedience made him a close prisoner in the house for several days , besides causing him no little suffering . Oscar employed much of his leisure time in reading , during his confinement in-doors . His acquaintances lent him many interesting books , with which he beguiled the weary hours . One day , happening to think of a volume belonging to his classmate , Benjamin Wright , which he thought he should like to read , he sent word by Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin brought it to school , and Ralph took it home to Oscar . On removing the paper in which it was wrapped up , a letter dropped out , which Oscar found was directed to himself . He opened it , and a smile lit up his countenance as he glanced over the sheet , which was filled up with drawings and writing of an amusing character . Benjamin was quite famous among the boys for the skill and facility with which he made sketches , and in this letter he had given a curious specimen of his artistic talent . The following is a copy of this production : DEAR OSCAR : I am sorry to hear you ' re in weakness and pain , And I send you a book to beguile your tired brain ; I send also some puzzles , to stir up your wit , And tempt you to laugh , when you really do n't feel like it one bit ! Illustration : A Queer Name . What a queer name ! What do we all do when we first get into bed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which is lengthened by being cut at both ends ? My first , if you do , you wo n't hit ; My second , if you do , you will have it ; My whole , if you do , you wo n't guess it . Illustration : The Double Face . Turn me over , pray . A word there is , five syllables contains ; Take one away , no syllable remains . What is that which is lower with a head than without one ? Who was the first whistler ? What tune did he whistle ? How do you swallow a door ? What is that which lives in winter , dies in summer , and grows with its root upwards ? If you were to tumble out of the window , what would you fall against ? Illustration : The Cat-Erect . Why is this like the Falls of Niagara ? If my puzzles are simple , and my pictures a fright , Then just laugh at me , and it will all B. WRIGHT . This letter was the prime source of attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and its reception formed an era in Oscar 's sick-day experience , not easily to be forgotten . All the family , from Mr. Preston down to little George , set themselves to work to guess out the riddles ; but in some of them , they found more than their match . To Oscar , however , the letter was something more than a collection of drawings and puzzles . It was a token of interest and sympathy from a boy towards whom he had never manifested a very friendly spirit . Benjamin 's high standing in the school , both for scholarship and behavior , had awakened in Oscar a secret feeling of jealousy or resentment towards him . He was a poor boy , too , and this by no means increased Oscar 's respect for him . But now , Oscar began to feel ashamed of all this ; and as instances of his unkind treatment of his generous classmate came up in remembrance , he wished he had the power to blot them from existence . He determined thenceforth to " stand up " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a return for his manifestation of good feeling . Ella wanted to carry Benjamin 's letter to school , to show to the girls , but Oscar would not allow it to go out of his hands . She then begged the privilege of copying it , to which he consented . She did the best she could , no doubt , but her drawings probably did not quite do justice to the subjects ; for Oscar declared that her copy was more comical than the original . She lent it to some of her schoolmates , one of whom was roguish enough to show it to Benjamin himself ! He laughed heartily at the caricature ; but thinking it was getting him rather more notoriety than he wished , he put it in his pocket , and that was the end of it . In consequence of his many acts of imprudence , Oscar got along very slowly in his recovery . Yet he was daily growing more impatient of his long confinement , and the utmost vigilance of his parents was necessary to restrain him from doing himself harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that season of the year , he was not allowed to go out , and the time passed heavily with him . One rainy afternoon , as he was sitting listlessly at a front window , watching for some object of interest to pass , a coach stopped at the door , and his heart beat high at the thought of his dulness being dispelled by the arrival of " company . " The driver opened the coach door , and out jumped a stout , brown-faced man , whom Oscar at once recognized as his uncle , John Preston , from Maine . The arrival of Uncle John was soon heralded through the house , and a warm greeting extended to him . He usually visited the city thrice a year on business , and on such occasions made his brother 's house his stopping-place . He lived in the town of Brookdale , where he had a family ; but he was engaged in the lumber business , and generally spent the winter months in the forests of Maine , with large gangs of loggers , who were employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks of the streams , where they were floated down to the mills in the spring freshets . These forests are far from any settlement , and the lumber-men live in log-huts , in a very independent and care-for-nobody sort of way . Oscar had often heard his uncle describe their manner of life , and , to him , there was something quite fascinating about it . He thought he should like the logging business very much -- all but the working part of it ; he was afraid that would spoil the whole , for his Uncle John always represented it as being pretty hard work . Oscar had four cousins in Brookdale , the children of his Uncle John , none of whom he had ever seen . He had many questions to ask about them , in the course of which he expressed a wish that he might visit them . His uncle replied that he should like to take him home with him , and , as he was sick , he thought the journey might do him good . He afterwards talked with Oscar 's parents about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , hoping that a few weeks in the country would improve his health .

Oscar 's valise was well packed for his journey , and many were the injunctions given him by his mother , in regard to his conduct during his absence from home . The morning for his departure soon came , and , in company with his uncle , he proceeded to the depot , and took the cars for Portland . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oscar secured a seat by a window , from which he could see the country they passed through ; while his uncle , to whom the journey was no novelty , seated himself by his side , and was soon absorbed in his morning newspaper . The keen relish with which Oscar set out upon his long ride gradually wore off , and he began to feel weary long before the train reached its destination . It was just noon when they arrived at Portland ; and as it was too late to reach Brookdale that day , Oscar 's uncle concluded to stop there until the next morning . They proceeded to a hotel , where they booked their names , and were shown to a chamber . After dinner , Mr. Preston took Oscar to walk , and showed him some of the most notable places about town . But the latter felt too tired to walk about a great deal , and spent most of the afternoon in the hotel , while his uncle was off attending to some business . After supper , Mr. Preston again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with him , but he preferred to remain in the hotel . He lounged awhile in the bar-room , as it was called ( though there was no bar in it ) , listening to the conversation of the men who had gathered there . At length , beginning to grow sleepy , he retired to his chamber , taking with him a queer little lamp the landlord gave him , which appeared to hold only about a thimblefull of oil . Oscar thought it was a stingy contrivance , and had some notion of sitting up to see how long it would burn ; but his eyelids grew heavy , and he gave up the idea . Throwing off his clothing , he extinguished his diminutive lamp , and took possession of one of the beds in the room , of which there were two . As he composed himself to sleep , a slight sense of lonesomeness stole over him , when he remembered that he was alone in a strange house and a strange city , more than a hundred miles from his home ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been taught by his mother in infancy , but which of late years , in his sad waywardness , he had outgrown and almost forgotten : " Now I lay me down to sleep , I pray the lord my soul to keep ; If I should die before I wake , I pray the lord my soul to take . " He had occasionally repeated to himself this simple but appropriate evening petition during his late illness ; but , strange to tell , for several years previous to that time , the thought of asking anything of the great Giver of all good had scarcely ever entered his mind . Oscar was soon fast asleep , and the next thing he was conscious of was the striking of a strange church-clock , that awoke him in the morning . His uncle was dressing himself , and the sun was shining in at the window . For a moment , he was puzzled to determine where he was ; but his recollection returned when his uncle remarked : " Come , Oscar , it is time to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an hour . " Oscar jumped out of bed , and was dressed and ready for the breakfast table before the bell rang . After the morning meal was despatched , for it was literally a work of despatch , judging from the celerity with which the heaping plates of hot biscuits and beef-steak disappeared from the long table ,  - -  Mr . Preston settled with the landlord , and proceeded with Oscar to the railroad depot . " How much further have we got to go ? " inquired Oscar , after they had taken their seat in the car . " About one hundred and twenty miles , " replied his uncle ; " and thirty-five of it will be in a stage-coach -- that is the worst of the whole journey . " " I shall like that part of it first-rate , I guess , " said Oscar . " If they have good horses , I know I shall . " " You will find out how you like it , before night , " added Mr. Preston , with a smile . The cars were soon on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully engaged in taking note of the scenery from the windows . The appearance of the country did not differ much from that through which he passed the day previous ; and long before he reached the end of his eighty-miles ' ride , his attention began to flag , and his eyes to grow weary . It was about eleven o'clock , when they arrived at the depot at which they were to leave the train . Here they had an opportunity to rest an hour , and to take dinner , before resuming their journey . After dinner , the stage-coach made its appearance , and the passengers began to stow themselves away within it , Oscar mounted the outside , and took a seat with the driver , with whom he was soon on intimate terms . All things being ready , the horses started , at the familiar " Get up ! " and they were on their way toward Brookdale . The horses did not prove quite so smart as Oscar hoped they would , and the coach was a heavy and hard-riding concern , compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the road was good , though hilly , and the scenery , much of the way , was very pleasant . The driver , too , was quite talkative , and Oscar being the only outside passenger , enjoyed the full benefit of his communicativeness . Occasionally they passed through a village , with its rows of neat white houses , its tall church steeple , its bustling store , and its groups of children playing in the streets . Now and then they stopped a few moments , to leave a passenger , a package , or a mail-bag ; for the strong leathern bags , with brass padlocks , which the driver had carefully packed away under his box , contained the United States ' mails for the towns along his route . As they advanced on their way , the villages became less frequent , the farm houses were more scattering , and the country grew more wild . Sometimes the road extended for miles through thickly-wooded forests . Occasionally they would come in sight of a river , and , perhaps , would hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of a raft of logs floating lazily down the stream . It was about six o'clock when the stage stopped at the post-office of a small settlement , and the driver told Oscar he was going to leave him there . His seat had grown tiresome , during the last few hours , and he was by no means sorry to leave it . " Well , Jerry , here I am again , " said Mr. Preston , addressing a boy who stood by . " How are all the folks at home ? " " They are well , " replied the boy addressed . " This way Oscar , " said Mr. Preston , pointing to a horse and wagon on the opposite side of the street . " Oscar , this is your cousin Jerry , " he continued , and the boys shook hands with each other , in acknowledgment of the introduction . Oscar now learned that they were yet five miles from Brookdale , and that as the stage did not pass any nearer to his uncle 's , Jerry had come over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being but one seat to the wagon , Mr. Preston and Oscar took possession of it , while Jerry seated himself on the floor behind them . While on the way to Brookdale , Oscar addressed several remarks to his cousin ; but the latter seemed shy , and they did not get acquainted with each other very fast . They passed but very few houses , and Oscar looked in vain for any signs of a village . At length , when he thought they could not be far from their journey 's end , he inquired : " Where is the village , uncle John ? Sha n't we see any of it , going to your house ? " " This is the village , " replied Mr. Preston . " This a village ! " exclaimed Oscar ; " why , I do n't see any houses . " " This is all the village there is , " replied his uncle ; " there are hardly any two houses in sight of each other in the town . " They were now approaching an old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several children were standing , looking towards them . This proved to be the end of their journey . Having driven the wagon into the large barn which stood nearly opposite the house , Mr. Preston left Jerry to put up the horse , and proceeded at once to the house with his nephew . Mrs. Preston had seen Oscar in Boston , and came out to meet him . She welcomed him very cordially , and inquired after all the other members of the family . She then introduced him to his three other cousins , Emily , Harriet , and Mary , all of whom were younger than Jerry , and quite as shy and silent as he , at the presence of a stranger . Supper was now ready , and all the family , including James , the hired man , seated themselves at the table . Mr. Preston , during the meal , talked freely of what he had seen and done since he left home ; but the children maintained their gravity and silence , though Oscar tried hard to break the ice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A strange face was an unusual thing among them , and they could not get over it in a moment . After supper , Mrs. Preston and her oldest daughter cleared off the table and washed the dishes ; James and Jerry went out to the barn ; Mr. Preston sat down to a table to examine some papers he had in his pocket-book ; while Harriet and Mary remained , to keep Oscar company . The latter now began to make advances towards his youngest cousin , who was the prettiest and most interesting of the children . A little coaxing brought her to his side . " Do you know what my name is , Sissy ? " he inquired . " Yes ; it 's Oscar , " she replied . " Oscar what ? " he inquired . " Cousin Oscar , " she answered , after a little hesitation . " Yes , but that is n't all of it , " replied Oscar ; " do n't you know the other part of it -- Cousin Oscar --  -- what ? " Mary looked thoughtful a moment , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oscar could not help laughing at this amusing mistake , and Mary , feeling hurt at the liberty he took , began to move away ; but he held her by the hand , saying : " No , do n't go yet , Sissy -- you got my name almost right , after all . Cousin Oscar Preston , from Boston ,  - -  that was what you meant to say , was n't it ? " " Yes , " replied Mary . " Now tell me what your name is ? " continued Oscar . " Mary Preston , " she replied . " And how old are you ? " " I ' m going to be six next winter , " she answered , with animation . " Very well , you ' re a smart little girl , " replied Oscar . " How old be you ? " inquired Mary , now turning the table upon her questioner . " I ' m fourteen , " said Oscar . " You ' re a smart little boy , " added Mary , with a roguish twinkle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a merry laugh . After that , there was no more shyness between Mary and Oscar . With the older children , however , Oscar did not get acquainted quite so easily , particularly with the girls . He made but little progress with any of them that evening , until he retired with Jerry , with whom he was to sleep during his visit . After they had got into bed , Jerry 's tongue was loosed , and before they went to sleep his reserve had almost entirely vanished . CHAPTER XV . BROOKDALE . The next morning the air was extremely raw and chilly , and there were strong indications of rain . Oscar 's uncle and aunt advised him so earnestly not to expose himself to the cold and damp wind , that he did not extend his rambles any further than to the barn that day . But if he did not go far , he made many new acquaintances . Having made sure of Jerry and Mary , he left his other two cousins to " surrender at discretion , " and turned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce himself to Billy , the horse , who was eating the breakfast James had just given him . After rubbing and talking to him awhile , he paid his respects to a pair of oxen and three or four cows , which he helped James and Jerry to drive into the pasture near the barn . He next visited the hogs , and then the hens . This completed the list of life stock on the farm . He then had a frolic with Jerry in the hay-loft , in the midst of which he suddenly stopped and inquired : " Is n't it almost time for you to go to school , Jerry ? " " No , " his cousin replied , with a laugh , " it wants just six months of it . " " Six months ! " exclaimed Oscar ; " what do you mean ? Do n't you go to school ? " " Yes , I go when there is any school ; but it does n't commence till next December , " replied Jerry . " That 's a queer idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how long your school keeps , after it begins . " " It keeps three months , " replied Jerry . " I should like that first-rate -- I wish I lived here , " said Oscar ; " I have to go to school all the time . But why does n't your school keep more than three months ? " " I do n't know , " replied Jerry ; " I guess it 's because folks are too stingy to pay for it . They ' ve been talking of having a summer school , but I do n't believe it will amount to anything . " " I should hope it would n't if I lived here , " said Oscar . " What capital times you must have ! no school to bother you , and no lessons to get . But I suppose you have to work some -- do n't you ? " " No , not much , " said Jerry ; " I help a little in planting and haying time , and have a few chores to do about the house ,  - -  that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play with ? " inquired Oscar . " There are boys enough , " replied his cousin , " but they are scattered all over town ,  - -  that 's the worst of it . There is only one fellow of my age that lives near here , and he 's half a mile off . " " If you call that near , I should like to know what you call distant , " said Oscar . " I ' m afraid I should be lonesome if I lived here . " " Halloo , it rains ! " said Jerry , as the big drops began to sound upon the roof over their heads . " Then I ' m going in , " added Oscar , and they both started for the house . It proved to be a rainy day , and Oscar was obliged to find his amusement in-doors through its remaining hours . With his four cousins to help him , this was not a very difficult matter . When he retired at night , he felt quite at home in his new quarters . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more beautiful for the rain . To Oscar , the fields not only seemed greener , but the hills looked higher , and the trees more majestic , than they did the day before . " Why , " he exclaimed , as he stood before the chamber window , " there is a pond away off there , is n't there ? I did n't know that before . " " Yes , that 's a pond , " replied Jerry , " and we ' ve got a small river , too , but you ca n't see it from here . We ' ll go over to the pond , some warm day , and go into water ; it 's a real good place to bathe . " " Perhaps we ' ll go to-day , " said Oscar ; " it looks as though it were going to be real warm . " Mrs. Preston now called to the boys that breakfast was ready , and they hurriedly finished dressing themselves , and descended to the kitchen . Having washed his face at the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket-comb ; but Jerry was in too great a hurry to go through this last operation , and he was about taking his seat at the table , with his hair standing up in every direction , when his father inquired : " Jerry , what have you been doing to your head ? " " Nothing , " replied Jerry , with a look of surprise . " Well , I think you had better do something to it , before you come here , " said his father . " Oscar will think you were brought up among the wild Arabs , if you come to the table with such a mop of hair as that about your head . Do n't you see how nicely he has smoothed his hair ? " " He 's got a comb of his own . I wish you would buy me one , father , " said Jerry . " Do n't stand there talking -- go and comb your hair , " said Mr. Preston , somewhat sharply . To tell the truth , Jerry did need a lesson in neatness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model for him to imitate . Having reduced his snarly locks to something like order and smoothness , Jerry took his seat at the table , much improved in appearance . " You ' ll have a chance to go about some to-day , Oscar , " said Mr. Preston ; " it 's about twenty-five degrees warmer than it was yesterday . " " Father , " said Jerry , " I and Oscar --  " " I and Oscar -- where did you learn your manners ? " interrupted his mother . Jerry was for a moment in doubt whether to be offended or not at this second unexpected lesson in good-breeding ; but he finally concluded to make the best of it , and went on with his story : " Oscar and I , then -- were going over to the pond this forenoon , and I guess it will be warm enough for us to go into water . Should n't you think it would ? " " No , indeed , " replied Mr. Preston , " you must n't think of such a thing . It 's only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into water for two or three weeks yet . Besides , Oscar ' s an invalid , and I should n't like to have him go in , even if it was warm enough for you . I would n't walk about much , either , at first , " he continued , addressing Oscar . " You ' re weak , and must look out , and not overdo yourself . This afternoon , when the horse is at leisure , Jerry shall give you a ride ; so you had better not go far this forenoon . " The river of which Jerry spoke is a small stream that has its source in the lake Oscar saw from the chamber window . It flows in a south-westerly direction , crossing the road on which Mr. Preston lived , not far from his house . A small bridge is thrown over the river at this point . After breakfast , Jerry and Oscar walked down to this bridge , and then , leaving the road , followed the river through the fields and woods , to its fountain-head . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a mile across , in one direction , with an irregular shore , fringed most of the way with woods . A two-masted sail-boat was riding at anchor , a little off from the shore , which Oscar regarded with wishful eye ; but as it did not belong to Mr. Preston , and they could not reach it without going into the water , it was of no use to think of taking a sail . They now walked along the edge of the pond , some distance , and after wandering some time in the woods , they returned home by a circuitous route . The annexed map of Brookdale will show the location of the pond , river , &c.; Jerry lived in the house numbered 2 . Illustration : Map of Brookdale . Oscar and Jerry spent the rest of the forenoon in the barn and wood-shed , and in the fields immediately around the house . After dinner , Mr. Preston told the boys they could have the horse and wagon , and as the family wanted some groceries , they might ride over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team , and were soon on their way . The store at which Mr. Preston traded was at the village where the stage left Oscar , which goes by the name of the " Cross-Roads , " from the fact that two of the principal thoroughfares of that section of country cross at this point . Though this store was about five miles distant , there was no other one nearer to Mr. Preston 's . The boys had a fine ride over to the village . Oscar drove , and was quite anxious to put Billy to a test of his speed ; but as his uncle told them not to hurry , because the horse had been worked some in the forenoon , he did not dare to make any experiment of this kind . Jerry assured him , however , that he once drove Billy over to the Cross-Roads in just twenty minutes , which was the quickest time he had ever been known to make . He thought this a remarkable feat ; but Oscar did not seem much astonished at it , and said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , and even in less time if the road was smooth and level . After riding about three-quarters of an hour , they arrived at the Cross-Roads , and drove up to a post and chain for tying horses in front of the store . The store was kept in a large wooden building . Over the door was the sign , " J. FLETCHER , VARIETY STORE ; " and the shutters were covered with columns of names of articles sold within , such as " Bacon , " " Cheese , " " Flour , " " Grain , " " Shoes , " " Dry Goods , " &c.; Another sign in one of the windows indicated that this was also the post-office of the village . The boys went into the store , and while Jerry was ordering the articles his mother had sent for , Oscar improved the opportunity to look around the premises . It was to him a queer assortment of goods . There seemed to be a little of everything for sale . Here you could buy of one salesman articles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different shops . Groceries and dry goods , country produce and hardware , boots , shoes , and hats , confectionary and fancy articles , stoves and children 's toys , were in most neighborly companionship . Before leaving the store , Oscar invested a few cents in candy and cigars ; for his father had given him a little spare change beyond what was necessary to defray the expenses of the journey . He shared the candy with Jerry , and put the cigars in his pocket for future use . Jerry having finished his business at the store , they set out on their return , and arrived home in safety and without meeting with any remarkable adventure . The boys employed themselves the rest of the afternoon in planning excursions and amusements , and before they got through , they had laid out " fun " enough to occupy them for several days . The evenings were now quite short , and as it was the custom to retire to bed early at Mr. Preston 's , it frequently happened that no lamps were lit in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evening , Oscar , who began to feel pretty tired , laid down upon the sofa in the sitting-room , and in a few minutes was fast asleep . Jerry got a straw , and was about to tickle his ear , when his mother stopped him . Oscar 's nap , however , was a short one , and suddenly waking up , he began to laugh . " I guess you had a pleasant dream , " said his aunt . " I had a real funny one , " replied Oscar . " I thought you sent me over to the store to get some things , and when I got there , I had them all jumbled together in my head , and I told the man I wanted a yard of molasses , and a pound of calico , and a gallon of shingle-nails , and I did n't know what else . And I thought the man laughed , and asked me if I would take them loose , or have them done up in a rag . Then another boy that was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke me up . I wonder how long I slept -- do you know , aunt ? " " Only two or three minutes , " replied Mrs. Preston . " I was real smart , then , " replied Oscar ; " for you gave me my errand , and I harnessed the horse and drove away over to the Cross-Roads , and went through the scene in the store , and woke up again , all in two or three minutes . I thought I ' d been asleep half an hour . " " I should think you ' d dream about the store , " said Jerry ; " you ' ve made fun enough about it , if that ' s all . " " Well , I ' ll leave it to aunt if it is n't odd to see such a queer lot of stuff in one store ; I ' ve heard about country stores , but I never saw one that would come up to that before . It is almost equal to going into a fair , to go in there . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pop-gun . " " There is n't business enough to support more than one trader , and that is the reason why Mr. Fletcher keeps such a variety , " said Mrs. Preston . " I know that , " said Oscar , " and I suppose the folks are glad to have him keep all sorts of knick-knacks ; but it seems queer to me , to see groceries and dry goods , and everything else , in the same shop . " " Did you see any babies there ? " inquired little Mary , who was amusing herself by walking around the room backwards . " What sort of babies -- live ones , or rag ones , or wax ones ? " inquired Oscar . " No , none of them , " replied Mary ; " I mean crying babies , like Annie Davenport 's . " " O , you mean those little dolls that make a squeaking noise when you squeeze them . No , I believe I did n't see any , " said Oscar . " No , Mr. Fletcher would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was very fond of teasing his sisters . " No , they ai nt silly , either , are they cousin Oscar ? " said Mary . " No , " replied Oscar , " seeing it 's you , they ai nt silly . " Mary was continuing her backward walk around the room , and was just at that moment passing before Jerry , when he suddenly put out his foot , and stumbling over it , she fell heavily upon the floor , striking her head against a corner of the sofa . A loud scream immediately followed this mishap , and as the author of it hastened to raise up his sister , he was himself a little frightened ; but seeing no blood flowing from her head , he concluded she was " more scared than hurt , " and tried to turn the affair into a joke , saying : " There , sis , you 're a little crying baby yourself , now . Come , stop your noise ; you ' ve blubbered enough about it . It did n't hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , what is the matter ? " said Mrs. Preston , who had left the room a moment before , and hurried back on hearing Mary scream . " Jerry knocked me over , " said Mary , sobbing bitterly , as her mother lifted her up into her lap . " Where did it hurt you , dear ?  - -  there ? Well , let mother rub it , and it will feel better soon . Jerry is a naughty boy to do so . Why need you torment your little sister so ? " Mrs. Preston added , turning to Jerry . Mr. Preston , who had been sitting upon the door-step , smoking his pipe , as was his custom in the evening , came in , on hearing the uproar ; and having ascertained what the trouble was , he boxed Jerry 's ears pretty severely , and sent him off to bed . Oscar soon followed him ; but Jerry was so mortified at the rough handling he had received , that he scarcely spoke again that night . CHAPTER XVI . IN THE WOODS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Oscar . He was fast gaining his strength , and the increased fulness and color of his countenance betokened returning health . No part of this improvement was to be attributed to the bottle of cough drops his mother packed away in the bottom of his valise , and charged him to take every morning and night ; for the drops were not very palatable , and he had not opened the bottle since he left home . In fact , he had by this time quite forgotten both the medicine and his mother 's injunction . So rapid was the improvement in Oscar 's health , that two or three days after his trip to the Cross-Roads , Mr. Preston gave his consent to an excursion he and Jerry had planned , which was to occupy a whole day . " Old Staple 's Hut , " as it was called , was the place they proposed to visit . It was about four miles distant , beyond the hills in the north-east part of the town , represented in the upper corner of the map of Brookdale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordingly filled a small basket with eatables . While she was doing this , Jerry took Oscar aside and said : " There is one thing more we want , and that is father 's gun . I know he wo n't let me have it , but I guess he would lend it to you , if you should ask him . " " Yes , we must have a gun , " replied Oscar ; " and I should just as lief ask him for it as not . " Oscar hunted up his uncle , and made known his request . Mr. Preston hesitated a moment , and then inquired : " Does your father allow you to use a gun at home ? " " He never says anything about it , either way , " replied Oscar . " Well , I guess you had better not take the gun , " said Mr. Preston . " I ' m afraid you might get hurt ,  - -  that 's all I care about . I do n't allow Jerry to use firearms , and I should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without your father 's consent . " " But I ' ll be very careful if you ' ll let me have it , " added Oscar . " I ' ve fired a gun several times , and know how to handle it . " " No , I think you had better not carry the gun with you , " replied his uncle . " If you used it , Jerry would think he must , and I know he is too careless to be trusted with it . He ' d shoot you , just as like as not , if he did n't kill himself . " Mr. Preston 's tone was so decided , that Oscar saw it would be useless to say anything more about the gun , and so he and Jerry were obliged to abandon the idea of taking it with them . Taking their basket of provisions , they accordingly set out on their long tramp . Leaving the road , and turning into a footpath through the fields , they passed close by the upper edge of the pond . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of swamp land , and a number of brooks to cross . Sometimes they had to pick their way along upon stones which had been placed at regular intervals in wet places , or upon old logs that served for bridges ; and at times it required no little skill in balancing to avoid getting a wet foot . After they had got beyond the pond , however , the land gradually ascended , and was mostly occupied as pastures for cattle . But they still occasionally came to a brook , flowing down from the hills towards the pond . Most of them were so narrow , they could easily jump over them ; but in one instance they were obliged to take off their shoes and stockings and wade across . " Now you see why this place is called Brookdale , " said Jerry , after they had passed four or five of these little streams . " Is that the reason , because there are so many brooks ? I never thought of that before , " said Oscar . " Yes , that 's it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make quite a show ; but they get low in the summer , and generally dry up in August , unless it 's a very wet season . " " I ' m going to cut me a cane , " said Oscar , taking out his knife ; " I see a real straight and handsome one in there , " and he pointed to a thicket they were approaching . " That 's nothing but birch -- that wo n't make a good cane , " replied Jerry ; " stop a minute , and I ' ll find you something better . " After looking about a little , Jerry found some beeches , which he said would make good canes . They accordingly cut two of the straightest and handsomest . " I mean to try an experiment with mine , " said Oscar , " and see if I ca n't crook the top of it . Do you know how they do it , Jerry ? " " No , I always thought they grew in that shape , " replied Jerry . " A man told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent it , " said Oscar . " He said that was the way all the hooked canes were made . I do n't know whether he knew or not , but I mean to try it some day , and see how it works . " " I do n't believe in that , " said Jerry . " It is n't very likely you can bend such a stick as that without breaking it ; just see how stiff it is . " " I do n't care , I 'll try it , just to satisfy myself , " replied Oscar . Oscar was right in regard to bending wood . The hooked-top walking-sticks are made in the way he described ,  - -  by boiling the end , and then bending it into an arch . In boiling wood , several substances which enter into its composition are dissolved , and others are softened , so that it is rendered flexible . The boys trudged slowly on their way , now aided by their canes , which , in a long walk , are of no slight service to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing , and whistling , as merrily as the birds around them , Oscar remembered the cigars he bought at the store , and soon the pure atmosphere of the fields was polluted with the vile odor of bad tobacco . Oscar had been in the habit of smoking occasionally for some time ; but though he considered it a manly accomplishment , he was very careful not to let his parents know that he was addicted to it . He prevailed upon his cousin to take a cigar ; but Jerry was not very partial to tobacco , and a few whiffs satisfied him for that occasion . They had now reached the foot of the long , steep hills , over which they must climb . These hills were thickly wooded most of the way , forming beautiful groves , cool , dark , fragrant with resinous odors , and softly carpeted with moss and decayed leaves . Oscar and Jerry concluded to rest a few minutes before scaling the hills . Selecting a favorable spot , they stretched themselves at full length upon the ground , and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest , and the trees were as straight as an arrow , and so tall that their tops almost seemed among the clouds . The moaning of the wind among the topmost branches sounded like the distant roar of the sea . Birds were skipping merrily among the " tasselled boughs , " and curiously eying the young strangers who had invaded their solitude . " O , how I wish I had that gun now ! " said Oscar , as a fine plump robin lit on one of the lower branches of a tree right over his head . In repay for this generous wish , Signor Robin executed one of his choicest songs in his handsomest style , and , without waiting for an encore from his audience , darted off and was quickly out of sight . But it is probable the audience thought more of the " good shot " he presented , than of the sweet strains he poured forth for their entertainment . " There 's better game than that in these woods , " said Jerry , after the robin had taken his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired Oscar . " Yes , " replied Jerry , " there are rabbits , and woodchucks , and weasels , and skunks , and squirrels ; and some folks say there are wild-cats here , but I do n't know about that . Jim Oakley , a fellow who lives about a mile from our house , comes over here gunning very often ; and he says he saw a real savage-looking creature here , a few weeks ago , that he took to be a wild-cat . He fired at it , but it got clear of him . He says it looked a good deal like a cat , only it was larger , and had a little short tail . I wish he ' d killed it . I should like to know what it was . I never saw a wild-cat ; did you ? " " No , " replied Oscar . " But that was n't equal to something a man came across in the woods the other side of these hills , two or three years ago , " continued Jerry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know ; was it a moose ? " inquired Oscar . " No , " replied Jerry ; " moose come down into this neighborhood , once in awhile , but that was n't what I was going to tell you about . There is a road through these woods , a little beyond the hills . It is n't travelled much , except by the loggers in the fall and spring . A man was riding along this road , one afternoon in summer , when he suddenly came across a monstrous black bear . As soon as the bear saw him , he squat down on his haunches , right in the middle of the road , and began to show his teeth . The man did n't dare to drive by him , and his horse was so frightened that it was as much as he could do to hold him in . He had a loaded revolver with him , but he knew there was n't much hope of killing the bear with that . So he turned his horse about , and concluded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun and somebody to help him kill the bear . The bear sat still , watching him , as much as to say , ' If you 'll let me alone , I ' ll let you alone ; ' but just as the man was starting up , he thought he would try his pistol , and so he blazed away at the bear . Two or three of the shot hit the bear in the shoulder . They did n't hurt him much , only enough to rouse his dander ; but he sprang up as quick as lightning , and started after the team . The man whipped up his horse , and the bear ' pulled foot ' after him , and did n't give up the race till he had run about a quarter of a mile . The man said if he had been afoot , the bear would have beat him at running , but he could n't keep up with the horse . " Well , the man went back three or four miles , and got another man to go with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns and hunting-knives ; but when they drove back to where the man met the bear , they could n't find anything of him . They traced his tracks into the woods , but after awhile they lost them , and as it was getting late , they gave up the hunt ; and nobody hereabouts has seen that bear from that day to this . " " Perhaps he 's about here now -- who knows ? " said Oscar . " No , I guess he went right back to the place he came from , " replied Jerry . " Somebody would have seen him , if he ' d stayed around here . " " Where do you suppose he came from ? " inquired Oscar . " From way back in the woods , fifty miles from here , " replied Jerry . " There had been great fires in the woods that summer , and I suppose he got burned out , or frightened , and that was the reason he came down this way . " " I should like to meet such a customer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a good double-barrelled gun with me . I read in a newspaper , the other day , about a boy up in New Hampshire , who met a bear and two cubs , all alone in the woods . He had a gun with him , and killed the old one , and one of the cubs , but the other cub got off . That was doing pretty well , was n't it ? " " ' T was so , " said Jerry ; " but I guess you would n't have done quite so well as that . " " I bet I should have tried , at any rate , " said Oscar , who really was not deficient in courage , though he had hardly practiced hunting enough to justify him in believing that he could master so savage an animal as a bear . Having rested themselves , the boys resumed their journey , and after ten minutes ' hard work , reached the top of the range of hills . The highest summit was a bare ledge of rock , and they concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of the view to be obtained . It was called " Prospect Rock , " and was very appropriately named . As the boys stood upon it , the country for miles around was spread out at their feet ,  - -  houses , and cultivated fields , and forests , and roads , and narrow streams . A distant mountain was visible in the west , which Jerry said was about twenty miles off , though it seemed much nearer . After enjoying the scene a few minutes , they began to descend the hill on the other side . They kept their eyes open , for game , but they saw only a few squirrels , and one rabbit , which bounded off , and was out of sight in a moment . Jerry pointed out to Oscar a woodchuck 's hole , near the foot of the hill . " I should like to see a woodchuck , " said Oscar ; " what do they look like ? " " They ' re about as big as a rabbit , and are of a brownish color , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that hole ? " inquired Oscar ; " let 's see if we ca n't scare him out . " " I do n't know whether there is or not , " replied Jerry ; " but if there was , we could n't dig him out without shovels . They burrow real deep . If we had brought a dog with us , how he would dig into that hole ! " " I wish I had my Tiger here , " said Oscar ; " it 's too bad father would n't let me bring him with me . " Oscar thrust his cane into the hole , but did not reach the end of it ; and if the occupant of the tenement was within , he did not think it worth while to show himself . The boys accordingly renewed their journey . After they had reached the foot of the hill , they had to cross a swamp . With its wet and miry bottom , and its dense growth of vines , bushes , and small trees , this was no easy matter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet feet , a few slight scratches , and a good many mosquito bites . This latter trouble was the most serious of all . The mosquitoes were large and ferocious . They bit right through jacket , vest , and all , and Oscar declared that their sharp stings even penetrated his boots . After the boys emerged from the swamp , they came to the road in which the man met a bear . They followed this road a short distance , till it brought them to the shore of a large and beautiful pond . Leaving the highway , they now walked along by the edge of the water , and soon came to the old hut they were in pursuit of . It was but a few rods from the pond , and was directly under the brow of a steep and rocky hill . It had a very old and decayed appearance . The roof had fallen in , the door had disappeared , and the single window was without sash or glass . It contained but one apartment , and that was very small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not try to enter . " Well , that must have been a great place for a man to live in , " said Oscar , after he had inspected the premises . " How long has the old fellow been dead ? " " I do n't know , " said Jerry ; " it must be fifteen years , for he died before I was born . " " I wonder what he lived here for ; does anybody know ? " inquired Oscar . " No , he was a hermit , and that 's all anybody knows about him . They say he used to have a garden , and raised everything he wanted to eat . In the summer time he used to work a good deal for two or three farmers that lived over at Cedar Hill , at the further end of the pond . He had a little skiff , and rowed back and forth in that . He never used to spend any money , and people say he must have had all of a thousand dollars , that he had earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . They suppose he buried it about here somewhere , or hid it in some rock . " " A thousand dollars ! " said Oscar ; " I ' m going to hunt for that ; what will you bet I wo n't find it ? " " Pooh ! " replied Jerry , " people have searched all round here , and dug holes , and pulled up the floor of the hut , more than a hundred times ; and I guess there 's no danger of your finding the money now . " " I ' m going to try , at any rate , " said Oscar , and he get up from the stone upon which he was seated . " Stop , do n't go now , " said Jerry ; " let 's make a fire and get dinner first -- I ' m just about half starved . " Oscar fell in with this suggestion , and they gathered together a lot of brush and other dry wood , and soon had a good fire kindled against a large stone , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the provisions they had brought with them were half a dozen potatoes , which they buried in the embers after the fire had got well under way . While these were baking , they employed themselves in gathering wood and watching the fire . They also found some slices of cheese in their basket , which they toasted by holding it before the fire upon the point of a sharp stick . When their preparations for dinner were about completed , Oscar inquired : " Where shall we find some water to drink ? Is there a spring about here ? " " Water , why , there 's plenty of it , " replied Jerry pointing to the pond . " What ! you do n't mean to drink pond water , do you ? " said Oscar , somewhat surprised . " Yes I do , " replied Jerry ; " that 's good water -- old Staples drank it all the time he lived here . " " Well , come to think of it , I suppose it is good , " said Oscar ; " for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . It seems queer , though , to dip it right out of the pond ; but I suppose it is just as good as though we drew it from an aqueduct . " There was a tin dipper in the basket , and Oscar took it , and went down to the pond , to try the water . He found it clear , and agreeable to the taste , though not very cold . Filling the dipper , he returned to the fire , where Jerry now had the dinner in readiness . They found a large flat stone , which answered for a table , and spreading their provisions upon it , they threw themselves upon the grass , and began to eat . The potatoes were nicely roasted , and , indeed , all the articles that helped to form their rural repast , tasted uncommonly well . Even the pond water , Oscar confessed , would have been equal to the Cochituate , if they had only had a little ice to put in it . Illustration : The Dinner in the Woods . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Jerry , impelled by sympathy , joined in the hunt , though with no very sanguine expectations of finding the hermit 's gold . They examined the hut , and poked over the rubbish , within and about it . They walked over the ground , around the cabin , turning over stones , looking after holes in the trunks of trees , and peering curiously into every crack and crevice they could find . They then climbed up the rocks behind the hut , and patiently continued their search , talking earnestly , the meanwhile , about what they should do with the money , if they found it . Oscar said if he found the money , he should buy the best horse he could find . He should not go to school any more , but should spend his time in riding , and going to places of amusement . If his father did not like it , he should leave home , and board at a hotel . Jerry , on the other hand , wanted to see the world . If he found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . After visiting the great Atlantic cities , he should go to California , and stop a few months , just long enough to dig a few thousand dollars out of the mines -- and then he should push on to China , and India , and Europe , and come home in one of the Collins steamers . It was finally agreed , however , that if either of them found the treasure , it should be equally divided between them , and with this friendly understanding , they renewed their search , with fresh zeal . " It 's real hot ; what do you say about going into water ? " inquired Oscar , after they had ransacked the neighborhood pretty thoroughly , and worked themselves into a perspiration . " I ' ll go in if you will , " said Jerry . " Father did n't tell us not to go in to-day -- I was afraid he would ; but he did n't say anything about it . " " He need n't know it , if we do go in , " suggested Oscar , who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathing so early in the season , and so soon after his sickness . " No , he wo n't know anything about it , " added Jerry ; " and I do n't believe it can do us any hurt , for it is as warm as it is in the middle of summer . I ' ve been into water many a time , when it was colder than it is now . " They did not debate the question long , but throwing off their clothes , they soon plunged into the clear lake . The water did not feel quite so warm to their bodies , as it tasted when they washed down their dinner with it . Still , it was not very cold ; and as the place was quite convenient for bathing , having a hard , gravelly bottom , with a gradual slope , they enjoyed their dip in the water as well as they could enjoy a forbidden gratification . After they had dressed themselves , they sat a little while with their caps off , that the warm sun might dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen pleasure . This accomplished , they concluded , from the position of the sun , that it was time to start for home ; and taking their basket and canes , they commenced their homeward march . They met with no incident of any moment in returning , except that they got off their course at one time ; but Jerry , who was quite at home in the woods , soon found where he was , and set himself right again . The last two miles of their jaunt were the hardest of all , especially to Oscar , who was more troubled with sore feet and stiff legs than Jerry . They were both , however , as tired and hungry as need be , when they got home . No questions were asked about their going into water . This was fortunate , for it probably saved them from the additional guilt of falsehood . They experienced no punishment for their disobedience , except the consciousness that they had committed a wrong act . To some boys , that alone would have been no slight punishment ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jerry . CHAPTER XVII . CLINTON . " Come , Jerry , let 's go over to Clinton 's this forenoon , " said Oscar , the morning after their excursion to the hermit 's hut . " Agreed , " replied Jerry , " we ' ll start right away as soon as I can find my cap . Let me see -- -where did I leave it , I wonder ? " " Jerry , " said Mrs. Preston , who overheard this conversation , " bring me in an armfull of wood before you go . " " I ' ll get the wood while you ' re looking for your cap , " said Oscar , and he started for the wood-house . Oscar almost repented of his offer when he discover ed that there was no wood split . However , he took the axe and split a few logs , and carried them into the kitchen . Jerry had not yet found his cap , though he had searched all over the house for it . He began to suspect some one had played a trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at his impatience , he concluded she was the guilty one . In vain she protested that she had not seen the missing cap , and did not know where it was . He searched every part of the girls ' chamber , and then , in his vexation , he pulled Emily 's bonnet from off her head , and tossed it out of the window into an apple-tree , in the branches of which it lodged . It was now Emily 's turn to fly into a pet , and she availed herself of the opportunity . Running to her mother , she reported what Jerry had done , setting off his foolish conduct in the worst possible light . Jerry soon made his appearance in the kitchen , and retorted upon his sister by charging her with having hid his cap . Mrs. Preston tried to settle the difficulty by directing Jerry to get Emily 's bonnet out of the tree , and ordering Emily to tell Jerry where his cap was , if she knew ; but Emily protested she knew nothing about the cap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the decree , while his sister failed to comply with hers . The quarrel was thus becoming more and more complicated , when Oscar suddenly entered the room with the lost cap in his hand . " Here 's your cap , Jerry , " he said ; " I found it just where you left it last night , out in the barn . Do n't you remember , you threw it at the cat to scare her ? " " Yes , so I did , and I forgot to pick it up again , " said Jerry . " There , do you believe me now ? " said Emily , with an air of triumph . Jerry did not stop to reply ; but , going into the garden , he climbed the apple-tree , and tossed the bonnet down to Emily . " Now I ' m ready to start , just as soon as I ' ve had a drink of buttermilk , " said Jerry to Oscar ; " come into the buttery and get some , wo n't you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning 's churning , but Mrs. Preston told the boys they might have that . Jerry proposed that they should " go snacks , " and gave the bowl to Oscar that he might drink his share first . The latter took one mouthful , but quickly spit it out , and puckered his face into all sorts of shapes . " Ugh ! " he exclaimed , " you do n't call that sour stuff good , do you ? " and he handed the bowl back to Jerry , with a look that would have soured the buttermilk , if it had not already undergone that process . As soon as Jerry could get over laughing at his cousin 's grimaces , he swallowed the contents of the bowl , and then smacking his lips , said : " There , do n't you think I like it ? You just drink it a few times , and then see if you do n't like it , too . I could drink a quart of it now if I had it . " " You may have it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , " replied Oscar . " Jerry , have the hens been attended to ? " inquired Mrs. Preston , as the boys were about starting from home . " I do n't know -- I have n't fed them , " replied Jerry . " You ought to know whether they are seen to or not ; it 's your business to take care of them , " said his mother . " Do n't you go off this morning till you have fed them . You ought to have done it an hour ago . " The care of the fowls had been committed to Jerry , but he did not feel much interest in them , and needed to be reminded of his duty pretty often . His negligence had been more marked than ever since Oscar 's arrival , and more than once the hens had been without food and water nearly a whole day because he forgot to attend to them . Jerry now went back , in obedience to his mother , and gave the fowls their usual allowance of corn , and a vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if there were any new-laid eggs ; and he was not a little surprised to find in one of them a small billet , neatly folded up , and addressed , " To Master Jerry . " He looked at it a moment , and tried to imagine what it could be ; then he opened it , and read the following , which was neatly written with a pencil : " THE HENROOST , June 12th . " MASTER JERRY : " " I have determined to write you a few words in behalf of my dear suffering family . The sun is scorching hot , and yet we have not got a drop of water to save us from parching up . My poor biddies have been walking back and forth all day , panting for water , and calling for it as plainly as they could speak ; but all in vain . We have received our food at very irregular times , too , and sometimes we have had to keep fast nearly all day . If I were the only sufferer , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see my poor flock dying by inches in this way . Do take pity on us , and see that we have plenty of corn and water hereafter . Some of my family , who pride themselves on being good layers , complain that since you have kept us shut up in such narrow quarters they can not find anything to make their egg-shells of . Now , if you would give us some old burnt bones , pounded up fine , or a little lime , once in awhile , I do not think you would lose anything by it . And as you will not let us go out to scratch for ourselves , what is the reason that you can not dig us a few worms occasionally ? It would be a great treat to us . I hope you will heed my suggestions . If you do not , I can assure you of two things : you wo n't have many eggs this summer ; and fat chickens will be a scarce article in this neighborhood next Thanksgiving time . But Mrs. Yellowneck has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it ; so I will write nothing more at present , but sign myself " Your faithful , but afflicted , " SHANGHAE ROOSTER . " Before Jerry had finished reading this mysterious letter , Oscar , who wondered at his long absence , went to see what the matter was , and found his cousin deeply absorbed in the document . After Jerry had read it , he handed it to Oscar , telling him where he found it . " Well , that is queer , " said Oscar , after he had read it . " Who do you suppose wrote it ? " " I know where it came from well enough , " said Jerry ; " keep dark -- do n't say anything about it , " he added , as he put the letter in his pocket . Then stepping to the kitchen-window , he inquired , " Mother , was Clinton over here yesterday ? " " I believe he was , " replied Mrs. Preston . " That accounts for it , " said Jerry to Oscar ; " that letter sounds just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as I saw it . " " But can he write as well as that ? " inquired Oscar . " Yes , he ' s a very good writer , " replied Jerry . " He ought to be , for he has to get a lesson every day , just as though he went to school , and recite to his mother in the evening . I wish I knew as much as he does , but I should n't want to study so hard . " They had now started on their way to Clinton 's . The Shanghae letter continued to be the topic of remark for some time . It was finally concluded that they should say nothing to Clinton about it . To tell the truth , Jerry felt a little mortified at the deserved rebuke he had received , and he thought the easiest way to get over it would be , to pretend that the letter had never reached its destination . Clinton Davenport , the suspected author of this letter , lived in the nearest house to Mr. Preston 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brookdale . He was three or four months younger than Jerry , and , like him , was an only son . They had been intimate playmates from early childhood , though their tastes and dispositions were very different . Clinton was an industrious boy . He liked to work , and took an interest in all his father 's plans and labors . He was an ingenious boy , too ; and , in addition to his other commendable traits , he was a good scholar . Oscar had seen Clinton once or twice , at Jerry 's house , but this was his first visit to him . They soon came in the sight of the house . It was a neat , but plain cottage , situated near the foot of a hill . There were several noble oaks around it , and fruit trees in the rear . Luxuriant vines were trained around and over the front door . A large and substantial barn stood a little one side , and back from the road , with its great doors swung open . On a tall pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cottage , which appeared to be occupied by a family of birds , who were constantly flying back and forth . This pretty birdhouse Clinton had made with his own hands the previous winter . When Oscar and Jerry reached the house , they saw Clinton doing something in the orchard , behind the buildings , and walked along towards him . They found him employed in destroying caterpillars ' nests , in the apple-trees . He had a light ladder , with which he ascended the trees ; and having his hands protected by a pair of old gloves , he swept down the nests , and destroyed the young caterpillars by the hundred . " This is n't very pleasant work , " said Clinton , " but it has got to be done . I 've been all over the orchard this morning , and this is the last tree I ' ve got to examine . I shall be done in a few minutes , and then I ' ll walk around with you . " " I should like to know where all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come up from the ground ? " " No , " replied Clinton . " A miller lays the eggs , the summer before , on a branch of the tree , and there they stay till about the first of June ; then they hatch out , and build their nest . The nests look something like tents , do n't you see they do ? " " Yes , so they do , " said Oscar . " That 's the reason they are called tent-caterpillars . There are three or four hundred of them in every nest . In about a month from now , they would all turn into millers , if nobody disturbed them , and lay millions of eggs for next year 's crop . " " That ' s curious -- I ' ve learnt something new by coming here , " said Oscar . " There , I believe that 's all , " said Clinton , as he cast his eye over the tree ; " now come and see my turkeys . " Jerry slyly winked at Oscar , and both thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , and followed Clinton to a tree near the barn , where there was a large , motherly hen , surrounded by her happy brood . They were young turkeys , but it was all the same to the poor simple hen . She had set four weeks upon the eggs from which they were hatched , and no wonder she honestly believed they were her own children . To confess the truth , they did look so much like chickens , that a city boy like Oscar would hardly have suspected they were turkeys , if he had not been told that they were . They were black , and of about the size of chickens of their age . They had also the sharp , piping cry of genuine chickens . But their necks were a little longer than usual , and that was almost the only badge of their turkeyhood . The hen was confined to the tree by a string , to prevent her roving off . A barrel turned upon its side , served them for a house at night . There was another hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proud mother of a large brood of chickens . There were about twenty-five of them , but though they now constituted one brood , they were hatched by two hens . Clinton said he usually managed to set two hens together , so that one of them might bring up all the chickens , thereby saving some trouble for himself , as well as one hen 's time , which was of some value to him . Hens do not seem to have much knowledge of arithmetic , and biddy was apparently unconscious of any difference between twelve and five-and-twenty . A loud and prolonged " Cock-a-doodle-do-o-o-o " now attracted Oscar to the hen-yard near by , behind the barn , where the rest of Clinton 's poultry were confined . It was a large enclosure , connected with a shed , in which the fowls roosted and laid their eggs . Its occupants , and indeed all the poultry on the place were the exclusive property of Clinton , and he took the entire management of them in his own hands . He raised the corn they consumed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . He sold his eggs , chickens , and turkeys to whom he pleased , and kept a regular account in a book of all his business transactions . Of course , all the money he made was his own , and he told Oscar he had nearly seventy-five dollars in the bank , which he had earned in this way . " I do n't see how you do it , " said Jerry ; " I could n't make anything that way if I should try . I do n't believe our hens more than pay their way , if they do that . " " If you should manage as I do , I guess you would make something , " replied Clinton . " No , it is n't my luck , " said Jerry ; " if I worked ever so hard , I should n't be any better off for it . " " I do n't believe that , " said Clinton ; " there ' s no luck about it . Any boy could make out just as well as I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try it , now , and see . " " No , I sha n't try , for I know just as well as I want to , how it would turn out , " replied Jerry . " How can you know if you never tried it ? " inquired Clinton . Jerry did not answer this question , and perhaps he could not . He preferred to comfort himself with the foolish plea of the lazy , that he was not one of " the lucky ones , " and it was useless for him to think of succeeding in anything of that kind . Clinton did not make the most distant allusion to the Shanghae Rooster 's letter , although Jerry felt sure that he knew all about it . The latter also avoided all reference to it . Oscar could hardly keep from introducing the matter , but his cousin 's injunction to " keep dark " prevailed , and he was able to restrain his impatient tongue . The boys now took a look at the piggery , where they found several fat , dignified grunters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed quite too clean and delicate to occupy such an enclosure . They then went all over the great barn , which happened to be tenantless , the cows being at pasture and the oxen and horse off at work . Oscar 's attention was attracted to a scrap cut from a newspaper , which was pasted upon one of the posts of the horse 's stall . It read as follows : " THE HORSE 'S PRAYER . " Up hill , spare thou me ; Down hill , take care of thee ; On level ground , spare me not , Nor give me water when I ' m hot . " Clinton said he found these lines in a newspaper about the time he began to drive alone , and he stuck them up upon the stall that he might not forget them . " Hallo , who is this ? " inquired Oscar , as a little curly-haired girl of six years came tripping into the barn . The little girl to whom the inquiry was addressed turned a shy and roguish look towards the strange boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her little hand in his . " Ca n't you tell him who you are ? " inquired Clinton . " He came all the way from Boston , where cousin Ettie and cousin Willie live . He ' s Jerry 's cousin , and little Mary Preston 's cousin . Now you 'll tell him what your name is , wo n't you ? " " Annie Davenport -- that 's my name , " she replied , in her artless , winning way . " Then you 're Clinton 's sister , are you ? " inquired Oscar . " Yes , and he ' s my brother , " she quickly added , with a proud look that greatly amused the boys . " Did you say you have a cousin Willie in Boston , Clinton ? " continued Oscar . " Yes , Willie Davenport , " replied Clinton . " I know him -- he 's about your size , is n't he ? and his father is a lawyer ? " " Yes , that 's him -- why , I want to know if you know him ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys have nicknamed him Whistler , because he whistles so much ; but he ' s a real clever fellow , for all that . My brother Ralph is quite intimate with him . It 's strange that I never knew before that he had relations down here , " added Oscar . " Do you know his sister , Ettie ? " inquired Clinton . " No , I never saw her , " replied Oscar . " Come into the house with me ,  - -  I must tell mother we ' ve heard from Boston , " said Clinton . They all entered the house , and Mrs. Davenport was soon informed of the pleasant discovery they had made , and had many questions to ask concerning her Boston friends . Oscar seemed to become at once an old acquaintance . The fact that he was a schoolmate of Willie gave him a direct passport to the good graces of all the family . When Oscar called to mind his peculiar relations towards Willie , this unlooked-for friendship was not particularly agreeable to him ; for he was not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton 's cousin . This , however , was more than he dared say to Clinton , and so he concealed his dislike of Willie as well as he could . After sitting in the house a little while , Clinton invited Oscar and Jerry into the " shop , " which was a room back of the kitchen , where Mr. Davenport kept a variety of carpenter 's tools . Here , in cold and stormy weather , Clinton 's father mended his broken tools and implements , and performed such other jobs as were required . Clinton , too , spent many odd moments at the work-bench , and patient practice had made him quite a neat and skilful workman . He showed the boys several boxes , a pine table , and a cricket , made entirely by his own hands , which would have done no discredit to a regular carpenter . After remaining an hour or two with Clinton , Oscar and Jerry started for home , well pleased with their visit . CHAPTER XVIII . THE LETTER . " Oscar , you have n't written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " inquired Mr. Preston one morning at the breakfast table . " No , sir , " replied Oscar . " Well , you ought to write , " added Mr. Preston ; " your mother told you to , and I suppose she has been looking for a letter every day for a week or more . It 's over a fortnight since you left home , and your folks will feel anxious about you , if they do n't hear from you soon . You ' d better write a letter to them this morning , before you do anything else , and then it will be out of the way . I shall either go or send over to the post-office to-day , and the letter will start for Boston to-morrow morning , and get there the next day . " " O dear , I hate to write , " said Oscar . " Why ca n't you write to mother , aunt , and tell her how I am ? " " No , no , " said Mr. Preston , " that wo n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she ' ll expect to hear from you , and not from somebody else . Your aunt can write , if she chooses , but you must write too . I ' ll give you a pen and some paper and ink after breakfast , and you can write just a much as you please . " " I guess it wo n't be much -- I do n't know how to write a letter , " replied Oscar . " A boy of your age not know how to write a letter -- and been all your lifetime to such grand schools as they have in Boston , too ! I do n't believe that , " said Mr. Preston , shaking his head . " I shall have to go and see the Shanghae Rooster , " said Oscar , looking at Jerry very knowingly . Jerry laughed at this allusion , but the others did not appear to understand its meaning . It was evident that they were innocent of all knowledge of the mysterious letter ; and as Jerry wished them to remain so , he adroitly turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of steel pens . " After breakfast , Mr. Preston told Oscar to follow him . They went up stairs , and Mr. P. took a key from his pocket , and unlocked the door of what was known by the name of " the private room . " It was a very small apartment , and was originally designed for a closet or store-room ; but Mr. Preston now used it as a sort of office . Here he kept his business papers , and here he did what little writing he had to do . There was one window in the room , which looked out upon the garden in the rear of the house . The furniture consisted of a chair , a small portable desk , placed upon a table , an old map of the State of Maine , a dictionary , almanac , and several other odd volumes and pamphlets . " There , " said Mr. Preston , " you may sit right down to my desk , and write as long as you please , if you wo n't disturb my papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wafers -- you can use what you want . When you get done , lock the door , and give the key to your aunt . " Oscar found there was no backing out from a letter this time ; so he sat down , and tried to make up his mind to face the dreaded duty . He heard his uncle tell the children not to interrupt him , till he had finished his letter ; and when Mr. Preston and his man James went off to work , Jerry accompanied them . Oscar was thus left to himself . After thinking about the matter a few moments , he dipped his pen in the ink-stand , and , having consulted the almanac , wrote the proper date for the letter , together with the address , " Dear Mother . " Here he came suddenly to a stand . He was at a loss how to commence . He sat uneasily in his chair , now nibbling the end of the pen-holder , and now running his fingers slowly through his hair , as if to coax out the thoughts he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrote several lines without stopping . Now he thought he should go ahead without further trouble ; but he soon found himself again brought to a dead halt . He began to scribble and draw rude figures upon a piece of waste paper , hoping the next sentence , in continuance of his letter , would soon pop into his head ; but instead of anything popping in , his ideas began to pop out , so that he almost forgot the letter , amid the unmeaning flourishes his pen was making . Then , suddenly thinking of the scarcely-commenced task before him , he read and re-read the few lines he had written , but could not determine what to say next . Lifting up the lid of the desk , he found a variety of bills , receipts , accounts and letters scattered about . Disregarding the injunction of his uncle , and in violation of one of the plainest rules of good breeding , he concluded to open one of the letters , and see if he could not gain some hint from it , to aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved to be a short business message , and it was written in such a difficult hand , that he could not read half the words . He then looked into several other letters , but none of them afforded him any aid . After idling away half an hour in this manner , he resumed his letter , and began to make some progress upon it , when the lively chirping and twittering of a party of birds in an apple-tree near the window , attracted his attention . He laid down his pen , and watched their movements awhile . They were swallows ; and from their actions , Oscar soon discovered that the old birds were teaching their little ones how to fly . There were several nests of these swallows , under the rafters of Mr. Preston 's barn ; and as they had recently had accessions to their families , Oscar concluded this must be the first appearance of the new-comers in public . The old birds fluttered back and forth , twittering and talking to the young ones all the while , and trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little fearful things looked doubtingly , first one way and then another , as though they would gladly launch away upon their destined element , if they were only sure they should not tumble ingloriously to the ground . The clamor of the old ones increased every moment . They called and coaxed more earnestly , and fluttered more impatiently , until at length the young birds worked up their courage to the requisite point , and away the whole flock darted , towards the barn . Now that the swallows were out of his way , Oscar returned to his letter once more . Had he learned a lesson of self-confidence from the example of the little swallows , the few minutes he spent in watching their movements would have been well employed . But instead of his confidence increasing , he was now almost sick of the sight of the letter , and began to doubt whether he should ever finish it . While he was hesitating whether he had better tear it up , or try once more to go on with it , a sweet childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the window , and saw little Mary sitting down upon the grass , in a shady spot , with a large book open before her . She was looking at the engravings in the volume , and was talking very earnestly to herself , and to the figures in the pictures . " There is Emily , " she was saying , " and there is father with a shovel ; and this one is me , and that is Jerry , and that 's Oscar , carrying a basket . I guess they ' re going to dig potatoes . O , what lots of houses over the other side of the pond ; and there ' s one , two , three , five , ten , eight meeting-houses , too . It must be Boston , I guess , there are so many houses there . And there 's a great boat coming -- O what a smoke it makes !  - -  and it 's got wheels , too . Now we 'll get right into it , and go and see Uncle Henry and all the folks . Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad -- it goes by , and we ca n't go to Boston . " Illustration : Mary and the Picture-Book . Thus little Mary continued to talk to the pictures and to herself , unconscious that any one was listening to her . She was a pretty child , and , all unknown to herself , she made almost as attractive a picture as any in her book , with her fair face , her flowing hair , and her clean dress , set off by the green grass and climbing vines around her . Oscar sat listening to her childish prattle for some time , when the striking of the kitchen clock reminded him that he had been seated at the desk an hour , and had not yet written a dozen lines . He was about to tear up the sheet of paper over which he had sat ( but not labored ) so long , and give up the attempt . Then he thought of his promise to write , and how ashamed he should feel to have his uncle 's folks know that he had tried a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mother . He finally determined to make one more attempt . Finding that the sound of Mary 's voice disturbed him , Oscar now shut down the window , and thus cut off all communication with the outer world , except by the eye . He soon got under way again with his letter , and , to his own surprise , he went along quite easily and with considerable rapidity . The reason of this was , he was now really in earnest , and had given his mind wholly to the letter . Before , his thoughts were flitting from one trifle to another ; now they were directed to the object he wished to accomplish . Before the clock struck the next hour , the letter was finished , sealed , and directed . It was quite a respectable sort of a letter , too . When he had got through , Oscar was himself surprised to find that he could write so good an epistle . The spelling , punctuation , and penmanship might have been improved , but in other respects the letter was creditable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should read , and not precisely as he wrote it : " BROOKDALE , June 15 , 185 --  . " DEAR MOTHER : " I suppose you are looking for a letter from me , and I meant to have written before this , but somehow I have neglected it . I got here safe the next day after I left home . We stopped one night in Portland , and put up at the  - -   - -   Hotel . The next day we rode in the cars all the forenoon , and in the stage all the afternoon . The stage does not go within five miles of uncle 's , but Jerry went over with a horse and wagon to get us . I like Brookdale first-rate . It is a real countryfied place , but I like it all the better for that . The nearest house to uncle 's is half a mile off ; and , by the way , tell Ralph that a cousin of Whistler 's lives there . His name is Clinton Davenport . I have got acquainted with him , and like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have capital times together . All the boys here are rather ' green , ' as we say in Boston ; and you would laugh at the ideas they have of city things ; but I suppose they think I am green about country things , and so we are square . I have lots of rides , and good long walks , too . A few days ago , Jerry and I walked four or five miles through the woods and pastures , to an old hut where a hermit used to live . They say he was a miser , and buried his money there , and people have dug for it , but nobody has found it . We carried our provisions , and made a fire , and ate dinner there . There is a fine pond close by , where we got our water to drink . " There are lots of birds here . We are going to set some snares in the woods , and catch some . There are some swallows ' nests in uncle 's barn , just over the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds . They are quite tame . They are just making their young ones learn how to fly . It is real amusing to see them . " Uncle has quite a large farm . I forget how many acres he told me there was , but it is a good many . They have cows , and pigs , and hens , and live in real country style . I have learned how to make butter , but I have not learned to like buttermilk yet . I ca n't bear it , but all the other folks think it is a great treat . The schools do n't keep here but three months in the winter , so Jerry and I are together about all the time . We sleep together , too . I almost forgot to tell you that I have got quite strong and hearty again . My cough is gone , and aunt says I look a good deal better than I did when I came here . I want to hear from home , but I hope you wo n't send for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of writing , and must close up my letter . Excuse errors and bad writing . Give my love to all the family , including Tiger . " Your affectionate son , " OSCAR . " Oscar felt quite relieved when his letter was ready for the post-office . Having locked up the little room , he carried the key to his aunt . " Have you written your letter ? " inquired Mrs. Preston . " Yes , ma'am , " replied Oscar . " Where is it ? You ' re going to let me read it , ai nt you ? " inquired Emily . " There it is , " said Oscar , taking the letter from his jacket pocket ; " but I guess you wo n't read it , miss . " " Yes , do let me read it , " persisted Emily , who really had an undue proportion of inquisitiveness in her nature . " No , I ca n't ; it 's sealed up , " replied Oscar . " Then tell me what you wrote , wo n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what business is it to you what he wrote ? " said her mother . " Do n't ask any more such foolish questions ; Oscar will think you have n't got common sense if you do . " " Did you write anything about me ? " continued Emily , in a lower tone . " Did you hear me , Emily ? " inquired Mrs. Preston , in a sharper tone . " O no , I did n't write much , " said Oscar , in reply to Emily ; " there 's nothing in the letter that you would care about seeing . " " I did n't know you were going to seal up the letter so soon . I wanted to send a message to Alice and Ella , " continued Emily . " You are too late now , " replied Oscar ; " but I ' ll give you a chance next time . What message do you want to send ? " " You must n't be so inquisitive , " said Emily , with a laugh ; " just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't let me read the letter ! " " Well , I can tell you one thing ,  - -  I do n't want to know , " replied Oscar . " Aunt Eliza , do you know where Jerry is ? " " He has gone with his father down to the meadow lot , " replied Mrs. Preston . " I guess they will be back before a great while . " Oscar set out for the " meadow lot , " which was a quarter of a mile from the house , on the other side of the river . He had not gone far , however , when he met Mr. Preston and Jerry returning . " I ' ve written my letter , uncle , and it 's all ready to go to the post-office , " said Oscar ; " ca n't Jerry and I carry it over ? " " I ' ll see about that this afternoon , " said Mr. Preston ; " I ' ve got something else for Jerry to do now . " " I ' m going over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jerry to Oscar ; " and you can go too , if you want to . " " Mulching -- what is that ? " inquired Oscar . " It 's stuff that they put around young trees , to keep the roots from drying up in summer , " replied Jerry . " You know all those small apple and pear trees back of the barn ? well , it 's to put around them . " Having reached the house , the boys ate some luncheon , and then proceeded to tackle Billy into the hay-cart . After Mr. Preston had given Jerry sundry cautions and directions , which the latter seemed to think quite unnecessary , the boys hopped into the cart , and drove off towards the woods . Mr. Preston owned several tracts of woodland in Brookdale . The lot to which the boys were going , was called the " old " one , because the wood had all been cut off once , and it was now covered with a young growth , not large enough for firewood . It was but a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot , and commenced operations . They were each provided with large jack-knives , and with these they proceeded to lop off the young and tender ends of the birches , which trees were quite abundant in that spot ; for birches are very apt to spring up after a pine forest has been cleared away . Many of the trees were yet so small , that the boys did not have to climb up to reach the branches . Though all this was really work , it seemed so much like play to Jerry and Oscar , that they actually forgot to be lazy . The consequence was , the job was done before they thought of it . Gathering up the heaps of small twigs scattered around them , they threw them into the cart , and found they had quite a respectable load ; respectable in bulk at least , though not a very heavy burden for Billy . Taking their seats upon the top of the mulching , which was almost as soft as a load of hay , they drove back to the barn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse into the orchard , where , with the aid of the boys , he scattered the birch twigs around the young trees , so as to protect their roots from the fierce heat of the sun . There was not enough for all the trees , but he told them they need not get any more at that time . After dinner , Mr. Preston said he should have to go over to the Cross-Roads himself , as he wanted to see a man who lived there ; but he told Oscar he might go with him , if he wished . Oscar accepted the invitation , and they were soon on their way , leaving Jerry not a little disappointed that he could not go with them . Oscar handed his letter to the postmaster , who marked it with the stamp of the office , and deposited it in the mail-bag , Mr. Preston stopped to purchase a few articles in the shop where the post-office was kept . When he was ready to start , he inquired : " Have you mailed your letter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve mailed it , but I did n't pay the postage , " replied Oscar . " That was n't right , " said his uncle ; " when you mail a letter to a friend , you should always pay the postage . If you pay it now , in advance , it will be only three cents ; but if the postage is not paid till the letter is delivered , it will be five cents . " " I did n't think of that , " said Oscar ; " I wonder if it is too late to pay it now ? I ' ll go and see . " On making known his request , the postmaster drew forth the letter from the bag , and imprinted another stamp upon it . Oscar paid the three cents , and departed , with his uncle . CHAPTER XIX . THE RECALL . Oscar was bent upon going a-gunning . He had allowed his mind to dwell upon the idea , until it seemed to him as though he could no longer resist the impulse to play the sportsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is true , had tried to dissuade him from it , and had positively refused to lend him his gun . But there were other guns in Brookdale , and everybody was not so particular as Mr. Preston about trusting boys with fire-arms . Why could n't he borrow a gun of somebody else ? So he asked himself ; and by-and-bye he put the same question to Jerry . Jerry heartily entered into the proposal . He thought Jim Oakley would lend him a gun . At any rate , he was not afraid to ask him . Jim was a famous gunner , in that region . He had several fowling-pieces ; and if he would not lend them his best rifle , it was not likely that he would refuse them one of his old guns . So Jerry reasoned , and Oscar fully agreed with him . They went to see Jim , that very afternoon , and by dint of teasing , they got the gun , together with a small quantity of powder and shot . Thus armed , they set out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the woods but a short time , and had not yet shot anything , though they had fired several charges , when a dispute arose between them about the gun . Jerry claimed a right to it half the time , on the ground that he had borrowed it . Oscar was willing that he should use the gun occasionally , but he resisted his claim to it half the time . He contended that the gun was loaned to him , and besides , he had agreed to pay the owner for all the ammunition they used . The dispute waxed warmer and warmer . Oscar was obstinate , and Jerry grew sulky . It was the first serious difficulty that had arisen between them . Neither of them , as yet , knew the other 's temper , but now they were in a fair way of finding each other out . It was the clashing of two strong wills . Oscar soon saw that their sport was at an end for that day , and throwing down the gun and powder flask upon the grass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take the old thing , and do what you please with it ; and when you carry it back , see that you pay for the powder , for I wo n't . " So saying , he turned upon his heel and walked off . He had not gone far when Jerry , who had picked up the gun , called out : " Here ! you ' ve broken the trigger , throwing it down so . You may carry it back yourself now , I wo n't . " " I sha n't carry it back , " replied Oscar ; " you say he lent it to you , and you may take care of it now . " Oscar went back to his uncle 's , leaving Jerry and the gun to keep each other company . Not feeling in a very pleasant mood , Oscar did not go into the house , but loitered around the barn , avoiding the family as much as he could . Pretty soon he saw Clinton driving up , and he stepped inside of the barn , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped however , when opposite to the barn , and called to him . " What would you give for a letter from home ? " said Clinton , when Oscar made his appearance . " I do n't know -- why , have you got one for me ? " inquired Oscar , with remarkable coolness . " That 's for you , I guess , " said Clinton , handing him a letter . " I ' ve been over to the post-office , and as I happened to see a letter directed to you , I thought I would take it along with me . " " That 's right , I 'm glad you did , " said Oscar , taking the letter . " Much obliged to you for your trouble , " he added , as Clinton drove off . Oscar now went into the barn , and , seating himself upon a stool , opened and read his letter . It was from his mother . She acknowledged the receipt of his letter , and expressed much gratification at hearing that he was well and enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had better return home , and resume his place at school , from which he had been absent nearly three months . The term would close in about a month , and he wanted Oscar to be prepared to enter the High School at that time . Then followed various little messages from the children , directions about his journey home , &c.; In closing , she requested him to return that week , that he might be ready to go to school the following Monday . Oscar was not very much pleased with the contents of the letter . He did not expect to be recalled so suddenly . He had hoped that , at any rate , he should not be sent to school again that term . But , his plans and hopes were all overturned by this letter . He went into the house , and told the news to his aunt , who expressed regret that he was to leave so soon . By-and-bye Jerry came home , but he brought the same scowl upon his face that Oscar left with him up in the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ever . No words passed between the two , and each seemed bent upon giving the other a wide berth . At the supper table , something was said about Oscar 's letter , and his going home ; but Jerry was too obstinate to ask any questions , and so he remained in tormenting uncertainty in regard to the matter . Oscar , too , had some curiosity about the gun , but he did not intend to " speak first , " if he never spoke again to his cousin . During the whole evening , Oscar and Jerry were at the opposite poles of the little family circle . When Oscar retired for the night , he found Jerry not only abed , but asleep , or pretending to be . It was a wonder that both did not tumble out of bed that night ; for each slept upon the extreme edge of the mattress , as far as possible from the other . When Oscar awoke in the morning , he found himself alone , Jerry having quietly arisen and slipped out of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other until they met at the breakfast table . Here , their sober and quiet demeanor , so unusual with them , soon attracted notice . " See how down in the mouth Jerry is ! " said Emily . " He looks as though he had lost all his friends . And Oscar does n't look much better either , poor fellow ! " Both boys changed color , and looked queerly , but they said nothing . " Never mind , boys , " said Mrs. Preston , " you ' ve got one day more to enjoy yourselves together . You ' d better make the most of that , while it lasts , and not worry about the separation till the time comes . " " That 's good doctrine , " said Mr. Preston ; " never borrow trouble , for it comes fast enough any way . Come , cheer up , Oscar , you have n't gone yet . " " It 's too bad to make me go home so soon -- I thought I was going to stay here a month or two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual demeanor should be attributed entirely to his summons home . " You must ask your father to let you come down and spend your vacation , " said Mr. Preston . " I expect to go up to Boston about that time , and I guess he will let me bring you home with me . " " I should like to come , " said Oscar , " but I do n't believe father will let me , it 's so far . " " O yes , he will , when he knows what good friends you and Jerry are , " replied Mr. Preston . " Jerry ' s crying , as true as I ' m alive ! " exclaimed Emily , who had been watching the workings of her brother 's face for several moments , and thought she saw moisture gathering in his eye . " No I ai nt , either ! " replied Jerry , in such a prompt and spiteful tone , and with such a scowl upon his face , that all the others , including even Oscar , joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-natured , " said his mother ; " Oscar 's going off seems to have had a queer effect upon you . " " I do n't care , you ' re all picking upon me -- it 's enough to make anybody cross , " said Jerry , in a surly tone . " You 're mistaken -- nobody has picked upon you , " replied his mother . " Yes , you have , too , " responded Jerry . " Jerry ! do n't let me hear any more of that -- not another word , " said Mr. Preston , sternly . " Then you ' d better make Emily hold her tongue , " said Jerry . " Hush ! do you hear me ? " said Mr. Preston , with considerable excitement . Jerry undertook to mutter something more , when his father jumped up , and , taking him by the collar , led him to the cellar-door , and told him to go down and stay until he was sent for . Then , shutting the door , and turning the button , he resumed his seat at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jerry was released from his confinement soon after breakfast ; but the unfortunate affair at the table continued to weigh heavily upon his mind . Throughout the rest of the day , he kept out of everybody 's way , and said nothing , but looked sour , cross , and wretched . Oscar , too , felt very unpleasantly . He found it hard work to amuse himself alone . He was a boy of strong social feelings , and abhorred solitary rambles and sports . It was a long and dull day , and when he retired to bed at night , he almost felt glad that it was his last day in Brookdale . Soon after he had got into bed , Jerry , who had retired before him , called out : " Oscar ! " " What ? " inquired the other . There was a long pause , during which Jerry hitched and twisted about , as if hesitating how to proceed . He at length inquired : " Are you mad with me ? " " No , " replied Oscar , somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " yes . " " I do n't want you to go off without making up with me , " added Jerry ; and as he spoke , his voice trembled , and had it been light enough , Oscar might have detected something like moisture in those very eyes that had flashed in anger at Emily in the morning , for reporting the same thing of them . " I ' m ready to make up with you , " replied Oscar , turning over toward Jerry . Having thus broken the ice , the constraint and reserve that had existed between them since the previous day , gradually melted away , and they were once more on sociable terms , although their intercourse was not quite so free and unembarrassed as it was before their quarrel . In fact , they did not properly heal up the difficulty between them , inasmuch as neither made any confession or apology -- a duty that both should have performed , as they were about equally guilty . Oscar 's first inquiries were concerning the gun . Jerry told him that he carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he saw the damage it had sustained , but said nothing about making the boys pay for it . The next morning the family arose at an earlier hour than usual , as Oscar had got to be on his way soon after sunrise . It was decided that Jerry should drive him over to the Cross-Roads . Accordingly , after a hasty breakfast , he bade them all good-bye , one by one , and taking a seat in the wagon with Jerry , started for home . It was delightful , riding while the birds were yet singing their morning songs , and the grass was spangled with dew , and the cool air had not felt the hot breath of the sun ; but the separation that was about to take place , and the unpleasant recollection of their recent quarrel , lessened their enjoyment of the ride very much . They reached the Cross-Roads nearly half an hour before the stage-coach came along . At length it drove up to the post-office , and Oscar , mounting to the top , took a seat behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the coach started again on its way , Oscar bowing his farewell to Jerry , as they drove off . Illustration : The Stage Coach . Nothing of special interest occurred the forenoon 's ride . The coach reached its destination about eleven o'clock and Oscar had barely time enough to brush the dust from his clothing , and to obtain a drink of cold water , when the signal was given for the cars to start , and he took his seat in the train . His thoughtful aunt had placed a liberal supply of eatables in the top of his valise , and to that he now had recourse , for his long ride had given him a sharp appetite . There were but few passengers in the train when it started , but at almost every station it received accessions . On reaching Portland , Oscar found that he had nearly half an hour to spare , before taking the Boston train ; for it was his intention to " go through " in one day , which his early start enabled him to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased at a refreshment stand in the depot , he walked about until it was time to take his seat in the cars . The clock struck three , and the train started . One hundred and eleven miles seemed to Oscar a long distance to travel , at one stretch , especially after riding all the forenoon ; and , indeed , he did begin to feel quite tired , long before he reached the end of the journey . To add to his uneasiness , a particle of cinder from the locomotive flew into his eye , and lodged there so firmly that all his efforts to remove it were in vain . In a little while , the eye became quite painful , and he was obliged to keep it closed . A kind-looking gentleman , who sat near him , noticed his trouble , and offered to assist him in removing the mote ; but it was so small that he could not find it . He advised Oscar not to rub the inflamed organ , and told him he thought the moisture of the eye would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oscar tried to follow this advice , but the pain and irritation did not subside , and he closed his eyes , and resigned himself to darkness . The nine o'clock bells of Boston were ringing , as Oscar left the depot and turned his steps homeward . He hurried along through the familiar streets , and had just turned the corner from which his home was in sight , when somebody jumped suddenly from a dark passage-way , and seized him by the hand . It was Ralph , who had been on the watch for his brother half an hour , and , concealed himself just as he saw him approaching . Each gave the other a cordial greeting , and then they hastened into the house , where Oscar found the rest of the family waiting to receive him . The general commotion that followed his arrival , aroused Tiger from the comfortable nap he was taking on a mat , and on hearing the well-remembered tones of his master 's voice , he sprang toward Oscar , and nearly knocked him over with his demonstrations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the welcome he received , he learned that there is pleasure in getting back from a journey as well as in setting out upon one . His inflamed eye soon attracted the notice of his mother , and she examined it to see if she could detect the cause of the irritation ; but the troublesome atom was invisible . She then said she would try the eye-stone , and , going to the drawer , she got a small , smooth , and flat stone , and told Ella to go down into the kitchen and bring up a little vinegar in a saucer . On putting the stone into the vinegar , it soon began to move about , as though it were possessed of life . When it had become sufficiently lively , Mrs. Preston wiped it dry , and put it between the lid and ball of Oscar 's inflamed eye . After it had remained there a few minutes , he allowed it to drop into his hand , and on a close-examination , he found that it had brought with it the offending substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little black speck , so small that it was barely perceptible to the unaided eye . It now being quite late , Mrs. Preston thought that further inquiries and answers concerning Oscar 's visit had better be deferred till morning , and the family soon retired to their beds . CHAPTER XX . DOWNWARD PROGRESS The next day was Saturday . Oscar was off most of the day with his comrades , among whom he was quite a lion for the time . During one of the brief intervals that he was in the house , his mother said some thing about his going to school on Monday . " O dear , I do n't want to go to school again this term , " said Oscar . " What 's the use ? Why , it ' s only four or five weeks before the term will be through . " " I know that , " replied his mother , " but your father is very anxious that you should get into the High School , and he thinks you can do it if you finish up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ve got all behindhand with my studies , " said Oscar . " O yes , you can if you try , " replied his mother . " You might have got into the High School last year if you had studied a little harder . You were almost qualified then , and I 'm sure you ought to be now . If you find you are behind your class in your lessons , you must study so much the harder , and you ' ll get up with them by-and-bye . " " But I do n't believe it will do me any good to be confined in the school-room , " continued Oscar . " I do n't think I 'm so strong as I was before I was sick . " " Well , " said Mrs. Preston , " when you ' re sick you need not go to school ; but I guess there ' s no danger of your staying at home for that reason , at present . You never looked better in your life than you do now . " Oscar tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with quite as poor success . He saw that it was fully determined that he should resume his seat at school , and he reluctantly submitted to this decision . When Monday morning came , he proceeded to school , but found that his old desk was in possession of another boy . The head teacher in Oscar 's department soon appeared , and seemed quite glad to see him once more . He appointed Oscar a new seat , and told him he hoped he would study so diligently as to make up for lost time . The hopes of Oscar 's teacher and parents were doomed to disappointment . It was soon evident that he cared less about his lessons than ever . He was behind his class , and instead of redoubling his efforts to get up with them , he became discouraged and indifferent . His recitations were seldom perfect , and often they were utter failures . His teachers coaxed , and encouraged , and ridiculed , and frowned , and punished , all in vain . One day , after Oscar had blundered worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to him , in a despairing tone : " You remind me , Oscar , of what one of the old Roman emperors said to an archer who shot his arrows a whole day , and never once hit the mark . He told him he had a most wonderful talent for missing . So I must say of you -- you ' ve got the greatest talent for missing of any boy I know . " Seeing a smile on the faces of Oscar 's classmates , he added : " But this is too sober a matter to make light of . If you could not get your lessons , it would be a different matter ; but I know , and you know , that this is not the trouble . You are quick enough to learn and to understand , when you have a mind to be . If you would only try to get your lessons as hard as the other boys do , you would n't be at the foot of the class a great while . If you keep on in this way , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , before you are many years older . " This admonition had little effect upon Oscar . When school was dismissed , a few minutes after , he rushed out with as light a step as any of his comrades , and his gay laugh was heard as soon as he reached the entry . In the general scramble for caps , one had fallen from its peg , and instead of replacing it , two or three of the boys were making a football of it . Oscar joined the sport , and gave the cap a kick that sent it part of the way down stairs . A moment after , he met Willie Davenport returning with it . " Halloo , Whistler , that is n't your cap , is it ? " inquired Oscar . " No , but it 's somebody 's , " said the good-hearted boy , as he brushed off the dust , and put the lining back into its place . He was about hanging it up , when Benny Wright appeared , and claimed it as his property . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have made a foot-ball of it . He remembered the kind epistle he received , when sick , and the amusement it afforded him , when amusements were scarce . Since his recovery , he had treated Benny with much more consideration than before , and quite a kindly feeling had sprung up between them . Oscar 's inattention to his studies was not his only fault at school . His general behavior was worse than it had ever been before . Vexed that he was compelled to return to school so near the expiration of the term , it seemed as though he was determined to make as little improvement in his studies , and as much trouble for his teachers , as he could . He not only idled away his own time , but he disturbed other boys who were disposed to study . He was repeatedly reproved and punished , but reproof and punishment did no good ; on the contrary , they seemed rather to make him worse . The teachers at length gave him up as incorrigible , and consoled themselves with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three weeks , at which time his class would graduate . They still aimed to keep him in check , during school hours , but they ceased spending their time and breath in trying to bring about a reformation in his conduct . One day as the scholars were engaged in writing , the master , while passing along among the boys , and inspecting their writing-books , noticed that somebody had been spitting what appeared to be tobacco juice , near Oscar 's seat . This was a violation of the rules of the school , and the teacher concluded not to let it pass unnoticed . Having no doubt , from several circumstances , that Oscar was the offender , he said to him : " Oscar , what are you chewing tobacco in school for , and spitting the juice on the floor ? " " I have n't chewed any tobacco this afternoon , " replied Oscar . " What is it , then , that you have been spitting upon the floor ? " inquired the teacher . " I have n't spit upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " continued the teacher , pointing to the puddle upon the floor . " I do n't know , " said Oscar ; " it was there when I took my seat . " It was possible that Oscar told the truth , but the teacher had his doubts . He might perhaps , have settled the matter at once by putting a question to one or two of the boys who sat near the supposed offender but as he always avoided the system of making one boy inform against another , when he could properly do so , he took another course . He told Oscar , if he had any tobacco in his mouth , or anywhere about his person , to give it up to him . Oscar declared that he had none . " Let me look into your mouth , " said the teacher . Oscar had a small piece of the weed in his mouth , which he tucked behind his upper lip with his tongue , and then opened his mouth . The teacher of course saw nothing but what belonged there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer in doubt that Oscar had told a falsehood . " I ca n't see your cud , but I can smell it plain enough , " said the master ; " and I ' ll examine your pockets , if you please . " Oscar was far from pleased with this proposition , and tried to prevent its being carried into effect . The master , however , easily overcame the difficulties he put in the way , and running his hand into the pocket which he seemed most anxious to defend , brought forth a piece of tobacco large enough to kill a horse ! " What is that ? " he inquired , holding the contraband article before Oscar . Oscar neither looked at it nor made any reply . " And you are the boy who said a moment ago that you had no tobacco about you , " continued the master " I declare I do n't know what to do with you . I have said and done all that I can to make a better boy of you , and now I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle it with you . But I want you to remember one thing . When you tell me a lie , you break God 's law , and not mine ; and you ca n't settle the matter in full with me , or any other human being . " The teacher then threw the piece of tobacco out of the open window , and taking Oscar 's writing-book , told him he would set a new copy for him . He soon returned , with the following line written upon the top of a clean page : " Lying lips are abomination to the Lord . " As Oscar wrote this fearful sentence over and over again , he could not fully escape the force of its meaning . It reminded him of his feelings during his recent illness , when at times the terrible thought that his sickness might possibly be unto death intruded upon his mind . But thoughts of God , and death , and a future world , were alike unpleasant to him , and he banished them as speedily as possible . During the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Preston , informing him of Oscar 's indolence and bad conduct , and referring particularly to the incident that had just occurred . By way of offset to the complaint , he spoke in very high terms of Ralph , who attended the same school , but was in another department and another room . He sent the letter by Ralph , but told him not to let Oscar know anything about it . Ralph had some suspicions of the nature of the letter , but he did his errand faithfully , going directly from school to his father 's store . Mr. Preston was at first very much irritated by the teacher 's complaints of Oscar 's misconduct ; and could he have taken the culprit in hand at the time , he would probably have handled him rather roughly . But several days elapsed before he found it convenient to talk with Oscar about the matter , and by this time his passion had subsided into anxiety and sorrow . He showed Oscar the letter , in which he , the eldest son , was severely censured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears in his eyes , he warned him of the dangers before him , and entreated him to change his course . Oscar had never seen his father exhibit so much emotion before . Usually , on such occasions , he was stern , if not passionate ; more ready to threaten and punish than to appeal to the heart and conscience . Now , all this was changed , and sorrow seemed to have taken the place of anger . Oscar was somewhat affected by this unusual manifestation of parental anxiety . He was pretty well hardened against scoldings and threatenings , but he did not know how to meet this new form of rebuke . He tried to conceal his feelings , however , and preserved a sullen silence throughout the interview . This affair made no abiding impression upon Oscar . In a day or two it was forgotten , and the slight compunctions he felt had entirely disappeared . But the schoolmaster 's complaint was soon followed by another that was quite as unpleasant . As Mrs. Preston was sitting at her sewing , one day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servant girl , with a face as red as rage and a hot fire could make it . " I 'll be goin ' off this night , ma'am -- I 'll pack me chist , and not stop here any longer at all , " said Bridget , in a tone that betokened her anger . " Going off -- what do you mean ? You do n't say you ' re going to leave us so suddenly , Biddy ? " inquired Mrs. Preston , with surprise . " Yes , that I be , " replied Bridget , very decidedly ; " I ' ll not be after staying in the same house with that big , ugly b'y , another day . " " Who , Oscar ? What has he done now ? " inquired Mrs. Preston . " He 's did nothing but bother the life out o ' me ivery day since he coom back , that 's jist all he ' s did , " replied Biddy . " Jist now , ma'am , he slopped over a hull basin o ' dirty whater right on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sassed me , and called me , all sorts o ' bad names -- the little sass-box ! It 's not the like o ' Bridget Mullikin that ' ll put up with his dirty impidence another day . I ' d like to live with ye , ma'am , and Mister Pristen , good , nice man that he is but I ca n't stop to be trated like a dog by that sassy b'y . " " I ' ll go and see what he has been about , " said Mrs. Preston , laying down her work . When they reached the kitchen , Oscar was not to be found . There was the puddle of dirty water upon the floor , however , and so far Bridget 's story was corroborated . As she proceeded to wipe it up , she continued to speak in not very complimentary terms of the " ugly b'y , " as she delighted to call Oscar . It was in vain that Mrs. Preston attempted to soothe her ruffled spirits . She refused to be comforted , and insisted upon taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make his appearance again until late in the afternoon . When his mother called him to account for his treatment of Bridget , he denied the greater part of her story . He said that the basin of water was standing upon the floor , and that he accidentally hit it with his foot , and upset it . He denied that he called her bad names or was impudent , but he admitted that he laughed , to see her so angry . He also complained that she was as " cross as Bedlam " to him , and " jawed " him whenever he entered the kitchen . Mrs. Preston , puzzled by these contradictory stories , brought the two contending parties face to face , in hope of either eliciting the truth or effecting a treaty of peace between them . She failed in both objects , however . Bridget not only adhered to her first statement , but boldly accused Oscar of sundry other misdeeds that had come up in recollection since the first outbreak ; while Oscar , on the other hand , stoutly denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-natured , and irritated him in every possible way . The contest finally waxed so warm between them that Mrs. Preston was obliged to interpose , and to withdraw with Oscar . Mrs. Preston never ascertained the real facts in the case . Candor compels me to say that Bridget 's complaints were essentially true . Knowing the poor Irish girl 's weak side ( her quick temper ) , Oscar had for some time taxed his ingenuity to torment her , for the sake of hearing her " sputter , " as he termed it . He was not only impudent , and applied offensive names to her , but sometimes he purposely put her to extra labor and trouble by misplacing articles , making dirt about the house , &c.; These things were a sad annoyance to Bridget , and she soon came to regard Oscar as " the plague of her life , " and treated him accordingly . He did very wrong to annoy her in this way ; and she was foolish to take so much notice of his hectoring . The ill-will thus established between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open rupture just described . But Mrs. Preston did not give full credit to Bridget 's story . She believed the difficulty was owing quite as much to Biddy 's irritable temper and ignorance as to Oscar 's impudence , and consequently the latter escaped with a slight reprimand . She also prevailed upon Bridget to remain with them the week out , thinking she would by that time get over her anger . But , to the surprise of all , when Saturday night came , Bridget took her departure . She had got another " place , " where she would be out of the reach of the provoking Oscar . The week for the annual examination of the public schools soon arrived . Oscar begged hard , but in vain , for permission to absent himself , on the eventful day that the grave committee and other distinguished visitors were to sit in judgment upon the condition of the school to which he belonged . But though he was present , he did not appear to much advantage among the " bright particular stars " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his class were called out , to receive the " Franklin medals , " his name was not heard , and no silken ribbon , with silver medal attached , was hung around his neck . The same day , in obedience to the orders of his father , but very much against his own inclination , Oscar applied to the head master for the certificate required of boys who present themselves for admission to the High School . The teacher seemed a little puzzled what reply to make . At length he said : " Do you know what kind of a certificate is required ? " " Yes , sir , " replied Oscar , who had read the advertisement in the paper that morning . " The certificate must say that you are a boy of good character , and that your teacher believes you are qualified for admission to the High School , " continued the master . " Now I want to ask you if you think I can honestly say that of you ? " Oscar hung his head in shame , but made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared it would . " It is very hard to refuse such a request , " continued the teacher ; " but , really , if I should give you the certificate , I am afraid it would do you no good , while it might do me some harm , for I do n't like to have my scholars rejected . I can not honestly say that I think you are qualified for the High School ; and besides your conduct has been such of late , that I do not see how I could give you a very high recommendation . I would advise you to give up the idea of applying for admission . I am very sorry it is so , but that will not help the matter . " What could Oscar say to this ? He said nothing , but his looks betrayed the deep mortification he felt , and moved his teacher to pity , while he denied his request . Nor was this the end of Oscar 's troubles . He had got to face his father , and to confess to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the school for which he had so long been preparing . In doing this , he smoothed over the matter as well as he could ; but at best it was a bitter thing to him , and thus he began to experience some of the sad but natural effects of his own misconduct . CHAPTER XXI . NED MIXER . The long summer vacation had now commenced . Oscar wished to spend it at Brookdale , but his parents did not seem much inclined to yield to his wishes . They had not yet fully determined what to do with him ; whether to send him to a private school , when the vacations were over , or to put him to work in some shop or store . Meanwhile , Oscar was idling away his time about the streets , and devoting all his energies to the pursuit of amusement . His favorite place of resort continued to be the hotel where Alfred Walton lived . Here he found congenial spirits in Alfred , and Andy the speller , and the several drivers and hostlers , with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he often met with strangers who took his fancy . At this time , a boy named Edward Mixer was boarding at the hotel . He had lately come to Boston from another city , and Oscar and Alfred were soon captivated by his free and easy manners , and his sociable qualities . He was between fifteen and sixteen years old , and represented that he was travelling about , to see the world . He said he had plenty of money , and should have a great deal more , when he became of age . He was fashionably dressed , and Oscar and Alfred felt proud of his acquaintance , and were soon on terms of intimacy with him . It was not long before Oscar discovered that Edward was a very bad boy . His conversation was low and profane , and he seemed to take special delight in relating sundry " scrapes , " in which he himself figured in a character that was something worse than mischievous , and bordered on the criminal . He " talked large , " too , amazingly large ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant conclusion that he was an unmitigated liar . But these were small faults , in their view . They considered Ned a capital fellow , and a right down good companion , in spite of these little drawbacks , and they sought his company as much as ever . Ned spent a good deal of his time around the several railroad depots . He seemed to have quite a mania for such places . Oscar and Alfred often accompanied him to these favorite old haunts of theirs . One morning , as the three were loitering around a depot , having nothing in particular to amuse themselves with , an excursion on foot into a neighboring town was proposed , and all readily agreed to the suggestion . They immediately set out , accompanied by Oscar 's dog , Tiger . They walked along the railroad track , and crossed the river by the railroad bridge , thus saving their tolls , besides many extra steps . They passed several small sign-boards , on which was painted the warning , " No Person allowed to cross this Bridge ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one interfered with them , they were soon safely over the river . They still followed the track for some distance , until they had reached the open country , and then they turned off into the green fields . There were many fine orchards and gardens on every side , but ripe fruits and berries were very scarce . Strawberries and cherries had pretty much disappeared , and it was not yet time for plums , peaches , and early apples and pears . Ned appeared to regret this very much . " Just see there ! " he exclaimed , as they approached a large garden , remote from any house , whose trees were loaded with green fruit . " What fine picking we should have , if it were only a few weeks later ! I mean to come out here again next month , you see if I do n't . We must mark this place ; let me see ; there 's an old rough board fence -- I shall remember that , I guess . Did n't you ever rob an orchard , Alf ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at . I ' m a first-rate hand at it , I can tell you -- never got caught in my life ; but I 've come pretty near it , though , a good many times . Hold on -- I ' m going to get over the fence , and see what they ' ve got . Those plums over there look as if they were pretty near ripe . Come , Alf and Oscar , wo n't you get over ? " " You two may , " said Oscar , " but I ' ll stay here with Tiger . He might bark if we all got over , where he could n't see us . " Edward and Alfred were soon upon the other side of the fence . While they were exploring the garden , Oscar 's attention was attracted to a dense thicket , from which two or three birds suddenly flew on his approach . He thought there might be a nest there , and concluded to see if he could find it . Carefully brushing aside the leaves and twigs , he began to hunt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absorbed in this occupation , he lost sight of his comrades . Illustration : Hunting for Birds ' Nests . After searching for several minutes , Oscar found a small nest , within his reach , but it was empty . He turned to inform the other boys of his success , but they were nowhere to be seen . He walked along by the fence , but could see nothing of them . He was afraid to call to them , lest the owner of the garden might hear , and take the alarm . He listened , but could not hear them . He walked along still further , and kept his eyes wide open , but they were not to be seen . He concluded they were playing a trick upon him , and had hid themselves . If that was the game he thought , he would not worry himself about it . He accordingly turned about , and was going to sit down and wait for them to make their appearance , when he happened to espy them in a distant field , running at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase after them . It was soon evident that the boys were gaining on their pursuer ; but they were approaching a brook , over which there was no bridge , and the man probably supposed that would bring them to a stand . It did not , however , for they ran right through the shallow water , without stopping to think about it . The man did not think it prudent to follow their example , and he accordingly gave up the chase , and went back with dry feet . After Edward and Alfred had got rid of their pursuer , they began to look around for Oscar . The latter , putting his fingers into his mouth , gave a loud and shrill whistle , which they immediately recognized , and answered in a similar way . Oscar started towards them , and taking a wide sweep through the fields , they all came out together upon the highway . They did not think it safe to remain long in the neighborhood , and so they hurried on towards Boston . It appeared , from Edward 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaches from a tree , while in the garden , but they proved unfit to eat . They also found some ripe currants , and were leisurely helping themselves , when they heard somebody ask them what they were about . They turned , and saw a man approaching ; whereupon , without stopping to answer his question , they leaped over the fence , and took to their heels , the man following closely upon them . The conclusion of the race Oscar had witnessed . As they were walking home , and talking about various matters , Edward suddenly gave the conversation a new turn , by inquiring : " Boys , do you want to go into a grand speculation with me ? " " Yes , what is it ? " was the response of both the others . " We should make something handsome out of it , but we should have to run some risk , " continued Edward . " I 've got the scheme all laid out , so that I know just how to go to work . But it 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you have got pluck enough to go into it . " " I ' ve got pluck -- the real , genuine article ; try me , and see if I have n't , " said Alfred . " So have I , " said Oscar ; " I should like to have you show me a boy that 's got more pluck than I have , when I get stirred up . " " Pooh , you do n't know what pluck is , neither of you , " replied Edward . " What would you do if a policeman should nab you ? " " I should run , just as you did , when the man caught you stealing fruit , " said Oscar , with a laugh . " That 's a specimen of your pluck , ai nt it ? " " But what is the speculation you were telling about ? " inquired Alfred . " I guess I sha n't tell you about it now , " replied Edward . " I ' m afraid you would n't keep it to yourselves . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Alfred . " So will I , " added Oscar . " If I let you into the secret , and you should blab it out , I would n't mind killing both of you , " said Edward , with forced gravity , which he could not long maintain , it gradually relaxing into a smile . " I mean what I say , " he added , " you need n't laugh at it . " Both the others renewed their promise to keep the matter a secret ; but Edward , after talking about his scheme a quarter of an hour longer , and exciting the curiosity of the others to the highest point , finally informed them that he could not let them into the secret then , but that he would tell them all about it in a few days , if he was sure that they would keep it to themselves . Oscar saw Edward almost every day , and often inquired about his speculation , but got no definite answer . He and Alfred both felt very curious to know what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not gratified . Edward assured them , however , that things were nearly ready , and that in a few days he would let them into the mysterious scheme . Oscar 's uncle , from Brookdale , was now in the city , and was stopping for a few days at Mr. Preston 's . He no sooner arrived , than Oscar applied to his parents for permission to return with him to Maine ; but they did not give much encouragement to his proposal , although his uncle said he should like to have him make his family another visit . Oscar , however , daily renewed his request , for he believed that he should yet accomplish his object by teasing . The day before Oscar 's uncle was to return to his home , a gentleman called into Mr. Preston 's store , and told him he wished to see him alone . Having with drawn to a private room , the stranger introduced himself as an officer of the police . " You have a son fourteen or fifteen years old ? " inquired the officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preston . " Are you aware that he is getting into bad company ? " continued the officer . " No , sir , " said Mr. Preston . " Well , " resumed the other , " I ' ve called to acquaint you of a few facts that have come to my knowledge , and you can act in the matter as you think best . There is a young fellow stopping at the  - -   - -   Hotel , who came to this city a few weeks ago , and who calls himself Edward Mixer . He is a little larger than your son , and is well dressed , and looks like a respectable boy ; but for a week or two past we have suspected that he was a rogue . He hangs around the railroad depots , and as several persons have had their pockets picked , when getting out of the cars , since he made his appearance , we began to watch him . We have got no evidence against him yet ; but yesterday I pointed him out to a New York policeman , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him well . It seems he is a regular pickpocket by profession , and has served a term at Blackwell 's Island . 1 He was liberated last month , and came on here to follow the business where he is n't known . But we keep a sharp eye on him , and as we have noticed that your son is quite intimate with him , I thought it my duty to inform you of it . I do n't suppose your boy knows the real character of this fellow , or has anything to do with his roguery ; but it is n't safe for him to be in such company , and I thought you ought to know what is going on . " Mr. Preston thanked the officer very cordially for the information , and promised to see that Oscar was immediately put out of the way of danger from this source . When he went home at noon , he had a long private interview with his son , and informed him of the disclosures the officer had made . Oscar was not a little astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose company he prized so highly , was a thief by trade , and was fresh from a prison . He assured his father that he knew nothing of all this . This was true ; but after all Oscar knew too much of the character of Ned to believe him to be a good boy , or a safe companion . He had heard him swear and lie . He had also heard him sneer at virtue , and boast of deeds that no well-ordered conscience would approve . And yet he courted his company , and considered him a " capital fellow " ! O , foolish boy ! But Oscar 's plea of ignorance did not fully excuse him , even in the eye of his father , who did not know how little force that plea really had . " I do n't suppose you knew his character , " said Mr. Preston ; " but are there not good boys enough in the neighborhood for you to associate with -- boys that have always lived here and are well known -- without your cultivating the acquaintance of every straggler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make yourself so intimate with Tom , Dick , and Harry , before you know anything about them . I ' ve cautioned you against this a good many times , and now I hope that you ' ll see there is some cause for it . If this intimacy had gone on a few weeks longer , it might have ruined you and disgraced your mother and me . " After consultation with his wife and brother , Mr. Preston concluded to let Oscar go down to Brookdale ; and remain until they could make some permanent arrangements for him elsewhere . He did not think it safe for him to remain longer exposed to the temptations of the city . He charged Oscar not to speak again to Ned , and not to inform any one of the facts he had learned about him , lest it might thwart the efforts of the police to detect his rogueries . On second thought , he concluded to take Oscar to the store with him that afternoon , to prevent the possibility of an interview between him and Ned . Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . In the evening he packed his valise for the journey , and the next morning he started for Brookdale with his uncle . A day or two after Oscar 's departure , Ned was arrested in the act of picking a lady 's pocket at a railroad depot . Being unable to obtain bail , he was committed for trial . When his case came up in court , he was brought in guilty ; and it appearing , from the testimony of the officers , that , though young , he was quite old in crime , he was sentenced to one year in the House of Correction . Oscar never ascertained the nature of Ned 's " grand speculation , " and probably it was well for him that he did not . Had he been let into the secret , and had the scheme been carried into effect at the time it was first talked of , I might have been obliged to add another and a still sadder chapter to the history of " THE BOY WHO HAD HIS OWN WAY . " 1 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
