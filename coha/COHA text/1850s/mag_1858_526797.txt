THOMAS JEFFERSON. * Concluded . I ME . JEFFERSON returned from France in the autumn of 1789 , and the following spring took office as Secretary of State . He was unwilling to abandon his post abroad , hut the solicitations of Washington controlled him . He plainly was the most suitable person for the place . Franklin , the father of American diplo-. macy , was rapidly approaching the close of his long and busy life , and John Adams , the only other statesman whose diplomatic , experience could be compared with that of Thomas Jefferson , was Vice President . It would be a tedious task to enter into a detail of the disputes which arose in Washington 's Cabinet , nor is it necessary to do so . Most candid persons , who have examined the subject , are convinced that the differences were unavoidable , that they were produced by exigencies in affairs upon which men naturally would disagree , by conflicting social elements , and by the dissimilar characters , purposes , and political doctrines of Jefferson and Hamilton . Jefferson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which from his youth he had entertained . As to the accusation , so often made , that he opposed an administration of which he was a member and which by the plainest party-rules he was bound to support , it is completely answered by the statement , that his conduct was understood by **ashington , that he repeatedly offered to resign , and that when he retired it was in opposition to the President 's wish . It is not worth while for us to apply a higher standard of party loyalty to Washington 's miiiisters than he himself applied . One great difficulty encountered by #E The Lffe of Thomas Jefferson . By HENRY S. RANDALL , LL . D. In three volumes . New York : Derby&amp;Jackson. 1868. the politicians of that day seems to have been purely fanciful . Strictly speaking , the government did not have a policy . It went into operation with the impression that it would be persistently resisted , that its success was doubtful , and that any considerable popular disaffection would be fatal to it . These fears proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government was as stable as it now is . Disturbing elements undoubtedly existed , but they were controlled by great and overruling necessities , recognized by all men . Thus the final purpose of the administration was accoTuphished at the outset . The labor which it was expected would task the patriotism and exercise the skill of the most generous and experienced was performed without an effort ,  --  as it were , by a mere pulsation of the popular heart . The question was not , how shall the government be preserved ? but , How shall it be administered ? This is evident now , but was not seen then . The statesmen of the time believed that the Union was constantly in danger , and that their best efforts were needed to protect it . in this spirit they approached every question which presented itself . Thinking that every measure directly affected the safety of the republic , a difference of opinion could not be a mere disagreement upon a matter of policy . In proportion to the intensity of each man 's patriotism was his conviction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he naturally thought that his opponents must be either culpably neglecting or deliberately plotting against the iiiterests of the country . Real difficulties were increased by imaginary ones . Opposition became treason . Parties called themselves Republicans and Federalists ; - they called each other monarchists and anarchists . This delusion has always charac*erized // our politics ; noisy politicians of the present day stigmatize their adversaries as disunionists ; hut during the first twenty years it was universal , and explains the fierce party-spirit which posscssed the statesmen of that period , and likewise accounts for many of their errors . Among these errors must be placed the belief which Jefferson bad , that there was a party of monarchists in the country . Mr. Randall makes a long argument in support of this opinion , and closes with an intimation that those who refuse to believe now can not be reached by reason . He may rank us with these perverse skeptics ; for , in our opinion , his argument not only fails to establish his propositions , but is strong against them . Let it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were some who would have preferred a monarchy to a republic , but that , after the govern ! nent was established , Ames , Sedgwick , Hamilton , and other Federal leaders , were plotting to overturn it and create a monarchy . Upon this we have no hesitation in taking issue . The real state of the ease , and the circumstances which deceived Mr. Jefferson , may be briefly set forth . Jeffcs son left France shortly after the taking of the Bastile. lie saw the most auspicious period of the Revolution . During the session of the Estates General , the evils which afflicted France were admitted by all , but the remedies proposed were , as yet , purely speculative . The roseate theories of poets and enthusiasts had filled every mind with vague expectations of some great good in the future . Nothing had occurred to disturb these pleasing anticipations . There was no sign of the fearful ( lisasters then impending . The delirium of possession had not seized upon the nation ,  --  her statesmen had not learned how much easier it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of Burke carried terror throughout Europe . Even now , it is impossible to read the first acts of that drama without being moved to sympathetic enthusiasm . What emotions must it not have excited while the awful catas trophe was yet concealed ! Tried by any received test , France , for centuries , had been the chief state in Europe ,  --  inferior to none in the arts of war , superior to any in the arts of peace . Fashion and letters had given her an empire more permanent than that which the enterprise of Columbus and the fortune of Charles gave to Spain* more extended than that which Trafalgar and Waterloo have since given to England . Though her armies were resisted , her wit and grace were irresistible ; every European prince was her subject , every European court a theatre for the display of her address . The peculiar spirit of her gonius is not more distinctly to be seen in the verse of Boileau than in that of Pope-in the sounding perio ( ls of Bossuet than in Addison 's easy phrase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried tyranny to a perfection and invested it with a splendor never before seen , becoming the coryph*us of freedom , might easily have fascinated a mind less impressible by nature , and less disposed by education for favorable impressions , than that of Jefferson . lie shared the feeling of the hour . his advice was asked , and respectfully listened to . This experience , while , as he says , it strengthened his preconceived convictions , must have prevented him from carefully observing , certainly from being affected by , the influences which had been at work in his own country . He came home more assured in republicanism , and expecting to find that America had kept p* with him . But many things had occurred in America to excite doubts of the efficiency of republican institutions . The government of the Confederation was of little value . During the war , common interests and ( hangers had bound the Colonies toge thier ; with peace came commercial rivalries , boundary disputes , relations with other countries , the burdens of a large debt ,  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequate to the public exigencies . The Congress was a mere conven // tion , in which each State had but one vote . To the most important enactments the consent of nine States was necessary . The concurrence of the several legislatures was require ( l to levy a tax , raise an army , or ratify a treaty . The executive power was lodged in a committee , which was useless either for deliberation or action . The government fell into contempt ; it could not protect itself from insult ; and the doors of Congress were once besieged byamobof mutinous soldiery . The States sometimes openly resisted the central government , and to the most necessary laws , those for the maintenance of the national credit , they gave but a partial obedience . They quarrelled with each other . New York sent troops into the field to enforce her claims upon her New England neighbors . The inhabitants of the Territories rebelled . Kentucky , Vermont , and Tennessee , under another name , declared themselves independent , and demanded admission into the Union . In New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a rebellion was set on foot , which , for a time , interrupted the sessions of the courts . An Indian war , attended by the usual barbarities , raged along the northern frontier . Foreign states declined to negotiate with a government which could not enforce its decrees within its own borders . England haughtily refused to withdraw her troops from our soil ; Spain closed the Mississippi to the commerce and encroached upon the territory of the Confederation . Every consideration of safety and advantage demanded a government with strength enough to secure quiet at home and respect abroad . It is not to be denied that many thoughtful and experienced men were discouraged by the failure of the Confederation , and thought that nothing but a monarchy could accomplish the desired purpose . There were also certain social elements tending in the same direction , and these were strongest in the city of New York , where Jefferson first observed them . That city had been the centre of the largest and most powerful Tory community in the Colonies . The gentry were nearly all Tories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tradespeopIe , thriving upon British patronage , had become attached to the British cause . There , and , indeed , in all the cities , there were aristocratic circles . Jefferson was of course introduced into them . In these circles were the persons who gave dinners , and at whose tables he heard the opinions expressed which astonished and alarmed him . What is described as polite society has never been much felt in American politics ; it was not more influential then . Besides , in many cases , these opinions were more likely to have been the expression of affectation than of settled conviction . Nothing is more common than a certain insincerity which leads men to profess and seemingly believe sentiments which they do not and can not act upon . The stout squire who prides himself upon his obstinacy , and whose* pretty daughter manages him as easily as she manages her poodle , is a favorite character in English comedy . Every one knows some truculent gentleman who loudly proclaims that one half of mankind are knaves and the other half would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ( lespair if be really believed the atrocious principles he loves to announce . Jefferson was not so constituted as to make the proper allowance for this kind of insincerity . Though undemnionstrative , be was thoroughly in earnest . In fact , he was something of a precisian in politics . He spoke of kings and nobles as if they were personal foes , and disliked Scott 's novels because they give too pleasing a representation of the instiVu- I tion of chivalry , lie probably looked upon a man who spoke covetously of titles much as a Salem elder a century before would have looked upon a bardswearing Virginia planter . In the purseproud citizens , who , after dinner , used to talk grandly about the British Constitution , lie saw a set of malignant conspirators , when in fact not one in ten bad ever // thought seriously upon the subject , or had enough fo*'ce of character to attempt to carry out his opinions , whatever they might have been . The political discontents were hardly more formidable . We have admitted that some influential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one took a decided step in that direction . In all the published correspondence there is not a particle of evidence of such a movement . Even hamilton , in his boldest advances towards a centralization of power , did not propose a monarchy . Those who were most doubtful about the success of a republic recognized the necessity of making the experiment , and were the most active in establishing the present one . The sparsity of the population , the extent of the country , and its poverty , made a royal establishment impossible . The people were dissatisfied with the Confederation , not with republicanism . The breath of ridicule would have upset the throne . The King , the Dukes of Massachusetts and Virginia , the Marquises of Connecticut and Mohawk Earl Susquehanna and Lord Livingston , would have been laughed at by every ragamuffin . The sentiment which makes the appendages of royalty , its titles and honors , respectable , is the result of long education , and has never existed in America . Washington was the only person mentioned in connection with the crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost his power over the people . lie was strong because he had convinced his country that he held personal objects subservient to public ones ,  - -  that , with him , " the path of duty was the way to glory . " He had none of the magnetism which lulls the senses and leads captive the hearts of men . Had he clothed himself in the vulgar robes of royalty ,  --  had he taken advantage of the confidence reposed in him for a purpose of self-aggrandizement , and that of so petty and commonplace a kind , - he would have sunk to a level with the melodramatic heroes of history , and that colossal reputation , which rose , a fair exha December , lation from the hearts of grateful millions , and covered all the land , would have vanished like a mist . Whatever individuals may have wished for , the charge of monarchical designs can not be brought against the Federa*sts as a party . iNew England was the mother of the Revolution , and became the stronghold of Federalism . In South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tories ; the former State voted for Mr. Jefferson every time he was a candidate , the latter gave him his election in 1800 . It requires a liberal expenditure of credulity to believe that the children of the Puritans desired a monarchy more than the descendants of the Cavaliers and the adherents of Do Lancy and Ogden . Upon this subject Jefferson does not seem to have understood that disposition which can be dissatisfied with a measure , and yet firm and honest in supporting it . Public men constantly yield or modify their opinior*s under the pressure of political necessity . lie himself gives an instance of this , when , in stating that he was not entirely content with the Constitution , he remarks that not a member of the Federal Convention approved it in all its parts . Why may we not suppose that Hamilton and Ames sacrificed their opinions , as well as Mr. Jefferson and the framers of the Constitution ? The evidence with which Mr. Randall fortifies his position is inconclusive . It consists of the opinions of leading Republicans , and extracts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the objection of having been prompted by political prejudices ; the latter will not bear the construction which he places upon them . They are nothing more than expressions of doubt as to the stability of the , overnment , and of regret that one of a different kind was not ndopted ,  --  most of which were made after the Federalists were defeated . We should not place too literal a construction upon the repinings of disappointed placemen . Mr. Randall , we believe , has been in political life , and ought to be accustomed to the // disposition which exists among public men to think that the country will be ruined , if it is deprived of their services . After every election , our ears are vexed by the gloomy vaticinatious of defeated candidates . This amiable weakness is too common to excite uneasiness . An argument of the same kind , and quite as effective as Mr. Randall 's , might be made against Jefferson . His letters contain predictions of disaster in case of the success of his opponents , and the Fcderalists spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged him with being a disciple of Robespierre , said that he was in favor of anarchy , and would erect a guillotine in every market-place . He called them monarchists , and said they sighed after King , Lords , and Commons . Neither charge will be believed . The heads of the Federalists were safe after the election of Mr. Jefferson , and the republic would have been safe if Hamilton and Adams had continued in power . Both parties formed exag*erated opinions . That Jefferson did so , no one can doubt *ho observes the weight he gave to trifles ,  --  his annoyance at the etiquette of the capital-at the levees and liveries ,  --  at the President 's speech ,  --  the hysterical dread into which he was thrown by the mere mention of the Society of the Cincinnati , and the " chill " which Mr. Randall says came over him " when he heard hamilton praise C*sar . " This spirit led him to the act which every one must think is a stain upon his character : we refer to the compilation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that book was written mainly for the purpose of proving that the Federalists were in favor of a monarchy . It consists chiefly of reports of the conversations of distinguished characters . Some of these conversations-and it is noticeable that they are the most innocent ones-took place in his presence . The worst expressions are mere reports by third parties . One story rests upon no better foundation than that Talleyrand told it to Volney , who told it to Jefferson . At one place we are informed , that , at a St. Andrew 's Club dinner , the toast to the President ( Mr. Adams ) was coldly received , but at that to George the Third " Hamilton started to his feet and insisted on a bumper and three cheers . " This choice bit of scandal is given on the authority of " Mr. Smith , a Hamburg merchant , " " who received it from Mr. Schwarthouse , to sc/mom it was told by one of time dinner-party . " At a dinner given by some members of the bar to the federal judges , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " - Rufus King being the American minister in that country . Whereupon Mr. Jefferson solemnly asks us " to observe the double entendre on the word King . " Du Ponceau told this to Tenche Coxe , who told it to Jefferson . Such stuff is repeated in connection with descriptions of how General and Mrs. Washington sat on a raised sofa at a ball , and all the dancers bowed to them ,  --  and how Mrs. Knox mounted the steps unbidden , and , finding the sofa too small for three , had to go down . We are told that at one time John Adams cried , " Damn em ! you see that an elective government will not do , "  --  and that at another lie complimented a little boy who was a Democrat , saying , " Well , a boy of fifteen who is not a Democrat is good for notliing ,  --  and he is no better who is a Democrat at twenty . " Of this bit of treason Jefferson says , " Ewen told Hurt , and Hurt told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indiscreet editor . They were revised by Mr. Jefferson in 1818 , when he was seventy-five years old , after , as he sr*ys , the passions of the time were passed away , - with the intention that they should be published . Jt is humiliating to record this act . No justification for it is possible . it is idle to say that these revelations were made to warn the country of its danger . As evidence they are not entitled to a thought . More flimsy gossip never floated over a tea-table . Besides , for such a purpose they should have been published when the contest was in progress , when the danger was imminent , not after the men whom he arraigned were defeated and most of them in their gravos . Equally unsatisfactory is the cxcuse , // that they illustrate history . This may be true , but it does not acquit Mr. Jefferson . Pepys tells us more than flume about the court of Charles II. , and I3oswcll 's Life of Johnson is the best biography in the languagc ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Boswell or a Pepys . Mr. Randall 's cxcuse , that the act was done in seltZvindi* cation , is the worst of all . Jefferson was the victor and needed no defence , surely not so mean an ( l cowardly a ( lefence . That a grave statesman should stoop to betray the confidence of familiar intercourse ,  --  that a skeptical inquirer , who systematically rejected everything which did not stand the most rigid tests , should rely on the ridiculous gessip of political circles ,  --  that a deliberate and thoughtful man should jump to a conclusion as quickly as a child , and assert it with the intolerance of a Turk , certainly is a strange anomaly . We can account for it only by supposing that upon the subject of a monarchy he was a little beside himself . It is certain , that , through some weakness , he was made to forget gentlemanly propriety , and the plainest rules for the sifting of testimony ; - let us believe that the general opinions which he formed , and which his biographer perpetuates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this subject , both on account of the prominence which Mr. Randall has given it , and because , as admirers of Mr. Jefferson , we wished to mak* a full and distinct statement of the most common and reasonable complaint against him . The biographer has done his hero a great injury by reviving this absurd business , and has cast suspicion upon the accuracy of his book . It is time that our historians approached their subjects with more liberal tempers . They should cease to be advocates . Whatever the American people may think about the policy of the Federalists , they will not impute to them unpatriotic designs . That party comprised a majority of the Revolutionary leaders . It is not strange that many of them fell into error . They were wealthy and had the pride of wealth . They had been educated with certain ideas about rank , which a military life bad strengthened . The liberal theories which the war had engendered were *ot understood , and , durThg the French Revolution , they became associated with acts of atrocity which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discriminate between the crime and the principles which the criminals professed . Students of affairs are now in a better position than Mr. Jefferson was , to ascertain the truth , and they will not find it necessary to adopt his prejudices against a body of men who have adorned our history by eloquence , learning , a ad valor . Jefferson 's position in Washington 's government must have been extremely disagreeable . There was hardly a subject upon which he and Hamilton agreed . Washington had established the practice of disposing of the business before the Cabinet by vote . Each member was at liberty to explain his views , and , owing to the wide differences in opinion , the Cabinet Council became a debating society . This gave Hamilton an advantage . Jefferson never argued. , and , if he had attempted it , lie would have been no match for his adversary . He contented himself with a plain statement of his views and the reasons which influenced him , made in the abstract manner which was habitual with him . Hamilton , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painstaking dialectician , who carefully fortified every position . He made long speeches to the Cabinet , with as much earnestness as one would use in court . Though Jefferson had great influence with the President , he wds generally outvoted . Knox , of course , was against him . Randolph , the Attorney-General , upon whose support he had a right to depend , was an ingenious , but unsteady , sophist . He had so just an understanding , that his appreciation of his opponent 's argument was usually stronger than his confidence in his own . He commonly agreed with Jefferson , and voted with J*amilt6n . The Secretary of State was not allowed to control his own // department . Hamilton continually interfered with him , and had business interviews with the ministers of foreign countries . Tfle dispute soon spread beyond the Cabinet , and was taken up by the press . Jefferson again and again asked leave to resign ; Washington besought him to remain , and endeavored to close the breach between the rival Secretaries . For a time , Jefferson yielded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December , 1793 , he left office , and was soon followed by Hamilton . After reaching Monti*ello , Mr. Jefferson announced , that he had completely withdrawn from affairs , and that he did not even read the journals , preferring to contemplate " the tranquil growth of lucern and potatoes . " These bucolic pleasures soon palled . Cultivating lucern and potatoes is , without doubt , a dignified and useful employment , but it is not likely to content a man who has played a great part , and is conscious that he is still able to do so . We soon find him a candidate for the Presidency , and , strange as it may seem , in 1797 , he was persuaded to leave his " buckwheat-dressings " and take the seat of Yice-President . Those who are interested in party tactics will find it instructive to read Mr. Randall 's account of the opposition to Adams 's administration . His correspondence shows that Adams was the victim of those in whom be confided . He made the mistake of retaining the Cabinet which Washington had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a weaker one has never been seen . His ministers plotted against him ,  --  his party friends opposed and thwarted him . The President had sufficient talent for a score of Cabinets , but he likewise had many foibles , and his position seemed to fetter his talen and give full play to his foibles . The opposition adroitly took advantage of the dissensions of their adversaries . In Congress , the Federalists were compelled to carry every measure by main force , and every inch of ground was contested . The temporizing Madison , formerly leader of the Republicans in the House of Repre sentatives , had been succeeded by Albert Gallatin , a man of more enterprising spirit and firmer grasp of thought . He was assisted by John Randolph , who then first displayed the resources of his versatile and daring intellect . Mr. Jefferson , also , as the avowed candidate for the succession , may be supposed to have contributed his unrivalled knowledge of the springs of human action . Earnest as the opposition were , they did not abuse the license which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson with a vindictiveness which has no parallel . in this country . They boasted of being gentlenien , and prided themselves upon their standing and culture , yet they descended to the vilest tricks and meanest scan ( lal . They called Jefferson a Jacohm - abused him because he liked French cookery and French wines , and wore a red waistcoat . To its shame , the pulpit was foremost in this disgraceful warfare . Clergymen did not hesitate to mention him by name in their sermons . Cobbett said , that Jefferson had cheated his British creditors . A Maryland preacher improved this story , by saying that he had cheated a widow and her daughters , of whose estate he was executor . He was compared to Rehoboam . It was said , that he had a negro mistress , and compelled his daughters to submit to her presence ,  --  hat he would not permit his children to read the Bible ,  --  and that , on one occasion , when his attention was called to the dilapidated condition of a church , he remarked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a mane er . " According to his custom , he made no reply to these slanders , and , except from a few mild remarks in his letters , one can not discover that he heard of them . Mr. Adams did not show his successor the customary courtesy of attending his inau* , uration , leaving Washington the same morning . The new President , entirely unattended and plainly dressed , rode down the avenue on horseback . He tied his horse to the paling which // surrounded the Capitol grounds , and , without ceremony , entered the Senate Chamber . The contrast between this somewhat ostentatious simplicity and the parade at the iaaugurations of Washington and Adams showed how great a change had taken place in the government . The Presidency is the culmination of Mr. Jefferson 's political career , and we gladly turn to a contemplation of his character in other aspects . The collections of Jefferson 's writings and correspondence , which have been published , throw no light upon his domestic relations . We have complained of the prolixity of Mr. Randall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood as complaining of the number of family letters it contains . They form its most pleasing and novel feature . They show us that the placid philosopher had a nature which was ardent , tender , and constant . His wife died after but ten years of married life . She was the mother of six children , of whom two , Martha and Maria reached maturity . Though still young , Mr. Jefferson never married again , finding sufficient opportunity for the indulgence of his domestic tastes in the society of his daughters . Martha whom he nicknamed Patsey , was plain , resembling her father in features , and having some of his mental characteristics . Maria , the youngest , inherited the charms of her mother , and is described as one of the most beautiful women of her time . Her natural courtesy procured for her , while yet a child , from her French attendants , the sobriquet of Polie , a name which clung to her through life . Charged with the care of these children , Jefferson made their education one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He planned their studies , and descended to the minutest directions as to dress and deportment . While they were young , he himself selected every article of clothing for them , and even after they were married , continued their constant and confi dential adviser . When they were absent , he insisted that they should inform him how they occupied themselves , what books they read , what tunes theyplayed , dwelling on these details with the fond particularity of a lover . Association with his daughters seemed to awaken his noblest and most refined impulses , and to reveal the choicest fruit of his reading and experience . His letters to them are models of their kind . They contain not only those general precepts which an affectionate parent and wise man would naturally desire to impress upon the mind of a child , but they also show a perception of the most subtile feminine traits and a sympathy with the most delicate feminine tastes , seldom seen in our sex , and which exhibits the breadthand symmetry of Jefferson 's organization . One of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen of England , to whom it was sent by his family , in answer to a request for an autograph . His daughters were in France with him , and were placed at school in a convent near Paris . Martha was captivated by the ceremonials of the Romish Church , and wrote to her father asking that she might be permitted to take the veil . It is easy to imagine time surprise with which the worldly diplomatist read the epistle . He did not reply to it , but soon made a visit to the Abhaye . He smiled kindly at the young enthusiast , who came anxiously to meet him , told the girls that he had come for them , and , without referring to Martha 's letter , took them hack to Paris . The account-book sh*ws that after this incident the young ladies did not diminish their attention to the harpsichord , guitar , and dancing-master . Maria , who was married to John W. Eppes , died in 1804 , leaving two children . Martha , wife of Thomas M. Randolph , survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Randoiphs lived on Mr. Jefferson 's estate of Monticello , and after he retired from public life he found his greatest pleasure in the society of the numerous family which surrounded him ,  --  a pleasure which increased // with his years . Mr. Randall publishes a few letters from some of Jefferson 's grand-daughters , describing their happy child-life at Monticello . Besides being noticeable for grace of expression , these letters breathe a spirit of affection for Mr. Jefferson which only the warmest affection on his part could have elicited . The writers fondly relate every particular which illustrates the habits and manners of the retired statesman ; telling with what kindness he reproved , with what heartiness he commended them ; how the children loved to follow him in his walks , to sit with him by the fire during the winter twilight , or at the window in summer , listening to his quaint stories ; how he directed their sports , acted as judge when they ran races in the garden , and gathered fruit for them , pulling down the branches on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gave him to anticipate their wishes by some unexpected gift . One says that her Bible and Shakspeare came fromiim ,  --  that he gave her her first writing-desk , her first watch , her first Leghorn hat and silk dress . Another tells how he saw her tear her dress , and in a f*v days brought a new and more beautiful one to mend it , as he said ,  --  that she had refused to buy a guitar which she admired , because it was too expensive , and that when she came to breakfast the next morning the guitar was waiting for her . One of these ladies seems to give only a natural expression to the feelings which all his grandchildren had for him , when she prettily calls him their good genius with magic wand , brightening their young lives by his kindness and his gifts . Indeed , the account which these volumes give of Monticello life is very interesting . The house was a long brick building , in the Grecian style , common at that time . It was surmounted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were piazzas at the end of each wing . It was situated upon the summit of a hill six hundred feet high , one of a range of such . To the east lay an undulating plain , unbroken save by a solitary peak ; and upon the western side a deep valley swept up to the base of the Blue Ridge , which was twenty miles distant . The grounds were tastefully decorated , and , by a peculiar arrangement which the site permitted , all the domestic offices and barns were sunk from view . The interior of the mansion was spacious , and even elegant it was decorated with natural curiosities , - Indian and Mexican antiquities , articles of virtit , and a large number of portraits and busts of historical characters . The library-which was sold to the government in 1815-contained between nine and ten thousand volumes . He had another house upon an estate called Poplar Forest , ninety miles from Monticello . Mr. Jefferson was too old to attempt any new scientific or literary enterprise , but as soon as he reached home he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were continued , he studied botany , and was an industrious reader of three or four languages . When nearly eighty , we find him writing elaborate disquisitions on grammar , astronomy , the Epicurean philosophy , and discussing style with Edward Everett . The coldness between him and John Adams passed away , and they used to write one another long letters , in which they criticized Plato and the Greek dramatists , speculated upon the end for which the sensations of grief were intended , and asked each other whether they would consent to live their lives over again . Jefferson , with his usual cheerfulness , promptly answered , Yes . He dispensed a liberal hospitality , and in a style which showed the influence of his foreign residence . Though temperate , he understood the mysteries of the French cuisine , and liked the wines of M*doc . These tastes gave occasion to Patrick Henry 's sarcasm upon gentlemen " who abjured their native victuals . " Mr. Randall tells an amusing anecdote of a brandy-drinking Virginian , who wondered how a man of so much taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // that some night he would be carried off by it . No American has ever exerted so great an ( l universal aa attraction . Men of all parties made pilgrimages to Monticello . Foreigners of distinction were unwilling to leave th' country without seeing Mr. Jefibrson ; men of fashion , artists , litt*rateurs , savants , soldiers , clergymen , flocked to his house . Mrs. Randolph stated , that she had provided beds for fifty persons at a time . The intrusion was often disagreeable enough . Groups of uninvited strangers sometimes planted themselves in the passages of his house to see him go to dinner , or gathered around him when he sat on the portico . A female once broke a window-pane with ber parasol to get a better view of him . But no press of company was permitted to interfere with his occupations . The early morning was devoted to correspondence ; the day to his library , to his workshop , or to business ; after dinner he gave himself up to society . Making every allowance for the exaggerations of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a master of conversation . It had contributed too much to his success not to have been made the subject of thought . It is true , he had neither wit nor eloquence ; but this was a kind of negative advantage ; fhr he was free from that striving after effect so common among professed wits , neither did he indulge in those monologues into which eloquence betrnyed Coleridge and seduces Mac aul a . He had great tact , information , and worldly knowledge . lie never disputed , and had the address not to attempt to control the current of conversation for the purpose of turning it in a particular direction , but was always ready to follow the humor of the hour . His language , if seldom striking , never failed to harmonize with his theme , while , of course , the effect of everything he said was heightened by his age and reputation . Unfortunately , li*s latter days were clouded hy pecuniary distress . Althouo'h prudent and methodical , partly from unavoidahle circumstances , and partly from the expense of his enormous establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend for whom he had indorsed completed his ruin and made it necessary to sell his property . This , however , was not done until after his death , when every debt was paid , even to a subscription for a Presbyterian church . As is well known , the chief labor of his age was the establishment of the University of Virginia . He was the creator of that institution , and displayed in behalf of it a zeal and energy truly wonderful . When unable to ride over to the University , which was eight miles from Monticello , he used to sit upon his terrace and watch the workmen through a telescope . He designed the buildings , planned the organization and course of instruction , and selected the faculty . lie seemed to regard this enterprise as crowning and completing a career which had been devoted to the cause of liberty , by providing for the increase and diffusion of knowledge . In Febrbary , 1826 , the return of a disease by which he had at intervals been visited convinced Jefferson that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ) rei ) ared for his decease , arranging his affairs and giving the final directions as to the University . To his family he did not mention the subject , nor could they detect any change in his manner , except an increased tenderness in each night 's farewell , and the lingering gaze with which he followed their motions . His mental vigor continued . His will , quite a long document , was written by himself ; and on the 24th of June he wrote a reply to an invitation to the celebration at Washington of the ensuing Fourth of July . It is difficult to discover in what respect this production is inferior to his earlier performances of the same kind . It has all of the author 's ease and precision of style , and more than his ordinary distinctness and earnestness of thought . This was his last letter . lie rapidly dcdined , but preserved possession of his // faculties . He remarked , as if surprised at it , upon his disposition to recur to the scenes of the Revolution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fourth of July . This wish was not denied to him ; he expired at noon of that day , precisely fifty years after the Declaration of Independence . A few hours afterwards the great heart of John Adams ceased to heat . So much has been said about Mr. Jefferson 's religious opinions , and our hiegrapher gives them such prominence , that we shall be pardoned for aliudin* to them , although they are not among the topics which a critic generally should touch . Mr. Randall says that Jefferson was " a public professor of his belief in the Christian religion . " We do not think that this unqualified statement is supported by Jefferson 's explanation of his views upon Christianity , which Mr. Randall subsequently gives . Religion , in the sense which is commonly given to it , as a system of faith and worship , he did not connect with Christ at all . lie was a believer in the existence of God , in a future life , and in man s accountability for his actions here in so far as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worship , but not of Christian worship . He regarded Christ simply as a man , with no other than mortal power ,  --  and to worship him in any way would , in his opinion , have been idolatry . His theology recognized . the Deity alone . The extracts from his public papers , upon which Mr. Randall relies , contain nothing hut those general expressions which a Alohammedan or a follower of Confucius might have used . lie said he was a Christian " in the only sense in which Christ wished any one to be " ; but received Christ 's teachings merely as a system , and not a perfect system , of morals . lie rejected the narratives which attest the Divine character or the Divine mission of the Saviour , thinking them the fictions of ignorance and superstition . He was , however , far from being a scoffer. lie attended the Episcop. 1 service regularly , and was liberal in his donations to religious enterprises . Nor do we think that this conformity arose from weakness or hypocrisy , but rather from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lively admiration for the character and life of Christ . If a Christian is one who sincerely believes and implicitly obeys the teachings of Jesus so far as they affect our relations with our fellow-men , then Mr. Jefferson was a Christian in a sense in which few can be called so . Though the light did not unseal his vision , it filled his heart . Among the statesmen of the world there is no one who has more rigidly demanded that the laws of God shall be applied to the affairs of Man . His political system is a beantiftil growth from the principles of love , humility , and charity , which the New Testament inculcates . When reflecting upon Mr. Jefferson 's mental organization , one is. impressed by the variety and perfectness of his intellectual faculties . He united the powers of obsTervation with those of reflection in a degree hardly surpassed by Bacon . Yet he has done nothing which entitles . him to a place among the first of men . It may be said , that , devoted to the inferior pnrs*it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in art or philosophy , where alone the highest genius finds a field . But we think his failure-if one can fail who does not make an attempt-was not for want of opportunity . He did not possess any imagination . lIe was so deficient in that respect as to be singular . The imagination seems to assist the mental vision as the telescope does that of the eye ; he saw with his unaided powers only . lie says , " Nature intended him for the tranquil pursuits of science , " and it is impossible to assign any reason why lie should not have attained treat eminence among scientific men . The sole difficulty might have been , that , from very variety of power , he would not give himself up to any single study with the devotion which Nature demands from those who seek her favors . Within ' his range his perception of // truth was a rapi ( l and unfailing as an instinct . Without difficulty he separated the specious from the solid , gave great weight to evidence , but was skeptical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ho was never incumbered by them . No one was less likely to make the common mistake of thinking that a particular instance established a general proposition . He sought for rules of universal application , and was industrious in the accumulation of facts , because he knew how many are needed to prove the simplest truth . The accuracy of his mental operations , united with great courage , made him careless of authority . He clung to a principle because he thought it true , not because others thought it so . There is no indication that he valued an opinion the more becanse great men of former ages had favored it . His self-reliance was shown in his unwillingness to employ servants . Even when very feeble , he refused to permit any one to assist him . He had extraordinary power of condensation , and , always seeing the gist of a matter , lie often exposed an argument of hours by a single sentence . Some of his brief papers , like the one on Banking , contain the substance of debates , which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his manner of s*tting his conclusions , seldom reveal*ing the processes by which he arrived at them . He sets forth strange and disputed doctrines as if they were truisms . Those who have studied " The Prince " for the purpose of understanding its construction will not think us fanciful when we find a resemblance between Jefferson 's mode of argumentation and that of Machiavelli . There is the same manner of approaching a subject , the same neglect of opposing aronments , and the same disposition to rely on the force of general maxims . Machiavelli exceeded him in power of ratiocination from a given proposition , but does not seem to have been able to determine whether a given proposition was right or wrong . In force of mind Jefferson has often been surpassed : Hamilton was his sa perior . As an executive officer , where action was required , he could not have been distinguished . It is true , he was a successful President , but neither the time nor the place demanded the highest execujive talents . When Governor of Virginia , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although some excuse may be made for him , he must be said to have failed . Upon matters which are affected by feeling and sentiment , the judgmeflt of woman is said to surpass that of ou'r sex , - her more sensitive instincts carrying her to heights which our blind strength fails to reach . If this be true , Jefferson in some respects resembled woman . We have already alluded to the delicacy of his organization ; it was strangely delicate , indeed , for one who had so many solid qualities . Like woman , he was constant rather than passionate ; he had her refinement , disliking rude company and coarse pleasures ,  --  her love of luxury , and fondness for things whose beauty consists in part in their delicacy and fragility . His political opponents often refused to speak with him , but their wives found his soeiety delightful . Like woman , his feelings sometimes seemed to preeede his judgment . Such an organization is not often a safe one for business ; but in Mr. Jefferson , with his homely perceptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his great and peculiar influence seem to us to have been qualities of character , not of the mind . Chief among these must be placed that which , for want of a better term , we will call sympathy . This sympathy colored his whole nature , mental and moral . It gave him his manysidedness . There was no limit to his intellectual tastes . Most persons cherish prejudices , and think certain pursuits degrading or useless . Thus , business-men sneer at artists , and artists sneer at business-men . Jefferson had nothing of this . He understood and appreciated the value of every employm*nt . No knowledge was too trivial for him ; with the same affectionate interest , he observed the // courses of the winds and the growth of a Ilowcr . Sympathy in some sort supplied the place of imagination , making him understand subjects of which the imagination alone usually informs us . Thus , he was fond of Art . He had no eye for color , but appreciated the beauties of form , and was a critic of sculpture and architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but tradition sauctified nothing , association gave no additional value . He committed what Burke thought a great crime , that of thinking a queen nothing but a woman . lie went to Stratford-on-Avon , and tells us that it cost him a shilling to see Shakspeare 's tomb , but says nothing else . He might have admired the scenery of the place , and he certainly was an admirer of Shakspeare ; but Stratford had no additional beauty in his eyes because Shakspeare was born and buried there . After his death , in a secret drawer of his secretary , mementoes , such as locks of hair , of his wife and dead children , even of the infant who lived but a few hours after birth , were found , and accompanying each were some fond words . The packages were neatly arranged , and their envelopes showed that they had often been opened . It needed personal knowledge and regard to awaken in him an interest in objects for their associations . The characteristic of which we speak showed itself in the intensity and quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sympathized with all our national desires and prejudices , our enterprise and confidence , our love of dominion and boundless pride . Buffon asserted that the animals of America were smaller than those of Europe . Jefferson flew to the rescue of the animals , and certainly seems to have the best of the argument . Buffon said , that the Indian was cold in love , cruel in war , an ( l mean in intellect . Had Jefferson been a descendant of Pocahontas , he could not have been more zealous in behalf of the Indian . He contradicted Buffon upon every point , and cited Lo gan 's speech as deserving comparison with the most celebrated passages of Grecian and Roman eloquence . Nowhere did he see skies so beautiful , a climate so delightful , men so brave , or women so fair , as in America . He was not content that his country should be rich and powerful ; his ardent patriotism carried him forward to a time when the great Republic should give law to the world for every department of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he seen in that broad humanity which was the source of his philosophy . lie sympathized with man ,  --  his sufferings , joys , fears , hopes , and aspirations . The law of his nature made him a democrat . Men of his own rank , when introduced to him , found his manner cold and reserved ; but the young and the ignorant were attracted from the *irst . Education and interest did not affect him . Born a British subject , he became the founder of a democracy . He was a slaveholder and an abolitionist . The fact , that the African is degraded and help* less , to his , as to every generous mind , was a reason why he should be protected , not an excuse for oppressing him . Though fitness for the highest effort be denied to Jefferson , yet in the pursuit to which he devoted himself , considered with reference to elevation and wisdom of policy and actual achievement , he may be compared with any man of modern times . It is the boast of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rule , . " Never to lay down any proposition of wider extent than the particular case for which it is necessary to provide . " Therefore politics in England have not reached the ( lignity of a science ; and her public men have been tacticians , rather than statesmen . Burke may be mentioned as an exception . No one will claim for Jefferson Burke 's amplitude of thought and wealth of imagination , but he surpassed him in justness of understanding and practical efficiency . Burke was never connected with the government , except during the short-lived Rockingham* // administration . Among Frenchmen , the mind instinctively recurs to the wise and virtuous Turgot . But it was the misfortune of Turgot to come into power at the beginning of the reign of Louis XVI . It became his task to reform a government which was beyond reform , and to preserve a dynasty which could not be preserved . His illustrious career is little more than a brilliant promise . Jefferson undoubtedly owed much to fortune . He was placed in a country removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great principles of free government had for generations been established ,  --  among a people sprung from many races , but who spoke the same language , were governed by similar laws , and whose minds ' rebellion had prepared for the reception of* new truths and the abantlonment of ancient errors . To be called upon to give symmetry and completeness to a political system which seemed to be Providentially designed for the nat *n over which it was to extend , to be able to connect himself with the futur** progress of an agile and ambitious people , was certainly a rare and happy fortune , and must be considered , when we claim superiority for him o*ver those who were placed in the midst of apathy and decay . His influence upon us may be seen in the material , but still more distinctly in the social and moral action of the country . With those laws which here restrain turbulent forces and stimulate beneficent ones ,  --  with the bright visions of pence and freedom which the unhappy of every European race see in their Western skies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which here loosens the bonds of social prejudice , and to ambition sings an inspiring strain ,  --  with these , which are our pride and boast , he is associated indissolubly and forever . With the things which have brought our country into disrepute-we leave it for others to recall the dismal catalogue - his name can not be connected . Not the least valuable result of his life is the triumphant refutation which it oives to the assertion , so often made by blatant sophisters , that none but low arts avail in republics . He has been called a demagogue . This charge is the charge of misconception or ignorance . It is true , he believed that his doctrines would prevail ; he was sensitive to the opinions of others , nor was he " out of love with noble fame " ; but his successes were fairly , manfully won . He had none of the common qualifications for popularity . No glare of military glory surrounded him ; he had not the admired gift of eloquence ; he was opposed by wealth and fashion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous men of his day ,  - -  by Jay , Marshall , the Piuckneys , Knox , King , and Adams ; he had to encounter the vehement genius of Hamilton and the prestige of Washington ; he was not in a position for direct action upon the people ; he never went beyond the line of his duty , and , from 1776 to his inaugural address , he did not publish a word which was calculated to excite lively , popular interest ; - yet , in spite of all and against all , he won . So complete was the victory , that , at his second election , Massachusetts stood beside Virginia , supporting him . He won because he was true to a principle . Thousands of men , whose untutored minds could not comprehend a proposition of his elaborate philosophy , remembered that in his youth he had proclaimed the equality of men , knew that in maturity he remained true to that declaration , and , believing that this great assurance of their liberties was in danger , they gathered around him , preferring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him because he had confidence in them . There is no danger in that demagogism the art of which consists in love for man . Fortunate , indeed , will it be for the IRepublic , if , among the aspirants who are now pressing into the strife , and making their voices heard in the great exchanges of public opinion , there are some who will imitate the civic virtues and practise the benign philosophy of Thomas Jefferson ! *Te take leave of this book with reluctance . It is verbose and dull , but it has // led us along the path of American reflown ; it recites a story which , however awkwardly told , can never fall coldly on an American ear . It has , besides , given us an opportunity , of which we have gladly availed ourselves , to make some poor amends for the wrongs which Jefferson suffered at the hands of New England , to hear our testimony to his genius and services , and to express our reverent admiration for a life which , though it bears the traces of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
