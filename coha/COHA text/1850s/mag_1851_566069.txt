DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rapidity with which man becomes accustomed to every great revolution , either in civil order , in commerce , or in the economy of the household . The wonder of this generation will in a few years be so familiar , that a change to the old customs would be as astonishing as the original revolution . This is exemplified by the // recent application of steam to locomotion . We are in the transition period , when traveling thirty miles in an hour is ceasing to excite surprise , and although the young man recollects before a railroad was opened , for the conveyance of passengers in this country , yet the children of the present day will never appreciate the improvement . A lady remarked in a recent conversation , that she always pointed out a stage coach to her children , so that they might not forget how it appeared . Not a few however can remember the condition of the roads in Connecticut , before the turnpike system was fairly undertaken , when the oxwagon was almost the only wheeled carriage employed in the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine , now in the midst of usefulness and honors , that on coming to be examined for admission to Yale College from a town some forty miles distant , he recjuested of his relative , a venerable minister , the loan of his ambling nag for the journey . The old gentleman , shocked at the effeminacy of the youth , and alarmed at the thought of the general degeneracy , exclaimed , " Can you not ride a trotting horse forty miles ? If we go on at this rate , people will by and by suppose , that they can not go to New Haven , except in a spring cart . " That prediction has long ago been fulfilled , and the spring cart is yielding to the carriage which performs in an hour , the journey which then required an entire day . The unsettled portion of Maine affords the only fair example in New England , of the roads generally used at the close of the IRevolutionary War , and even at the conclusion of the eighteenth century ; yet the traveler must hasten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of learning experimentally , how poor a track may be called a highway . Five years ago , the writer passed through the Dixville Notch , on the borders of Canada , wading the streams , tumbling over or around rocks whose weight could only be measured by tons , regarding a swamp , with the niud not over a foot in depth , where the carriage did not need to be held up , a great improvement . About midway of this execrable road , we found a woman at work before her washing tubs , which with Yankee shrewdness she had arranged , so that a little stream trickled down from one to the other and saved the trouble of changing the water . After a pleasant word of greeting , she told us that she had come to that lonely spot some six months before , but never expected to leave , as her great wonder was how she ever reached the place . We left the poor woman evidently considering herself hopelessly imprisoned , but now a railroad is in progress of construction before her door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatigue to every corner of these United States . The real ex // tent of the revolution in traveling , was well exemplified by the surprise of a venerable clergyman , upon trying the new mode of conveyance . This father in Israel had clung to his private carriage , in his annual journey from the neighborhood of New a Haven to Boston , until the line of railroad was completed between the two cities and in successful operation . He was then persuaded , on a bright May morning to seat himself in the cars , and in a few hours was whirled to his destination . He landed at our father 's doorstep in apparent bewilderment , and when we gathered around the white-haired saint , to ask after his health , replied , " Thanks to a kind providence , my children , I am well , except the feeling of one , who has been shot out of a cannon . " These anecdotes demonstrate the greatness of the revolution efYected by the railroad and steamboat , and also the propriety of noticing its progress , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a scientific treatise on this subject , but simply to express those views , and state those facts , which should interest every intelligent mind , in respect to the origin , construction , and management of the railroad . This is becoming a matter of great practical importance to the community , since more than one hundred millions of dollars have been already expended upon this enterprise in New England , and about three thousand miles of railroad are in operation , while a vast amount of capital has been invested in these works throughout the United States . The great number of stockholders , and the fact , recently ascertained by numerous experiments , that every railroad is not profitable , through a natural necessity , has snggested the inquiry into the proper management of such enterprises , for the permanent benefit of the stockholders , and the convenience of the public . We purpose to give the result of a somewhat careful examination into the publications at the head of this article , for the benefit both of stockholders , and of all who take an interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people , reorganizing trade , and binding the different sections of the country with clamps of iron . Our views will certainly be unprejudiced , as we do not possess a single share of railroad stock , and of their soundness , others must judge . The ordinary progress of a railroad enterprise in its projection , construction , and operation , suggests the natural arrangement of topics , and harmonizes with our simple and unscientific plan . The obtaining of a charter , from the legislature of the State in which the railroad is to be located , is the first step toward an organization of the company which is to carry the work forward . // The charter , as the nucleus which contains the guiding principles of the whole enterprise , holds somewhat the position which certain modern philosophers would assign to the forces of light and motion in the formation of the universe . But we suspect that the parallel is more accurate than would accord with the notions of those philosophers , since unless there had been a further expenditure of creative power and skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several railroad charters which have been obtained , and yet not a shovel has been lifted on the track designated , but the sod retains its pristine verdure . In England , a great outlay of money is essential to procure from the legislature the passage of a bill for incorporating a railroad company , but our legislatures have usually proceeded on the principle of permitting all who desired the privilege to invest their money in building these highways . Since , however , railroad companies have themselves become interested in preventing the construction of rival roads , it has been somewhat more difficult to procure a charter , and the powerful influence , vulgarly denominated the third house , has to be regarded and employed . Yet we are disposed to believe , that unless it is clear that the enterprise is intended to defraud others of their just rights , or is merely devised to promote gambling in stocks , those who are ready to build a railroad should be allowed the privilege under suitable restrictions . The charter usually specifies the amount of stock which must be subscribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of this list is the next step in the process . It is procuring fuel to set the engine in motion , and enable it to act successfully . It is an interesting fact in the history of railroads in this country , that the majority of shares were originally taken , not by capitalists , but by men in active business : farmers , mechanics , and merchants , who were the least able to spare the funds , and commonly borrowed the money they subscribed . Thus , the world over , we must in the main look to the working classes for our helpers in starting and carrying forward any great enterprise in the church or the State . Capitalists wait to purchase the stock , while the road is building , at from ten to fifty per cent discount . The transfer book of almost any railroad in New England would prove the truth of this statement . Yet we are not to suppose that the original subscribers are necessarily losers . The farmer i ? * Berkshire county who originally took five shares in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened into selling out at a discount of fifty per cent , did no t find himself two hundred and fifty dollars out of pocket , // for the two or three hundred acres of land , which he owned on the line of the road , had risen in value to treble the amount of his sacrifice . So the mechanic is remunerated by the increased demand for labor , and thus reaps abundantly for the scattered seed . We know a merchant who subscribed some two thousand dollars in the stock of the Western railroad , and sold out a year or two after for sixteen hundred dollars , because lie needed the money in his business ; but he lost nothing , since he had at that time received more than four hundred dollars net , from the new business brought him by the road . The payment of interest to the stockholders on the amount they invest , until the road is in operation , has become a vexed question . The majority of those who engage in these enterprises are not able to wait for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to borrow the money which they invest , and it is argued that this loss of interest should be fairly charged to the cost of the road . Thus , a landlord , in estimating the cost of a building , would not merely add the expense of the material and labor , but also the interest of the outlay before the completiou of the structure to the day that it was finished . This argument is correct when the funds for building a road are procured by original stock subscriptions ; but when , as commonly happens , the amount necessary must be made up by preferred stock , by bonds and mortgages , or worse yet , by a floating debt of some hundred thousand dollars , then the case is altered . The question then is , whether it is wise to take the funds obtained by these means for the payment of interest to the stockholders , when it is merely taking a dollar from one pocket to put it in the other ? But the question becomes one not of prudence but of ju8tice , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of interest high , and the directors of unfinished roads are greatly embarrassed in procuring the funds requisite to complete their undertakings . If , under such circumstances , a part of the stockholders advance the means for finishing and sustaining the enterprise , shall their sacrifice be expended in the payment of interest to those who would not make the sacrifice , or in building the road by which all parties are to be benefited ? The directors of the iRutland and Burlington Railroad , in their report , submitted June 1*3 , 18*.50 , reason thus on this subject : " There is due to stockholders for interest upon assessments up to January 1 , 1850 , the sum of $90,400 . It becomes an important question for you to determine in what manner , and when , this interest shall be paid . The amount can not be paid in cash from any means at present in the treasury ; nor can it be paid in sash without obtaining a loan for this purpose , thereby increasing to an equal *nount the debt you already owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withdraw an equal amount of capital on which your creditors have a right to rely , and appropriate the same by an interest dividend to your own use . The wisdom of such a proceeding has never been discovered . It likens itself to the practice with which some corporations have been charged-borrowing money at exorbitant rates to pay to shareholders a dividend of earnings ! How then shall this interest debt be paid ? In reply , the board unhesitatingly recommend an issue of the capital stock of the company at its par value , bearing date January 1 , 1850 . This recommendation , if adopted , furnishes a substantial fulfillment of our obligation in this particular , and at the same time relieves the treasury from a burden from which it can not otherwise easily relieve itself . " Even this expedient is not an actual payment of the interest when the stock is below par , and becomes cumbersome through the necessary division of shares , and the complication of accounts . Apparently , the most honest and simplest method , when the capital required can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not paying this interest at all , thus diminishing by so much the cost of the road , and increasing the value of the stock . In regard to the methods usually employed for raising additional funds , no security can be safer than the bonds secured by mortgage , of a road economically built , wisely located , and prudently managed , when the aggregate amount of the bonds does not exceed half the cost of the enterprise . Yet , besides this , there generally rests as an incubus on the more recent railroads , a balance charged in the accdunts to floating debt . This term has become such a bugbear , that it suggests the direst imaginings on the part of stockholders and investigating committees . It would be fairly symbolized by a huge alligator , whose capacious jaws of usury were fast receiving profits and investment never to be disgorged , and whose scales were impregnable . Yet , with our system of credit , a floating debt is often an absolute necessity , and involves the salvation of the road , and consequently of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern iRailroad , for the year ending June 30 , 1850 , contains some remarks on this point , which we quote , both for their intrinsic worth , and also as high authority in all matters connected with railroad management , from the acknowledged experience and ability of their author . " On the subject of the indebtedness of railroad companies there is but little investigation , and consequently much misapprehension . The inquiry is-How much do they owe ? but this question is seldom followed up with the equally important one-What have they got to pay with ? It is however with corporate bodies , as with individuals , that the richest and the strongest may still have the greatest amount of liabilities . It seems however to be taken for granted in relation to railroad corporations that it must be good policy to liquidate their debts , or at least fund the floating portion of them at any sacrifice as soon as it can by any possibility be d . But this should depend on the circumstances of each // 327 Floating Debt-Financial . figents. particular case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the management of corporate institutions to be free from all liabilities , and nobody will dispute that it is desirable to be so . But it may notwithstanding not always be for the interest of the stockholders that their agents should divest themselves of the trouble and responsibility of sustaining a debt , at all events , and at every sacrifice . There are cases in which a funded debt is beneficial rather than injurious to the company owing it , and which the directors should not pay off if they could . In the case of the Western Railroad , the payment of its debt to the State would , the last year , have reduced the profit on each share from $9 18-100 to $7 61-100 . The same is true to a less extent with the Eastern . A floating debt is less manageable and generally much more expensive to carry than one that is funded , yet this it may not always be good policy to pay by the issue of new shares , or even to put it in the form of a funded debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to pay a large rate of interest for a short time , than to force on unwilling holders a new issue of stock , thereby reducing the value of the whole , or on the public a large amount of bonds at a rate that insures for a long time a greater amount of interest than need be paid in sustaining a current loan for a short period . Some labor and perplexity may be saved , but money may be lost by such an operation . It is better sometimes to gain less reputation for the officers , and save more money for the stockholders . Again , little or no distinction is made in the public estimation between those companies that have property to meet their debts , and those who must depend on the creafion of new stock , or the issue of new bonds to cover their engagements . A railroad company in the former position may be said to have no debt at all upon it as such , while the latter must depend on its income to sustain its credit , and thus enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This summary of the methods , necessary to provide ways and means , for carrying forward a railroad enterprise to a successful issue , must convince every intelligent mind that rare qualifications are demanded in the financial agents . There must be a thorough understanding of financial transactions , great skill in their management , the utmost accuracy in the detail of accounts , p*rsonal commercial credit , sterling honesty , and a devotion to the interests of the enterprise , as truly as to a matter of private business . We see not how any one of these qualifications can be spared without loss , and it may be well for stockholders and directors to reflect upon this necessity , before attempting to economise , by setting up this office at auction , to be taken by the lowest bidder who can find friends to sign his bonds of security against fraud . A railroad company may suffer to the amount of many thousands , while saving a few hundred dollars in the salary of their agent , merely througl* his incapacity . It will be new to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage to the company for whom he manages ; but the directors of our banks , and our money brokers will affirm that there is " much in a name . " The directors of the Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad , July , 1850 , thus speak of an officer who had resigned : - " As the financial agent of the company his services // have been invaluable , having given his individual acceptances for large amounts , through months and years of great stringency in the money market , until the affairs of the Company had assumed a shape and condition no longer to require such aid . " It is likewise true , on the other side , that the management of the finances of a railroad gives great insight into the state and prospects of the market , which may be lawfully used for personal profit , and thus in some respects affords an equivalent for a small salary . This can no more be prevented than could Talleyrand hinder his barber from judging of the market by the appearance of his countenance in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This fact , however , shows more conclusively the wisdom of employing an agent who is competent and upright , at whatever expense . We come naturally , after considering the providing of the capital , to the actual construction of the road . The selection of routes , the elevation of the grades , the best form of rail , and the other minuti connected with the building , belong to the department of the practical engineer , upon which we are not anxious to intrude , especially as no general principles will avail , when every question must be decided by the particular circumstances . It is an instructive and interesting fact , that with the increase of wealth in our country , the railroad improves proportionally , and the Englishman 's slur at our fiat rails in our new territory would soon cease , if he were compelled to travel over the corduroy road , of which this is the best substitute that the inhabitants of a sparsely settled region can afford . We will , however , venture on behalf of passengers to advise the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad , without the express stipulation , that said road shall be covered with a topping of coarse sifted gravel , not less than four inches deep . A railroad which can not afford this expenditure should not be permitted in New England . Should this article b* fortunate enough to meet the eye of a director in the New York and New Haven railroad corporation , we would suggest for their especial consideration the policy of sodding the embankuients , and by this outlay entitling themselves to the rich remuneration which they are receiving from the public . At present a ride over many of our railroads recalls the fable of Jupiter 's journey in a cloud , except alas ! that we have dirt instead of vapor for our draperies . Unless some responsible capitalist , who can lose a half million of dollars if necessary , is willing to contract for building the entire road , experience has shown it best to procure a competent engineer , and make full and explicit bargains for small sections and particular portions of the work ; since the larger the contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demand for an extra allowance at the settlement . This is easily explained , since he who makes a survey of twenty miles will not calculate so accurately as he who examines a few hundred feet ; and if he makes a profitable guess , will not surely care for the welfare of the company , while if mistaken , he can easily move the pity of a jury by the story of his adversity . Besides , the large contractor must underlet , and thus the railroad has to pay a double profit , while the practice of requiring the builders of the road to take part of their pay in stock , or in bonds , always occasions difficulty in the settlement , and gluts the market with shares , which must be turned into money at any sacrifice , to pay the wages of the laborers . Another occasion of perplexity frequently occurs in the settlement of land damages , and we take pleasure in giving publicity to the experience of the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad Company , which is thus kindly narrated in the report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other corporations . " These suits for land damages have given us much trouble ; and we are fully satisfied that , in the construction of a railroad , it is best to settle such matters before a spade is put into the ground . Men , who would freely give their lands to induce yon to locate your road through their premises , will afterwards maintain that they are greatly injured by it , and seQk to obtain enormous damages . In some cases , however , we ought to saye that owners of land have deported themselves like honest men . " The directors of a railroad , running out of Boston , located their track around an old man 's farm , in order to avoid an altercation , and supposing that this would be the best punishment they could inflict on him for his obstinacy ; but as it happened they were outwitted . In a short time the business of the road increased so much that it was essential to have it straightened at this point , which was near a dangerous crossing . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right from the legislature , or buying the farm at a most exorbitant price , which they wisely concluded to do , as on the whole the least expensive and troublesome alternative . The expense of building and equipping a railroad constitutes the Construction Account , and it is a frequent , though great mistake , to suppose that this account is closed , and the road is finished when it is opened for travel . Years often elapse before the road is completed and its cost settled ; for the opening is but a test of what equipment is needed ; and the labor of months is required to bring the track up to grade , and to give the embankments solidity . The directors of the Boston and Providence // Railroad , one of the oldest railroad corporations in the country , in their report to the stockholders , June , 1850 , remark : " During the past year no extraordinary expenditures have been made , and in the opinion of the directors , the interests of the corporation will , hereafter , require none on construction account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was necessary to do to complete the road , and everything which can be done to protect it from further injurious competition . " The statement of the directors of the Eastern Railroad Company in their report is very instructive . " When an increase of business takes place , an increased outlay is necessary and proper to accommodate it . Otherwise it will show either that an expense disproportionate to the actual requirements of the road had been incurred , or that the income belonging to present stockholders had been taken to furnish capital to those who may hereafter become so . There are practical objections to both . It is evident , however , that such increase should not be in proportion to the enlargement of the traffic , because the great expenditures for obtaining the rights of way , making the road bed , establishing the stations , &amp;c. , must generally have been incurred for any amount of business , however small . In our case , however , this is not entirely true . In 1843 , although the road was sufficient for its actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a double track only eight miles ; its station-houses were of the most fragile character ; the arrangements at East Boston were inconvenient ; and , in fact , but little more was done than to render the road passable . Since that time , the road has been graded , and the bridges widened for a second track , which has been completed between Boston and Salem , a new and heavy rail laid on the Marblehead Branch , new machine-shop , engine , car and freight-houses erected at East Boston , and new and enlarged depots at Salem , Lynn , and Hampton . The expensive branches to Gloucester and Salisbury have been constructed , and a new rail been substituted over the whole length of the trunk road ( a small portion not yet completed ) , of one-third greater weight than that originally laid down . The equipment has been increased by more than doubling the car accommodations for passengers , quadrupling those for freight , and by the purchase of thirteen engines , tripling the motive power. * ' We th*is perceive that a railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened for travel , and consequently its construction account can not then be closed . We should , therefore , in the natural order , next take up the actual working of the railroad , and afterward refer again to this account , which is the problem at which railroad managers arid railroad investigators stumble , and are not unfrequently entirely baffled . The first question which presents itself on the opening of a railroad is the tariff of fare for passengers and freight . A few years since , the theory was broached that the lower the price on a railroad , the more would be the profits by the increase of business . There is undoubtedly a measure of truth in the proposition , but , of course , it must be limited , for a railroad could hardly declare a dividend , // which should carry for nothing , although the world should become its customers . The minimum point of charge to produce the maximum amount of revenue is a delicate problem which can hardly be settled in any case without actual experiment , since competition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts which vary with each road , must be ascertained and considered . The directors of the railroads in the vicinity of Boston raised their fare half a cent on the mile a tear since , from the conviction that this was due to the stockholders . The directors of the Northern iRailroad , in New Hampshire , give the following sensible view of this subject , in their fifth annual report , rendered May , 1850 " During the past year , the fare for passengers has been advanced to about three cents per mile , and that for freight to about what it was previous to its reduction in 1848 . Such fares we consider reasonable for any road-doubly so for one passing , as does ours , by high grades , ( in comparison with those of lower roads , ) through a country sparsely inhabited , and whose inhabitants have , until recently , paid about treble the present rates of fare for freight , and about onehalf more for passengers . We have full confidence in the willingness of a liberal public to pay stockholders a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and accommodation , and we believe the directors , for the time being , will gladly reduce fares as soon as a just regard for the interests of stockholders will permit . " Another matter which has attracted considerable notice in the reports of railroad directors , and of investigating committees , refers to the building of engines and cars by a corporation for their own use , in preference to purchasing their equipment . The fact is well substantiated , that the expense , when built by the railroad corporation , is very greatly enhanced , although it is claimed that the work is stronger and safer , a fact which is not fully established . The almost unanimous decision appears to have been , that enough men should be employed in the machine shop to perform the ordinary repairs on the road , and that their leisure should be occupied in building a new car or engine , while the principal equipment is purchased elsewhere . Much discussion has also been had on the expediency of building or sustaining branch roads , and the views expressed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining almost universally . These branches are sometimes necessary , and a source of profit ; but , unless self-supporting , generally do more harm than good to the trunk whence they derive nourishment , instead of imparting strength . Strong , and often imperative , inducements urge to the construction of a branch , to prevent a competing main line from being organized . When , also , the stock of a railroad is twenty per cent . above par , the directors // are tempted to enlarge it as much as possible by the building of branch roads , under the impression that the increase of income will be proportioned to the outlay . But the experience of the Boston and Worcester Railroad would not justify this conclusion . Rare qualifications are demanded in those who manage the practical working of the railroad as in those who control its financial operations . The superintendent or other officer who has this business in charge , should be a thorough civil engineer , a good practical mechanic , and an accurate mathematician . These qualifications are essential to the preservation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running of the different trains . Moreover , the business arrangements , the settlement of the rates of fare , the agreement with other roads , require great tact and wisdom , so that the affairs of the road shall be conducted with the utmost economy , consistent with necessary convenience and the highest return of profit . It is comparatively easy to manage a well equipped road , possessing an ample capital and abundant custom , as it is easy for a rich householder to procure domestic conveniences ; but to make much of little is an art as difficult , but as essential to most of the railroad superintendents in this country , as to a somewhat straitened house-keeper . For example , a large freight may be readily taken with a full supply of locomotives and cars , but where economy is requisite , the secret of success consists in making each engine do all the work of which it is capable , and keeping every man in the employ of the road laboring to the best advantage . An interesting fact is stated by Lardner , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best managed roads in the world . From the official statistics he derives the following result : " The daily service of an engine , therefore , expressed in time , would be nearly two hours working , and three and three quarters Wa*tiiig with steam up . " A child can see that the reduction of the time spent in waiting , and an increase in the working time , would add greatly to the income of the road , by reducing the number of engines and laborers required , and the amount of fuel consumed . When connections are to be made with other roads , or with other modes of conveyance , not the easiest , but on the whole the most profitable , arrangement is to be consummated , and this requires great prudence and foresight on the part of the managers . Every business man understands the advantage of skillfully using a small capital , and this is the talent which is demanded by our railroad corporations . Moreover , a company can not manage but a certain amount of business , and if they undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties , strive to become car builders or steamboat proprietors , they xviii undoubtedly find themselves losers by the operation , as the man who attempts to carry on several distinct kinds of business will probably soon become bankrupt , though in any one of the occupations he might readily acquire a fortune . The income , and what is of more importance , the profits and honest dividends of a railroad , depend on wise management ; and if a manufacturing corporation , or a house-builder , find it for their interest to pay double wages to an overseer who has the talent of making others work to advantage , this faculty should not be overlooked in a railroad superintendent . The mention of dividends brings us again to the accounts of the corporation . The problem which puzzles many railroad managers consists in deciding what expenses shall be charged to income , and what to construction , during the time that elapses between the opening and the completion of the railway . Suppose , for illustration , that a locomotive employed on gravel train , in bringing the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damages itself and the cars to the amount of some thousand dollars , or carelessly comes in collision with a regular passenger train , shall the repairs be charged to the regular expenses and be deducted from the income , or to the construction and increase the capital ? The case becomes more complicated , when , as in some railroads , the construction account is charged with the freight and labor , according to the general tarifl of all work performed after the road is in operation . The temptation is very strong at this critical period in the history of a railroad to make the best show of income possible , and thus increase the facility of procuring capital to complete the enterprise , and fund the floating debt . We are not inclined to dispute the propriety of the directors in a railroad corporation putting the best phase on its affairs , which can be presented without fraud , instead of taking an opposite course , and presenting unprincipled speculators a weapon to injure and plunder . The same rules which would apply to the equitable transaction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs . These remarks will show why an able railroad report is to be received with some qualification , and is sometimes an exception to the musty proverb , " Figures can not lie . " Tudeed , these documents not unfrequently exemplify Talleyrand 's definition of words as a " device to conceal facts . " But while the reports of railroad directors are not necessarily infallible , let no stockholder be so deluded as to iniagine the reports of investigating committees any more trustworthy . We should in most cases prefer to take the former than the latter as data upon which to // reason , if we were forced to the alternative . When a committee , prejudiced in any way against the management of a railroad , engage in the scrutiny , it is very easy to discover gross mistakes and publish them , although these apparent mistakes may have been the most prndent devices , and may have saved the corporation from ruin . Could the writer of this article have free access to the books of any railroad company in New England , with authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has no doubt that , with his ignorance of the detail of railroad management , and of finance , which would be all in his favor , he could honestly impose on himself and on others , a distrust of the officers , and perhaps effect a change at the next annual meeting . Yet , the expediency of appointing from time to time investigating committees is undoubted , and they have accomplished much that is good , but they should not be deemed infallible . Few public documents will compare , for neatness of style , precision of thought , and clear arrangement , with the annual reports of our railroad directors throughout New England . An improvement , however , might be made in the presentation of statistics if some general outline could be agreed upon , not by a legislative committee , the majority of whom know as little of practical railroad management as a sailor of cavalry evolutions , but by the acting railroad superintendents . This might readily be arranged for those roads which have closed their construction accounts , and would greatly assist the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their income a sum to be reserved as a fund for renewing the road , and for meeting any extraordinary expenses , but the amount to be reserved annually can only be ascertained by experiment . Seven years of trial has led to the following estimate by the directors of the Eastern Railroad : " It may therefore be assumed , that before the net profits can be stated , there should be deducted , besides the current expenses and interest , about 13 cents per mile run , to be carried to renewal and contingent funds , to which accounts , and not to construction or to current expenses , should be charged all materials and labor used in substituting new for old , and all losses by fire , collision , or other accidents . If at any one period these exceed the fund that has been thus appropriated , the excess will become a charge to be liquidated by the appropriations of subsequent and more fortunate years . On the contrary , if they are less , there will be an accumulation to meet future expenses and disasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual depreciation of the road and equipment , and provide against those extraordinary perils to which all roads are subject . " // the reports , both of directors and of investigating committees , secondary to the careful selection of honest , competent , and responsible men for offices of trust , and while giving them the control , still guarding against the possibility of long continued abnse , by intrusting the oversight , though not the actual direction , to others . Either the president or superintendent should have supreme authority in the management , or each should have a clearly defined jurisdiction , while both are held strictly accountable to the board of directors . We quote , on this subject , the report of the investigating committee of the Old Colony Railroad , printed 1850 : " It is a waste of time and energy for seven men to come together from the different walks of life , and attempt to decide , and act upon the various questions which arise in conducting a railroad . Frequently , when honest and intelligent men feel themselves oppressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being imperfectly informed upon the subject , decide wrongly ; or , if they decide rightly , and with promptness , it must be by chance , or under the influence of a controlling mind ; and , in the latter case , they but act the farce of pretending to judge , when they are not permitted to do so . The directors should always be vigilant guardians of the property intrusted to their protection , but they should not attempt to manage , in detail , the business of a railroad . There should be , in the opinion of your committee , but one man at the head of a railroad corporation . He should be competent for that office , and should be amply remunerated for his services ; all the subordinate officers should be under his supervision , and immediately accountable to him ; and he should be held strictly responsible to the directors and stockholders for the result . He should have the privilege of calling upon his directors , as a board of consultation , if he desires their advice and support ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in their opinion , zealously and judiciously striving to discharge his duties . " We find in the New York Tribune the following evidence of the good management in our railroads : " From a list in the Bo8tom Adverti8er of thirteen railroads and their branches in Massachusetts , with 238 miles of aouble track , 375k of single , costing in the whole $33,810,689 , it appears that more than half the companies paid dividends in 1850 , from the net profits of the year , 8 per cent. ; and the average dividend on the whole exceeded 7 per cent. ; each having retained a greater or less reserve . While in England , the past year , no company paid more than 5 per cent. , with the exception of four , which paid respectively ? 7 14s. per cent. , 6 per cent. , 5* per cent . and 5* per cent . Six other companies paid 3 per cent. ; several from 1 to 3 ; and a number nothing . The Great Western , with a capital of nearly ? 14,000,000,264 miles long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8,390,000 , 4 per cent. ; the South-Eastern and Greenwich , capital ? 9,460,000 , 3* per cent. ; the Midland and Bristol , 496 miles , capital ? 15,540,000 , 2* // per cent. ; the Lancashire and Yorkshire , 260 miles , capital ? 11,488,000 , 2 per cent . " But there happens to be another mode of presenting the facts even in respect to the railroads in Massachusetts . Of the thirty-three railroads included in the annual reports to the last session of the legislature in that State , which are mentioned as having been in operation during the entire year , fourteen declared no dividends , and the averacre dividend of the whole was but 3 * per cent , showing just the contrary result , and yet both of these statements , though accurate , present an exaggerated view of the case . In the last instance , we have included the branch roads , which is certainly just , as many of them are leased by the main line at a fixed rent , thus receiving an income which they do not earn* but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these roads is small , their dividends should not be thus classified without respect to the amount invested in each road . It should also be remembered , that many of the roads now paying no dividend , have fairly earned a handsome profit above their expenses , which they have used for the liquidation of their floating debt , thus increasing the value of the stock . It is another important circumstance that the older and well established roads are the most profitable . We see no reason to doubt the ultimate success of almost all those railroads which are now either in operation or building , especially since the difficulties of procuring funds have prevented the execution of many foolish schemes , which were formed amid the excitement on this subject a few years since , when a railroad was apparently believed capable of not only transporting passengers and freight , but of cultivating the land and of erecting cities . We close this part of our subject by quoting from the annual report of the directors of the Eastern Railroad Company , June , 1850 , written by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been already much indebted in this article " The per eentage profit on the amount paid in by the stockholders , in the year 1849 , of the seven principal railroads in Massachusetts , as appears by the legislative reports , have been on each $100 as follows Boston and Providence , 5.836 , and on the total cost of the road , 5.66 Boston and Worcester , 6.086 , " " " " 6.07 Boston and Maine , 6.715 , " " " " 6.71 Boston and Lowell , 8.330 , " " " " 8.00 Fitchburgh , 8.979 , " " " " 6.90 W*stern , 9.187 , " " " " 7.61 Eastern , 9.494 , " " " " 8.40 " This statement is not made to show the relative value of the stocks of these several roads . A single year 's work affords no adequate criterion of their capabilities . There are many considerations beside an immediate income that enter into a correct estimate of their value . There probably are many circumstances , // that if known , would qualify materially the impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring them out , and are here introduced with that view . If we can thus elicit a more critical analysis of the expenditure , and a more definite return of all the facts , which it is , or should be , the object of these reports to furnish , they would , in a series of years , afford both to officers and stockholders , a mass of valuable and reliable information to direct the former in their management , and the latter in their investments . On examining them , however , as they are , one fact will be discovered , viz. , that those roads which have cost the most per mile , pay , as a general rule , the largest per percentage on that cost . This is readily accounted for . The most expensive railroads are those that were first built , partly owing to want of knowledge , and partly to the very high prices paid for labor and material . But those that were first in the field had their choice of locations , and of course selected those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives them an intrinsic value that more than offsets the cheaper construction of the more modern roads . The locality of a railroad is as important a consideration as that of an estate ; and there is as much difference in this respect as in a lot in State-street , and one on the Lynn Marshes . There is then no reason for their depreciation from this cause , nor would there be any for taking the course that has been very properly adopted in some well-conducted manufacturing corporations , of availing of a prosperous season to reduce their construction account to the same proportionate amount as their younger rivals . The cases are not similar . The business of railroads is local , and it can seldom be found profitable to build a new road to take it away . The expense of operating a road is nearly the same , whether the whole or half the traffic of a section is carried upon it . Consequently , where one might derive a great profit , two would render both a total loss . Not so with manufactories . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of its kind , and the value of all must be determined by the lowest price at which a new one can be constructed and operated . But in railroads their location is the great element of value , and the market price of their stock will be determined by the extent and permanency of their income , and not by their relative cost of construction . " We would now notice briefly , in closing , what most would probably anticipate as the leading purpose of this article , the commercial , civil , and moral results attendant upon this new mode of transportation . Lardner makes some instructive observations in his book on this subject , especially in the relation of the railway enterprise to the reduction of prices . The following is a summary of his statements : - " Among the advantages which attend improved means of transport , one of the most prominent is that of lowering the price of all commodities whatever in the market of consumption , and thereby stimulating production . The price paid for an article by its consumer consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article to its producer at the place of its production . 2d . The expense of conveying it from that place to the consumer . In many cases , these expenses incidental to transport , amount to considerably more than half the real price of the article ; in some , they amount to three-fourths , or four-fifths , or even a larger proportion . In the case of many animal and vegetable productions of agriculture , speed of transport is as essential as cheapness , for they will deteriorate and be // destroyed by the operation of time alone . In some eases the price of an article at the place of consnmption consists exclusively of the cost of transport . Cases even occur in which the cost of transport is actually greater than the price paid for an article by the consumer . This , which would seem a paradox , is nevertheless easily explained . An article in a given place may be a nuisance , and its possessor may be willing to pay something for its removal . This article , however , transported to another place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of stimulating profitable production . The cleansing the common sewers of a city affords a striking example of this . Every improvement in the art of transport having a tendency to diminish cost , and augment speed and safety , operates in a variety of ways to stimulate consumption and production , and thereby advance national wealth and prosperity . When the price of an article , in the market of consumption , is reduced by this cause , the demand for it is increased : 1st , by enabling former consumers to use it more freely and largely ; and , 2dly , by placing it within the reach of consumers who were before compelled to abstain from it by its dearness . The increase of consumption from this cause is generally in a larger ratio than the diminution of price . The number of consumers , able and willing to pay one shilling for any proposed article , is much more than twice the number who are able and willing to pay two shillings for the same article . But consumption is also angmented in another way by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , before the reduction , purchased at the higher price , will now be appropriated to the purchase of other articles of use or enjoyment , and thus other branches of industry are stimulated . " These views are undoubtedly correct , and might , if we had room , be sn stained by many examples . It is interesting , in this connection , to notice the difference between the canal and the railroad in point of success , and we have the result summed up in " An Account of the Farmington Canal Company , of the Hampshire and Harnpden Canal Company , and of the New Haven and Northampton Company , till the suspension of its canals in 1847 . " Published in New Haven , 1850 . " It is a fact somewhat remarkable , that canals in New England have failed of being profitable to the proprietors , while the railroads , which have taken the place of them , earn fair dividends upon the investments . The Blackstone canal passed through a region of country which abounds in manufactures , and was built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same is true of the Middlesex canal . But the Boston and Lowell railroad , and the Providence and Worcester railroad , are each successful . The most enterprising and sagacious men of New England were engaged in projecting and founding these canals . If it be possible to explain the causes why their expectations concerning them were not realized , // 339 it is only by means of an experience which they did not have . The canals of New England were never able to control the lines of travel , or to carry passengers to any great extent ; this of course deprived them of one great source of revenue possessed by railroads . The canal companies were not transportation companies , but derived their income entirely from tolls : they required , therefore , several times the amount of freight which railroads do , in order to make the same net profits . Judging from the results in the case , it may be donbted whether there is any region in New England which would furnish business enough to make a canal a source of profit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England were becoming more and more needed for propelling machinery . " Yet while these enterprises failed in their direct object , they were not without their benefit , as the author of this pamphlet shows most clearly in a few sentences . " We have given this brief account of these various efforts to carry on these works of internal improvement , because it seemed due to the distinguished men who were concerned in them , that there should be some record of their labors . It may be thought , perhaps , by some , that they labored in vain . This conclusion , however , would be far from well founded . The Farmington canal opened a channel of business for this city ( New Haven ) , which has never been closed from that time to the present . The annual amount of business was not inconsiderable , and the income from it , if done on a railroad , would of itself demonstrate its importance . But it was not merely in the direct trade it brought into the city  --  the very effort to construct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which displayed themselves in other directions . Nor ought we to overlook the greatness of this effort . The citizens , undismayed by one of the most disastrous bank failures which ever occurred in New England , and which swept through the city at the very time they were engaging in this enterprise , steadily carried it forward against almost insurmountable obstacles . Almost every one took part : in it , and indirectly we believe almost every one has received equivalent benefits from it , while at the same time tHere were but few who suffered materially in their fortunes . " Similar benefits are derived by a community from the projection and execution of a railroad enterprise . The very construction of the road is a great advantage to the districts through which it passes , by creating a market for produce , and affording occupation to the laborers . This revolution , in the rapidity and ease of transport , has of necessity changed the method of transacting business . The country merchant , instead of collecting a large stock by his purchases in the spring and autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus requires less capital , while his stock is more frequently turned , and thus trade is equalized , and rendered more safe and remunerative . But it is often said , that a railroad injures the business of the small towns through which it passes , and tends to concentrate trade in large centers . A measure of truth is undoubtedly included in this argument , but not that which is commonly understood by the statement , // and the same charge might be made against any improvement in the means of transportation . The construction of turnpikes in Connecticut destroyed the large produce stores in the country , by which many had accumulated wealth , since the farmers were thns enabled to carry their own produce to the largest market . The railroad accomplishes the same result , only on a larger scale , and while changing the channels of trade to the possible injury of a few , benefits the vast majority by diminishing at least one profit in the exchange of productions . Nor is it at all settled , that while a few customers may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , the decrease in their purchases is not more than compensated by the large increase in the number of those who trade and by the advantages which he himself derives from the facility of intercommunication . Another source of profit to the community is the time saved in traveling , which fairly estimated in regard to those who are carried over any railroad in the country , would probably exceed the entire income of the road . Should this seem an exaggeration to any , let the reader calculate the value to a business man of being able to go from Boston to New York in a night or an afternoon , instead of spending a week in the transit , and he will perceive the justice of the estimate . The increased safety of this mode of transport not only for goods but for persons , is another fact to be taken into account . We have no statistics which will enable us to compare the railroad with the stage coach in this respect , but the simple statement of the facts ascertained by the reports of the several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any mind of the truth . Thirty-one railroads , which have been in operation during the last year , report an aggregate of 157,389,296 passengers carried one mile , and of these nine have been killed , four of whom were intoxicated at the time , and ten injured more or less seriously , though none of them mortally . The danger to each passenger in traveling one mile on these railroads , of receiving a mortal injury , is as one to seventeen million four hundred and eightyseven thousand six hundred and ninety-nine  --  and of being injured at all as one to eight million two hundred and eighty-three thousand six hundred and forty-seven . But this is greatly lessened by the exercise of prudence , since most of these accidents have happened through the gross carelessness of the passengers themsel'ves . The directors *of the Boston and Maine *ailroad , in their report , June , 1850 , remark : " In the management of a concern of so many ramifications , the utmost care and caution will not always protect the public against accidents , occasioned by // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scarccly a man lives that is not off his guard at times , and although negligence and inattention are chargeable upoa the servants of the road sometimes , still it is believed that carelessness , thoughtlessness , or foolhardiness of passengers , or of persons traveling on the line or across the road , are the fruitful causes of injury , for which the officers of the road are often unjustly censured . And the fact is especially verified by a review of the accidents , which have occurred on the road since the time to which the last annuial report was prepared . In every case , a want of care and attention on the part of the injured , has beea the primary cause of disaster . " The employees of the road , and those attempting to cross the track , have suffered much more severely , especially when we consider their relatively small number ; twenty of those employed on the railroads are reported as having been killed or mortally wounded , and eighteen injured , while of those not connected with the roads , thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad enterprise consists in its furnishing , when successful , a convenient savings-bank for all classes . The mechanic is not only benefited in his own avocation to more than the amount of stock which he subscribes , but is induced to lay by earnings to pay for his investment , which he might otherwise have been tempted to squander . We are disposed to overlook the moral advantages which result from this enterprise , in our thirst for gain , and yet few schemes of reform are so full of promise , as this , which is regarded merely as an aid to commerce . The railroad educates a class of operatives , who are among the most useful and intelligent members of society . The mere question of profit determines the necessity of employing sober and industrious men , when the lives of hundreds and thousands are to be intrusted to their charge . The regulations of a well conducted road aid greatly in the maintenance of general order , producing respect for law , and showing its propriety . Apart from these considerations , the single fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a small patch of land , and live as cheaply and work as easily as formerly , when hiring a single room in a crowded house in the midst of a filthy cit , y , is an incalculable good , beyond all the theories of Socialism . Strange as it may appear , these facilities for moving about also benefit the community , by making the majority more contented with their homes . Nor is this merely a deduction from that principle of human nature , which induces a desire for what is difficult and declines what is easy . A few years since no young man of enterprise was satisfied to remain in the country ; but was eager to engage in the turmoil of the city , and the nation began to suffer from the centralization of the masses in the commercial marts . The railroad and the electric telegraph are // however removing this evil by enabling the farmer , not only to exchange his products readily , but also by affording him the advantages of the commercial emporium in the early receipt of the newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the busy stirring heart . The railroad makes every village on its line a suburb of the city whence it starts . The cluster of cottages nestled amid the foliage of the green monutains , is no longer a secluded spot , where every day is a Sunday , whose inhabitants have few subjects to discuss , except the gossip of the neighborhood , and the qualifications of the schoolmaster , or the defects of the minister . The rumbling train that disturbs the pastoral quiet with its short , sharp yells , leaves during its momentary pause messages from the civilized world , and the boys of the village know the votes of Congress , or the revolutions in Europe , as soon as the merchant in his counting-room . They do not therefore need to go abroad , that they may break away from dullness and inactivity , or if they go , are soon satisfied on discovering that the only change is the increase of brick and mortar . The railroad also increases the opportunity of labor in different departments at each station , and thus diminishes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem , the facilities for going away induce people to stay at home . These influences can scarcely be too highly estimated , for they affect not single individuals , but whole communities . Familiar intercourse destroys national prejudice , and thus banishes hostilitv* The cliffs may still seem pale with envy across the Straits of Dover , but the passing of an hourly ferry , and the pulsations of the electric wire beneath those waves , is fast demolishing the barrier which for cehturies insulated the inhabitants of Great Britain . Commerce creates mutual dependencies , and that which facilitates trade accomplishes more for the prevention of war , by making it unprofitable and therefore unpopular , than the diplomacy of statesmen or even a congress of non:resistants . Intercourse imparts knowledge , while the mental energy required to construct these highways for nations , educates , and invigorates , and purifies . What would be the effect on the Hindoos , of building and operating a railroad through India ? Would it not be one of the most feasible measures for upturning their ancient systems of belief , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , the railroad , by affording the opportunity of comparing the benefits of servitude and freedom , by furnishing in the Southern States employment for white laborers , , and rendering their position honorable , is doing more , in our opinion , for the removal of the curse entailed upon us , from the time of British supremacy , than the formation of political parties , or the resolu // tions of ecclesiastical bodies . Every rail laid along our mountain ridges , every steamboat wheel which disturbs our mighty streams , is adding a rivet to the union of these States , which the intrigues and bluster of neither Northern nor Southern demagogues can sever . Prophecy intimates that the extension of the Redeemer 's Kingdom is to be associated with the progress of art , and with nothing more clearly than the increased facility of traveling , as is seen in its description of millennial blessedness , and in its commands and its promises . God compels every invention to subserve His own great purpose , and lie has placed these mighty agencies in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither the Brahmin nor the IMlussulman are intrusted with this powerful enginery , not even Papacy with all its vaunting can claim to have the direction of these inventions , which are revolutionizing society . We commend to Archbishop Hughes the inspection of the table on page 417 of Lardner 's volume , where if ciphering is not beneath the attention of one who aspires to be a Cardinal , or unless the science of figures savors too much of the exercise of private judgment , he will find that in 1848 four-fifths of the railroads in the world , whether valued by length of miles , or amount of capital , were in the hands of Protestants ; and since that day this decaying sect , as he declares it , has vastly increased its supremacy in this particular . In the fullness of time , when man had been elevated by Christianity to a position which allowed him to receive the blessing , God committed these inventions to those who would employ them for His glory , and thus enabled them to cope more successfully with the tyranny of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the education and ennobling ot the individual mind , after the example of the teacher of Galilee . We are standing only at the head waters , and this revolution so mighty in our eyes , is but the trickling rill which shall swell into a torrent  --  a river-until it pours its deep current into the infinite ocean . As the apostles saw but the dawning of the gospel , so every generation of Christians has been watching the rosy tints of morning , and many centuries may pass ere it is noon-and yet we are not wrong in anticipating a more and more rapid spread of light and love . We are led to these thoughts by a glance at the projects which are already conceived and gravely discussed , and which the most prudent men believe will ere long be carried into execution . Here , is a plan of shortening the time of passage between New York and London , published by order of a state legislature , which proposes by a railroad of 850 miles , half of which is already coinpleted , // to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' time , and probably to six . We have no question but the experiment will be tried in a few years at farthest . We have moreover a proposition for immediately constructing a railroad to the Pacific Ocean , and this , called " the Boston Plan , " is but one scheme claiming superiority over others , because it can be built most rapidly . We allude to this simply to show how far-reaching are the projects which would bring Boston and San Francisco within ten days of each other . The mere mention of these projects , and their grave discussion , is enough to disclose the revolution which is now progressing on the earth . We must not forget that the railroad is but one step in the ascending staircase , on which the race are mounting , guided and cheered by heavenly voices . The resources of infinite grace and wisdom are not exhausted , and we only mark the beginning of wonders which shall co-operate with the divine purpose in the redemption of man , and the restoration of a ruined world . The procession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panting engine , a seeming realization of the dragon , fabled in the middle ages , whose breath was flame , and whose course was as a rushing tempest , always interests and quickens by its illustration of power and skill . The eye never wearies of watching a railroad train as it whirls on its appointed track , seemingly instinct with life , running in merry wantonness its matchless race unwearied , and screaming madly in the pride of its power . But when we remember that it is the product of human intelligence , and a token of the divine love , and reflect on its promise for the future , the spectacle is invested with moral grandeur , giving us courage for the conflict to-day , and prophesying of a good time to come , when creation shall rejoice in the liberty of the sons of God . " For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea . "                 @ @ @ @
