txt ART . IV. - . THE RESULTS OF MODERN MISSIONS , PERMANENT . John Fo8ter on iIi*S8wns : with an E8say on the Skepticis ? n of the Church . By JOSEPH P. THOMPSON , Pastor of the Broadway Tabernacle Church . New York : Edward H. Fletcher , 1851 . Tins work reproduces in a popular form two important publications . One is the noble discourse of John Foster on the Glory of the Age , or the Spirit of Missions , delivered thirty-three years a go , before the Baptist Missionary Society : the other is an essay on the Skepticism of the Church respecting the work of missions , by the Rev. Mr. Thompson , which appeared some years since in the Biblical Repository . The former has a kind of martial tone about it ; as we read , we seem to hear the tread of embattled and bannered hosts , as with voices of victory , they press on to the conquest of the world . There is a beauty in its expression , and a strength in its reasoning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of missions , fitted to stir the soul , and to stimulate the faith of the militant Church . The latter , the pre // liminary essay , is preparatory to the discourse , and , by its timely utterances , is adapted to do great good , while it gives completeness to the book . Skepticism in regard to the missionary work is far too common : although not always expressed , it widely lurks throughout the Church . We hail truth which is fitted to dislodge it . The days of skepticism should be over , and they must be , before the work of the world 's redemption will go forward as it ought . There is need now of faith , earnest , influential , universal faith . Without entering upon any particular analysis or review of these treatises , we propose to consider a branch of the general subject of missions intimately connected with , and naturally suggested by , what is here before us : the decline of the earlier missions and the reasons for the belief in the permanent success of modern missions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The work of missions is Christianity at work . There is nothing novel or modern in the principles which lie at the basis of our present missionary movements . They characterize the Gospel , its Founder , its Apostles , the universal Church , in the days of her purity and vigor . The Savior came forth from the Father to seek and to save the lost . The Apostles and early Christians went everywhere preaching the word . The Gospel has ever been aggre*-sive , and the watchword of its friends has been " onward . " In the face of obstacles , against the combined forces of the world and Satan , notwithstanding repulse and temporary defeat , the kingdom of the IRedeemer has advanced towards its triumph . For man 's salvation and God 's glory there has been a vast expenditure of human resources and of divine energy . The wants of the world , the degraded condition of a fallen race , the exposure of the soul to endless perdition , together with the demands of God , have ever moved the sensibilities of Christian hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts which have been made , have been crowned with a success which has infinitely rewarded them . It would be hard to measure the salvation of a single soul , by mortal toils and sacrifices . In the first ages of the Church interesting missionary labors were undertaken . Among the lost sheep of the house of Israel , the disciples of Christ labored under his personal superintendence . After his ascension the Apostles applied themselves to the fulfillment of his last command , beginning at Jerusalem . In Samaria , throughout Asia Minor , in the proud cities of Greece , at iRome , far and wide in the Eastern world , they established churches , and gathered many converts from Judaisum and Paganism . Through some centuries , the Gospel was introduced with // greater or less success into many lands , where , for a season , it maintained its foothold and accomplished its benign effects . From time to time , successful missionaries arose who bore among strange people , and distant nations , the tidings of salvation . From time to time , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished for their zeal in promoting the spread of the Gospel . During the first three centuries its triumphs were witnessed from India to Gaul , and from the shores of Britain to the confines of Ethiopia . Yet it is a melancholy fact , that over all those regions of the triumphs of the early churches , the dominion of Satan has for more than a thousand years been supreme . The lands where the Apostles proclaimed the gospel have for long centuries borne no fruits of the Apostolic labors . Deep darkness has brooded there . Long ago the light of the Cross waned before the pale glimmer of the waxing Crescent . And now in every place where Apostles toiled , and Martyrs died , there is need of Apostolic devotion and the Martyr 's faith . Nay , already , from lands where Apostles ' feet never trod , from lands which for many hundred years after their time lay enshrouded in original pagan darkness , devoted servants of Christ have gone forth and entered into their ancient labors . To the dwellers in India , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enjoyed Pentacostal seasons . Thence along the early track of the gospel , they have gone as the heralds of salvation . Where the ancient faith has long been forgotten-where the turbaned nations have bent under a degrading superstition-on the sites of Apostolic churches-they have planted anew the banners of the Cross . Syria hails again the light which gushed over her hills in the New Testament times . An American missionary , with the indomitable zeal and unfaltering faith of the great Apostle to the Gentiles , declares to the Athenians the unknown God whom they ignorantly worship . At Salonica , the Thessalonica of the New Testament , a young brother has recently fallen , in attempts to renew there " the work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope " which the Apostle commended in the Thessalonian Christians . Passing on from those first centuries we behold the same results following the efforts of succeeding times . Among the mountains of Koordistan , existed a church which as early as the fifth century , was one of the foremost in the extension of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been surpassed . Among the fierce and barbarous nations around them , the Nestorians carried the words of life . Within the confines of China , their vigilant and toiling apostles planted the // Cross . Beyond the summits of Imaus , the savage Tartars heard from their burning lips the messages of salvation . Success attended their efforts , and the influences that went forth from the fertile vales of Persia were for the healing of the nations . For centuries past , not only has the gospel been unknown where they so faithfully labored , but that church itself has fallen . Today in the vale of Oroomiah , among its clustering villages , sixteen of our own American missionaries are industriously seeking to recall that fallen church to its ancient faith . Similar has been the history of other powerful Oriental churches . The Abyssinian , the Syrian , the Armenian , the Greek and , to the west , the Roman churches have all suffered a decline and fall from a former and a purer faith : while in very many places , where in various periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have then the startling conclusion , that for about sixteen centuries , the success of the pure gospel was for the most part merely transient . The investigation of the causes of such results , opens a wide and interesting , but melancholy study for the ecclesiastical historian . The social and political state of the nations produced its effect . Within the Church , as faith and spirituality declined , corruption and formality crept in . The clear doctrines of grace were encumbered and darkened by human traditions and speculations . Religions ordinances degenerated into efficacious rites . The simplicity of the ancient worship was exchanged for a showy and ritualistic service . Spiritual ambition grew dominant , and the servants of the churches became lords over God 's heritage . At last the Church of Christ became an organized hierarchy , and connected itself with the civil power . God 's blessing was withdrawn , and the scattered churches were smitten with his curse . There is something melancholy and discouraging in these facts , and in view of them , we are led to inquire whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the missions in which we are now interested . Shall the watch-fires which we kindle on the distant and dark shores of heathenism go out in the lapse of ages ? Shall the stations which we have cherished , and which have become the centers of light and holy influence to the people among whom they are p laced , revert again to their original darkness , and shall our sacrifices and expenditures be in vain ? Are darkness and barbarism and superstition again to encroach upon the domains of Christianity , and at last blot out every vestige of the faith we hold and teach ? And where our missionaries are now teaching , shall other missionaries in a distant age be needed to teach to an ignorant and deluded people the way of life ? Or are the churches of the missions now permanently // founded , and is all that we gain from Satan and sin to be secured for Messiah ? Were there causes in the apostolic and later ages leading to the results which we have contemplated , which do not now exist ? Are missionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with increasing power and permanence , until the world shall be converted to Christ ? Is light to wax brighter and to spread abroad , until it shall mingle with light , and the globe be flooded with its radiance and glory ? From mountain-top to mountain-top , shall herald cry to herald , until the glad tidings of a world redeemed shall everywhere be heard ? It is the latter view which we are accustomed to take ; and in it we find much to cheer and nerve the soul . If the success of missions were merely temporary , the work would be worthy of far greater sacrifices and efforts than we are accustomed to make : but if it is to be enduring , then we see motives of still greater magnitude than before , to urge us onward and to lead us to spare no exertions which we may wisely make . Since the Reformation , the life of the Church has been restored , and gradually her strength has been put forth for the conversion of the world . The revival of her ancient faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionary labors . Unorganized efforts were from time to time made by different branches of the Church , until during the last century under the pressure of obligation and from love to Christ and to man , missionary movements were reduced to a complete and settled system . From this point a new order of things arises , and one which , under the controlling purposes and providences of God , seems to be destined to secure the entire evangelization of the world . Failures at particular points there may be ; reverses , which shall in the end be followed by renewed success ; the temporary abandonment of certain stations for others of more immediate promise . Nations and races , like the aborigines of this country and the islanders of the Pacific , may dwindle and decay and in the end become extinct . IBut the great work is to go forward permanently and triumphantly to its predicted , and therefore certain consummation . We proceed now to the statement of some grounds for believing that the success of modern missions will be permanent . In the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implies the permanence of their success . They have been undertaken and are conducted on a mature and comprehensive plan , which respects the continuous and increasing employment of appropriate agencies , until the world is thoroughly Christianized . There is a mutual understanding among the various branches of the Universal Church , in regard to the // 212 The Results of Modern Missions , Permanent . several fields which shall be occupied , the instrumentalities which shall be used , and the triumph which shall be gained . 113y none is the work considered a temporary work , or one which shall be abandoned with any limited success . Nothing less than the complete subjugation of THE wou*n to Messiah , is the aim and the determination of his followers . Success at any particular point is only a motive for greater efforts . Every fortress which is gained , is not only so much taken from the enemy , but it is thenceforth to be actively used for Christ : as in the storming of a city the capture of each strong point diminishes the resistance of the garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mission is instituted , a deep and strong foundation is laid for future times . Many agencies and aids which were unknown to early missions , are gathered around it . The mission families establish themselves there for life . They plant among the habitations of paganism the Christian home . Its light and beauty and order , its altar , its instruction , its songs , its sacred associations and influences and training , are all before the heathen , presenting to them an excellent model and by the striking contrast impressing them with the defects and darkness of their own unhallowed homes . There they behold the illustration of what the family should be-which they have never known by experience-where the marriage vow is fulfilled , and all that is exalted and blessed in the relation which it secures is enjoyed-where parental love , and filial affection , and fraternal union are experienced and prized . The influence which is exerted by the permanent presence of religious households , can not be fully estimated . Said the wife of one of our earliest missionaries- " It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to our Scriptures , that made an impression on the heathen , as our life our treatment of women and children , and our domestic habits , so different from theirs . " At every mission a Christian church is organized , to which the mission families belong . They are its nucleus-around which the converted pagans shall gather  --  to whom they will look for guidance and example in their new life . They will see that its ordinances are faithfully observed , that its laws are obeyed , that the spirit of Christianity is cherished , and that the life of its professors is in harmony with that spirit* The churches of the missions will not now be left , as was too often the case among the early missions , with the converted heathen alone . That may have been one great source of those divisions and troubles , which gave the Apostles so much anxiety , and which drew forth from them such strong rebukes as we find in some of the Epistles of Paul , and which eventually led on to decay and apostasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members which is powerful , which they respect , which tends to confirm them in right action and to make them worthy members of the household of faith . The gospel , too , is to be permanently preached by the missionaries themselves , or by those who are under their direct influence and personal instruction . In this way error will not be as likely to creep in , wrong customs or dangerous doctrine will not be as likely to gain a foothold . Religious institutions will grow old under the superintendence of those who are capable of conducting and perfecting them . In the early times , the Apostles could not abide with the churches which they gathered . They ordained officers for them from the converts themselves , and hastened on to do their Apostolic work . Similar was the mode of those who in after ages succeeded them . The modern system is the reverse of this . The mission at the Sandwich Islands is now thirty-one years old . Yet the latest intelligence brought us the account of the ordination of the first native preacher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct personal ministry and superintendence of educated and experienced pastors . This system contemplates the education of the heathen . It proposes , as soon as possible , to prepare them to sustain among themselves , those institutions which belong to an enlightened and religious people . By the side of the Church it plants the Seminary , and all abroad among the people it establishes schools . Here the children and youth of the people are gathered and instructed in the common branches of knowledge , and in the Word of God . Here they are carried forward from step to step in their education , with the hope that they will be converted and be prepared to become teachers and preachers of the Gospel . Here they unlearn their heathen habits and notions , are made acquainted with correct science , and are introduced to the knowledge of many things which the heathen can not know , and which prepare them for usefulness and wide influen*e . These schools and higher seminaries of learning , are a grand auxiliary of Christianity , and one of the surest means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now send forth missionaries may , in the lapse of ages , become enfeebled , they may grow indifferent to the world 's conversion . But Christianity shall live where it is thus established . Educated men shall be raised up to take the place of the missionaries as they fall , and to perpetuate among their people the ordinances of religion . The delightful and benign effects of this system of education are already seen in many places . Native teachers and preachers are now abroad among the people of the Saudwich Islands and Ceylon , in Thdia , // and among the Armenians . Already the ancient missionary spirit is somewhat revived amidst the Nestorians , and their preachers are now climbing the wild mountains and proclaiming , in those old fastnesses of the faith , the truth as it is in Jesus . This work is to go forward , until , in every land , there shall not be wanting men to proclaim to every nation and tribe , in their own tongue , the wonderful works of God . Nor is this the only effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure good homes among the heathen . In the female seminaries multitudes are trained , who are to be influential in the households of the people . As daughters and sisters , as the future mothers of the land , they , in their appropriate sphere , are to do much to secure the perpetuity of religion . Paganism degrades woman , deprives her of that sweet and potent influence which she is fitted to exert for the exaltation and virtue and happiness of any people : Christianity restores her to her proper position , and places in her hands the means of vast and efficient usefulness . Educated Christian mothers and teachers will entirely change the households of the pagan world . They will make them fountains of holiness , and moral power , as they are among us : places where the character is early formed aright : in a word , Christian homes , after the " model homes " of the mission families . This education is designed to develop individual manhood . It is a Protestant education-an education based upon the Biblean education which makes much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortal being , as one accountable supremely to God and now deciding his endless destiny . It is an education which will be felt through every order and condition of intelligent mind , cultivating private judgment , drawing out whatever there is of force and individuality in every soul , and guiding that soul onward and upward . It is an education which will affect the structure of society , demolishing its abuses , and engrafting upon it the masculine and virtuous principles of a better state . A powerful engine for securing the permanence of Christianity , which was not employed in former times , is the press . This is one of the principal bulwarks and auxiliaries of modern missions . In the early ages education and the means of education were possessed by few . Knowledge was locked up in guarded treasuries to which a select class alone were admitted . Books , as we understand the term , were unknown . The massive and costly manuscript , requiring slavish labor to be copied , was the poor equivalent . But now , in every land , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , the Word of God , in every language nuder heaven ; scattering tracts // and religious books , thick as the leaves of the forest before the autumnal blasts . It is like the Gift of Tongues . It is like an omnipresent ministry . No habitations are so remote and inaccessible-no men so poor-that these pages of life may not reach them and declare to them all that is necessary to make them wise unto salvation . The press is an agency that can not be destroyed . And as long as it does its work , Christianity can not be exterminated . It places the Bible in every man 's hand-and where the Bible is read , religion can not die . The printing-press will by degrees pass into the hands of pious men among the pagan nations , and they will never cease to employ it as an agency of defense , and a powerful battery upon the stronghold of sin . It will make the nations acquainted with the science , and literature , and religion of Christian lands . It will introduce among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which abound among us , and which tend to fortify the faith of the gTospel . In this broad and comprehensive plan of missions , we *nd strong evidence of their permanent success . The missionary now does not go forth alone . He goes with supplies for a long , and forces for a vigorous , warfare . The Apostles and early missionaries went alone : they had few aids : and when they left a particular field , it languished . There is a strong contrast between the systems of the ancient and modern missions . The former was like a lonely knight errant , striking strong blows , and performing deeds of prowess remarkable for a single arm . The latter is like a well-equipped and marshaled army , with all the munitions and ordnance of war , prepared to garrison and supply every stronghold which is captured , and to move on conquering and to conquer . Again , the connection of civilization with Christianity , and the intimate sympathy between the different portions of the Church thereby produced , tend to secure the permanence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and civilization of the world were mainly among the pagan nations . The early missionaries had therefore none of those advantages and aids which come from a superiority in science and the arts of an enlightened state . The great Apostle to the Gentiles visited the seats of ancient learning , and their sages were often his hearers . He stood up among the monuments of Corinthian skill and art ; and his voice was heard where the greatest of Athenian orators had thundered forth his world-famed philippics , and where Athenian poets had recited their rriatchless verses to the listening assemblies of Attica . The labors of the Apostles and their companions were mainly within Syria , Asia Minor , Macedonia , Greece , and Italy , the most advanced of the nations // then . lilt was a paganized civilization which prevailed , and therefore it opposed peculiar obstacles to the humbling teachings and requirements of the religion of Christ . In its place of pride , and with the assumption of superiority , it looked down with scorn upon the lowly followers of Jesus and upon all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true faith had triumphed among the people that were most advanced , it derived no such influence from its success as was fitted to make much impression upon the nations . But now , the highest civilization is the handmaid of Christianity . The most enlightened nations are Christian nations , aud mainly Protestant nations . Where Christianity goes , there go powerful agencies and auxiliaries to build it up , and to secure its permanence . Where its missions are planted , there are opened fouutains of blessings to the nations ; there are established institutions which are the glory of the lands , and which freely lavish their gifts upon the people . Around them are seen industry , and order , and the tokens of an advancing civilization . There enterprise is developed and education is enjoyed . There family government and social rights and civil liberty are germinated . There the arts are nurtured and men engage in the useful professions and callings of life . And all these things , while they are the fruits , are also the supports of Christianity . They will cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a formidable front to its foes . There is nothing in the literature , the science , the practical knowledge or the condition of the heathen , which will give them a sense of superiority to the teachers of the faith of the Gospel . Nor will they value their religion above that of Christ , when they shall have intelligently witnessed the practical effects of each , in contrast . The civilization which is connected with Christianity is its best earthly support , and its entire tendency is to perpetuate Chris* tianity where the latter shall have gained a firm foothold . By this connection an intimate sympathy is fostered which binds together the different portions of . the Church . Formerly , churches , far from one another , were almost entirely dissociated . There was but little intercourse between the different members of the body of Christ , and that only at long intervals and by great exertions . Acquaintance could scarcely be cultivated . Aid could hardly be communicated if its need was known . Missionaries journeyed on foot or in fragile sea-boats , without compass or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether unknown . But now all this is changed . Art , and science , and inventive genius have been at work , and their manifold and splendid offerings and creations are all tributary to the Church . Gigantic steamers are dashing through the waters of every sea , // bearing our missionaries to their stations . Ponderous cars are pressing across the desert , and piercing the gloom of the forest . The command has been literally obeyed , and the prophecy fulfilled : " Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make straight in the desert a highway for our God . Every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low : and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough places plain . " l3y and by shall the result appear : " And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see it together : for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it . " From land to land thought is now transmitted by the lightning . In comparison with it old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy communication , bringing the most distant places into close communion , and jnaking the whole world a neighborhood , has done much toward producing an intimate sympathy between the different portions of the Church . By it Christians from distant lands are brought together in large convocations , where they mingle their mutual sympathies , and , waiving their petty differences , unite in a common enterprise against a common foe . By it resources and recruits can easily be sent to our distant and suffering missions . By it tidings of success or calamity are rapidly borne to every portion of the Church , so that the whole body of believers is moved by a simultaneous sympathy . The system of posts and post-offices also fosters this sympathy . Mails are now transmitted by the cooperation of the different governments of the world , with the greatest possible dispatch and safety , from continent to contineilt , and to the remotest settlements of men . Every steamer that plows up the Niger toward the heart of Africa-every steamer that pierces the gloom of Asia 's dark lands-bears with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in loneliness and faith are there building up the IRedeemer 's kingdom . Wherever our self-exiled and devoted countrymen are thus laboring , they are cheered by frequent correspondence with the friends they have left behind them . This links them closely to their brethren all over the world , and animates them for their future duties . Halfenlightened lands are adopting this system of communication . It has been recently introduced into the Turkish empire . It will follow everywhere in the wake of civilization and Christianity . The Press is also increasing this sympathy . Through our Missionary Heralds and newspapers , and more elaborate volumes of history and biography , we are made acquainted with the character and works of missionaries , with the hindrances to the spread of the gospel , with the trials which must be endured , and with // the progress of the cause of Christ . This informatiou leads us to feel for our brethreu abroad . Through the same ageucy they learn what is taking place at home , and their hearts throb with every strong pulsation that moves our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missions are strengthened and their success secured . They can not fail . Auy calamity to the humblest station , sends a thrill through the entire Christian world . We have seen what this principle has accomplished throughout the Papal church : what then may it not secure , when sanctified and exalted by Christian faith and love ? There is now an Argus-eyed vigilance over every department of religious enterprise , and a Briarean labor ready for any emergency . The Church on earth is one : and its every portion is dear to the whole . Time with its discoveries and improvements shall only bind the parts more closely together . Continued enlargement shall promote enlarged interest and sympathy , until , when the world is redeemed from its bondage , a common love shall burn in every heart . Old systems of error are crumbling  --  and in this fact we may see indications of the permanence of the success of modern missions . The time was , when those systems which have most widely prevailed were vigorous and aggressive . They sent forth their apostles , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their faith . Brahmanism once had the vitality and energy necessary for its wide increase and prevalence . Buddhisin was once marked by eminent growth and extension . Its missionaries once went from land to land , over the mountainranges of the Himalaya , and beyond the waters of the Indus , in the zeal of an awakened propagandism . IMlohammedanism , relying upon carnal weapons , the fire and the sword , once forced itself upon the nations of western Asia , and became the religion of many wild and powerful people . But the days of conquest and extension for these various systems are past . Although they are still powerful , they are waning . They have become effete , and are now in their dotage . Silently and surely they are giving way before the power of truth , and the agency of divine Providence . Their deluded subjects are losing their faith in these false systems and their reverence for them . The lower forms of heathenism seem to be only awaiting a vigorous assault , before they shall fall and pass away . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide impression that the era of a better faith is at hand . Traditions have been handed down , and are now repeated and believed , which tell of the coming of another and a purer system , which shall supplant that which they have cherished for ages . Light is beaming around the IMlos // lem mind , and the turbaned nations of the East begin to feel the influence of a religion better than that of the Prophet whom they adore . We have seen the extraordinary spectacle of a people anticipating the presence of the missionaries by casting their idols to the moles and to the bats . Thus through the earth , there is a weakening of the powers of darkness and a dissolution of their accursed sway . Christianity remains aggressive . The crumbling of other systems is only the era of its more vigorous exertions . Close in the track of its retreating foes , it presses hard after , to gain what they have lost . Onward , over the wreck and ruin of Satan 's empire , it urges its way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been its aim : nothing less will satisfy its adherents . Every error must be supplanted by the living and life-giving Truth . For this have its Apostles toiled : for this have its Martyrs died : for this has the contest been hotly and unceasingly waged , as ages have rolled slowly away . Its heralds are now more widely scattered than ever before . Its conquering hosts are abroad on every battle-plain . They are piercing the old realms of night , and surrounding the strong fortresses of sin with their heavy batteries . The TForld-TnE wOliLD-is their battlecry-and it rings from land to land as , through watching and toiling , victory follows victory . The revival of religion among the ancient Oriental churches , has an important bearing in this connection . While among the heathen there is an abandonment of their ancient superstitions and delusions , among the nominal but apostate Christians of the East , there is a return to their ancient doctrine and worship . Although those churches long ago departed from the faith which was once delivered to the saints , yet God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their conversion , and to some extent they are returning to a life of vital godliness . Among the Armenian , Nestorian , and Syrian churches , there have been enjoyed powerful revivals of religion , characterized by the same wonderful effects which mark similar works among ourselves . The spirit of genuine religious inquiry seems to prevail to a considerable degree among the people , while in many cases , the ecclesiastics themselves have hopefully become the subjects of saving grace . The work , wonderful as it has already been , appears to have only just commenced . The principles of godliness are taking root broadly and deeply among those interesting people . Investigation of the principles of the gospel is increasing : spiritual anxiety is taking the place of spiritual lethargy : the quiet of the old formalism is broken up : youth in multitudes are growing up under religious training and all the // sacred influences of the gospel ; and the agencies which are adapted to the conversion and sanctification of men , are there diligently employed and brought to bear upon the multitude with cheering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those ancient churches . Causes like those which led to their decline will not be likely to prevail again , while true and active piety will be nurtured by sympathy from abroad , and by their labors at home . The time may not be distant when Nestorian missionaries shall press out into the track of their ancestors , bearing the gospel from the waters of the Caspian , to the seas of China . The Protestant Armenian church , occupying its novel and momentous position in the heart of Turkey , has too great a work before it to retrograde . As that people , " the Anglo-Saxons of the East , " shall be brought more and more under the control of the pure gospel , we may expect that God will employ them in the enlargement of his kingdom . Through all the channels of their extensive trade and commerce , whereever over the Eastern hemisphere their enterprising merchants are found , they may become the heralds of salvation to the nations . This revival , at this juncture , is auspicious of good things . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omen of the prevalence and the permanence of his kingdom . Prophecy is approaching its fulfillment  --  and in that we may read the certainty of the permanent success of modern missions . Through the dimness of ages the ancient Seers beheld the radiance of a glorious Day . The voices of Prophets declared the coining of a time , when holiness and happiness shall prevail upon earth . In anticipation of it the Psalmist 's harp was tuned to exalted numbers . For its coming , holy men have labored and prayed ; while to that day , the eye of faith , through the entire history of the Church , has been directed . The range of prophecy extends from the early periods of the world to its closing scene . In Paradise , it whispered words of hope to the saddened hearts of the fallen pair . It told of the Flood : and the Deluge came . It told of the Egyptian bondage : and under the Pharaohs , the children of Israel were rigorously oppressed . It told of the promised land : and in process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It announced the Captivity and the Dispersion : and those events came with the certainty of doomu . It announced the coming of the Messiah : and at the appointed time the world 's great Deliverer appeared . Prophecy has foretold the rise and fall of empires , the series of events in the history of the Church , and the delightful issue of the labors of the people of God . For age // after age , fulfillment has followed fulfillment , until now we are rapidly approaching the end . The prophecies seem to be centering at some point but a little before us . To that point too the providences of God seem to be rapidly bearing us . The convulsions and changes of our day , the onward movements of the nations , the overthrow of old dominions and powers of darkness , and the triumphs of the gospel , are all preparing the way of the Lord , and hastening the arrival of the world 's great Jubilee . Sure as any other predictions , are those which announce the trinmphs of the Redeemer 's kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord , and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship " before him . " And it shall come to pass in the last days , that the mountain of the Lord 's house shall be established in the top of the mountains , and shall be exalted above the hills : and all nations shall flow unto it . " " And the kingdom and dominion , and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven , shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High , whose kingdoin is an everlasting kingdom , and all dominions shall serve and obey him . " " For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord , as the waters cover the sea . " " The seventh angel shall sound : and great voices shall be heard in heaven , saying , The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ ; and he shall reign forever and ever . " If these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day draweth nigh when they shall be , then are the missions of our times the appointed agencies for bringing about the grand result . Who can doubt it ? They are the centers of light and holy influence , from which light is to spread abroad until it shall mingle with light , from which holy influences are to go forth until they shall meet with kindred influences , and the redeemed world be brought under the dominion and love of Christ . The missionaries from the north , west , and south of Africa shall meet exultingly at length at its center , and Ethiopia shall stretch forth her hand unto God . From the Nestorian hills , from India 's plains , from the guarded shores of China , the armies of Emanuel shall sweep before them the powers of darkness , until their victorious banners shall wave together in the heart of Asia . The Island Missions shall by and by lift up their voice of triumph , declaring that the abundance of the sea is converted to God .

In former ages there has been sad decline , and the work of the world 's conversion has retrograded . But under the overruling providence of Him who orders all things with infinite wisdom , that may have been only the necessary means for the wider and more glorious propagation and success of the gospel . Those events which have been witnessed in the past , may have been the preparatory acts for the final and crownin g act which is soon to happen .

Our money should be poured into the Lord 's treasury . Our time shoukl be devoted to the Lord 's work . We should be his , in our bodies and our spirits , which are his .
