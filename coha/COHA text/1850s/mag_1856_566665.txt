Chiefly taken from the Congress Debates , the Private Papers of General Jackson , and the Speeches of Ex-Senator Benton , with his Actual View of Mien and Affairs . With his Editorial notes and illustrations , and some notices of eminent deceased contemporaries . By a Senator of Thirty Years . In 2 vols . Vol . I. Appletons , 1854 . A1*n*aucAx DEMOCRACY , in its origin and true history , its principles and results , has been very inadequately exhibited thus far in literature . To a great extent the literature of this country has been too much dependent , both for its tone and its topics , upon that of another country , which has not yet learned to love American Democracy , however much it may exult in the advancement of the Americans as a people . Among our own citizens , the real Democrats have been mostly men who were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands full in contending for the application of their principles in practice , without much time to speculate upon them as a philosophical theory . And it must be confessed that the larger class of our educated men , in the professions , in literary pursuits , or in elegant leisure , have ever been too much inclined to dislike and distrust the ruling spirit of Democracy , and to cherish secret desires for the introduction of checks and // safeguards against the free application of the popular will to the control of the government . It has been well said , that all real life is a continued struggle against antagonist tendencies to decay and death . And it is as philosophical as it is lamentable , that Democracy , as the vital izing element of political freedom , confirms in its experience the universality of the dogma . In all ages it has gained nothing but by its own energy , and has preserved itself only by incessant vigilance and unshaken determination . American Democracy , as the trnest and most consistent development of this form of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its opposers , but has owed everything , under the benignant favor of an overruling Providence , to its possession of a power which could not be resisted any longer . It is a subject of just congratulation to our country and to posterity , that so true a devotee of Democratic principles as Colonel Benton , one who has shared so largely in their vindication , and witnessed so gladly the results of their application , has been spared to fulfill in part ; the most worthy design of recording , for the benefit of other generations , the thoughts and experiences of his long and honorable political life .0 thers of our statesmen have written and published books , often eloquent and learned and popular books , on political subjects ; but these have generally been of the class of men who fear and distrust Democracy , and who have borne the double disappointment , first of failing to secure the adoption of their favorite measures , and then of witnessing the wonderful advancement of the country in prosperity and glory in the face of their gloomy predictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young patriot , or the student of political science , gain from the perusal of such writings as those . Senator Benton is able to fill his book with the record of a succession of double triumphs , that his great measures have been approved by the people , and that the country has held on in a career of unprecedented prosperity under their operation . Were we instituting a comparison between the writings of two classes of practitioners in medicine , instead of practitioners in politics , there could be no doubt as to which would furnish the most useful studies-those who had been successful , or those whose methods had always failed . Nor could any elegance of style , or profoundness of speculation , or abundant display of learning , give authority to writings that had never wrought conviction , or methods that had never cured disease . Nor do men habitually resort to the lawyer who always loses his case , or the shipowner who never made a successful voyage . These considerations are sufficient to commend // Colonel Benton 's book to the profound attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American government , and the true sources of our domestic tranquillity , and of our unparalleled advancement in all that contributes to national greatness . The public life of Mr. Benton commenced with the admission of the state of Missouri to the Union , when he was chosen the first senator of the infant state , and was continued in the same office , by continued re*Aections , for the full period of thirty years . It is difficult to say which is the most strange , that a man so stiff and uncompromising should have retained the constant support of his constituents so long , or that he should lose it after so protracted and cordial a continuance . In promising a " History of the Working of the American Government " during those " Thirty Years , " he has made his title-page more comprehensive than his design , which seems to have been , not so much an actual " history , " but rather a contribution toward. * the history of his times , by presenting the course of events chiefly as they stood related to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduces the work with a succinct " Preliminary Yiew " of the war of 1812 , and the political condition of things which followed it during the intervening period , 1815-20 . He holds that the war achieved in effect its avowed and leading object , the immunity of our seamen from impressment , in fact though not in form ; so that " henceforth , we hold exemption from impressment , as we hold our independence , by right and by might , and now want the treaty acknowledgment of no nation on either point . " The great political questions which sprung up after the war , related to the national bank , protection of American industry , internal improvements by the federal government within the states , the boundaries of the treaty-making power , the right of secession of a state from the Union , the benefit of a public debt , and SLAVERY . The financial condition of the country at the opening of this history was that of general distress . Col. Benton 's description is graphic and impressive in the highest degree , and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chartered in i8l6 ; and before i820 , had performed one of its cycles of delusive and bubble prosperity , followed by actual and wide-spread calamity . The whole paper system , of which it was the head and the citadel , after a vast expansion , had suddenly collapsed , spreading desolation over the land , and carrying ruin to debtors . The years i5i9 and 20 were a period of gloom and agony . No money , either gold or silver : No paper convertible into specie : No measure or standard of value left remaining . The local banks , ( all but those of New England , ) after a brief resumption of specie payments , again sank into a state of suspension . The Bank of the United States , created as a remedy for all these evils , now at the head of the evil , prostrate and helpless , with no power left but that of sueing its debtors // 55 and selling their property , and purchasing for itself at its own nominal price . No price for property or produce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No purchaser at execution sales , but the creditor or some hoarder of money . No employment for industry , no demand for labor , no sale for the product of the farmer , no sound of the hammer , but that of the auctioneer knocking down property . Stop laws , property laws , replevin laws , stay laws , loan-office laws , the intervention of the legislature between the creditor and the debtor : this was the business of legislation in three-fourths of the states of the Union-of all , south and west of New England . No medium of exchange but depreciated paper : no change even , but little bits of foul paper , marked so many cents , and signed hy some tradesman , barber or innkeeper : exchanges deranged to the extent of fifty or one hundred per cent . DIsTREss , the universal cry of the people : RELIEF , the universal demand , thundered at the doors of all legislatures , state and federal . It was at the moment when this distress had reached its maximum , 1820-21 , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal government , that this VIEw of its working begins . It is a doleful starting point , and may furnish great matter for contrast or comparison , at its concluding period in iSSO. , pp. 5 , 6 . It is not inappropriate to this extract to place along side of it another passage , in which he briefly describes the condition of things at the close of General Jackson 's administration , the * eriod he has chosen for the termination or his first volume . is in his reply to some of the misapprehensions of INtl. de Tocqueville , put forth in his truly able work , Democracy in America . Mr. Benton says of General Jackson : He found the country in domestic distress , pecuniary distress , and the national and state legislation invoked by leading politicians , to relieve it by empirical remedies ; tariffs to relieve one part of the community by taxing the other ; internal improvements to distribute public meney ; a national bank to cure the paper money evils of which it was the author ; the public lands the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanges ; a million and a half of unavailable funds in the treasury ; a large public debt ; the public money the prey of the banks ; no gold in the country , only twenty millions of dollars in silver , and that in banks which refused , when they p leased , to pay it down in redemption of their own notes , or even to render back to depositors . Stay laws , stop laws , replevin laws , baseless paper the resource in half the states to save the debtor from his creditor ; and national bankrupt laws from Congress , and local insolvent laws in the states , the de . mand of every session . Indian tribes occupying a half or a quarter of the area of the Southern states ; and unsettled questions of wrong and insult with half the powers of Europe . Such was the state of the country when General Jackson became President ; what was it when he left the presidency ? Protection tariffs and federal internal improvement discarded ; the national bank left to expire upon its own limitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank paper , no more unavailable funds , and abundant gold and silver currency , the public debt paid off , the treasury made independent of banks , the Indian tribes removed from the states , indemnities obtained from all foreign powers for all past aggressions and for new ones committed , several treaties obtained from great powers that never would treat with us before , peace , friendship and commerce with all the world , and the measures established which , after one great conflict with the expiring Bank of the United States , and all her affiliated banks in 1887 , put an end to bank dominion in the United States , and all its train of contractions and expansions , panic and suspension , distress and empirical relief . ' pp. 112 , 113. // It is the evident and honorable design of this book , as its leading object , to set forth the working of Democracy as a system of government ; to show that the Democratic principle is dominant in our institutions , and to prove by historical induction the safety and advantage of following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great prominence to the administration of General Jackson , because it was in this that Democracy culminated , as viewed from his stand-point . And it was equally natural and proper that he should speak much of his own doings , both on account of the leading part which he bore in public affairs , and because the very thing he has undertaken was to furnish the materials for history presented with the liveliness and authenticity of personal narrative . No manly or impartial critic will complain or say that the measured exultation and self-complacency here and there breaking forth , should have been repressed under such circumstances . It must be admitted that he evinces a good degree of impartiality in narrating his own deeds ; for he says of the famous clause in the constitution of Missouri , designed to perpetuate slavery there , which threw the country into what he deems the most dangerous excitement it has ever encountered , " I was myself the instigator of that prohibition , and the cause of its being put in the constitution . " p. 8 . And he records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reduction of executive patronage , and the preservation of the integrity of Congress as essential to the purity of the government , which he supported with earnestness when the executive power was not in the hands of his political friends , but which he never urged , and appeared to have forgotten , after the power came into the hands of his own party . The ilistorical View commences with the Missouri Compromise , as it was called , of 1820 , which he shows to have been a Southern measure in its inception , supported by the vote of every Southern Senator , and a large majority of the representatives of the South . The country has fully sanctioned the principle there established , that when the people of an organized territory of the United States have arrived at that stage at which it is admitted to be competent for the formation of a state , to be admitted to the Union , on the same footing as the original states , the Democratic principle requires that the people thereof should be allowed to form their own constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of government should be republican . The power of Congress to make all needful regulations for the // territories , is to be exercised while they are territories , and requires all such wholesome legislation as will give the right stamp in infancy to the character of the embryo state . This is doubtless the statesmanlike conclusion , irrespective of the sectionalism of the question which was the immediate occasion of the struggle . This principle , however , was lost sight of in the struggle of 1850 , when the state of California was kept waiting for six months after it had formed a constitution . In narrating the course of public measures , in which he bore so conspicuous a part during the succeeding sixteen years , to the end of General Jackson 's presidency , our author takes care to show , as far as facts will warrant , how constantly the popular will is sure to triumph in our government , and to prove by the results of national advancement , how safe it is to entrust all great public questions and interests to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , he narrates the controversy concerning internal improvements by Congress , from Mr. Monroe 's veto in 1823 ; the " American System , " as the plan of congressional legislation to promote manufactures by levying heavy duties on imported goods , was called by its friends , from the first debate in 1824 , in which Mr. Webster was the leading speaker on the side of free trade ; the Disposal of the Public Lands , from the passing of the act devised by the great Secretary Crawford , to reduce the price , and require all sales to be for cash ; the National Currency question , from the first denunciation of the United States Bank , in General Jackson 's first message to Congress , in 1829 ; Nullification , from its first shadowing forth in Mr. Calhoun 's toast , at the celebration of Jefferson 's birthday in 1830 ; the Nature of our Federal Government , as exhibited in the discussion of Calhoun 's resolutions in 1832 ; the Senatorial Censure of President Jackson , with the subsequent " Expun*e ; " the Slavery Agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by resolutions , inflammatory speeches , and political manoenvering ; the Defenses of the country , including the Navy , Fortifications , and the Military Academy ; the subjects of Executive Appointments , Gold Currency , Indians , Salt Tax , French Spoliations , French Indemnity , and many others , arising in the course of one of the most trying periods of our political history . It is foreign to the purpose of this article to examine or adjudicate these topics in detail ; or even to enter into an argumentative proof of the main conclusion  --  the triumphant vindication of the stability and self-preserving power of our form of government , and the futility of all attempts to prevent the // popular will from controlling and determining the action of the government . Mr. Benton 's volume of more than seven hundred pages , in royal octavo , printed in double columns , is no larger than he thought necessary for the purpose of establishing these positions ; and certainly , no such meagre summary as we could crowd into three or our paragraphs , could be an adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest this part of the case upon the general conviction , now everywhere prevailing , in favor of this conclusion . The young men of the United States , and the students or writers of history in future times , will enjoy the advantage of having all these subjects largely elucidated , from the Democratic point of view , by the labors of the man , who above all others in our day , is best entitled to speak authoritatively concerning them , because he is to be regarded as the most farseeing , the most laborious , the most uncompromising , and the most uniformly consistent supporter of Democratic principles . We have no object in landing Colonel Benton-he has never been our favorite , and it is easy enough to detect the mistakes and inconsistencies of his history  --  and we speak thus of him only by comparison . He has done well in the service of his country according to his abilities  --  and nobly , because none has done better . Let this be his fitting epitaph-THE MOST CON5ISTENT AND FAITHFUL DEMOCRAT OF HIS TIMES . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book , we may be allowed a few remarks upon the general sub.1 ect suggested-American Democracy . It is a trite remark , that political society naturally resolves itself into two parties , Aggressives and Defensives , Progressists and Alarmists , Reformers and Conservatives , Radicals and Respectables , or , more comprehensively , Deniocracy and Aristocracy . There is not , indeed , a line drawn in society , by which these classes are separated , so that all can be known , or can even know themselves , as to their true classification . It would be a great simplification of politics , truly , if the distinction could be made so plain that every man could tell on which side of the separating line he belongs . For the want of this , we must generalize , and set forth the tendencies and biases and bearings of different matters , and leave each citizen to settle as he best may his own political associations and responsibilities . Only , it ought to be observed , that most Americans will find their position on the one side or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter that is on the tapis . There are few among us who are not reformers on some subject or other ; and there are many boastful radicals who are conservative enough upon some // question , where the change of reform would cross their prej dices or injure their interests . Wherein any man resists change simply because it is change , or refuses to look at a matter just because he never has seen it , or shriuks from a well-attested measure for no reason but that he has never tried it , he is so far forth an Anti-progressist . And wherever the same man is ready to sacrifice the old because it is inferior , and seek the new because it is better , there he appears as a Progressive ; and if the change he promotes is thorough and uncompromising , he is in this a genuine Radical . And if the matter he is engaged in is political , and if it favors the government of the people , or opposes class interests and unequal privileges , or promotes the development of individual self-reliance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Democrat . In tracing the development of American Democracy historically , we must therefore be guided by principles and not by the lives of individual men . Consistency is not the attribute of humanity . Men change their aspects and courses by changes of circumstances ; but principles are immutable , and always consistent . American Democracy requires also to be considered as the product of American society-just as the investigation of American society requires an understanding of American Democracy . Like living and breathing , which are distinct yet inseparable , each of these is to the other both cause and effect . American Democracy is the growth of the soil , and hence can never be learned from books written in other lands , or in ages that are long past . It is as unique as our history , and as superior in its qualities , as it is in the advantages under which it has obtained its existence . Like Christianity , it has a right to be judged by the purity of its theories , and the benefits it has yielded when consistently carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice it has encountered , or the violence with which it has been resisted , nor yet condemned because it has failed of producing what no other system of politics or morals has produced-perfection in its supporters . American Democracy claims to be , not the best system that imagination can conceive , but the best method of government that man can administer . And it justifies itself when it is shown to be productive of more good and less evil , than any method of government which can be brought into comparison with it . The true origin of American Democracy was on board the Mayflower , in IPlymouth Bay , where the right was exercised of originating a government by the people , to be administered // by the will of all , and for the good of all . It is not iiitended by this remark , that the principle of a government by the will of the people , here adopted , . was in the first experiments consistently carried out in all respects , nor that the will of the people was always perfectly wise or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayflower government was a true and honest adoption of the Democratic principle . It recognized no class interest , no permanent prerogative , no prolonged tenure of office . Even in its most prominent restriction , where the right of suffrage was limited to the owners of land , the violation of Democratic principles was less apparent than real , because they connected with it that other AngloSaxon idea , which has since become the distinguishing p eculiarity of our American colonization , that every man who was capable of sustaining the responsibilities of a citizen should be furnished with land . It was only after a change in the conditions of society had created numbers of landless men , that Democracy was driven to a struggle in behalf of universal suffrage . The circumstances under which Democratic government originated in this country have given to American Democracy its distinguishing features . It was a society self-formed out of the original elements , and not a substitute for a monarchical or aristocratical government thrown off . It had no pre*xistent usa*es or forms of power to mold into conformity with popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state was voluntarily created by the men , and for themselves alone . The men came to the wilderness as men , to live , or to carry out . their ideas of a life worthy of men , which included the idea of a free exercise of their religion , each one for himself . And they formed their government just to help them to live ; not as a substitute for their individual life , or as the paramount object of individual life , but as a secondary adjunct , serviceable and needful , but not paramount . Each man expected to live , of and for himself , bound only to the offices of good-neighborhood towards others ; and he only looked to the state to watch for him and keep him in safety against external war and internal crime . The idea never entered their minds of looking to the state to furnish employment , or to be a substitute for individual energy and sagacity in carving out a course of life . Commencing their social institutiops amid the hardships of the wilderness , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must sink . Their religious institutions and forms , their educational provisions , their methods of management of all public affairs , were formed with this view , that // every man was bound to learn how to take care of himself , and might therefore feel himself to be as good as his neighbors . Those who could not do this , were regarded as not competent for the high responsibilities of citizenship , and were left to subside into the condition of personal dependence upon those who could take care of them . It is a natural result of such a state of society , beginning with equality and adopting such a policy to perpetuate equality , that to this day yon may find whole school districts in the " Old Colony , " in which every boy of an entire generation grows up competent to be master of a ship . Let such Democracy be judged by its frnits . These ideas , incorporated with the first settlement , pervaded more or less perfectly all the New England colonies . Land for all , education for all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of themselves , was the original provision of American Democracy for its own self-perpetuation . And although it must be confessed that much of the specific legislation of the colonies tallies badly with our modern ideas of just laws for our modern condition of society , it is also true that the legislation of our fathers was never intentionally unjust or oppressive ; that it appears far less unequal when judged in the light of their circumstances , and that it contained in itself the seeds of all needful ameliorations , as their necessity should become manifest . The changes which have taken place , have all been voluntary and powerful , and have generally taken place on the demand of minorities , by the full and cordial assent of dominant majorities . No other governments can show such a history of voluntary reforms , nor exhibit such fruits in the production of successive generations of self-reliant men . These Mayflower principles ,  --  of which the cardinal one is , that the state is for the individual and not the individual for the state ; and that government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people only choosing their governors between one set and another ,  --  these principles had to contend with many adverse influences and changes of society in the progress of the colonies ; but they formed the dominant elements of society which all the true master-minds of the country took as the basis of their political counsels and plans . They pervaded all the colonies . Tn every one of them there occurred controversies and struggles in which parties were driven back to these first principles for a standing-ground . Duane and Clinton , Jay and Hamilton , in New or ; Franklin and Read , Dickinson and Rodney , in Pennsylvania ; Jefferson , Wythe , and Patrick Henry , in Virginia ; all the real leaders of the revolution out // of New England , were as fully grounded in these principles as Putnam and Trumbull in Connecticut , or Hawley , Quincy and the Adamses in Massachusetts . The opening paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence are the instant and spontaneous utterance of a community to which these principles were so natural as to be almost unthought . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , those men talked forth the principles of American Democracy , while hardly conscious of the breadth and scope of their utterance . No man can study the history of the Declaration of Independence , its antecedents and its consequences , especially comparing the character and positions of those who urged it onward and of those who cautiously held back from its adoption , and then observing the manner of its reception among the people , without becoming impressed with the conviction that it was a genuine emanation of the popular will . Patrick Henry and Samuel Adums were not demagogues leading the people blindfold , but were sagacious students of the people , or rather , they were themselves sympathizing members of the popular mass , who knew the people 's will by the instinct of their own . Thousands of patriotic citizens supported the re volution after it was begun , whose cautious apprehensions of consequences , or their conscientious reverence for constituted authority , prevented them from taking a forward part in its incipient stages . And thousands of others , who never convinced themselves either of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held their peace when they found they were overruled , and so acquiesced in what they could not help , comforting themselves with the hope that , after a while , they might again obtain a government almost as good as that which they had lost . The revolution was accomplished ; the will of the people triumphed ; the principle was established that government derived its just authority from the consent of the governed , who must be their own judges in the last resort , both as to the kind of government they would establish , and as to the degree and continuance of mal-admmnistration which would make it , in any given case , " the right and duty of the people to change that government " by an original and extra-constitutional movement , or a revolution . The right of revolution , by the people , for just canse , is therefore a cardinal doctrine of American Democracy . But now that the new republic has been admitted to a place among the family of nations , it must meet the responsibilities of its position , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does not concern other nations , what the form may be ; but a government de facto must be presented and maintained . Hence the Convention of 1787 , the delegates of the states specially and solemnly appointed to devise a proper form of government tbr the United States . Those who have contemplated the condition of the country at that juncture , will be impressed with the great change in the tone of the public mind . At the revolution , men risked everything , and had prepared themselves to abide the issue , even should it bring them to the rebel 's scaffold . No one of them took up arms , or furnished supplies , or shared in the councils of the Colonies , without the full consciousness that such might be his doom , if the revolution failed . But now that they have succeeded , and have secured this fine country , with all its advantages and all its promise , the precious value of all that they have saved and won rises before their minds , and they become chiefly anxious to conserve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each man 's separate interest fills his thoughts . Calculation , caution , and anxious care , take the place of daring courage and self-sacrificing public spirit . The Declaration of Independence was the child of courage and Patriotism ; the Constitution was the child of Caution and Fear . The body of the people knew very well how to fight for their liberties ; they were not so sure that they knew all about administering the complicated details of government in a manner worthy of the character of a great nation , which they expected to be . They therefore deferred to the men of learning and wisdom , who understood history , and possessed the knowledge of books . The people made the revo1 ution , and the sages made the government . The great wonder is , that the first was so wise , and that the second was so popular . But each has its idiosyiicrasy , which must be kept in view if we would understand its operations . The animu8 of the Constitution is seen in the arguments of its defenders . Their greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government was stable , and safe from the fluctuations of the popular will . In other words , the framers of the constitution thought it important to interpose " checks and balances , " as they deliberately phrased it , but in plainer terms , obstructions to prevent the popular will from acting too directly on the government . In the then state of public opinion and of political philosophy in the world , it seemed necessary to be able to assure other countries that there was something in the government besides the will of the people , some mysterious quality or power , on which the world might rely to // give stability to our institutions and binding force to our treaties . The importance attached to this quality , and the prominence given to it in the defenses of the new constitution , gave the name of Federalists to that class of citizens who were then in the ascendant . Those whose jealousy was excited by the eagerness of this advocacy , and who were willing even to reject the Constitution rather than run the risk of establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's will , took the name of Republicans-even they not daring to take the dreaded name of Democrats . The result has proved that both were wrong in a degree ; the Federalists found that their strong government was obliged to be Democratically administered ; and the Republicans found that a little patience and perseverance would enable them to carry out the popular will through the forms of the constitution , far better than they could hope to do by a revolution-that intelligent votes are better than barricades . The constitution of 1787 , was undoubtedly the wisest frame of government ever devised by man ; and the government then established has undergone less change in the succeeding sixtyseven years , than any other then upon the earth . Its *visdom and its success entitle it to be thoroughly studied by those who love to look into the causes of the events in history . Its practical working has taught lessons which were unknown either to its framers or their opponents . The best possible attestation to the soundness of its theory is the constancy and smoothness of its movement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they shielded , and therefore have fitted easily ; but ours was devised and framed entire , by the wisdom of its authors , and yet has proved itself to be admirably adapted to the spirit of the people . No plan of government was ever devised by men , so fitted for the people it was desigmied for , as to be accepted voluntarily without force or fraud , and kept in operation so long without even a plot against it . And yet it was not perfect . Its framers did not pretend to consider it perfect , and therefore they added a provision by which it could be amended-through the ordinary operation of political action . Doubtless , this open door for amendments has been the chiet reason why so few amendments have been proposed . Colonel Benton has shown that most of the amendments already made were rendered necessary to remove the obstacles which the Constitution had interposed against the too direct control of the people 's will . One of the most important was the change in the mode of election of the President of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each state // was thought to be an admirable devise , to soften our too intense democracy . Says our author , " The opinion prevailed in the convention , that the mass of the people would not be sufficiently informed , discreet , and temperate , to exercise with advantage so great a privilege as that of choosing the chief magistrate of a great republic . " p. 27 . And therefore electors were interposed , who , in theory , vote for the men they themselves think most proper to be chosen . But , practically , the electors have always voted according to the known will of their constituents . The only attempts to defeat the known will of the people , or a majority , have been when the election has gone into the House of Representatives  --  the necessities of the case bringing this trust into the hands of representatives who were chosen one whole year . and mostly two years , before the presidential election , and who therefore represent the will of the past , and not that of the present . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been intended first of all to give the election to the people , acting by states . By conceding to the state legislatures the entire power to regulate the mode of election , even to the extent of assuming to the legislatures themselves the appointment of the entire board of electors for their several states , it has recognized the principle that no regard is to be paid to minorities in sections of states . The choice of electors by districts would have the effect of dividing the political power of the state , and even of neutralizing it . Under circumstances easily supposable , it would carry the weight of a state into the scale opposite to the choice of a majority-as on the supposition of one party having large majorities in a few districts , which might be overborne by the representatives of a greater number of districts chosen by small majorities. * This evil is enhanced where there are three or more parties in the field , and where the election is determined by a plurality , as it is in most of the states . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given by the smallest party , carrying the districts most evenly divided.t The judgment of the people in all the * Suppose a state entitled to five electors , each representing a district of 10,000 voters , making 50,000 in all , with only two presidential candidates in the field . The party having a minority in the state might be so distributed as to allow the majority to choose only two electors , giving each a majority of 2000 . This would take 12,000 votes , while the minority might elect their candidates in three districts by majorities of only two hundred each , requiring but i6,300 votes , which with their minority of 8,000 in the other two districts would make only 23,300 to outweigh the 26,700 votes of the majority . The states will never consent to put their political power at such a hazard . f Suppose such a state as above , having 50,000 voters , divided into three parties , A .. , B. and C. , in the proportion of iS , 000 , 1 ' 1,000 , and 15,000 , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vote of each state cast as a unit , by having the whole number of electors chosen on one ticket . Thus far , then , we have carried out the original idea , that the president is to be chosen by the votes of the people , reckoned by states and not by districts . But the interposition of a Board of Electors has had an effect entirely contrary to the intention , of the framers of the constitution . Instead of retaining the direction of the choice in the hands of the wisest and best men , as the theory was , it has passed it into the hands of the most ambitious and unscrupulous , by the occasion it has furnished for introducing the political machinery of caucuses and national nominating conventions . There was no national caucus or convention required to nominate Jefferson , or Jackson . The congressional caucus was introduced as the iueans of prolonging the party rule organized under the first . And when congressional caucuses had become effete and fallen into contempt , the lan of national nominating conventions was devised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme also seems to be about performing its functions for the last time , and will probably be laid aside after the present year . If , for no other reason , it will be banished as soon as the fact becomes palpable , that its use is to defeat and not to effectuate the will of a majority of the people . The present aspect of affairs greatly resembles the state of things which preceded the election of 1824 , and which broke down the power of the congressional caucus . Colonel Benton 's description of the caucus system , and of the convention plan which succeeded it , is so clear , and so earnestly appropriate at this time , that we copy it entire : The presidential election of 1824 is remarkable under another aspect , as having put an end to the practice of caucus nominations for the presidency by members of Congress . This mode of concentrating public opinion began to be practiced , as the eminent men of the revolution , to whom public opinion awarded a preference , were passing away , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was tried several times with success and general approbation ; public sentiment having been followed and not led by the caucus . It was attempted in 1824 , and failed , the friends of Mr. Crawford only attending ; others not attending , not from any repugnance to the practice , as their previous conduct had shown , but because it was known that Mr. Crawford had the largest number of friends in Congress , and would assuredly receive the nomination . All the rest therefore refused to go into it ; all joined in opposing the caucus candidate , as Mr. Crawford was choosefive electors by a plurality vote . In such a case , it is easily practicable for the smallest of the three parties . to carry three of the electors , and thus wield the power of the state , by giving 3,400 votes in those districts , while the other two parties are defeated by having 3,300 votes each . The elections in the state of New York were carried both in 1864 and 1865 , by pluralities of this size-  --  a bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called ; all united in painting the intrigue and corruption of these caucus nominations , and the assembly of members of Congress joining in them . By their joint efforts they succeeded , and justly , in the fact , though not in the motive , in rendering these congress caucus nominations odious to the people , and broke them down . They were dropped and a different mode of concentrating public opinion was adopted-that of party nominations of delegates from the states . This worked well at first ; the will of the people being strictly obeyed by the delegates , and the majority making the nomination . But it quickly degenerated , and became obnoxious to all the objections to Congress caucus nominations , and many others besides . Members of Congress still attended them , either as delegates or as lobby managers . Persons attended as delegates who had no constituency . Delegates attended upon equivocal appointments . Double sets of delegates sometimes came from the states , and either were admitted or repulsed , as suited the views of the majority . Proxies were invented . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for office , and voted accordingly . The two-thirds rule was invented , to enable the minority to control the majority , and the whole thing became anomalous and irresponsible , and subversive of the will of the people , leaving them no more control over the nomination , than the subjects of kings have over the birth of the child which is born to rule over them . King caucus is as potent as any other king in this respect ; for , whoever gets the nomination , no matter how effected , becomes the candidate of the party , from the necessity of union against the opposite party , and from the indispGsition of the great states to go into the House of Representatives to be balanced by the small ones . This is the mode of making presidents practiced by both parties now . It is the virtual election And thus the election of the President and Vice President of the United States has passed , not only from the college of electors , to which the constitution confided it , and from the people , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House of Representatives , which the constitution provided as ultimate arbiter , but has gone to an anomalous , irresponsible body , unknown to law or constitution , unknown to the early ages of our government , and of which a large portion of the members comprising it , and a much larger proportion of interlopers attending it , have no other view , either in attending , or in promoting the nomination of any particular man , than to get one elected who will enable them to eat out of the public crib , who will give them a key to the public crib. ' p. 49 . It would be too severe an impeachment of the capacity of the American people for self-government , to believe that such a state of things can be permanent . It is doubtful whether the public mind is quite prepared to determine at once upon the most practicable remedy . Colonel Il3enton 's plan , which was originally proposed by Mr. McDuffle in 1823 , and again by Colonel 3enton in 1826 , gives the election to the direct vote of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by states . The states were to be divided into equal districts , corresponding to the electors they were severally entitled to , and the person having the greatest number ( plurality ) of votes in any district , counted one vote for president , and the person having a clear majority of the whole number of districts , to be declared chosen . And in case of a failure to elect by a majority , a second election was to be held immediately by the people , to choose between the two highest candidates . The first election was to be held in August , re // quiring Congress to be in session in October , for the purpose of counting and declaring the votes , so as to allow the second election , if necessary , to be held in December . It is obvious that this method would be greatly simplified , and would therefore be more sure to respond in every instance to the actual will of the people , by retaining the original principle of the constitution , that the people should be reckoned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaving the apportionment of political power unaltered , although it interferes in a great degree with the rule of the majority , by giving to the small states an advantage in the two senatorial electors , it might be safely left to the several state legislatures to prescribe the method in which their own proportion of votes should be determined , the result being properly certified to Congress . And in case no person should have a majority of these state suifrages , then let the House of IRepresentatives , voting as they do at present , choose between the three highest candidates . We are of opinion that the practical working of this mode of election would be farther improved by the restoration of the original principle of the constitution , which required both president and vice president to be voted for on one ticket , without distinguishing between them . This arrangement was incongruous with the election by a college of electors , but it would be perfectly harmonious with the election by direct vote of the people . Let every man give his vote for two candidates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same state with him . self . Then the person having the highest number of votes in a state shall receive the electoral suffrage of that state , for president , and the person having the next highest , shall have the suffrage for vice president . It is hardly within the compass of possibility that the direct votes of the people should be given under so rigid a discipline of party , as will produce a tie like that between Jefferson and Burr in 1800 . One of the benefits of this return to the good old ways of our fathers would be the restoration of the vice presidency to its proper rank , by securing , in every case , the election of a man for the second office , whom a majority , or at least a very large proportion of his fellow citizens , were willing to aid in elevating to the highest place . This would lessen the probability of a failure of the l ) eople to elect . And in case of such an occurrence , it might be left to the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president , and then to the Senate to choose one of the two remaining for vice president . // It is a popular error which the politicians have industriously propagated as a means of holding the mass of the people in blind allegiance to their party arrangements , to suppose that the election of a president b the ouse of Representatives , voting by states , is a prodigiously great evil , or fraught with special danger to our frame of government . We have tried it twice , and it gave us such men for president as Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams . In the first case , the House carried into effect the known will of the people , and established a dynasty that ruled for a quarter of a century . In the other case , either the House made a mistake as to the will of the people , or else the political blunder in organizing the new administration changed the popular current ; either way , the error was easily retrieved at the next election . An election by the House creates the greatest possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempest in that teapot , which subsides the moment the choice is effected-all parties agreeing in the result of the constitution . But whatever amount of evil may be apprehended from an election by the House , it is far less injurious than the present system , with its corrupt conventions , and its automaton colleges of electors . At any rate , we agree with Colonel Benton in the opinion that it will be no easy matter to effect a constitutional change in the mode of election . Time will be required , and discussions , and probably a protracted popular agitation , by patriotic and resolute men who can not be disheartened by temporary defeats . The constitution has made itself amendable , throughout its whole structure . There is not a provision in it so sacred but that it may be forced to yield in time to the will and wants of the people . But the method of effecting any change is slow and difficult-many will think too difficult to comport with the proper supremacy of the people 's will in a republican government . Be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either by carrying the proposed reform through Congress , with a two-thirds vote in beth Houses , and the ratifying of it by three-fourths of the states , or else it must begin in the state legislatures , which seems the more hopeful process , although hitherto wholly untried . Says Colonel Benton : Select bodies are not the places for popular reforms . The reforms are for the benefit of the people , and should begin with the people ; and the constitution itself sensible of that necessity in this very case , has very wieely made provision for the popular initiation of constitutional amendments . The fifth article of that instrument gives the power of beginning the reform of itself to the states , in their legislatures , as well as to the federal government in its Congress : and there is the place to begin , and before the people themselves in their elections to the General Aseembly . And there should be no despair on account of the // failures already suffered . No great reform is carried suddenly . It requires years of persevering exertion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great popular reformation ; but because it is difficult , it is not impossible . The greatest reform ever effected by peaceful means , * * that of the parliamentary reform of Great Britain , * * * was effected but by forty years of continued exertion. ' p. 79 . Our national experience points to an election in the house as a political crisis , which the national constitution is able to pass through in safety , and which is likely to be followed by changes durably beneficial . This consideration is peculiarly consolatory at the present juncture , when it appears inevitable that we are to have a triangular campaign for the presidency , with a very great degree of probability that ' neither of the three parties will be able to carry a majority of electoral votes . In that case the choice of a president will devolve upon the present House of Representatives , a majority of whom were chosen in 1854 , and who are themselves divided into three parties , too well balanced for either to be able to organize the body or to guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were four parties , so divided that the choice between the two highest candidates , Adams and Jackson , was determined by the frieuds of the fourth party , who was not a candidate before the House . No such expedient will be available next winter , to mitigate the fierceness of the struggle . It will be a severer trial of the timbers of our ship of state than either of the preceding , and we may hope that , if happily surmounted , it will yield still more benficial results in the end . It is all too late to look now for any preventive of an election by the House at the pending struggle , except by means of such an arrangement as will be likely to concentrate the votes of the three great states , New York , Pennsylvania and Ohio , upon one candidate , who shall also be able to unite the suifrages of most of the other free states . Let the right man be presented in the most unobjectionable way , and it will be easily practicable for the people to elect him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election is carried into the House of Representatives , then one of two results is likely to follow . Either the House will elect the right man , or the people will be sure to choose him at the next election . And four years is but a short period in the history of a nation whose growth and power are as stable as ours . The history of our government shows that the American Democracy may be relied on to establish reform , whenever the abuse becomes palpable and important enough to demand the uprising of the people . The masses have no interest but in good government and npright administration . At the same time , they are not disposed to unreasonable distrust or severity // towards those whom they have elevated to power . But it has been fully proved , that whenever the people see . cause to believe that an administration or a party is corruptly employing the patronage of the government to buy up political support , the public indignation is sure to visit such party . John Quincy Adams used to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration *ad to carry . The people of the United States have too much independence and selfrespect to acquiesce in any policy through which they are to be bought and sold with their own money . Neither can any clique or interest , of any kind , maintain a permanent control of our government over the heads of the people . The rule of democracy is , that the majority shall govern ; but if those who are chosen by the majority corruptly disregard the rights of the minority , so widely does the sense of right prevail , that a change is sure to follow at no distant day . The greatest danger is , that by political management and contrivance , the power of controlling the government may be kept out of reach of the people . The very last political movement in the country , the elections of 1854 and 1855 , teach us abundantly , that the sure and safe remedy for abuses is a direct appeal to the people , and nothing more . It is better to wait for reforms , until the people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political evils by withdrawing the government from the control of the people . And we see that , when the people were made to see the evidence of a design on the part of a foreign priesthood to exert an undue control over the measures of government , party adhesions that have lasted for a whole generation were forgotten , and a general rally of the people warns the foreign party to keep their places . What has been done now , can be done again , and will be sure to be done again , whenever the occasion shall become palpable , if the responsibility is left upon the people alone . The price of liberty is eternal vigilance , and the people will watch against wrong , if they are made to feel that they themselves are to keep watch , and no others are to watch for them . But it will be a sad day for democracy , if bigoted alarmists are allowed to seize upon the opportunity , and trample down the great demob cratic principle , that the government of a state belbugs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to a favored class , by whatever mark or accident distinguished . It used to be the burden of the old Federalists , that our government would not last , because it had so little influence with the people . The only point of direct contact it had with the people was through the post office , and the postmasters were // then only two or three thousand , scattered all over the country . We have lived to see , once and again , that the government has quite power enough ; that the greatest danger is of too great centralization , leading to the certain abuse of power ; until now there is a wide-spread conviction that the influence of the federal government has increased , is increasing , and ought to be diminished . The true method of checking the evil is by increasing the rigor and directness of the control of the people . All other remedies savor of quackery , and are unsuited to the genius of our institutions . The wide extent of our confederacy , and the diversity and even antagonism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guaranty against the undue centralization of power to the destruction of liberty . And this is just , to a certain extent . But it is evident that time is constantly producing a greater assimilation of character , and rendering us more and more national in our feelings . Increase of intercourse and trade is also continually advancing a unity of interest among all sections , each sharing in the benefits of all , as in a village . The state sovereignties are the proper stronghold of democracy . In these and in the local municipalities the people are trained and exercised in self-government . The power of self-preservation for democracy lies here , and can only be kept up by constant exercise . It is the business of the general government to keep its place , and not encroach . It is the business of the people and the states to take are that it keeps its place , and to resist its encroachments-even to revolution . And the states are already in danger of being overborne by the national government . The mere fact that there are states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or constitutional compact , will not secure our liberties . There must be a constant and intelligent surveillance maintained by the people against encroachments . The life of democracy is a perpetual antagonism against the elements of despotism , as the life of man is a perpetual antagonism against the elements of death . He is the true patriot , who fosters jealousy , not he who hushes our fears , by cries of All 's well . Yhere is no greater danger than in fulsome laudations of our frame of government , as though any paper constitution could do the work which belongs to a living and thinking and self-reliant democracy . The continued exercise of the power of self-government is indeed the life of democracy , which decays and dies as it rests upon anything out of itself for its preservation . That we have in the United States a people truly capable of such a democracy , is to be ascribed primarily to the wide diP // fusion of political intelligence . The member of Congress who boasted that there was no newspaper published in his district , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituents , could be no democrat , whatever were his pretensions , for he had no reliance on the intelligent self-will of the people to control public affairs . The general prevalence of that elevated morality which establishes mutual confidence among men is equally essential to democracy . He who maintains that all men are alike false and untrustful , may be a good witness to prove that the one he best knows is such ; but he can never be a good democrat , because he neither inspires nor exercises confidence . He who reposes a blind trust in a class , while filled with fear and distrust towards the whole people , is equally unqualified to be a democrat . Men who are honest and sincere can always find others who are so ; and they had rather be deceived in a few , than to put confidence in none . But the grand distinguishing peculiarity of American Democracy , which inspires the highest hopes for its success and perpetuity , is in the homage which it pays to man as an individual , and the limited importance which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-being . This feature of our institutic , ns was stamped upon the colonies in their earliest days , and has thus far proved indelible . Government can , indeed , do many things , for good or evil , bearing upon the general prosperity and the welfare of individuals . But the general conviction is that every man should rely mainly on his own resources for the support of his life and the security of his happiness . When democracy won its transient triumph in France , its first demand was for the establishment of public workshops at the expense of the state , in which able-bodied citizens could earn their bread . Thus the people were taxed exorbitantly to maintain a costly and cumbersome and corrupting system of public employments , instead of cutting down the expenses of the government and lightening the burden of taxation . Had Lamartine and his fellow-patriots at once thrown off the unjust public debt , reduced the taxes to the lowest point , given the utmost freedom to all trade and industry , and then taught the eoleto rely on themselves for support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine has always been , that it is the part of every man to contrive for himself , as well as to work for his bread . One man has no more right to be supported by the rest , than another has to govern the rest . The doctrine of equal rights cuts both ways . He who is poor through inertia of mind , has himself to blame for his lot , as much as he who is // poor through indolence of body . Man should think as well as work . Democracy is for those who govern themselves as mdividuals* and who are therefore qualified to bear their part in the government of the whole . It has no place and it makes no provision for those who will not breast themselves to their proper responsibilities as men , in order to perform their duties as citizens . Those who by neglect or a bad education are unfit to take care of themselves , are left either to the care of private benevolence , or to complete their education in the hard school of stern necessity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way . that is not intended to encourage idleness or unthrift . The maintenance of this spirit is to preserve our free institutions . It is only self-governed men that can make a selfgoverned state . It is true , the growth of large cities and the influx of a laboring population from other countries , who were not trained under such influences , may render some measures of imperative necessity , which are in conflict with the genius of our institutions . But such things should be regarded as exceptional , and always kept within the narrowest limits . Better do too little than too much , governmentally , in superseding the necessity of individual self-reliance . And for the rest , the most effective training for the safe enjoyment of liberty is the exercise of liberty . Indeed , men learn to be freemen , as boys learn to swim , by doing the thing they would learn . And the best Americanization of a foreigner is teaching him to take care of himself without wronging his neighbor . To form such a people , in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task and the destiny of American Democracy . The newspapers inform us that the indefatigable author of the work under review , undaunted by the loss of his manuscripts and materials in the burning of his house , is hastening to the completion of his second volume , which , if we review it , will carry us over the ground of more recent political phenomena , and lead us into some further details of criticism on particular measures and results .
