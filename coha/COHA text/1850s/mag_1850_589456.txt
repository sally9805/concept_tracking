Political Portraits with Pen and Pencil . October ; POLITICAL PORTRAITS WITH PEN AND PENCIL . ROBERT RANTOUL , JR. , OF MASSACHUSETTS . As there are tares to be found in the best fields of wheat , so are there drawbacks to the best of political systems  --  to our own as well as to those of other countries . Among these , is that regulation by which a state can be rcpresentcd in the national legislature only by one of its own citizens ; whereby , if there chance to be a dearth of able men in one state , and an abundance of them in the one that adjoins it , no advantage can arise to the community from the existence of such men , because they happened to have their birth in Massachusetts or Rhode Island , rather than in some other member of the confederacy . We are not pleading for a change in our system , but merely mentioning a fact , for the purpose of showing that the excellent form of government we enjoy is attained at the expense of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand higher than it does , for intellect , were it permissible for the people to select their representatives from the whole country . No one cause has had so much to do with giving to the Parliament of England that mighty name which it has among the nations , as the extreme latitude enjoyed by the constituencies in selecting their members . It naturally tended to the return of eminent men to the Commons ' House , and made the Chapel of St. Stephana an intellectual gladiatorial arena , in which great men discussed great principles and decided the fate of great questions . It enabled the first of Irishmen to represent an English trading town ; and , when the illiberal prejudices of men who could not rise above the narrow commercial feelings of their age led him to cease to be worthy to sit as one of the members for Bristol , it also enabled him to be once more the nominee of a liberal and enlightened statesman , whose opinions were more advanced than those of people who had more to hope for the establishment of radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be returned from a Scotch town , when , through the mendacity of faction , his return from Westminster was delayed . It requires all the undoubted and most important advantages that have flowed from our system , to prevent us from regretting that a state of things which gave to England the use of such minds as were possessed by Fox and Burke , has no existence among ourselves . * F'ox. when his return for Wenminster , at the election that followed the dissolution of the Coalition Parliament , was prevented by a sort of " broad seal " swindle , was , nevertheless , enabled to secure a seat in the succeeding Parliament . Through the influence of Sir Thomas Dundas , he was chosen one of the Scotch representatives , for an association of burThs among which was Kirkwall , in the Orkneys ; which gave occa-a to his rival , Pitt , to reproach him with haviu* been banished to the extremity of 5100 a civilization , the Ultima Thule of ancient geography . When Burke had offended the citizens of Bristol by his liberal course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their members , and was returned again for the borough of Malton , under the influence of the Marquis of Rockiugham , the noblest of aristocrats , and , like Burke himself a warm and consistent friend of America . // The Democratic party , in some few of our states , is placed in a most unfavorable position , its members being cut off ; not merely from all hope of political elevation , but also from social consideration . This observation holds good , in a very especial manner , of the ancient Commonwealth of Massachusetts . In what are commonly called " old party times , " the Democratic party often were in the ascendant in Massachusetts ; but since the re-organization of the national democracy , after the elevation of the late Mr. John Q. Adams to the Presidential Chair , with the exception of one or two worse than barren victories , it has not been the fortune of that party to have its career cheered by a solitary gleam of that success , without the occurrence of which , to some extent , all effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the Massachusetts democracy have among their number as many men of ability as can he found in any other member of this Union , yet their voice is never heard in the national councils , and has almost ceased to be of consequence even in the legislative halls of their own state . In fact , so far as talent goes , the democracy of Massachusetts are at this time , notwithstanding their depressed condition , more favorably situated than are their old opponents . The names of Banks , Boutwell , Cushing , Greene , Hallett , Henshaw , Knowlton , Merrick , Rantoul , and a host of others , have become well known to the country , though their bearers have , in most cases , never filled any of those stations which have the effect of bringing prominently before the nation the names , and acts , and characters of those by whom they are occupied . Not the least of the gentlemen named is he of whose career we now propose to give a sketch . ROBERT RANTO CL , Ju. , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts , where he was born on the 13th of August , 1805 . He is , unlike most of our public men , of pure Celtic origin , and traces his ancestry back to Scotland in the sixteenth century wI was Minister of the High Church of Elgin , and David Rantoul one of the boldest of the followers of the Scotch Calvin , John Knox . The name is derived from the two Gaelic words ? hynn and Tuyl , which mean Mountain cavern . Mr. RANTOUL early commenced preparing for a university education , at Phillips ' Academy , in Andover . He entered Harvard University at the age of eighteen , and was graduated at the Commencement of 182t3 , when he had just completed his majority . Among other evidences of his high collegiate standing , is the fact of his having delivered the Valedictory Poem to his class-mates . Having resolved to enter the legal profession , Mr. RANTOUL became a student of law in the office of Mr. John Pickering , a gentleman of great learning , not only as a lawyer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too often neglected - by legal gentlemen . It is probable that his early association with a gentleman so remarkable for the extent , and depth , and various character of his acquirements , was one cause of the great range that he has taken in his own studies . Mr. Pickering having removed to Boston , Mr. RANTOIJL continued his studies in the office of Mr. Leverett Saltonstall , a lawyer of high repute , and for several years a member of the United States House of Representatives from the Essex South District . lie was admitted to the bar in 1829 . In 1833 Mr. RANTOUT. became a resident of the town of Gloucester , which he was afterwards to usefully represent in the State Legislature . He accepted the invitation of the Mechanics ' Association to deliver an // oration before them on the Fourth of July , being the first of that series of brilliant public discourses which he has delivered , at intervals , during the last seventeen years , and which have won for him so high a place among the first orators of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of Europe during the forty years and upwards that had elapsed since the commencement of the first French Revolution ; and it is one of the most eloquent productions of the kind that is known to us . It is too often the case with American writers on European politics , that they deem it necessary to heap maledictions on the heads of prominent liberals of the Old World , because the latter have not seen everything from a peculiar point of view ; a point , we may add , that nothing short of a miracle could have enabled them to take . Into this error Mr. RANTOUL did not fall . In an especial manner did he do justice to Napcleon , looking upon him as a great man , but necessarily under the control and guidance of circumstances . His observations on the closing period of Napoleon 's career are very fine . " The greatest Captain of the age , " he says , " when he found it impossible to reach the common asylum of the unfortunate in this home of liberty , threw himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barren volcanic rock of the Atlantic , swept by the perpetual trade winds , and alternately drenched by torrents of rain , or scorched by the fierce rays of the tropical sun . On this inhospitable isle he lingered out the sad remnant of his days ; and that he preserved to the last his characteristic traits , is witnessed by the fact , that in the hour of his dissolution the dress of his battles covered him ; the field-bed of Austerlitz supported his sinking frame ; and the sword of Marengo lay beneath his pillow . lie is now resting in the bosom of that rock of the ocean ; the stone of his prison-palace is laid over his ashes ; the Roman cement covers him who tamed the Roman eagle . His fame will flourish in perennial youth , and like the Phomix , rise freshly from his tomb as often as successive revolutions shall convulse the world . " The orator 's view of the Revolution of July was also a just one , and his observations on the results of that event were marked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " it may be pronounced , that this experiment is conclusive of the fact , that either branch of the House of Bourbon is equally incapable of ruling an enlightened nation in a liberal spirit : and although we can not expect such an event immediately , still we are waiting for the occurrence of another more effectual revolution , to be accomplished by moral means , and to finish the work of the last . " This was said in less than three years after the overthrow of Charles X. , and while much was yet hoped from Louis Philippe . Recent events have clearly demonstrated the prophetic accuracy of another remark : " Austria , " he says , " is the hammer with which Russia rivets the fetters of Europe . That these two powers could not exert a deadening influence on the liberal spirit of the continent , nor exclude it from their own dominions , if the military element did not enter largely into the constitution of their governments , is too obvious for proof . " The manner in which Russia has lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy is literally correct . She acted for Austria nominally , for herself really , in the recent intervention against the Hungarians . She wished to preserve the military government of the house of Hapsburgh-Lorraine , as far as it could be preserved from destruction , for her own future purposes . Her masses of troops pre // vented the dissolution of the Austrian monarchy , and taught , to the conservative party throughout Europe , that she alone is equal to maintaining things as they are-that her barbarian legions are the revolution-quellers of Christendom . Austria is now only a place of arms to Russia , from which she can look out upon Southern and Western Europe , and prepare the way for the establishment of her power in the old homes of civilization and the arts . Mr. RANTOUL 'S political sympathies threw him , at a very early period of his life , into the ranks of the Democratic party , though at the time he left the University there was scarcely a skeleton battalion of democrats in Massachusetts : old party relations having become entirely broken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was not until some years later that the reorganization of the Massachusetts democracy was commenced . His first political labors were performed where almost every American who distinguishes himself must commence them ,  --  in writing for the press ; in general meetings , caucuses , &amp;c . The liberality of his views , and the vigor with which he supported them , commended him to attention , at a period when the radical action of Andrew Jackson had stirred up the American mind , and caused men to entertain great hopes of reform ; hopes destined to be not altogether disappointed . His first public address was made at a meeting in South Reading . in support of General Jackson 's veto of the bill rechartering the United States Bank . This was in 1832 ; since which time Mr. RANTOUL has been one of the regularly recognized leaders of the democracy of Massachusetts . In 1834 , Mr. RANTOUL was elected a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives , from Gloucester , and immediately entered on a brilliant legislative career , in the course of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was discussed in the General Court , and by the vigor with which he opposed those measures of the whigs that were calculated to lessen the enjoyment of popular rights . He supported the cause of universal education , the reform of the criminal code , and the construction of the Western Railway ; while he opposed those financial schemes of the whigs which had for their object a far greater inflation of the currency than had ever before been known in New-England . In the winter of 1836 , and but little more than a twelvemonth before the suspension of cash payments by all the banks of the Union , a proposition was brought before the Massachusetts house of Representatives , to incorporate a mammoth bank , with a capital of ten millions . It was supported by the whigs of Boston , who always have exercised a controlling influence over their party ; and , as the whig majority in the legislature was large , but little doubt , if any , was entertained of the success of the measure . This confidence was the better founded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper money , which had blinded the eyes and bewildered the minds of no small number of the children of Mammon . The belief was common enough , at that time , that paper money was wealth , though it is altogether probable that the shrewder class knew that its great merit , as they held it to be , was to be found in the ability which its abundance would give to themselves to obtain possession of the property of time uninitiated . But , whatever were the motives that actuated the leaders in the design of establishing what was named in advance " The Ten Million Bank , " it is certain that they came before the legislature confident of success , expecting , as is // the custom with Massachusetts capitalists on all occasions of the kind , to find that body ready to register their decrees . But they had not allowed sufficient for either the talents of the opposition , or for the effect of powerful and eloquent arguments on the minds of disinterested men of their own party . From the outset , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opposition that astonished the applicants , and carried dismay into the ranks of the dominant party . No legislative contest of our age was fought with more transcendant ability ; and it is no disparagement to other gentlemen who took part in it , to say , that its chief honors were won by Mr. RANTOtJL , though he was the youngest and least experienced of the intellectual gladiators . He brought to the work which he had been called upon to perform , immense acquirements on the subject of the currency ; and , what was perhaps of as much consequence , this knowledge was so well arranged in his mind as to be available on the instant , as many of the whig sophists learned to their cost . In set speeches , and in miscellaneous debates , where no time is allowed for preparation , and which are therefore the true tests of a man 's powers and acquirements , he met and overthrew the whig champions , men who were oracles to the public on the question that was under discussion , and whose shields it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the arms of courtesy . His animated style , the rapidity of his language , the clearness and logical precision of his arguments , his readiness on all occasions , and the felicity of the illustrations that he drew from the history of every commercial nation , gave him so much power in the House , that , far from maintaining the confidence with which they had entered on the undertaking , the friends of the proposed bank began to count the men whom they could rely upon , and to make use of those appliances so familiar to the leaders of the aristocratical party of this country , when the even tenor of their proceedings is disturbed by the exertions of some master minds . As the contest drew toward its close , the public mind became greatly excited , especially in Boston , the whigs of that city being wonderfully moved at the thought of what would follow from the spectacle of the defeat of a measure upon the success of which they had set their hearts , in a body containing a majority of their own party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , destined to taste the bitter cup of defeat ; the bill was thrown out , and the state saved from public bankruptcy . had it been carried , it is highly probable that the credit of the state would have sunk as low as that of Pennsylvania , under the inevitable reaction that followed ; a reaction that swept away the paper moneyparty in its irresistible current . That it would have succeeded but for the exertions of Mr. RANTOUL , was admitted by democrats , and charged against him by whigs , at the time . If we have dwelt on the events of that day perhaps more circumstantially than is strictly allowable in a biographical sketch , it is because all that is now left for a Massachusetts democrat is retrospection . We look back upon a time when a union of purpose and of men was brought to bear with vast force against even a party that could not dream of defeat ; and when , through the operations of great minds directed to great subjects , an opposition party could leave its ineradicable impress on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lot to govern . We find in the speech made by Mr. RANTOUL on the 22d of March , 1836 , a passage that would have done honor to Fonblanque . " Suppose a // capitalist worth his round million , " he said , " falls from the head of Long Wharf : he can not swim , he sees nothing to catch at , he gives up hope ; when with joy he discovers a man on the wharf with a rope in his hand , who cries out , What will you give for the end of this tP A thousand dollars ! ' No ! ' Ten thousand ! ' No ! ' A hundred thousand ! ' No ! give me half your fortune , and you shall have it ? ' Anything , everything ! ' promises the drowning man : the rope is thrown to him , and his life is saved . Suppose , now , he keeps his word , and shares his fortune with the individual who took advantage of his necessity ; would this instance of half a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quoted in the price current to show how cordage stands in the Boston market , and should we have 1785 citizens , all liable to fall off Long Wharf ; forthwith petitioners to the legislature , praying the Commonwealth to go into partnership with them in a rope-walk , ten times longer than any in history , the Commonwealth to send to Holland after the hemp , in order to secure an abundant supply of cheap cordage ? I think these 1785 citizens instead of putting in such a petition , would rather learn the lesson , that those who walk on a slippery brink should be careful not to fall overboard unless they can swim , a lesson it would be well to carry with us into the money market . The high rate of interest paid in particular cases , for a very short time , and just before two o'clock , when there is an urgent demand ; and he who lends knows that he who borrows must have it ; but perhaps does not know , sometimes , with the perfect certainty he could wish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever of the prevailing current rate of interest paid in solid business throughout the Commonwealth . " Mr. RANTOUL 'S reputation was established on a solid basis , by his successful labors to prevent the state of Massachusetts from turning banker for the benefit of a few capitalists . He had then served two terms in the house of Representatives , and was re-elected to that body for the sessions of 1837 and 1838 . At the election of 1836 he was one of the Democratic candidates for state Senators in Essex county , but , though he received a very heavy vote , he was not chosen . During the session of 1838 , when the strength of the Democratic party in the Legislature had been materially reduced in consequence of the disasters of 1837 , Mr. RANTOUL defended , with great eloquence and learning , the Independent Treasury plan , then a new idea , and from which the Whigs expected all sorts of evils to flow . A series of absurd resolutions against the independent Treasury having passed the Senate on the 8th of March , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same month . The debate on these resolutions was very spirited , the principal speakers on the Democratic side being Mr. RANTOUL and Mr. ROBINSON , the latter gentleman being then one of the representatives of the old Democratic town of Marblehead . The whigs had the majority on their side , and the Democrats nothing but principle , and unanswered , because unanswerable , arguments ,  --  the results of experience , and the teachings of common sense . Therefore , the resolutions were adopted , by a vote of three to one , though they contained assertions , that if advanced now , would cause the person putting them forward to be regarded as an ignoramus , and abounded with puerilities and absurdities that would have eclipsed the teeming madness of Bedlam . On the 22d of March , Mr. RANTOUL spoke against the resolves , and offered several amendments , embodying the plainest truths , all of which were voted down . Some of his amendments were in the form of quotations from // Mr. Webster 's speeches against paper money , and the practice of collecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House would not hear wisdom even from the mouth of the greatest whig of all , and by a majority of 136 declared that he was wrong ; three-fourths of those who thus voted , having about as clear a conception of the subject as Swift 's Yahoos would have had of a motion to promote cleanliness and decency . The next day , Mr. RANTOUL made an elaborate speech against the resolves . Tie took them up , one by one , and demonstrated that they were compounded of falsehood and nonsense . He continues , and concluded this speech on the 23th of March . He brought before the House an immense amount of statistical matter , in support of the Democratic view of the currency question ; and , throughout the whole of the currency controversy , few speeches of equal ability were made , either in Congress , or in State Legislatures , or directly to the public . But it was all in vain ; and if the orator did not meet with the fate that generally falls to those who cast pearls before swine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior in any way to their predecessors , but because they were incapable of distinguishing the precious gems that were submitted to their dull vision . As to the arguments , as they were called in courtesy , on the other side , it is sufficient to say that they were worthy of the cause they were brought up to support , and of the men and party from which they emanated . The part taken by Mr. RANTOUL in the work of meliorating the harshness of the " old law , " is one of the most sound of his many claims to public consideration . From the commencement of his career he has been the consistent and untiring friend of that great reform which has for its object the abolition of the unchristian and inhuman practice of judicial slaughter . That so atrocious a remnant of barbarism as the gallows should linger in enlightened states , is not the least remarkable of those paradoxes of a practical kind that can not fail to excite astonishment ; and in future ages it will probably cause people to wonder at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intellect and attainments should ever have supposed that sound evidence could be obtained through a resort to torture . We almost laugh , in the intensity of our scorn , at the thought that it was once not an uncommon thing to press men to death if they refused to plead ; forgetting that the peine forte et dure is inflicted by ourselves on every person who is sentenced to die on the gallows ,  --  for what can be more terrible than the life that the condemned leads between the day of sentence and the day on which he dies what is studiously rendered a disgraceful death ! Beside serving as a member of the regular Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives , and on that committee which in 1835 revised the statutes , Mr. RANTOUL several times acted as chairman of committees appointed to specially consider the question of the abolition of capital punishment . On the 22d of February , 1536 , he made a very elaborate report to the House , in which the whole subject of capital punishment was discussed with great clearness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 43 , 44 , ) is not only eloquent in itself , but has a melancholy interest in consequence of recent events . " It has been said , " are the * Mr. Rantoni 's writings and speeches on the subject of capital punishment are very numerous . Exclusive of minor pieces , they are : -1 . A Report made to the Massachusetts House of Representatives , February twenty-fifth , 1885 , extending to // words of the report , " but it is the language of unrefleeting levity , that the criminal convicted of a capital offence , under our laws , is generally depraved and worthless , and that , therefore , the sacrifice of a few such lives is of very little consequence to society , and it is not an object fit to engage the attention of the government of a great state , even if these laws might be repealed without injury . It is impossible that any member of this legislature can entertain so inhuman a sentiment . Felons , however fallen , still are men , and have the better title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If these wretches were princes , says Goldsmith , there would be thousands ready to offer their ministry ; but the heart that is buried in a dungeon is as precious as that seated on a throne . Suppose that one only may be caught up from the gulf of vice , misery , and perdition , and restored to repentance , virtue , and usefulness ; this would be gain enough to reward all the exertions that may be made to effect the reform , for there is upon earth no gem so precious as the human soul . " Great stress is always laid by the friends and eulogists of the gallows on the passage in Genesis ,  --  " Whoso sheddeth man 's blood , by man shall his blood be shed . " *r . RANTOUL met the perverters of scripture , and exposed the absurdity of which they are guilty when they seek to cover their own love of bloodshed by an affected regard for divine law . This expression , the report said , ( pp. 81 , 8* , ) is " precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that take the sword shall perish with the sword ; ' but it was never imagined that this latter passage contained a divine command to Christians to exterminate with the sword every member of the military profession ; why then should the former be thought to enjoin capital punishment ? The two passages , if the former refers to man , and not to beasts , would seem to be merely declaratory of the natural and general consequences , the one of murder , the other of war . If this were a law , it would be peremptory in all cases , death for death , making no distinction between murder , manslaughter , excusabi6 and justifiable homicide , much as the law now is among oriental nations . If this law is obligatory upon us , it is obligatory in this form , yet no member of this legislature would be willing so to receive it . If it were meant for a universal law , why was it not given when the first case happened , that of Cain ? and why was it not ordered to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Old Testament , upwards of one hundred octavo pages . 2 . A Report made to the same body , February 22 , 1836 , consisting of nineiy-six octavo pages . 3 . A Report made to the same body March 14 , 1837 , of some thirty pages . 4 . " Letters on the Death Penalty , " addressed to the Governor and Members of the Legislature of Massachusetts , in 1846 . These , . however , extensive as they are , and valuable as they are admitted to be by all who are familiar with them , form hut a small part of his labors in the cause of humanity in that particular direction . To say nothing of lectures , addresses , &amp;c. , devoted to the subject , his speeches thereon in the legislature would fill a large volume . In the session of 1836 , Mr. Rantoul made three long and elaborate speeches in support of the abolition of the death penalty , beside making short replies to THIRTEEN members of the House . These great labors required immen*e study and preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward . Few of our public men have sacrificed so largely of their time and talents to promote a reform that has never assumed a art character . The writings of Mr. Rantoel on this subject have met with favor , both at home and in foreign countries . They have received the praise of eminent public men in France , Italy , Germany , Switzerland , and Belgium , who have often quoted from them . His letter to the authorities of Massachusetts , in 1846 , was reprinted by order of the Legislature of New-York . It has been reprinted in other states , having been originally printed by order of the Legislature of Massachusetts . // such as those of Moses and David , to instance no more ? A law which is not stated to have been enforced in a single case for years after it was given , under a theocracy , and while it was often broken , can not have been meant for universal observation , ages after , under governments far from infallible , and when milder manners , and the extinction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for milder punishments. " * Mr. RANTOUL has several times been a candidate for Congress in the district of which he is a resident . He was first nominated in 1838 , and afterwards in 1840 , 1842 , and 1848 . At the election of 1840 , and when it was known that the Democratic party had experienced the greatest defeat known in our history-losing all but its honor-he received more than four thousand votes . In 1842 he led his whig competitor , and came within less than two hundred votes of being chosen ; the existence of the liberty party alone preventing his return to Congress . The soundness of his views in national politics would have made him a faithful representative of the Massachusetts Democracy in the national councils . We have already spoken of his labors in the currency contest , and have showed that they were of the Jackson school . On the tariff question he has ever been equally sound , and for the same reason , namely , because his studies and observations have convinced him that the so-called " protective system " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while professing to aim at the good of the masses , it really subtracts from the fruits of their industry immense sums for the benefit of the wealthy that it is centralizing in its effects , by making the many dependant on the few , and that , carried to its ultimate consequences , as all great tendencies of either opinion or action must be , if not counteracted , it produces that state of society in which , to use Goldsmith 's energetic language , the laws govern the poor , and the rich govern the laws . He has spoken and written much on this subject ; and the comparatively sound state of opinion that now exists thereon in New-England , is directly traceable to his labors , to a very large extent . In the campaign of 1848 he made several speeches on the free trade question , which were remarkable for the boldness of their views and the profundity of their arguments . One of these speeches was made at Salem , a town not to be surpassed for the intensity and the density of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large meeting ; and another , said by those who heard it to have been superior to that delivered at Salem , was made a few days later at Medford . The Salem speech was admirably reported by Mr. Parkhurst , and many thousand copies of it were printed , and circulated throughout New-England . Had we room we should feel gratified at making liberal extracts from so catholic a political paper , which abounds with excellent doctrines , expressed in the most energetic language , but we are compelled to limit ourselves to the closing paragraph . " The Democracy of the United States , " he said , in conclusion , " is to determine whether hereafter * When Cromwell 's Parliament of 1656 were discussing the case of Naylor , many texts were quoted from the Old Testament in support of the proposition that he should he punished with death as a blasphemer . Sir William Strickland , in reply , very pertinently observed , " that if they took their roles from those texts , they rtught punish with death Sabbath-breaking and disobedience to parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamentable misapprehension of the character and objects of the sacred volume , when they seek to pervert it to the defence of what is disgraceful to umanity , aud therefore abhorrent to Heaven . They evince some familiarity with the xt of the Bible , coupled with an utter ignorance of its spirit . // the policy of our nation in the world shall be to make an enemy of every other nation ; to keep at home its own food , and to shut out its neighbor 's clothino ; to provoke and irritate , instead of conciliating and making friends . There never has been , and there never will be , excepting in this manner , such a scene of universal brotherhood in this world as will follow the general adoption of a liberal commercial policy . Liherty , Equality , Fraternity , ' and the fraternity of all men . That is the doctrine which thirty-four millions of Frenchmen now hoist at their masthead , and that is the doctrine that is to circumnavigate the globe with our ships , and their ships , and the ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shall we join in this policy ? Shall we say , let labor have free scope , let the untilled lands be brought into the market at the cheapest rates , so that agriculture shall have free play ? Let the products of the West be sold , in God 's name , in Ireland , in England , or anywhere else where there is an opportunity to sell them . May our commercial greatness , vast and towering as it now is , go on increasiiig as it has done , and let our onward march in greatness , in wealth , and in prosperity , be accelerated , as it will be when we adopt that policy which makes a Christian brotherhood of all nations , and unites their before discordant interests into one . " In 1843 Mr. RANTOIJL was appointed Collector of Boston . He filled the office one year , at the end of which time he left it , in consequence of some opposition having been made to his confirmation , by the Senate . The grounds of this opposition were purely political ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any respect , is sufficiently proved by the fact , that when appointed District Attorney for the Massachusetts District , by President Polk , he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate , which was composed mostly of the same men , a majority of whom had declined to ratify his appointment to the Collectorship of Boston . The campaign of 1844 was one which tested the strength of the Democratic party very severely . It was the greatest contest , if we may be allowed the expression , that the country had seen since that of 1800 . The stupendous humbug of 1840 was too fresh in the recollection of every one , to admit of the whigs stultifying any portion of the community . They had to stand upon the merits of their principles and measures , and of course they were beaten . The victory , however , was won with much difficulty , and at immense expense of time and labor on the part of Democratic speakers and writers . Mr. RANTOUL was foremost among these , and slackened not in his exertions from the opening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest , and made many effective addresses in that liberal and influential section of the republic . We were on the same ground but a few months later , and found that his ringing eloquence and close logic had made an extra ordinary impression on the free mind of the West . His luminous expositions of the principles of FREE TRADE were particularly acceptable to the Western Democracy , who were then aware that the time was fast approaching when the question of opening the markets of the world to the fruits of their industry , or of rendering them the dependents of the monopolists of New-England , would be the absorbing topic of the political world . They listened to him with delight , and could but wonder that a man of abilities so eminent should not long before have been one of the represcntatives of his own *tate , in Congress . In the honest fervor of their admiration of his great powers and correct opinions , they for the time forgot what Massachusetts whiggism is , and that it refuses to tolerate anything except the bundle of // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The places at which Mr. RANTOUL spoke in the contest of 1844 , out of New-England , were Elmira , Rochester , Buffalo , Cleveland , Columbus , and Cincinnati . In 1848 he addressed the Democrats of St. Louis , a few weeks after the nomination of Cass and Butler . He was in that city on business of a private character , but cheerfully complied with the request of his political brethren , who were delighted with the admirable specimen of New-England eloquence that he gave them . In 1845 , soon after the inauguration of President Polk , Mr. RANTOUL was appointed District Attorney of Massachusetts , an office which has been filled hy some of the ablest lawyers in the country , to whom he proved himself a worthy successor . No opposition was made to his appointment , and it was felt hy his friends , and the Massachusetts public , that the office was likely to gain more from the man than the man from the office . The more important cases in which he was engaged while he filled this office are elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1849 he voluntarily retired from the place , and was succeeded by the Hon. George Luntz , who now occupies it . Mr. RANTOUL 'S style of speaking is singularly pleasing and very effective . His utterance is rapid , but at the same time his use of language is singularly correct . He is never at a loss for words , and those words are with him the media of powerful arguments . With him language is the realization of the definition of what its meaning should be , rather than what it always is ,  --  not the mere garment of thought , but its incarnation . He rarely speaks from notes , and his best efforts have been those in which he has spoken from the least direct preparation , and only from the abundant resources of a full and well arranged mind . " Never write on a subject , " says Jean Paul , " without having first read yourself full on it ; and never read on a subject till you have thought yourself hungry on it . " Substitute speak for write in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. RANTOUL 'S course of proceeding as an orator ; and it is to this that his productions owe one of their greatest charms . They impart information to a degree that is not to he found in most things of the kind , and they cause the hearer or the reader to think , thus accomplishing what ought to be the chief end of everything that proceeds from the tongue or the pen of man . But what chiefly attracts those who listen to him is the clearness of his logic and the closeness of his arguments . He goes steady to the point at which he aims , and is tempted not aside by any of those beautiful flowers that too often seduce the advocate or the orator from the direct path , and cause him to degenerate into the rhetorician . We remember a very high compliment that was paid to him in 1840 , and which will probably he as new to himself as to most of the readers of this article . A gentleman belonging to the whig party of Massachusetts , and one every way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a friend , in the summer of that eventful year , said , in substance : " I have heard speeches of every kind in this campaign , from men of every shade of opinion , and fi om the very first men in the nation , and I do not hesitate to say , that the only orator and eloquent man I have heard , is ROBERT RANTOUL . " His voice is sharp and clear , and the command which its owner has over it , is remarkable . Some who have heard him have been surprised that he should unite so much rapidity of utterance with so much correctness in language , and so peculiarly limpid a style ; but the idea that rapid , fluent speakers are careless and slovenly in the structure // of their sentences , while slow speakers are neat and elegant , is not wellfounded in all cases , if it be in any case . The fact is rather the reverse of this . Charles Butler , in his pleasant volume of " Reminiscences , " has some observations on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , " that though both Lord Mansfield and Lord Thurlow spoke most slowly and deliberately , yet their periods were strangely confused , and often ungrammatical ; while Lord Ashburton , ( Dunning , ) whose volubility was marvellous , and was the despair of short-hand writers , never offended against grammar ; his periods , though often quaint and apparently entangled in endless parentheses , were uncommonly neat and perspicuous ; and what is of much more consequence to an orator , gave him an appearance of speaking without preparation , and from the feelings of the moment . " The greater part of this description of Lord Ashburton 's oratory will apply to that of Mr. RANTOUL . The exceptions are , that he is rarely quaint , and that he is never even apparently involved in parentheses . What Mr. Butler says of Fox , that there never was a moment in which he was either intentionally or unintentionally obscure , can be said with literal correctness of Mr. RANTOUL . Every American who can make a good oration or address , is sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrations , festivals , &amp;c . Mr. RANTOUL has been the orator on more than one occasion of the kind , commencing with his first entrance on public life , and terminating with the last anniversary of the nation 's birth-day , when he addressed the people of Dover , N. H. , by invitation . One of the best of his efforts in this line was made at Concord , Mass. , on the 19th of last April , when the seventy-fifth anniversary of the first action of the Revolution was observed by the people of those towns whose ancestors threw down the gage of battle to the rulers of the British empire . His oration on that occasion has been published at length in the account of the celebration , and is a monument of erudition and sound views of the great crises of history . It would have done honor to Macaulay , so replete is it with historical pictures , drawn in colors the most brilliant , yet all combining together to form a perfect whole , a gallery in which are to be seen the deeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men themselves . It was equal to the occasion , and worthy to be delivered on a spot where lie buried the mortal portions of the first of the heroes of American liberty : Dust which is , Even in itself , au immortality . " Not the least honorable and useful of Mr. RANTOUL 'S labors are those which he has devoted to the cause of education . He was a member of the Board of Education of Massachusetts for six years ,  --  from 183G to 1842 ; - during which time he not only did much for education , but made frequent addresses in its behalf in popular meetings , &amp;c . One of the best of his numerous writings is an elaborate article on the subject of education , which was published in the " North American Review , " for October , 1838 . He has also been a firm , but a charitable advocate , of the cause . of temperance . Mr. RANTOUL 'S position at the bar is a high and an honorable one , as is evidenced by the very able and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States District Attorney , having more than once been called upon while he held that station to manage cases of the greatest importance . He is a deeply-read lawyer , but not a mere lawyer . The // tendency of too assiduous application to the law is to narrow the mind , and it has very rarely happened that any of the great men who have adorned the legal profession have not been persons of extensive and various attainments out of its line . Mr. RANTOUL 's acquirements are of the first order , as is apparent from his various orations and addresses . His library is one of the largest and best selected to be found in the capital of New-England , and is liberally opened by its owner to those who are not in circumstances to supply themselves with the works of the leading minds of the world . It is exceedingly rich in the literature of the continent of Europe , especially that of France , from the earliest times , before the several countries that now form that republic had been fused into one nation . Equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classics ; and he has by no means neglected the rich and various literature of England , or that of America , which is fast rising to importance . One of the earliest cases on which Mr. RANTOUL was concerned , was that of the Knapps , who were tried in Salem , in 1830 , for the murder of Captain White . He was one of the junior counsel for the defendants . In 1840 , he was senior counsel in what was known as the " Journeymen Boot-makers ' " case , and succeeded in obtaining one of the completest triumphs that it ever fell to the lot of an American lawyer to achieve . The defendants were charged with having entered into a combination " to compel , by force of numbers and discipline , and by imposition of fines and penalties , other journeymen to join their society , and masters to employ none but members . " This is an unlawful conspiracy at common law in Massachusetts . " The gist of the offence of conspiracy , " say the books , " consists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offence is complete when the confederacy is made . It is not necessary to complete the offence that the confederacy should be to commit an act which is indictable . " The trial of the boot-makers came off before the Boston Municipal Court , at the October Term , 1840 . Mr. RANTOUL defended them with great eloquence and powerful arguments , and a vast array of legal and historical learning . He held , and established , that the conduct of the defendants had not been unlawful ; and that , therefore , they could not in law and justice be convicted of a conspiracy to perform an unlawful act . What they had the undoubted right to do in their capacity of individuals , that they had a right to do as a combination of individuals . " A conspiracy to raise wages , " said Mr. RANTOUL , " could not be indictable in England , if it were not unlawful for an individual to attempt to raise his wages . And the indictment , in the case at bar , is bad , because each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them jointly . " ( Thacher 's Criminal Cases , p. 634 . ) The Court ruled against the defendants , and the jury found them guilty . The defendants took several exceptions to the ruling of the Judge , ( Thacher , ) and the case was carried up to the Supreme Court . Action was had on it at the March Term of that Court , in 1842 . The only exception considered by the Supreme Court , was this : " The defendants ' counsel contended that the indictment did not set forth any agreement to do a criminal act , or to do any unlawful act by criminal means ; and that the agreements , therein set forth , did not constitute a conspiracy indictable by any law of this commonwealth ; and they moved the Court so to instruct the jury : But the judge refused so to do , and instructed the jury that the indictment against the defendants did , in his opinion , describe a conspiracy among the defendants to do an // unlawful act , and to effect the same by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose described in the indictment , was an unlawful conspiracy , against the Jaws of this commonwealth ; and that , if the jury believed , from the evidence in the case , that the defendants , or any of them , had engaged in such confederacy , they were bound to find such of them guilty . " Mr. RANTOUL argued the case very elaborately . In conclusion , he said : " All the counts in the present indictment are fatally defective ; first , in not averring any unlawful acts or means ; secondly , if any such acts or means are averred , in not setting them forth . The vagueness and generality of the charges are such , that aurtrefois convict could not be pleaded to a second indictment for the same acts . When the end is not unlawful , the means should be set forth . " ( Metcalf 's Reports , iv. , 119 . ) The Attorney General ( Austin , ) replied , and took ground in all respects precisely the opposite of that advanced by the defendants ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , after a long train of reasoning : " Whatever illegal purpose can be found in the constitution of the Boot-makers ' Society , it not being clearly set forth in the indictment , can not be relied upon to support this conviction . So , if any facts were disclosed at the trial , which , if properly averred , would have given a different character to the indictment , they do not appear in the bill of exceptions , nor could they , after the verdict , aid the indictment . But , looking solely at the indictment , disregarding the qualifying epithets , recitals and immaterial allegations , and confining ourselves to facts so averred as to be capable of being traversed and put in issue , we can not perceive that it charges a criminal conspiracy punishable by law . The exceptions must , therefore , be sustained , and the judgment arrested . " ( Metcalf 's Rep. , iv. , 136 . ) We have dwelt at some length on this 9ase , because it not only involved a great question bearing upon some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its decision in behalf of the defendants settled the question favorably to the liberal view of things . The decision was final , so far as Massachusetts is concerned . Mr. RANTOUL won much applause from the singularly able manner in which he fought the battle in behalf of sound principles , and from his having obtained a victory in the face of influences almost overpowering in their character. * In 1842 , Mr. RANTOUL was the leading counsel for the defence of several of those persons who were indicted in Rhode Island for having sought to make the government more liberal than it had been for many years . The Algerine authorities were disposed to carry matters with a high hand . With the true instinct of tyrants , they relied on partizan judges and packed juries as their best instruments , or men who resembled those infamous characters that were the stains of English laws under the Stuarts , in every thing except their talents and courage . The question of the right * The reasons advanced by Mr. Bcntool in defence of the boot-makers , and the recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their acquittal , hot also to the settlement ota great principle favorably to the cause of humanity and common sense , were substantially the same as those which led to the reversal of the condemnation of Mr. O'Connell , by the British House of Lords , in 1e44 . Lord Penman. then Chief-Justice of the Queen 's Bench , Lord Cottenham , who , beside other high stations , has been LordChancellor , and Lord Campbell , now ChielJostice of the Queen 's Bench , all voted for the reversal of the condemnation of the Irish prisoners ; and the gist of what was said by them all , is in no essential respect different from the arguments of Mr. Rantoul in the // of " trial by a jury of the vicinage " was argued by Mr. RANTOUL ill opposition to the counsel for the usurping government , who were crushed under the weight of authorities that he hurled upon them , authorities that they had never before heard of . His speech was applauded in open Court by the audience , though the " reign of terror " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no citizen of the state would have been permitted to defend the accused to the extent of his ability . While United States Attorney for the Massachusetts District , Mr. RANTOUL was engaged in several cases involving great legal principles . The New-Bedford Bridge case , argued before the Circuit Court , was one of the most important of these . It was a question of admiralty jurisdiction , which had never been settled , and was intended to define the limits of the legislative power of a state when in conflict with the federal government . The government counsel went through the whole system of maritime law , commencing with Athens and Rhodes , and q , oming down to the present day . lie cited upwards of four hundred authorities , in numerous languages , and won the applause of the public , and the cooler and perhaps more valuable commendation of the Court , for the singularly felicitous manner in which he conducted the case . To say nothing of his references to , and quotations from the maritime codes of ancient nations , he examined those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts they have taken in the pursuits of commerce-from the smallest of the Italian republics , to the great nation that affects to have subdued the waves , and which , in a far more extended sense than was the case with Venice ,  --  " holds the gorgeous East in fee . " The condemnation of the schooner Spitfire , a slaver , and the conviction of her master , ( Flowery , ) were procured by Mr. RANTOUL , against able and learned counsel . Just before his retirement from office , he conducted the case of the government against Crafts , one of the most singular trials to be found in the history of American law . Crafts was one of the owners of the ship Franklin , which ship , on her passage from London to Boston , was cast-away on Cape Cod , and lost , together with several lives . The government charged that the loss of the ship was intentionally brought about by the master , and that Crafts had induced him to engage in the ncfarious business ; and the proof adduced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied more than a month with the case , and considerable excitement was caused by it , especially in the mercantile world . The government 's cause was conducted with great skill by Mr. RANTOUL , as was admitted on all hands , but the rhetoric of the eloquent counsel for the defence , ( Mr. Choate , ) carried the prisoner safe through the ordeal . The closing argument of Mr. RANTOUL , on this trial , was one of the most eloquent and effective ever delivered in an American court . He called attention to the character and consequences of the crime charged on Massachusetts Courts  --  the highest of which Courts sustained his positions , reversing the decision of the Court below , just as the House of Lords reversed that of the prejudiced and partial Irish Court that condemned Mr. O'Connell in the face of law and justice . Lord Lyndhurst , Chancellor under the Peel Ministry , and Lord Brougham , voted against the three Lords before named , but , being outnumbered , the government was , as it deserved to be , defeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of what was destined in a few years to be the first maritime power in the world . " Already , " he said , " our shipping , with its annual earnings , outfits and repairs , with our exports and imports , and the products water-borne upon our lakes and rivers , amounts to about one thousand millions of dollars in value ; and , including with the mariners who man this navy , the immigrants from the Old World , and the passengers on our inland waters , a million of lives are exposed every year in common with this property . It is this amount of property and of life , and not merely the intercst of eight insurance companies , that calls on you to protect it by the punishment of a most atrocious crime . " His account of the origin of the law of the sea , and his assertion of its vast importance , were much admired at the time : " It was , " he said , " the necessity that some general law should throw its protecting regis over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sense of the obvious common interests of all merchants and mariners , that caused the early and universal adoption of the law of the sea  --  a law whose venerable authority commanded the respect of T*oman emperors in the height of their unbounded power-of which Antoninus said : I am indeed the lord of the earth , but the law is the lord of the sea . ' And when afterwards feudal anarchy had separated the law of the land into a thousand discordant systems , the law of the sea still was , and continues to be , one law ; and it is only upon the sea that sovereign law , the world 's collected will , sits arbiter . You are trying this great maritime fl-and , gentlemen , in the court which is the minister and interpreter of this universal law  --  a court which tried maritime offences , by a jury of twelve good and lawful men , in the kingdom of Jerusalem , before the institution of a jury had acquired its present form in the courts of common law of England  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecks , and conspiracies to procure them , not only before its prohibitions were adopted into our statutes , but before Columbus had discovered the oceanpath to our hemisphere . " Mr. RANTOUL is now in the prime of life ; and from the high order of his mind , the various character and extent of his attainments , and the confidence that is felt in his integrity by his political friends and the general public , his appearance in a prouder field of action is anticipated with much confidence by his fiiends . Nothing but his being a resident of a community in which every man who is a Democrat is placed almost beyond the pale of the law , and becomes as it were a political caput lupinum , has prevented him from rising to the highest honors that are attainable by men of talent in this country . The dawn of a better day would seem , however , to be at hand . The old ideas on the subject of protection are in the course of being discarded by the more enlightened portion of the northern manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only through their being admitted into the markets of the world that they can hope for a continuance of prosperity , the " home market " being no longer a monopoly to them , the South and West-especially the former-having commenced manufacturing on their own account . With the extension of more liberal opinions on this subject , must rise the men who have advocated them when they were unpopular , and when it seemed that nothing could ever lead to their being looked upon with feelings that approach to toleration.
