txt /q/e will of the people governed . History is , indeed , little else than a record of the attempts which have been made , at various times , by individuals and nations , t their dominion through the means of encroachment and usurpation . The tyranny of one nation over another is , perhaps , tL most odious of all tyrannies ; and the most galling of all ser vitudes is that of one nation oppressed by another . Somt times the conquerors and the conquered become fused ini one indiscriminate mass , and partake a common destiny ; bui when this amalgamation does not take place , an ascendency of race over race is established , which becomes an unceasing source of social misery . Such was the relation between the Egyptians and the Israelites , though in this case the subjugation was not effected by conquest such was the relation between the Turks and the Greeks between the Spaniards and the Indians of South America . Strange as it may appear , many of those nations which have been most jealous in the /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , exercised a harsh and tyrannical sway over those dependent upon them . Domestic slavery still keeps in a state of the most abject bondage several millions of human beings in the United States of America , though no nation asserts the principles of liberty with so much vehemence , or more nearly realizes a perfect democracy in its institutions . In the free states of antiquity , no question appears to have been ever raised as to the propriety of maintaining domestic slavery , though occasionally , from motives of expediency , large numbers of slaves were emancipated . The government of the republican Romans , in the conquered provinces , was probably more oppressive than that of the native dynasties , however despotic . Even the smallest and most democratic cantons of Switzerland kept in subjection for centuries scraps of territory , the inhabitants of which were not only not admitted to the privileges of citizenship , but were ruled by a harsh and oppressive system of administration . England , in its treatment of Ireland during six centuries , refrained from placing the people of that kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a full participation of that freedom of which Britons so loudly boast . In order to give effect to this policy , an internal ascendency founded first upon distinctions of race , and afterwards upon difference of creed was created , under the operation of which the majority of the Irish nation were treated as slaves and enemies by a domilant minority . The instances are rare in - which the will of a nation has ) een formally consulted in the establishment of its constitution , few sucTi examples are , however , to be found . The most recent is that presented by France , in the revolution of 1848 , when the French people were summoned to elect , by miversal suffrage , deputies who should frame for France a : constitution : and thus , as near an approximation to an ex ) ression of the national will , as appears to be possible , was bought to have been attained . Yet the sanction subsequently ; iven - to the usurpation of Louis Napoleon * shows how little * As this is the first passage in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the term " usurper " is frequently applied to him by le author hereafter , I must put in a protest against the only inference - which 3uld be drawn from the employment of the term . The Emperor Napo III. , from all the evidence which has reached us , was entirely justified I arresting the heads of factions and dispersing the disloyal National Asjmbly , in December , 1851 . That Assembly , by its abolition of universal /z/ reliance can be placed even on the most deliberate acts of nations . The political institutions recommended to the Athenian people by Solon , and to the Lacedaemonians by Lycurgus , were adopted by the citizens at large by express assent . In the United States of America , the federal constitution , which unites in Congress the representatives of the several states , was framed , after deliberation , in such a manner as to obtain the sanction of a majority of the American people : and several of the states of Europe have , during the present century , either remodelled their ancient form of government , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experience . The year 1848 was peculiarly prolific of such changes ; but the sudden and violent revolutions , effected during that season of popular commotion , have been followed by a reaction destructive to the constitutional liberties of the nations by whom such changes were adopted . /z/ History supplies us with examples of almost every possible modification of government. * It also proves to us that no form of polity is exempt from imperfections ; and however suffrage , the very condition of its own being , its monarchical coalitions , and its all but successful attempt to place the army of Paris under the control of its own president , had forfeited all right to be considered the National Assembly of France . The coup d'etat was a necessary and a justifiable measure , if the Assembly was , as we have all read , so false , so traitorous to France . And Mr. O'Brien has admitted , farther on , that the Prince President had no authority whatever to prorogue or dissolve them , under the constitution : he was thus left no alternative but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter ; the whole French people sustained liim in his course ; and we therefore protest against the term " usurper " being at this day applied to his name . M. ' * I have not thought it necessary to delineate in detail the different forms of government which have existed at various periods in different countries of the world . The reader , who is desirous to make himself acquainted with such details , Avill find in " Brougham 's Political Philosophy " a comprehensive view of the various forms of political organization which have been estabhshed by mankind in different ges , and in different parts of the world . Though , personally , I have little reason to speak in complimentary terms respecting Lord Brougham , I have great pleasure in acknowledging the merit of this publication as a compilation of facts useful to every student of political science . /z/ much one constitution may in theory appear preferable to another , there is some ground for justifying the unsound doc* " ine of the poet , that " Whate'er is best administered is best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed by beneficence . When power is divided between several coordinate authorities , the best designs are often thwarted by contrarieties of will . The beneficent despot can accomplish without contravention the good which he desires to achieve for his people . An absolute monarch , if well disposed , rules with a view to the interest of the whole people . In a representative or constitutional government the rulers often care only to satisfy the dominant majority . Hence , arbitrary power is often more acceptable to the multitude than more complex forms of government . If a nation have learned to revere and love a succession of benevolent sovereigns , it is in vain that the theorist proclaims to such a people the superior advantages of republican government . He might as well attempt to convince a loving child that the homage , and attachment , and obedience , which he renders to a fond parent , is but a debasing servitude . In such cases as these " the subordination of the heart keeps alive the spirit of an exalted freedom . " Of the operation of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration . The feudal relation of lord and vassal is one which suggests painful memories throughout the greatest part of Europe . It was the relation of the conqueror to the conquered , of the despot to the slave . But the quasi-feudal connection which subsisted between the Gaelic clans and their chiefs is still associated with feelings of reciprocal confidence and attachment . The chief was regarded as the father of his tribe . The Gaelic word clan means " the children . " He shared with them common dangers , common enjoyments , and a common home . He was their leader in war , their companion , their friend , their protector in time of peace . The clansmen saw in him the representative of a long line of heroes or sages who had won for them renown by bravery or wisdom . The sentiment which impels a Frenchman to adore the name of Napoleon , which compels even the sternest republican of America to venerate the memory of Washington , this ineradicable tendency to /z/ hero worship was concentrated upon the character and person of the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feudal dependence is considered derogatory to the dignity of a freeborn man , the members of an ancient clan dwell with affectionate recollection on traditions illustrative of the relationship between the clan and its chief . It too often happens that in what are called " free " states the interests and feelings of the poorest class are more disregarded by the government than they are under absolute monarchies . It is not surprising , therefore , that the masses should view with jealousy the selfish arrogance of privileged classes , " who call it freedom when themselves are free ; " nor that they should seek in absolutism for protection from the domineering usurpations of an oligarchy . In the United States of America perfect equality in regard of political rights exists amongst all the free citizens . It is , therefore , natural that every freeborn American should prize the republican institutions of his country ; but what matters it to the negro slave whether a despot or a congress give laws to the United States ? What matters it to him whether the Gaul or the Saxon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even the most absolute monarchs are amenable to the opinion of the people whom they govern . A nation which has patiently acquiesced in what is called servitude , while governed by a beneficent despot , will sometimes suddenly rise in its might and depose a tyrant , substituting in his place another dynasty equally invested with unlimited power . Indeed , experience shows that it is more difficult to break down the oppressive privileges of an oligarchy than to dethrone a tyrant , or to displace a dynasty . Influenced by these considerations , the inquirer might be disposed to infer , that if rulers were endowed with wisdom and goodness , absolute monarchy would be the form of government most conducive to the happiness of mankind . But inasmuch as experience proves that there is more reason to fear that rulers will misuse the power intrusted to them , than to hope * that they will exercise it with wisdom and justice , it is necessary to seek guarantees against the abuse of power in institutions more complex than that of a simple monarchy . These guarantees are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-government is cherished ; in other words , amongst whom each individual is called upon to take a part in performing those public duties by which social order is pre- /z/ rved . Every person is not qualified to become a minister of state , but there are few , however humble may be their station , or however limited may be their acquirements , who are not capable of executing some function or other connected with the objects of government . In a well-constituted state every individual ought to be made to feel that he owes duties not only to his family and to himself , but also to society ; and the performance of such duties as he is qualified to undertake ought to be assigned to him . One of the noblest characteristics of the political institutions of Great Britain has been this allotment of several of the functions of civil administration , such as those of magistrate , grand juror , mayor , and town councillor , juryman , guardian of the poor , churchwarden , harbor commissioner , member of parliament , privy councillor , &c.,; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be argued that these services would have been more effectually performed by paid officials dependent upon the central government , yet , even if this point were conceded , the advantage would be dearly purchased by a sacrifice of that manly and self-relying spirit which is generated by the exercise of social duties of a public nature , and which is the best guarantee for the preservation of a nation 's liberty . Arbitrary monarchs and ambitious ministers love to centralize power as much as possible . They desire to place in direct subordination to the central government every public functionary , because they are thus enabled to command the whole patronage of official administration , and to wield according to their own will all the powers of the state . In vigorous hands centralization of power undoubtedly secures a greater degree of unity of action than can be obtained when coordinate authorities act independently of each other . Great military operations , in particular , can seldom be executed effectively when the cooperating forces are not subject to the control of one directing will . In confederations , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each canton or state has been bound to provide a certain contingent of troops to support the general interests of the confederation , it seldom happens that all the constituent authorities of the league take the same view of the expediency of a military undertaking , of of the means by which it ought to be executed . The military contingents of the states which formed the Germanic confederation amounted , after the peace of 1815 , to above 300,000 men . There can be no doubt that a force of this amount /z/ would be a much more formidable instrument of offence , though , perhaps , not of defence , if placed at the disposal of a single commander , such as Napoleon , Marlborough , or Wellington , than if subject to many different controlling authorities . But it does not , therefore , follow as a necessary consequence , that it is desirable that the population of Germany should be placed under the government of one centralized and consolidated monarchy . In human affairs it generally happens that one class of advantages can be secured only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in perpetually seeking changes for the purpose of obviating some inconvenience , but in endeavoring to establish such institutions as shall , upon the whole , secure the greatest amount of good . As long as a centralized government is subject to rigorous responsibility , it will generally be conducted with efficiency ; but when such responsibiUty is relaxed or annulled , it becomes just as ill-regulated as the worst description of local administration ; and is , at the same time , capable of being converted by a bad minister into an engine of corruption or oppression , the operation of which extends to every portion of the kingdom . A people desirous to preserve their freedom can not be too jealous in watching the encroachments of a centralizing spirit . At the same time it must be admitted , that there are some departments of government which can not be conducted effectively except under a centralized administration . For example , the duty of negotiating with foreign powers ought clearly to be reserved to the general government . As an example of the class of operations which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration , we may mention the construction of public works of a local nature . It will be more convenient , however , that we should reserve , until a future occasion , a specification of the different functions which ought to be appropriated to central and to local agencies respectively . In every country the necessity of separating general from local administration has been more or less recognized , but such separation appears in many cases to have arisen from accident rather than from design , and in very few countries is the organization required for the due performance of each class of functions as systematic and perfect as it ought to be . /z/ CHAPTER in. /z/ The aim and end for which government is constituted ought to be to secure the prosperity and happiness of the whole people . The modern phrase which describes " the greatest happiness of the greatest number " as the object of all good government , is liable to objection , inasmuch as it seems to imply that the interests and wishes of the minority ought to be sacrificed to the interests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted without modification and reserve . A parent is bound to promote the happiness not of the majority of his children , but of all his children . Political institutions should be framed so as to protect life and property , secure the enactment of good laws , carry into effect such laws in the most advantageous manner , guarantee the maintenance of public liberty , maintain friendly relations with foreign powers , encourage production , and secure to industry the fruits of its labor , dispense impartial justice , develop the intelligence of the people , and teach them their duties , provide for the destitute , minister to the health and recreation of the community . Amongst the means by which these objects may be promoted , the first and most important is , the establishment of a legislature by which good laws may be enacted . It is unnecessary to adduce arguments to prove that laws , iitten or oral , are essential to the existence of society , whether savage or civilized ; nor is it necessary to adduce arguments to prove that the character of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much upon the laws by which it is regulated . These sue postulates which all reasonable men will at once admit . We may therefore proceed without delay to consider what description of legislature is best qualified to secure the enactment of good laws. * History presents to us examples of almost every possible form of legislature . In a rude state of society especially * Perhaps it may not be superfluous , in a work on the Principles of Government , if we cite the famihar proposition , that man being born for society , and society being impossible without government , every man has , therefore , a native natural right to be governed . M. /z/ if the communities be not very large laws are sometimes enacted by assemblies consisting of the whole male population . Such appears to have been the practice of the ancient Germans . Even in our own days such a mode of enacting laws has prevailed in the three forest cantons of Switzerland , Schwytz , Uri , and Unterwalden . In some of the ancient republics , whose territories were governed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convened in general assembly , to give their sanction to the laws proposed . More frequently , however , the duties of legislation have been performed by bodies which have either assumed that function by virtue of the tacit acquiescence of the rest of the community , or which have been expressly nominated to perform it by delegation . In arbitrary monarchies , the king , aided by such ministers as he may select , imposes laws by way of edict . In oligarchies , self-elected councils ( more or less numerous , as chance may direct ) assume the right of enacting laws . In constitutional or limited monarchies , the power of making laws is conjointly shared by the sovereign , the nobles , and the representatives of the people . In pure republics , the delegates of the people alone constitute the legislature . Different portions of the same realm are sometimes governed by different laws , though under the same legislature . Of this case Great Britain furnishes an example . The laws of Scotland , though enacted or modified by the imperial legislature , are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other instances , not only are the laws different in different states , which compose the empire at large , but there are also separate legislatures . Thus , before the union of 1800 , there was a separate legislature in Ireland , though subject to the general sovereignty of the crown of Great Britain and Ireland . Such , too , has been the case in Norway and Sweden , in Hungary and Austria . In each of the colonies of Great Britain local legislatures exist ; but whilst these legislatures enact laws relative to their local concerns , they are subject to the paramount legislation of the Imperial Parliament . Independent states have sometimes formed confederations with other states , and have delegated to their representatives , united in Diet or Congress , the power of legislating or acting for specified purposes which affect the common interest of all /z/ the states , whilst each state has reserved to itself the power of making its own laws and of exercising all the rights of sovereignty not expressly delegated to the general authorities of the confederation . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of legislation founded upon the cooperation of powers equal and coordinate is necessarily very complex and unwieldy , as well as liable to internal collisions , it may be doubted whether , upon the whole , such a system is not calculated to secure to the constituent portion of an empire the greatest attainable amount of civic happiness . Thus , in the case of Ireland , there is every reason to believe that it would at this moment be much more prosperous and happy than it now is , if it had preserved its independent legislature , instead of allowing it to be merged in that of Great Britain . Would the interests of Norway be advanced by the union of its legislature with that of Sweden ? Would the inhabitants of the smaller states of Germany , such as Saxony , Bavaria , Wirtemburg , Baden , &c.,; have reason to congratulate themselves if these states were to be absorbed in the greater empires of Prussia or Austria ? Has Portugal suffered from having been disconnected from Spain ? Would Belgium be happier than she now is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar questions well deserve the consideration of every student of history . If he weigh them carefully , he will probably arrive at the conclusion that the seeming advantages promised to arise from a consolidation of independent states into great empires are very dearly purchased by a surrender of their legislative independence . When legislative power is centralized , the interests of the extremities are generally sacrificed to those of the central seat of government . Thus Paris rules France , whilst a mob , or a clique , or a despot , rules Paris . What has become of the local fame of Burgundy , of Lorraine of Brittany , of Provence , of Toulouse , and of other Gallic states , celebrated during the middle ages for the skill and industry of their inhabitants , or for the heroism of their warriors and princes ? If five independent states agree to be ruled by a common authority , it is manifest that the will of each of them must become subordinate to the will of the majority . If contending interests or strong prejudices ( which often create more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oppress the minority , it is manifest that the states which form // the minority have lost much of their liberty by entering into such combination . However specious , therefore , may be the advantages which are promised to result from the creation of a central legislature , the inhabitants of an independent state ought to be very reluctant to surrender any of the prerogatives with which that independence is endowed , more particularly if differences in race , differences in religion , and differences in local interests should tend to excite jealousies between the several members of such a united legislature . On the other hand , a federal coalition which does not encroach upon the legislative privileges of the constituent states confers advantages which can not be enjoyed by small communities isolated from each other . Take , for instance , the case of the United States of America . If there had been no central legislature , or central executive , it is probable that they would eventually have been reconquered by Great Britain . Without some central organization it would have been extremely difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been too weak to contend with the power of the mother country . It is certain that in all transactions with foreign powers the states would , if acting separately , command much less influence than is now enjoyed by the great federal republic of the west . It is also probable that intestine war would have arisen . It is certain that the aggregate of military force maintained by the several states , through jealousy or apprehension of each other , would have been much greater than that which has been found sufficient under a federal union . It is probable that there would have been in the different states different rates of commercial duties , framed with a view to the exclusive advantage of each state , but tending , on the whole , to check production and trade . ' In order to avoid these and other inconveniences , a central authority was created by the formation of a general legislature called " Congress , " composed of representatives of the several states which constitute the Union . With these , other states have been , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned the duty of making laws relative to the following social requirements , viz. : military and naval force , treaties with foreign powers , peace and war , letters of marque and reprisal , taxes for general purposes , management of the national debt , commerce , post office , coinage , naturalization , bankruptcy , copyright , piracy . In the mean time , the separate states have enjoyed the /z/ right to manage their own internal concerns . Each state possesses both legislative and executive authority extending to all objects not specially reserved for the action of Congress . In reference to the constitution of a legislature , the same remark may be applied which has already been made with regard to political institutions in general , namely : that in constructing a legislature , the peculiar circumstances of the country for which it is to be framed ought to be taken into account , and that the application of abstract principles should be modified by a due regard to such circumstances . When a monarchy has long subsisted in any country , there naturally exists , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong prejudice in favor of that form of government . Not only does individual interest generate this sentiment , but , under the operation of a variety of influences , which it is not necessary to specify , it even becomes connected in the mind with the obligations of religious duty . Attachment to particular dynasties becomes a passion , under the impulse of which men will cheerfully sacrifice their lives and the interests of all whom they most love . That primary duty which every man owes to his country the noble sentiment of patriotism in many minds takes the form of devotion to royalty . In some instances , as in that of the Stuarts , this devotion is not founded upon respect for the individual monarch , but upon attachment to the dynasty and to the principle of legitimacy , the sovereign being considered as " the Lord 's anointed , " entitled to reign by virtue of divine appointment . Such being the natural tendency of the human mind , it seldom happens that kings lose their crowns until they have forfeited them by a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affections of those over whom they rule . Happily for mankind , there are limits to the endurance of wrong ; and , from time to time , cases occur in which misused power is wrested from the hands which wield only to misemploy it . But even in those cases in which it has become necessary to change the dynasty , the sentiment in favor of royalty has not always been extinguished . After the execution of Charles I. of England the attempt to found a republic in Great Britain utterly failed . A sovereignty of a more arbitrary character was established , under another name ; and after the death of Cromwell , the British people appeared almost unanimously to rejoice in the restoration to the throne of a family which had but very slender /z/ title to their regard , in the person of a prince whose public and private character was alike undeserving of respect . In France , also , the attempt to establish a republic upon the ruins of the Bourbon dynasty most signally failed . After undergoing , during several years , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before witnessed , the French quietly submitted to the arbitrary government of an illustrious commander . In the recent French revolution that of 1848 a republic was proclaimed , and was accepted by the nation , not so much from inclination as from the difficulty of discovering a monarch and a dynasty whose elevation to the throne would have given universal satisfaction ; but there is every reason to believe that the number of those who were in principle republican was small , when compared with that portion of the French nation who were attached to monarchical institutions . Hence the readiness with which the French people have acquiesced in the usurpation of empire by Louis Napoleon . Taking into consideration , therefore , the strong prepossessions which are generated in favor of monarchy , in those countries which have long been subject to monarchical sway , it may be stated as a general proposition , to which even those who , in the abstract , prefer republican institutions , may assent that it is not expedient to attempt to overthrow a monarchy which , upon the whole , governs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should become necessary to change the dynasty , it will , in such countries , be generally found more safe to replace it by another dynasty than to substitute for it a republic . At the time of the revolution of 1688 , when the English nation was compelled , for the sake of self-protection , to deprive James II . of his crown , the leaders of that revolution wisely resolved to transfer the forfeited crown to a prince who was , for many reasons , acceptable to the English nation , rather than to attempt to found a republic . Had they proclaimed a republic , civil war would certainly have been the immediate consequence ; and probably the eventual result would have been the restoration of him whom history now calls " the Pretender . " In the revolution which took place in Belgium in 1830 , by which the House of Nassau was most justly expelled from the Southern Netherlauds , the leaders of that revolution , in selecting a new form of government , wisely preferred to establish a constitutional monarchy , rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Belgian people were in favor of monarchical institutions. * They were so fortunate as to be able to iind a prince ( Leopold of Coburg ) distinguished for his public and private virtues , whose nomination gave general satisfaction to the Belgian people . The stabilityevinced by this monarchy , at the time when almost every throne in Europe was more or less shaken by the revolutions of 1848 , proves the wisdom of their determination . Had they proclaimed a republic , they would probably have embroiled Belgium in contention with some of the great powers of Europe ; and , even if mutual jealousies had prevented these powers from attempting to destroy Belgic liberty , there is every reason to believe that a counter-revolution would have taken place in favor of the Prince of Orange , which , aided by the military power of the Dutch , would have replaced the dynasty of Nassau on the throne of Belgium . /z/ In a country where an aristocracy has long existed , whose names have been associated with the great achievements of its history , it is in vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accord to them a degree of respect that is withheld from those who possess no such hereditary title to public homage . This feeling is not only natural to man , but , when disconnected from servility and adulation , is highly commendable . The hope that such homage will be secured throughout all ages has been one of the most powerful and not the least honorable incentives that have impelled great men to noble undertakings ; and if such sentiments be justifiable , in its application to the descendants of illustrious men , how much more natural and legitimate is it when displayed towards distinguished characters whilst still alive ! The most confirmed democrat feels no jealousy , when /z/ he sees such men as Lord Chatham , the Duke of Wellinp:ton , - Lord Gough , Lord Denman , Lord Brougham , Lord Lyndhurst , or Lord Campbell in the legislature of his country . That place is theirs by virtue not of popular favor or of royal caprice it is theirs by right . As long as great abilities and great labors , devoted to the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so long men of this class can not be excluded from the legislature , whatever may be the form of government that prevails in the country to which they belong . It is to be regretted , indeed , that hitherto , in the British dominions , public opinion , which forces the sovereign , or rathef the minister , to acknowledge this right , and to confer titles of honor , or hereditary dignity , upon distinguished men , has not extended to a wider range . Hitherto , titles won by public service have been accorded almost solely to those who have rendered themselves eminent at the bar , in the senate , or by their military achievements . But supereminent attainments in science , in art , in literary composition , constitute claims to titular rank which have hitherto been overlooked in the United Kingdom . If an aristocracy is to be maintained , it is desirable that it should be placed upon the'widest possible foundation in the esteem and affection of the people . This can only be done by making titles of honor the reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornaments to deck the minions of ministers or kings . In every society , even the most democratical , there exists an aristocracy an aristocracy either of rank , of birth , of wealth , of talent , or of virtue ; and the aristocracy of wealth , or of talent , is generally found to be at least as overbearing as the aristocracy of rank , or of birth ; but the word is ordinarily applied to a titled nobility possessed of landed property . On theoretical principles , it is not easy to adduce sufficient reasons for assigning to an aristocracy hereditary functions of legislation . It may be said that it is desirable tliat considerable weight in the councils of the state should be given to men of large fortune , who naturally are averse to violent changes , who by their circumstances are equally independent of the monarch and of the people , and who , having a great permanent interest in the general welfare of the community , may be supposed to be desirous to promote and to uphold a good sys- i tem of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ilege in question ought not to be limited to a few individuals , j but should be shared through the medium of representation /z/ by all the wealthiest members of the community . Speculative principles , however , can not always be carried into eiFect with advantage ; and as long as an institution is found to promote the general welfare of the community , and to deserve the respect of mankind , it is not wise , in seeking after theoretical symmetry , which can never be perfectly attained , to overthrow that which has subsisted for ages . If , therefore , an aristocratical chamber , or hereditary peerage , has existed as a branch of the legislature for a considerable time , it is not desirable to deprive it altogether of legislative functions , unless it become utterly degraded , or irremediably opposed to the general interests of the people . Some years ago , when the idea of a Reform in the House of Lords was much agitated in popular assemblies , a proposal was put forward which seems well worthy of consideration . It was suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland should be preserved , and that the sovereign should still enjoy the prerogative of creating Peers without limitation as to numbers , but that none should enjoy a seat in the House of Lords , in its legislative capacity , except those who might be selected for that purpose by the people . This proposal seems to obviate many of those objections which may be urged against either an hereditary peerage or a peerage created for life . It would have the effect of inducing the peers to study as much as possible to deserve public favor , and thus establish a much greater degree of confidence than at present exists between the aristocracy and the people at large . Such an arrangement would also have the effect of removing the invidious distinction which at present subsists between the peerage of England and those of Ireland and of Scotland English peers now taking their seats in the House of Lords as a right belonging to each individual , whereas Irish and Scotch peers are excluded from the legislature , - except they happen to be selected as representative peers . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of representative peers ( to be invested for life , or for a limited period , with legislative functions ) by the choice of their brother patricians , is peculiarly liable to objection , unless arrangements be made for subdividing the whole order into electoral sections . Amongst every body of men party spirit will exist , and every such body will be divided into factions . Now , if the whole patrician order be called upon in mass to elect one or more representative peers , such elected peers will /z/ always belong to the party of the majority . Thus , if th ( majority of the Irish or Scotch peers be Tories , it can not be expected that they will elect Whig peers as representatives . The minority of the peerage is , therefore , left wholly unrepresented . A system of rotation , or of nomination by lot , though in itself objectionable , would be preferable to such an exclusive mode of selection ; but the election of peers by the freeholders of counties would obviate all these objections , as in one county a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lords , whilst a AVhig peer might be chosen in another . - If objections may be urged against the maintenance of an hereditary peerage as a branch of the legislature , still greater objections are applicable to a peerage created for life by the will of the monarch or of his ministers . It is natural to suppose that one who is raised to such a position will , generally speaking , lend himself to the designs of the power by which he has been elevated . The privilege of nominating peel 's for life becomes , also , a means of extensive influence , generating subserviency to the Court , not only on the part of the peers so created , but also on the part of all that class from which peers are usually chosen . It is also natural to suppose that peers named for life will unceasingly strive , by intrigue or adulation , to obtain an hereditary tenure of their dignities . Such has been in all ages the disposition of man when elevated to temporary authority , whether to the sovereignty itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobihty , who acquired such enormous power during the middle ages , for the most part the descendants of men who had originally obtained their dignities on the conditions of personal service , and even held their estates on life tenure . The counts ( comites ) and dukes ( duces ) were originally " companions " of the monarch , or " leaders " of his armies . During the rein of Charlemagne , a " count " was superseded in his delegated function with as little ceremony as is now shown in the removal of a governor from one of the colonies of the British Empire . There is one description of title to a seat for life in the House of Peers , which appears to be free from objection . In whatever manner a second legislative chamber may be constituted , all members of the House of Representatives , who have enjoyed the confidence of the people as elected representatives during a considerable period , say for twenty years , ought to be entitled to take their place in such second cham- /z/ ber . We shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature , to show that it is also desirable that retired judges should be admitted into one branch of the legislature by virtue of the qualification derived from their past services . If a Chamber of Peers be adopted as a branch of the legislature , it does not seem reasonable to limit their functions by unnecessary restrictions . An assembly such as the House of Lords which generally contains a considerable number of retired lawyers , chancellors , and judges , as well as others who have distinguished themselves in a political career in the House of Commons may be supposed to possess men peculiarly well qualified for the task of legislation . There is indeed one privilege which has been wisely reserved to the representatives of the people that of originating money bills . Popular assemblies seldom show much unwillingness to tax themselves for objects which they approve ; but , on the other hand , the people have always been disposed to resist with vehemence the imposition of taxes to which they have not themselves consented . In the British legislature , the jealousy with which the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lords , in regard of money bills , has been carried to an absurd extent ; it has not only been considered a breach of privilege if the Lords attempt to alter the provisions of any bill relating to the disposal of public money , but efforts have been made to extend this claim of privilege to bills which impose pecuniary penalties for offences . By the Constitution of the United States , it is provided that all bills which impose taxes must originate in the House of Representatives , but the Senate may amend and alter them subject of course to the subsequent approval of such amendments by the House of Representatives . It is quite reasonable that money bills should originate with the body which peculiarly represents the people at large ; but if objectionable clauses be introduced into such bills , it is equally reasonable tliat the coordinate branch of the legislature should be empowered to suggest amendments in their enactments . The Peers of Parliament possess , in the right of voting by proxy a privilege which ought not to be conceded to the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which are simple and definite , or in which pecuniary interests alone are at stake , vote by proxy may sometimes be permitted Avith advantage . In cases of this kind , it may /z/ fairly be supposed that the principal can give such instructions to the agent who possesses his confidence as will protect his interest or promote the object which he has in view ; but when legislative functions are confided to an individual , a public trust is reposed in him , which is to be exercised for the good of the whole community according to his own judgment , not according to the judgment of another . In regard of the varied discussions which present themselves for the consideration of a legislative assembly , it is impossible for an absent member to foretell the modification of opinion which such discussions might generate in his own mind . He therefore practically abdicates the exercise of his own reason , when he confides his proxy to another person . The absurdity of the practice is fully established by the exception to its exercise which is enforced in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or third reading of a bill but not in committee . The only plea that can be adduced in justification of proxy is the argument , that a member who distrusts his own judgment acts beneficially for the public when he places his vote at the disposal of some man whom he deems to be wiser than himself . But if this argument be valid inj regard of the discussions which take place upon one stage of a bill , it is surely valid in regard of all other stages . If the practice be justifiable in the House of Lords , why is it not equally applicable in the House of Commons ? In both cases common sense declares , that a member who is absent from a discussion ought not to be allowed to vote , because his judgment can not be affected by what is said in the discussion . We may here notice another privilege possessed by Peers of Parliament I mean that of formally recording their dissent by way of Pi'otest . In the discussion of public questions , every possible encouragement should be given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will be overruled by the good sense of the community ; if they be well founded , they will be strengthened by reflection , and the exposition of them will hasten a correction of the errors of preceding legislation . Many instances might be adduced to prove , that the opinions of a majority have been erroneous , whilst the recorded protest of the minority , when based upon sound reason , has served as a continual memento , suggesting a reversal of the proceedings in which truth and reason were at first overborne by mere number . The right of protest , advantageously possessed by one branch of the legislature , rniNCIPLES OP GOVERNMENT . 33 ought also to be enjoyed by the other . In the House of Commons , objections may indeed be recorded by way of amendment ; but this proceeding is not so satisfactory a means of setting forth the reasons against a measure as a protest , because it is not usual to set forth in an amendment the grounds upon which the opposition is founded , whilst in a protest the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I HAVE endeavored to prove that in those countries , in which there exists a strong predilection in favor of monarchical or aristocratical institutions , it is not expedient , in a fanatical iTesearch after imaginary and unattainable perfection , to over- * It is to be observed this chapter is rather a critique on the British House 3f Lords than a general disquisition on the functions and privileges of an , iristocracy ; on the general subject , we can not do better than hear the illxis:rious Burke 's opinion of " a natural aristocracy : " " A true natural aristocracy is not a separate interest in the state , or separable from it . It is an essential integrant part of any large body rightly onstituted . It is fonned out of a class of legitimate presumptions , which , akcn as generalities , must be admitted for actual truths .

" /z/ throw altogether those institutions ; but that efforts should be made so to combine , restrain , and apply the powers which belong severally to monarchy and aristocracy , as that they shall be made instrumental to the welfare of the community . This reasoning is , however , founded upon an assumption that such powers are to be exercised in concurrence with , if not in subordination to , those which properly belong to the people at large . All governments ought to be constituted with a view to the benefit , not of the few , but of the many , not of the rulers , but of the ruled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of the whole community . This is a fundamental principle which none will now venture to contest ; and since experience shows that those who possess power are generally disposed to misuse it , unless curbed by counteracting influences , it is essential to the welfare of a nation that the democracy should exercise a direct influence over the legislature . As personal participation in legislative proceedings can not , except in very small communities , be enjoyed by every individual in the state , it becomes necessary to resort to representation , as a means of giving effect to the opinions and wishes of the people . This is accomplished by dividing the country into electoral districts , and by giving to the inhabitants of each district the right to elect one or more persons to represent them in the legislature . The employment of this system of representation is the principal feature which distinguishes the constitutional or popular governments of modern days , not only from arbitrary governments , but even from the free republics of ancient times . The democracy of Rome exercised many of the privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction of the inhabitants of the Roman Empire participated in these privileges . Social self-government , indeed , under municipal institutions , existed in many parts of the Roman Empire ; but from participation in the general government of the Commonwealth , the inhabitants of the greater part of the territories subject to Rome were rigorously excluded . In modern times , on the contrary , it is at least a professed object of the policy of free states , as , for instance , . of the United States of America , of the United Kingdom , of France , Belgium , &c.,; to give to the inhabitants of the provinces rights equal and similar to those enjoyed by the citizens of the metropolis . I propose now to consider what are the conditions essential to a well-devised system of representation . As the conclu- PRlNCirLES OF GOVERNMENT . 35 sions at which we shall arrive in this inquiry are equally applicable under a constitutional monarchy us under a republic , it will not be necessary to submit to the reader such alternative modifications , in regard to a representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of the legislature , which , necessarily , vary according as its constituent elements may be derived from periodical election , or from hereditary succession . Questions connected with the representation of the people have of late given rise to more controversy than any other subject of political contention . What portion of the population ought to enjoy the suffrage ? In what manner votes should be given ; whether openly , or secretly ? Whether representatives should be allotted to districts in proportion to population , to extent and value of territory , or to taxation ? What qualification should be required on the part of the representative , in regard of age , sex , religion , or property ? Whether representatives ought to receive any remuneration ' for their services ? For what period representatives should be elected ? These are among the most prominent questions which have occasioned debate . It would require a volume to discuss at length all the arguments which have been urged in support of opinions more or less favorable to democratic power , in connection with these questions . We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary manner , the principal points at issue . 1 . What portion of the population ought to enjoy the privi lege of choosing ' Representatives ? It may be conceded as a general principle that it is desirable tliat every man in the community should participate in all civil rights , capacities , and privileges enjoyed by his fellowcitizens ; but if the circumstances of a population be such , that the establishment of universal suffrage would have the effect either of causing revolution , or of placing undue power in the hands of an individual , or of enabling an oligarchy to overrule the independent intelligence of the country , a statesman should pause before he yields to the suggestion of an abstract principle in favor of what appears to be a realization of democratic power , but which may , in truth , become the means of introducing arbitrary government . There have been but few countries in which the laboring population have possessed stifficient knowledge of political science to enable them to form correct and independent opinions respect- /z/ ing public affairs . They have , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them best entitled to their favor ; and thus the votes of thousands have often expressed only the opinions of a single individual . In such a state of society it is manifest that the reasoning intelligence of the country would be more fully represented if the franchise were limited to those who are qualified by education to form enlightened opinions respecting political questions , than if it were granted to every adult of the population . The usurpation by Louis Napoleon of autocratic power in France , and the ratification of that usurpation by the French people voting under universal suffrage , screened by the ballot , affords an illustration which shows that institutions the most democratic in form are not always those which are most imbued with the true spirit of liberty . In this case we have seen a very large majority of the electors ( above six millions out of seven millions ) voluntarily surrendering their national liberties to the will of a single man . It may be doubted whether such would have been the result of an appeal to the intelligent and independent middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples which show that the lowest class of the population have often been prompted to abdicate their political rights , and have invested a favorite leader with arbitrary power . On the other hand , it may be said that the instincts of every class , however devoid of education , enable them to know who are their real friends , and what measures are most conducive to their welfare ; that the interests of the poor require , even more than those of the rich , to be protected by representatives in whom they confide , inasmuch as wealth will always command influence ; that the exercise of political rights gradually trains men to the proper use of them ; that , in the present day , when every mechanic and every peasant possesses the means of acquiring political information , through the medium of the newspapers , the laboring population are as well qualified to form correct opinions upon public affairs as the half educated squires of former times ; and that the selection of a representative is one of those civic duties which require honesty of purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing is more certain than that the mass of the people almost always desire what is right , and are generally animated by noble impulses . A crafty politician may mislead /z/ them , and make them the dupes and instruments of his own individual interest or ambition ; but this can only be done by misrepresenting facts , or by suggesting to them false pretexts . In order to move them he must disguise his unworthy purposes , and appeal to the high and generous sentiments of man 's nature to their patriotism to their love of glory to their sense of justice or to their zeal for religion . A general review of these counterbalancing arguments , as well as of various considerations which the nature and limits of this work do not allow us to develop at length , may induce us to assent to the proposition , that as near an approximation to universal suiFrage should be made as the intelligence and peculiar circumstances of the population of each country will permit ; and that with this view such an extension of the franchise should , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as possible the political influence of each class to its capacity for self-government . Hitherto the possession of property , as evinced either by ' the occupation of tenements of a certain value , or by the pay- iment of taxes , has , in almost all countries , been made the test of electoral qualification . The professional man , the artist , die man of letters nay , even the capitalist , if he dwell in a odging , has been excluded , however highly educated he may ) e , from participating in the franchise enjoyed by the pettiest shopkeeper whose premises are of the required value . It ivould be desirable , if it were possible , to base the franchise ipon some standard which would measure the character and capacity of the elector , rather than his wealth ; but no such standard has hitherto been devised ; nor , indeed , does it seem possible to suggest a basis for the franchise which shall fulfil his requirement . But , at least , all persons whose educational qualifications have been established by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be entitled to vote wherever hey reside. * * The educational test seems not better suited than others to protect the ight of suffrage from abuse . For example , the majority of our rogues read . nd " vvrite , while many an honest man , even in this land of " common " chools , does neither . Is the peaceable , laborious , unambitious member of society , who pays all his honest debts and violates no law , to be disfranchised ailv because he is illiterate ? Or is his mother wit not as safe a gviide to the lallot box as the superficial smartness of his neighbor , one step above him n acquired information ? Within the past two years a test of this descripion has been established in Connecticut , and attempted in other eastern tates , chiefly with a - view to disfranchise citizens of foreign birth naturalized Lccording to law . If generally adopted , it would in some states , Vermont /z/ It would , perhaps , be desirable , that , in addition to the tleral representation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special representatives ; thus , for instance , that the clerical , the medical , and the legal professions should elect delegates to represent their special interests ; that , in like manner , the mercantile and other bodies should be specially represented , and also that the working classes should be able to command the advocacy of a certain number of delegates , appointed exclusively by themselves . Under the system of representation which has hitherto prevailed in the United Kingdom , various classes of the community have been left without champions in the legislature , whilst an undue preponderance has been virtually given to other classes . Thus the medical profession has supplied but a very small number of members to Parliament , whilst the legal profession has given at least its fair proportion of law makers ; yet medical men are peculiarly well qualified to take part in many important branches of legislation . In like manner , the working class , though the most numerous class in the state , have frequently been left without a single representative who could be said to derive his election exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in interest and feeling . The aristocracy and the middle class have practically usurped all control over the legislation of the United Kingdom . An extension of the suffrage does not afford a perfect remedy to injustice of this kind . It only tends to transfer the ascendency from the class which has hitherto enjoyed it to another which has been hitherto excluded from its due weight in the council of the empire , and thus to generate a new injustice . Universal suffrage , if employed by the working class with a view to their own exclusive interests , would give to that class a monopoly of the representation ; because in every country the working class constitutes a majority of the population . It is probable , indeed , that they would never systematically combine to exclude from the legislature the higher ranks of society ; for experience shows that in every country the lowest class are disposed to give an undue preference to persons and families who have long occupied an exalted station . But still a political organization must be regarded as imperfect , if it fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections which constitute the whole community . It might , perhaps , be difficult to frame a legislative enactment which would give to each class its just and appropriate representation ; but these difficulties are not insuperable . In all cases in which the members of a profession are incorporated in recognized associations , ( such , for instance , as those of the learned professions. ) it would be easy to provide for their representation in the legislature . A precedent for such special delegation is to be found in the case of the universities ; and if ever universal suffrage be conceded to the democracy , it would be only just and reasonable to provide some counterpoise to the undue ascendency of the laboring population , by securing to all other classes adequate representation by means of special delegation . The propriety of securing a due representation of different orders in the deliberative assemblies of a nation was recognized in several countries of Europe at a time when what is now called constitutional government can scarcely be said to have been fully organized in any part of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nobles , the clergy , and the tiers-etat were convened in separate chambers for the consideration of questions submitted to them by the sovereign . The States of Piedmont and of Sicily consisted , during the middle ages , of three orders the clergy , the nobility , and the towns . The Cortes of Arragon consisted of four estates the ecclesiastics , the nobles , the hidalgos or gentry , and the corporations of towns . The States of Sweden were composed of four orders the nobles , the clergy , the burgesses , and the peasants . In the systems of popular election hitherto adopted , the wishes of a majority of the electors determine the choice of the representatives . No provision has been made for securing to the minority a representation in the legislature . This appears to be a serious defect ; and it is a question well deserving of consideration whether some improvement might not be devised which would render representation more perfect . Suppose any given number of electoral divisions to contain in the aggregate 250,000 electors , of Avhom 150,000 entertain one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , is it reasonable that this minority should be left wholly unrepresented in the councils of the state ? yet , under the system of election at present in force , such is often the case . With a view to secure to the minority representation in the /z/ legislature , it has been proposed " to divide the representation into groups of three members , and to entitle each constituent to give either one vote for each of the three members , or three votes for one of them ; by which means the minority ( when they are over one fourth of the community ) would be sure of one representative . For example , in a constituency where the Tories numbered 300 , and the Liberals 105 , or very little over a fourth , the latter , by each of the 105 giving his three votes for the same candidate , would make his number on the poll 315 , or 15 votes more than the 300 electors could possibly give to their third man . " This suggestion ( subject , perhaps , to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing each party to the number of constituents belonging to such parties respectively ) well deserves the favorable consideration of reforming statesmen. * Where open voting prevails , persons who hold office , from which they are removable at the will of ministers of state , ought not to be allowed to vote at elections . If votes be given secretly , by way of ballot , it may not be improper to allow such individuals to exercise a right which naturally belongs to every member of the community ; but inasmuch as the votes of officials , if given openly , would not express their real sentiments , but would in almost all cases be in accordance with the directions of their superiors , the concession of this privilege to them would be simply an undue addition to the influence of the executive . Men of independent minds would prefer to be disfranchised rather than compelled to vote in obedience to a superior authority . It is cruel to place any person in a position in which his conscientious performance of duty may be at variance with his personal interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly . In determining the question , whether the choice of the electors should be recorded by way of open or of secret vote , we have to balance the advantages and disadvantages which belong to each of these modes of election ; and it is not easy to decide on which side the weight of reasoning and experience preponderates . For my own part I confess , that , ex- * Since the above section was written , a Reform Bill has been introduced into the British House of Commons , which has been framed with a view to obviate several of the defects in the representative system which have been noticed in the text . If the remedies suggested be found to operate advantageously , they will naturally be adopted hereafter , not only in the British colonies , but also in those foreign states which possejs representative assemblies . /z/ cept under the influence of imperious necessity , I could not advocate a system which would sliroud under secrecy the vote of the elector . . The choice of a representative is not only one of the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is also one of his highest duties ; and it is in the very nature of a public duty that it should be discharged under a sense of responsibility . If the elector vote in accordance with his avowed opinion , he does not require the protection of the ballot ; if , under the screen of the ballot , he vote in a manner inconsistent with his proclaimed opinion , he is guilty of base hypocrisy an hypocrisy which is engendered by the practice of secret voting . The only case , therefore , in which the protection of the ballot can be of use to an honest elector , is that in which such elector exercises perfect reserve with respect to his opinions . Ought such reserve to be encouraged in a free state ? Wherever elections are taken by ballot , reciprocity of individual sentiment can exist only in a very imperfect degree between the electors and the elected . Whatever may be the professions of the voter , the representative can never know , for a certainty , by whom he has been supported ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of open voting , between the representative and his supporters must be greatly impaired , if not totally annihilated . If the conduct of a representative be at variance with the declaration and promises which he made whilst ho was a candidate , he may fairly be questioned , cautioned , or rebuked by those who have assisted to elect him . But no such responsibility can be exacted by any individual elector , if the votes have been given secretly , for no certain assurance exists that the party who questions the conduct of the representative was one of his supporters , and a representative will seldom admit the right of those who have not appointed him as their trustee , to call him to account for the manner in which he has ' executed his trust . On the other hand , the social circumstances of a community may be such as to render necessary the protection which the ballot affords . Publicity of voting exposes the elector both to temptations and to dangers , from which the ballot exempts him. * /z/ Secret voting tends to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the elector . It is possible , indeed , that wholesale bribery would , in small constituencies , be facilitated and screened by the ballot ; but such corruption could not be conducted by way of separate negotiation between individual electors and the candidate . The bribery must be managed by agents , who would contract for the return of the candidate , and make arrangements with the electors , so as to secure his return ; giving to each elector a proportion of the gross amount received from the candidate or from his friends , in consideration of such return . In large constituencies it would be difficult to organize such a machinery as would be required to give effict to this plan of wholesale corruption . Pohtical venality has become so systematic in England , that it could scarcely be carried to a greater extreme , if it were sanctioned by the express permission of law , instead of being hypocritically denounced in all legislative proceedings , as it now is , even by those who practise it without scruple . The law rightly treats the franchise as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view to the benefit of the whole community ; not as a property , which may be bought and sold for the advantage of individuals ; but few elections take place , in which this principle is purely and rigidly carried into practical operation . The borough elections of England have hitherto been disgraced by venality in its most disgusting forms . Canciidates have been recommended to constituencies , not by their virtues or their talents , but by their liberality in administering bribes to the avaricious , and intoxicating liquors to the multitude in such case well called " the swinish " multitude . Nor does this corrupt traffic cease with the occasions which called it forth , or limit its operations to the lowest class of electors . In its more refined form , it establishes a compact between the representative and his supporters , by which he is held bound to obtain for those who have placed him in the legislature as large a share as possible of official patronage . It thus degrades the representative from the station of a legislator into that of an agent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barter his vote to the minister , in exchange for the official situations required to satisfy the hungry expectations of his constituents . There have been found some who have contended that the acceptance of a bribe in consideration for a vote is not a vio- /z/ lation of morality , and , therefore , ought not to be punished by law as an offence . This position does not appear to be tenable . If the suffrage were given to individuals as a property it might reasonably be sold . A shareholder in a mercantile company may , under some circumstances , be justified in voting under the influence of pecuniary considerations ; but the political franchise is given to the elector as a trust , which is to be exercised for the good of the whole community . It is , therefore , an offence , morally speaking , as discreditable on the part of an elector to sell his vote for a corrupt consideration as it is for a judge to accept a bribe , or for a minister of state to sell the patronage of official situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should impose a heavy punishment upon the delinquent . It does not , however , seem to be necessary or expedient to delay the poll at an election by requiring the voter to take an oath against bribery . Generally speaking , the exaction of an oath has no other effect than that of adding the sin of perjury to the original offence against which the oath is intended as a security . But , be this as it may , it is obviously reasonable that if an oath against bribery be imposed upon the elector , it ought also to be exacted from the candidate . The sin of him who tempts is at least as great as that of him who yields to the temptation . The British House of Commons , which hypocritically affects a virtuous indignation against corruption at elections , and requires the elector to take an oath against bribery , has more than once refused to exact a similar oath from political candidates . This inconsistency can scarcely excite surprise , when it is remembered that a large proportion of the members of that assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat in the lenrislature . Considering the extent to which venality in one form or otlier has prevailed in the management of the House of Commons since the Revolution of 1G88 , it is truly wonderful that English liberty should have survived through such an era of political corruption . Fortunately , none of the ministers of state liave , during that period , been animated with the disposition Df a Stratford , nor have any of the sovereigns of Great Britain been stimulated by the ambition of a Cassar or of a N'apoleon . Ministers have employed , without scruple , all the ntluence which the command of patronage gives , but they iave sought not so much to augment thereby the prerogative /z/ of the sovereign as to secure their own personal aggrandizement , and the power of the aristocracy . Had an able and ambitious statesman supported the designs of a usurping sovereign , the boasted liberties of Englishmen would long since have been sold by the representatives to whom they have confided the guardianship of their political interests . Perhaps the increased power of public opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now independent of ministerial influence , may guarantee the present generation from such dangers ; but it is the duty of patriotic statesmen to guard as much as possible against contingent peril , and if the use of the ballot at elections tend to protect the people from the evils of political corruption , such a tendency becomes a powerful argument in favor of its adoption . In the United Kingdom the elector has also been habitually subjected to coercion on the part of landlords or employers , and to intimidation on the part of mobs . It can not be denied that in many elections the real wishes of the voters are thwarted by the operation of this undue influence upon their minds . This indisputable fact constitutes a powerful if not unanswerable argument in favor of the ballot . In vain we contend that every elector ought to be perfectly free to vote for the individual whom his unbiased preference would select as his representative . In vain we argue that a landlord or an employer is not more entitled to expect that the elector who is dependent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a representative , than he is entitled to exact conformity to his wishes in the performance of any other duty by such elector . No one ever hears of any interference on the part of a landlord with the conscience of his tenant , when the tenant is called upon to act as a juryman . No landlord , however tyrannical , would dare to justify such an interference . Why should not a similar state of feeling exist with regard to the election of a representative ? The duty of an elector is not less solemn than that of a juryman . Why should not his right to the free and conscientious exercise of his own choice be held equally sacred and inviolable ? If a proper state of opinion existed with respect to the rights and duties of electors , open voting would be preferable to vote by ballot . la any country in which public virtue exists secret voting ought to be avoided . But if public feeling be irremediably corrupt , a system of secret voting must be adopted , not because the practice is in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils . /z/ " Whilst we reluctantly an-ive at this conclusion , we may obFcrve , that before secrecy , which is in itself objectionable , shall be subritituted for open voting , it would be desirable to try whether an extension of the suffrage , and an enlargement of the constituencies , would not obviate the evils of bribery and intimidation , for which the ballot is proposed as a remedy . A large constituency can not easily be acted upon by these influences , more especially if the votes be taken in such a manner as renders it difficult to bias the choice of the electors by extraneous combination . 3 . Whether representatives should he allotted to districts in proportion to taxation to extent and value of territory or to population ? Tliis likewise is a question which has given rise to much debate , and respecting which arguments are nicely balanced . It is alleged that as there ought to be no taxation without representation , so the representative influence assigned , either to individual electors , or to electoral districts , ought to be graduated according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or such districts . This principle has often been acted upon in constructing the organization required for the administration of local taxes , as , for instance , in the scale of plural voting , which prevails in the election of guardians under the English Poor Law . But although , in some particular classes of operations , there may be special reasons for adopting taxation as the basis for an allotment of representative influence , it can not be safely so employed in the construction of a representative system which shall embrace the wants , interests , and government of the whole community . In the complicated arrangements of modern finance , it would be almost impossible to frame a just scale of representation upon this basis . Under a system of indirect taxation the customs , or excise duty , which is levied in one district , is ultimately paid by a consumer who lives in another district , and it would be most unfair to give to that district , in which the tax is levied , a disproportionate influence in the legislature , merely because it apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if all the difficulties which render it almost impossible to allot representatives in just proportion on the basis of taxation could be obviated , there would still remain to be overcome the objection , which is an unanswerable argument against plural voting in the case of individual electors that the poor have as much interest as the rich in the good gov- /z/ ernment of the state , and that they require , even still moi than the rich , to be protected by representation in the legis lature . This objection applies also to the principle which would assign representation to electoral districts in numbers proportionate to the value of such districts . There is much plausibility in the reasoning which contends , that a rich mercantile town , containing a given amount of population , ought to possess more influence in the legislature than an impoverished rural population , consisting of the same number of individuals ; but the poorer a district may be the more is it probable that its interests will be neglected ; and it is not impossible that the acquisition of influence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to redeem it from poverty . Different nations have acted on different principles in framing their representative systems . In the United Kingdom no one specitic basis has been recognized in the allotment of representatives to various sections of the community . In England population was to a certain extent taken into account in the reform of the representative system in 1831-32 , but it can not be said to have been the basis upon which representation was founded . On the other hand , in legislating for Ireland and Scotland , Parliament refused altogether to take into account the number of the population in relation to the claims of these countries to proportionate representation . In the United States of America population is the sole standard which governs the allotment of political influence in the delegation of members to the House of Representatives ; but the Senate is constituted without regard to the population of the States which it represents in Congress . After a full consideration of all that may be said in favor of the several modes of adjusting representative influence that have been suggested or adopted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general welfare of a nation is best secured by taking population as the basis of representation . The application of this principle , as well as of all other general principles , must , however , be modified by circumstances . Few theoretical dogmas can be universally applied with advantage . Thus , for instance , in the case of the Australian colonies , we find that an inordinate proportion of the whole population has been tempted to crowd into cities and towns , in consequence of the difficulty of procuring small allotments of land in the country that has hitherto prevailed . The province /z/ of Victoria , a colony covering an area of above 60,000,000 acres , contains at present a population which is estimated at about 300,000 , of whom not less than 60,000 are supposed to reside at Melbourne . Now , if representation were to be allotted in proportion to population alone , Melbourne would send to the legislature not less than one fifth of the whole number of representatives , and thus acquire an overwhelming influence , when compared with that possessed by the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely be considered compatible with a due regard to all the interests , actual and prospective , of a rising colony . 4 . Whether any qualification should be required on the part of the representative ? The attainments to be desired in a representative are , competent ability and strict integrity . Now , as no formal test can be appHed which will guarantee the possession of these attributes , it will be found expedient , in the selection of representatives , to rely upon the judgment of the electors unfettered by restrictions , rather than upon any artificial requirements . It will naturally be asked , whether this latitude of selection ought to extend to the female sex , and whether women should be capacitated by law for the exercise of political functions . If this question were to be treated as a mere theorem to be determined by argument , it would be easy to demonstrate that women are in all respects , except physical strength , equal , if not superior , to men ; that their feelings are more pure and unselfish , their perception more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , which requires the exercise , not of physical strength , but of virtue and intelligence , woman is as well qualified by nature as man . In regard of educational attainments , too , it may with truth be urged , that in modern society the intellectual acquirements of women , on the average , surpass those of men . The principle of the Salio law , which , in some countries , limits to males succession to the crown , has been repudiated with advantage by England and other states . At this moment * queens occupy three of the thrones Europe ; and the experience of present as well as of former times tends to prove that the functions of sovereignty are performed by women with an efiicacy equal , if not superior , to that which belongs to the rule of man . If , then , women are found to be qualified to exercise the highest of all Written in 1853. /z/ political functions , it is difficult to discover any reason for supposing that they would be incapable of performing those which belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to any of the professions or occupations of life in which great corporeal strength is not required . From these considerations we may infer that realms would have been at least as well governed as they have hitherto been , if women had participated in all legislative and administrative duties , and in all political rights ; but it is not equally manifest that the happiness of either sex , or of society at large , would have been thereby augmented . Women occupy a sphere different from that of men , not because they are inferior in mental endowments , but because nature indicates that the gentler sex should voluntarily withdraw from the strife of public exertion , and wholly surrender themselves to the affections and duties of domestic life . In that sphere , woman is the equal , the companion , the friend of man ; her influence not to say her rule is almost absolute ; by her virtues and endearments she commands his willing homage , and wins his affectionate gratitude as the guardian of his hearth , the mother of his children , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrons and of maids were directed to the acquirement of political fame rather than of the affections of their husbands and lovers , if their energies were employed in the struggles of political faction rather than in the peaceful pursuits of a happy home , the relations at present subsisting between the sexes would be wholly disturbed . In the rivalry of competition , that tenderness which sheds its soothing charm over the asperities of life would be lost , the duties of the domestic circle would be neglected or confided to menials , and the happiness of both sexes would be sacrificed to the pursuit of an illusory advantage . Hence , although it be undeniable that many women are much better qualified to discharge legislative functions than the men who now exclude them , yet it is doubtful whether , upon the whole , the well-being of society would be promoted by the concession of political rights to the female sex . Perhaps , however , the principle of exclusion which has hitherto prevailed has been carried too rigidly into operation . Women are allowed to drudge in factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences , but they are excluded from nobler vocations , which they are peculiarly qualified to discharge with advantage to themselves and to others . The medical art , for instance , is an occupation /z/ peculiarly adapted for female practitioners . That women , when sulfering from disease , should be under the necessity of consultint ; men , is a practice obviously repugnant to every natural sentiment of delicacy . Women , therefore , instead of being excluded from the medical profession , ought rather to be encouraged , to qualify themselves for its exercise , and to practise it under a diploma , with the same sanction that is accorded to medical graduates of the male sex . Perhaps it will be thought that preponderating arguments have been urged in favor of a like admissibility of women to the duties of legislation ; but as the female sex , in general , acquiesce with entire satisfaction in their exclusion from political franchises , it is not desirable to encourage an agitation in favor of " the rights of women , " until it can be clearly demonstrated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapacitate them for the performance of public duties . Whether ministers of religion should be debarred from the exercise of legislative functions , is a question which admits of much doubt and controversy . If a clergyman possess in a high degree the qualifications which fit him for the performance of legislative duties , and which entitle him to public confidence , it seems unreasonable that the public should be deprived of his services ; nor is it desirable that the clergy should be left wholly without representation in the great council of the nation . On the other hand , it is found , that the intrusion of ecclesiastics into secular affairs almost invariably tends to lower public respect for their sacred functions : it is imagined that their thoughts ought to be directed to the higher concerns of a future world , rather than to the petty business and miserable strife of this transitory life . It is believed that if a clergyman be earnestly engaged in the cure of souls , his time will be abundantly occupied with his spiritual duties . It is thought that the incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a nature that a clergyman can not take part in them without lowering the dignity of his person and oifice . Upon these grounds the clergy have , in England and America , been rendered incapable of being elected as representatives of the people . In England the clergy of the Anglican Church possess , as an order in the state , no inconsiderable political influence , by the presence of the bishops in the House of Peers . In other countries , the clergy have generally been invested with extensive privileges of a political kind ; in some , an undue ascendency has been /z/ given to this order . In the German Empire , for instance , no less than three of the electors of the emperor were ecclesiastics , the Archbishops of Treves of Cologne , and of May ence , at a time when the whole number of electors was no more than seven . In reference to this difficult question , I incline to think thai the clergy ought , in some way or other , to find admission int at least one branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time , brought under consideration , wit which the clergy are more conversant than any other members of society , such , for instance , as those connected with educa tion , and their participation in these debates would be at tended with advantage . What would be the best mode o introducing this element into legislative deliberations , is question which must be differently solved in each country , according to the character of its institutions , and according t the tendencies with regard to religious opinion which happe to prevail in it . In the United Kingdom a clergyman is disqualified fro sitting in Parliament , even though he have abandoned th exercise of clerical functions . Attendance upon the sitting of a legislative assembly may be incompatible with the du discharge of parochial duties ; and , on this ground , the exclu sion of officiating clergymen may be justifiable ; but when a ecclesiastic retires from the exercise of his profession , th reasons for such disqualification cease to exist.f By a singular inconsistency , the English law debars a retired clergyman from Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , the functions of a magistrate tend frequently to bring a clerical justice of the peace into collision with his parishioners , and to make him an object of aversion rather than of affection to them . The objections which may * The apparent anomaly of clerical representation in any council for secular affairs , might , perhaps , be obviated by this distinction : in countries the establishment of the church- preceded the state , it would seem essential to the latter that it should have the asible aid and sanction of the church ; where the state , as in Caesar 's time , preceded the church , or , as in Muscovy before its conversion , or in this country at the revolution , it is wholly optional with the institution in possession of power to share its cares and honors vith churchmen , or to refuse to do so . By the church , in this relation I mean any united body of religious teachers , sufficiently numerous to have a national character and influence . M. t In the United States , clergymen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state or federal legislatures . The Massachusetts House of Representatives , in 1854 , contained fifty-five clerical members , including the speaker . /z/ PRINCIPLES OF GUVCKiSMJSijlT. 51 be urged against the admissibility of clergymen into the legislature are not so strong as those which apply to his investiture with magisterial functions . Perhaps clergymen , while actually administering parochial duties , ought to be excluded from both legislative and magisterial functions , but such disqualification ought not to be continued in the persons of those who retire from the active engagements of the clerical profession . In many countries it has been thought expedient to prevent very young men from entering the legislature , and it has been provided that no one should be elected as a representative of the people until he shall have attained the age of twenty-five or thirty years . Such a restriction seems wholly unnecessary . If the disposition of a young man lead him into public life , and if he be able , by his character and capacity , to win the confidence of a constituency , the sooner he enters upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner will he become prepared to be useful to his country . In the management of the affairs of a great empire , such as that of the United Kingdom , France , or America , many years of study and preparation are required to form an able statesman ; and this apprenticeship can be served in no school with so much advantage as in the Imperial legislature . An assembly composed wholly of very young men would , perhaps , be too much disposed to act upon hasty impulse ; but since the majority of all legislative assemblies is composed , in the natural course of public affairs , of persons advanced in life , no such danger is likely to arise from the presence of a few young men ; whilst , on the other hand , the introduction of a considerable amount of youthful feeling into a mixed assembly tends to infuse a spirit of vigor , promptitude , and generous emotion , which might perhaps be wanting in a body composed exclusively of men who have been rendered slow and cautious and selfish by the disappointments which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious test is forbidden by those principles of religious toleration which aVe essential to the good government and happiness of every community . We must , therefore , repudiate altogether the idea of exacting conformity to any peculiar system of religious belief , as a qualification requisite in a representative . All citizens are entitled to equal justice , and to equal enjoyment of civil privileges . All are compelled to undertake the burdens which belong to civilized society . All ought , therefore , to share the advantages /z/ " vvhicli belong to social institutions . In the history of mankind it is impossible to point out a single instance , in which the violation of this principle of toleration has not been attended with consequences injurious to the state which has infringed it ; and in many cases such violations have been the immediate cause of the downfall of nations . Amongst the circumstances which produced the decline and fall of the Roman Empire , religious persecution occupies a prominent place Religious bigotry has reduced Spain , once the leading poweij of Europe , to a condition in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the European Commonwealth . Religious persecution deprived Belgium and France , in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , of several hundred thousands of their most industrious citizens-t Religious persecution has rendered Ireland a cause of weakness as well as a theme of reproach to the British Empire . A thousand other instances might be cited in which religious bigotry has been injurious to nations . We may , therefore , affirm , without hesitation , that neither on the part of the electors nor of their representatives should any disqualification be allowed on account of their religious opinions . Some who have reasoned on political subjects have main- * The instance of Spain is not cited here with the author 's usually sound information . An inquiry into the history of the collapse of that great jjower bring to light a variety of influences cooperating to produce the deplorable result . The and courageous Balmes has expounded this question inth his customary vigor , while showing that " the empire of the Catholic religion coincided , in Spain , with the final preponderance of absolute monarchy . " He clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes : 1 . The premature and immoderately extensive development of the old local institutions ; 2 . The formation of the Spanish nation out of a successive reunion of very heterogeneous parts , all possessing institutions extremely popular ; 3 . The establishment of the centre of power where the crown was strongest ; 4 . The extreme abundance of wealth , " which lulled the Spaniards to sleep in the arms of prosperity ; " o . The great military means in the possession of the sovereign , at the critical moment of the centralization of institutions . To all who desire to possess the corrective to Mr O'Brien 's view of the cause of Spain 's decay , I strongly recommend that entire chapter of Balmes , ( Ixvi . ) M. f The " persecution " of the Huguenots here alluded to partook more of the character of a political proscription than of a religious exclusion . The Huguenots were , says a late French historian , " a republic in the heart of a monarchy " a state within the state with ports , cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they and France could long coexist ; finally , France ejected them , I am not apologizing for one cruel or false action of the rulers of France at that time ; but let the question stand , where the facts will support it , between the state as such , and an armed , fortified sect within and upon its borders . That Belgium and France so soon recovered their removal , shows that they could hardly have been a vital part of the nation at the time of their excision . M. /z/ tained that holders of office under the executive ought to be excluded from the House of Representatives ; again , in some countries as for instance in France ministers have been allowed to sit and speak in the legislature , but have been prohibited from voting . Much inconvenience would arise from the total absence of the officers of the executive from the deliberations of the legislature , and if they be declared ineligible to sit as elected representatives , they oughtat least , to be permitted to speak for the purpose of giving explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the British constitution in requiring that the member of Parliament who accepts office under the Crown should thereby vacate his seat , and that he should be reelected before he can again sit in the House of Commons . Subject to this precaution , administrative officers , whose functions are not incompatible with attendance in the legislature , ought to be eligible to be deputed as representatives of the people . Ministerial responsibility is greatly promoted by the presence in the legislature of those who practically administer public affairs . Undoubtedly , it is not to be desired that a large proportion of the members of either branch of the legislature should consist of persons holding offices or pensions under the executive more especially if such office holders be liable to be deprived of their emoluments , at the will of the sovereign or of ministers ; but the head of every public department ought to be allowed to sit in the legislature , and to take part in its discussions . If he be elected as a representative of the people , he ought to be permitted to vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organ of the executive , it seems preferable that he should not be allowed to vote . Whether judges should be eligible to be chosen as representatives of the people , is a question which has given rise to much debate . Upon one hand it is contended , that the office of judge , more than any other , ought to be kept free from the bias of political partisanship , and further , that its duties are generally so onerous as fully to occupy the energies of the most vigorous intellect , so that whatever time is devoted by a judge to political avocations , is abstracted from the cares of his own appropriate functions . On the other hand it is argued , that there is no class of legislators so well qualified for the task of law-making as those who are daily engaged in the practical administration of the laws ; that the leisure hours of the judges can not be better employed than in attending the /z/ sittings of the legislature ; that it is impossible to eliminate altogether from the mind of a judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naturally affect the mind of every citizen ; and that , in point of fact , it generally happens that lawyers are raised to the bench , in consideration not solely of their acquirements , but also of some political service which they have rendered to the party to which they have been attached ; that it is not found that such party attachment disables a judge from acting impartially in the adjudication of cases brought before him ; and that , therefore , the pubhc ought not , upon grounds which are merely speculative , to be deprived of the advantage which would arise from the presence of these functionaries in the legislature . It seems to me that the arguments in favor of their eligibility preponderate over those which may be urged in support of their exclusion ; but a provision , such as has been suggested , for enabling all judges who have retired after a certain period of judicial service to take their seats in one chamber of the legislature , would go far to secure the advantages which may be expected from the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination of the question at issue less detrimental than it might otherwise be . Amongst the supporters of aristocratical institutions , there is a strong leaning in favor of a property qualification , without which it is contended that none should be allowed to become representatives of the people . It is urged that adventurers , who do not possess a pecuniary independence , are more reckless with respect to the consequences of their acts than those who have something to lose ; that they are more liable to be seduced by corrupting influences , and to lend themselves to the designs of ambitious or usurping rulers . Now , though we may concede that this apprehension is not unfounded , we have to set against these apprehensions the injury which is sustained by the community from being deprived of the services of many wise and upright citizens , who do not possess large pecuniary resources . Every restriction which tends to confine the choice of electors to men of wealth limits , to a proportionate extent , their power of selecting able and virtuous men . There is reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have been best qualified for the task of legislation liave been excluded from the House of Commons by the law which requires that members of Par- /z/ liament sliould possess a certain amount of property ; whilst it has been found that adventurers have experienced little difficulty in evading this law . Akin to a property qualilication are the enactments which render it impossible for a candidate to engage in a contested election , or to defend his return , without incurring a very considerable , nay , often a ruinous outlay . The laws relating to elections ought to be so framed that the successful candidate should not be involved in any expense . If he accept a seat in the legislature , with a view to the public advantage , not with a view to his own private interest , there is no reason why he should be subjected to any cost . If , on the conti-ary , he be swayed by less worthy motives , the expenditure which he is compelled to incur in obtaining a seat affords him a pretext for using the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tends to exempt him from responsibility . One who has purchased his seat naturally thinks that he is justified in employing the influence which it gives him for his own , rather than for the public , advantage . We may here also observe , that if the arrangements for registering votes , for taking the poll , and for trying controverted elections , be such as involve the candidate in great expense , these charges tend to exclude from the legislature all who are not possessed of superfluous wealth , and thereby to prevent the choice of the electors from being determined by consideration of the abilities and character of the candidates . Under the system for registering voters which has prevailed in the United Kingdom of late years , many members or candidates , who have been anxious to sit in Parliament , have been compelled to retain professional agents for the purpose of watching the registry , as well as to incur other expenses connected with registration , which altogether form a large amount of charge . By the laws relative to polling at elections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking the poll ; and by the arrangements incidental to those laws , candidates or their friends have been subjected to much cost in bringing electors to the poll . Then , again , after the elected candidate has taken his seat , he is liable to the expenses incidental to a petition against his return amounting frequently to several thousands of pounds sterling . When all these liabilities are taken into consideration , it will be evident , that the honor of holding a seat in FarUament has become , in the case of a great majority of the /z/ constituencies of the United Kingdom , a privilege to whi none but the wealthy can aspire . The obvious remedy for this evil is to simplify all the proceedings relative to elections , so much that no questions can arise which require legal discussion , or entail expense upon the candidate . In England , lor instance , there are a great variety of different qualifications of voters , whereas the number might be reduced to two or three , of so simple a nature that no discussion relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exjenses of the poll ought to be paid by the public . The interests of the constituency , not those of the candidate , are at stake in every legitimate election ; and therefore honest candidates ought not to be mulcted on account of their desire to serve their country , nor should dishonest candidates be allowed to purchase the opportunity of serving themselves by the acquisition of a seat in Parliament . In order to prevent vain and frivolous contests , it may , perhaps , be expedient that candidates should be required to give security for the payment , in the event of their defeat , of a small specified contribution towards defraying the expenses of the poll . It may also , perhaps , be advisable to require that no one shall be considered a candidate , unless he shall have been put forward upon a requisition signed by a specified number of voters . Provisions to this effect have been introduced into the constitutional ordinance recently enacted for the Cape of Good Hope . The polling places ought to be appointed , so that each elector should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of election , and return on the same day . By such an arrangement , all expenses connected with the conveyance of electors to the poll might be obviated . The adjustment of controverted elections is a question of greater difficulty . It is impossible to avoid expense , if election petitions be tried at the central seat of government , because it often becomes unavoidably necessary to bring up great numbers of witnesses , whose expenses can not be by themselves . Legal assistance must also be obtained by the petitioning candidate and by the sitting member ; and the fees exacted in this department of professional labor are most extravagant . The costs of the petitioner , or of the sitting member , can not be thrown upon the constituency , in the case of controverted elections , without unduly encouraging litigation . I am inclined to think that the trial of a controverted erection /z/ would be best adjudicated on the spot where the election was held , by a commission of judges , three in number , appointed by the representative chamber of the legislature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunal , I defer for the present the observations which suggest themselves in connection with this subject . 5 . Allowances to Representatives . In consistency with the foregoing views , we can scarcely refuse to admit that the representative ought to be relieved from the necessity of incurring expense whilst attending to the duties of his function . An allowance may therefore be provided to defray his indispensable expenditure ; but care should be taken that it shall not be so ample as to induce candidates to seek a seat in the legislature as a means of obtaining an income . The position and the duties of a legislator are of such a nature that they will always attract the aspirations of public-spirited and philanthropic men . It is therefore unnecessary to employ pecuniary remuneration as an inducement to tempt such persons to undertake this office ; but if large emoluments were attached to the office of representative , many persons very ill qualified for the duties of legislation would be induced to use every sort of exertion probably the most unworthy artifices to obtain this position , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind , but simply as a situation which bestows wealth as well as distinction . In former times it was customary in England to provide an allowance for the member whilst he was attending Parliament ; and in the United States of America each member of the legislature receives a daily allowance of eight dollars , to indemnify him for the expenditure which he is compelled to incur while attendinsr the sittings of the legislature . 6 . For what term ought the Representative to be chosen " to use the phraseology of British politicians what ought to be the duration of Parliament ? In answering this question , I say , without hesitation , that seven years is too long a period , and that one year is too short a term for the duration of the representative trust . By those who are favorable to septennial Parliaments it is frequently argued , that , in point of fact , the average duration of Parliaments has not exceeded ybwr years , and that in no recent case has it exceeded six years . But even if the truth of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative /z/ assembly ought to be elected for so long a period as six or seven years . Men generally speculate upon the contingency which is most in accordance with their wishes ; and a representative who seeks a seat in the legislature for his own personal aggrandizement , not for the public good , will feel himself much more free to pursue his selfish aims if he be elected for a period of seven years , than if he were under the necessity of being subjected to the ordeal of popular election after the lapse of three or four years . Opportunities as well as temptations of corruption more frequently present themselves during the longer than during the shorter period . And even assuming that the representative is not disposed to . deviate from political honesty , yet , if elected for seven years , he is rendered too independent of the control of public opinion . On the other hand , though in the affairs of a parish or of a corporation annual elections may be preferable to elections for a longer term , yet , in the complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition of a legislature do not seem to be expedient . It is impossible for any individual , however gifted he may be , to become thoroughly versed in the legislative proceedings of a great empire within a period of one , or even of two years . It is necessary that he should acquire a knowledge of the forms of the assembly to which he has been introduced , of the conventionalities of debate , of the opinions and character of his fellow-representatives , as well as that he should be master of the various branches of political science which may elsewhere be acquired by study , or by intercourse with mankind . Nor is one year a term sufficiently long to enable constituents to judge of the capacity , character , and tendencies of their representative . An honest representative frequently finds himself under the necessity of giving a vote which may not be acceptable to his constituents . If he have to solicit their suffrages immediately after the occurrence of such a contingency , he may naturally expect to lose his seat , unless he have previously had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his principles sound . Upon the foregoing grounds we may safely conclude , that in the election of representatives the duration of the legislative trust ought not to exceed four years , nor be less than three years . /z/ The foregoing observations have been penned upon the supposition that what is called a " limited or constitutional monarchy " is the form of government under consideration . But many contingencies have occurred , and many will hereafter occur , in which a people find themselves compelled to reconstruct the whole of their political organization . Let us now consider the case in which no existing prejudices or influences make it desirable to maintain the monarchical form of government . Let us imagine the case of a country in which there is no hereditary aristocracy , and no existing prejudice in favor of aristocratic rule , but in which an enlightened people are desirous to establish for themselves such a form of government as will best conduce to their social welfare and happiness . The problem to be solved is , What form of government ought they to choose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in concert with the chief magistrate , or ought there to be only one legislative chamber ? If there be a second chamber , how ought it to be constituted ? Ought it to consist of hereditary members , or to be composed of members nominated for life , or of members elected for a limited term ? Whence should its authority be derived ? from the head of the state , or from the people at large , or from a section of the people ? Ought the chief magistrate , the head of the executive , to hold his office by virtue of hereditary descent , or of election ? If by election , ought he to be appointed for life , or for a limited term of years ? Ought he to take part in legislative proceedings , or ought his functions to be limited exclusively to executive duties ? What ought to be the prerogatives , attributes , and duties of the executive ? What classes of public affairs ought to be placed under the control and administration of municipal bodies ? How ought municipal bodies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a country to be organized ? What general principles ought to govern their operations ? Let us proceed to consider these questions in a summary manner , avoiding as much as possible elaborate details . /z/ Reason and experience seem to suggest a preference for that form of constitution which vests the legislative power in two coordinate chambers . There is a tendency in all assemblies more especially in those which emanate immediately from the people at large to be swayed by temporary gusts of passion or prejudice . Even in the exercise of calm opinion upon abstract questions , prevailing theories frequently so take possession of the public mind , as to blind it to the force of all antagonistic reasoning . If the legislative authority reside in a single assembly , elected by the will of the people , and of short duration , legislation will naturally follow all the caprices of public opinion , and irreparable mischief may be inflicted before the period of reaction shall arrive . Any complication of the structure of the legislature which tends to prevent the hasty adoption of ill-considered measures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on such occasions . If the legislature consist of a single chamber , such a check may partially be established by providing that only one third , or some other proportion , of the whole body , shall be elected at a given period , so that not more than one third could be simultaneously and immediately subject to the impulses incident to a popular election . This is the principle in accordance with which the municipal councils of the United Kingdom are now constituted : and it has been found to operate advantageously as well as to give satisfaction . But if it be possible to form two legislative chambers , which deserve and possess the confidence of the community , a legislature so divided appears to be preferable to a single council , even though that council should be constituted in the best possible manner . It will be admitted that hasty legislation is checked by such a division ; but some will apprehend an evil of an opposite kind , and imagine that two legislative bodies , instead of acting in harmony , will perpetually strive to thwart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be expected that such will be the result ; but if they are both dependent upon the people at large , there seems to be no ground for this apprehension . Occasions will arise in which they may take /z/ different views of the public interest , and , in such cases , legislative action upon the question at issue will be suspended for a season . But no evil can result from such suspension . In the case of private aifairs , the maxim , " When you are in doubt , do n't act , " is an invaluable rule for the guidance of individual conduct ; nor is it less wise when applied to the proceedings of public assemblies . Time extinguishes doubts , and it is better that action should be deferred until conviction is established , than that ill-advised and precipitate measures should be adopted upon problematical speculation . Assuming , then , that it is desirable that the legislature should consist of two chambers , we have now to inquire in what manner ought these chambers to be constituted ? Having discussed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional monarchies , the " House of Representatives " should be formed , I have only to refer the reader to that discussion , with a view to the formation of opinions respecting the constitution of this branch of the legislature . AVith regard to the construction of a Senate , or second branch of the legislature , it is difficult to say which of many proposals is to be preferred ; but this inquiry will be facilitated by laying down the following negative propositions , which do not appear to admit of dispute . 1 . Tlie Senate ought not to he self-elected . In many republican , or quasi-republican states the Senate has exercised the privilege of self-election ; that is , it has assumed to itself the right of filling vacancies in its own body , ) r of adding to its numbers . Such a form of election estalDishes an oligarchy which perpetually strives to usurp to itself he whole power of the state . It absorbs the prerogatives of he executive , and robs the people of their rights . The inerests of such a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glory of the state , but in regard of all uestions of internal policy , a Senate so constituted will pri ' : larily consider how it can advance the aggrandizement of its wn order , not that of the people at large . From the existence of such an institution naturally results le division of the population into Patrician and Plebeian . milies a result which tends to undermine all social happi3ss . It is impossible to read the history of Rome without 3rceiving that the heart-burnings , generated by this distincon , must have gone far to neutralize the pleasure and pride /z/ the Roman people derived from the triumph of their arms , and from the title of a citizen of the Roman Republic . The ascendency of one class of citizens over another is more galling than the tyranny of a single despot , unless that ascendency be derived from superior virtues or superior abilities . In the United Kingdom aristocratic privileges lose something of their obnoxious character by being limited to a very small number of individuals , almost all of whom have either themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from such services . Patrician families enjoy no distinctive privileges , and the younger branches of the aristocracy soon become merged in the great body of the population . In some countries of Europe , on the contrary , noble families have been for centuries a privileged class , and this artificial distinction , not being connected with the possession of any real superiority , not even with that of wealth , has produced many social evils . It necessarily generates vapid pride in the privileged classes , with jealousy and discontent amongst the unprivileged . Fortunately the French Revolution of 1789 has swept away this pestilential nuisance from the surface of a great part of Europe , but even to a very late date its traces have remained . It has been computed that in Hungary the class of nobles who , before the late revolutionary struggle , were possessed of exclusive privileges , amounted to not less than six hundred thousand persons . By some writers they have been estimated at fifteen hundred thousand . A ridiculous attempt has been lately made to introduce these patrician distinctions into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been expected . A committee of the legislature of New South " Wales recently recommended that an order of nobility should be established in that colony , and that one of the branches of the legislature should be composed of persons delegated by the patrician order . Fortunately this proposal to establish " a Botany Bay peerage , " composed of the descendants of convicts , or of the keepers of convicts , has been encountered by a universal shout of scorn and ridicule ; so it is not necessary seriously to point out the mischiefs which would have resulted from the adoption of this proposal . 2 . The Senate ought not to be named by the Executive . If the Senate were to be composed of members appointed by the executive , for a definite term of years , it is certain that it would consist almost exclusively of persons who would conform their conduct to the will of the chief of the stai /z/ It is not probable that lie would nominate persons who , from their previous habits of thought and action , might be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his proceedings . Such a mode of nomination would , therefore , give an undue influence to the chief magistrate , and tempt him to form designs for enlarging or perpetuating his power . In a well-constituted government the head of the state ought to be the servant , not the master , of the people . Authority is delegated to him , not in order that it may be exercised for his own aggrandizement , but in order that the will of the nation may be executed through his instrumentality . The nation is supposed to utter that will through the voice of its legislature . We have seen that the object , with a view to which a second chamber is to be constituted , is , that the will of the nation may be expressed with the utmost possible deliberation . Now , this object would be altogether defeated if one of these chambers were to represent the wishes of the executive , not the wishes of the nation . If the members of the Senate were to be nominated for life by the chief magistrate , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were appointed only for a term of years . They would be to a slight extent more independent , but still they would be representatives of the executive , not representatives of the nation . The qualities which would recommend them for selection to an ambitious and imperious ruler , are precisely those which least fit them for acting as legislators on behalf of a free people . It is for the interest of the nation that the wisest , the most virtuous , and ihe most independent citizens should be called upon to undertake the duties of legislation . On the contrary , the chief of a senator to the preference of the execuive would be subserviency of character , combined with a - position to uphold authority and to sanction abuses . It is vious , therefore , that such a mode of nomination does not ilfil the object sought for in the erection of a second legislae chamber . It is also liable to all the objections which ve been urged against the creation of a peerage for life . If the members of the Senate were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legislan , conferred in reversion upon their descendants , a greater lount of independence would be secured in this branch of e legislature than if they were to be appointed only for a rm of years or for life . Objections founded upon an appre- /z/ tension of undue subserviency to the head of the state are thereby diminished , but another class of evils scarcely less formidable is engendered by this proposal . An oligarchy is created under circumstances which render the introduction of such an excrescence alike injurious and hateful to the people at large . In theoretical reasoning there is little to be said in favor of hereditary privileges of legislation , even where there has long existed a great feudal nobility . But mankind in general are willing to tolerate institutions which have endured throughout ages , though they may be theoretically imperfect , more especially if they practically produce little inconvenience . The time-honored names of an ancient nobility awaken none of those emotions of jealousy which are felt when a parvenu is invested with oligarchical privileges , on account of his having cringed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be urged against a form of constitution which by hereditary title gives to individuals , who may possess no one qualification for statesmanship , a permanent seat in either branch of the legislature , will be held applicable by the common sentiment of the whole community to the elevation of a spurious oligarchy , in a country where antecedent circumstances do not suggest or justify the creation of such a body . For these , and other reasons , which will be incidentally noticed elsewhere , we must reject each of the foregoing proposals , and conclude that the Senate , as well as the House of Representatives , ought to derive its origin from delegation by the people at large . It is not easy to determine what is the most advantageous mode of carrying into effect this delegation ; whether , for example , the Senate should be chosen by the same constituency which elects the House of Representatives , or whether il should be nominated by intermediate bodies acting on behalf of the people ? In the United States of America , both these modes of con stituting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senator ; are chosen by the same electors who choose the members of the House of Representatives , whilst the Senate of the Unioi at large , which forms one of the legislative chambers of Con gress , is composed of members delegated by the legislature , of the several states . It is generally acknowledged , that this latter mode of el tion has given to the Senate of the United States the abl statesmen that are to be found in the Republic ; and , on theo Jl /z/ retical principles , it appears to be desirable that the Senate should not be chosen by the same constituency which elects the House of Representatives . Inasmuch as the object with ' which two legislative chambers are preferred to one , is to impose a bridle upon the impulses of public feeling , without subjecting the legislature to autocratic or oligarchical ascendency , it seems expedient that the same passions which operate in the election of the House of Representatives should be as much as possible eliminated from the election of the Senate . With this view , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose the members of the Senate should be higher than that of the constituencies which choose the members of the House of Representatives . Such a distinction would give to the Senate a more aristocratic character than that of its coordinate branch of the legislature ; but in assuming this com.plexion , it would become proportionally an object of jealousy , and its moral influence would thereby be weakened . It seems expedient , therefore , that the Senate should derive its authority from at least as large a portion of the nation as elects the House of Representatives , * but that the process of election should take place through an intermediate body , who may be expected to exercise a calmer and more discriminating judgment than is usually to be found in the multitude . In the United States of America , the legislatures of the several states which choose the Senate of the Federal Union exercise the functions of such an intermediate body , or electoral college , and experience proves that this branch of Congress could not be more advantageously constituted . There is no reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any country which finds itself compelled to frame anew its legislative institutions . In considering what form of municipal organization is most suitable for the management of the local concerns of each country , I shall hereafter advocate the formation of " district councils , " elected by popular suffrage . The councils thus formed in the several districts , whether rural or urban , would , it is to be presumed , consist of the ablest and most energetic men , who in each /z/ locality could be found willing to devote themselves to tl management of public affairs . To the members composing such " district councils " might , therefore , be assigned the duty of electing the senators of the several districts , respectively . It may here be observed , that in the case of these elections there would be no reason whatever for giving a preference to secret over open voting , because the district municipal councillor , in voting for a senator , ought to be held responsible to his constituency for the discharge of this important trust . The same reasons which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intermediate to direct election , in the case of the Senate , lead us also to conclude that it is expedient that the senators should be chosen for a period different to that assigned for the House of Representatives . If the representatives be chosen for a term of three years , the senators might be chosen for six years ; and in order that this body may not undergo a total change at any particular moment , it might be arranged that half the number should retire at the end of three years , or a third at the end of two years . In the Senate of the United States , the senators are chosen for a term of six years , and a third retire at the end of every two years . In order to secure to this body as much stability as is consistent with responsibility to the people , it is expedient that the Senate should not be liable to dissolution at the will of the executive . Retired judges , and persons who have sat in the House of Representatives for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed a place in the Senate for the remainder of their lives , without being subjected to a popular election . The experience of such veteran servants of the public would add weight and authority to the deliberations of the assembly , and it is to be presumed that those who have so long enjoyed public confidence will not in their old age prove themselves to be unworthy of it . It may be said , indeed , that if they continue to retain such confidence , they will naturally be selected by the people , as representatives in one or other of the legislative assemblies , but it is often found that persons of advanced age are unwilling to undergo the turmoils of a popular election . And the temperament which best qualifies for the exercise of judicial functions , is precisely that which least fits its possessor for the strife of an election contest . A person elected as member both of the Senate and of the House of Representatives , /z/ ought to be allowed to determine in which of these chambers he will take his seat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit , by virtue of such election , in both houses of the legislature . CHAPTER Vin. /z/ The functions of a legislature ought not to be limited to the mere enactment of laws . To the legislature , whether it be called by the name of Parliament , Congress , or by any other denomination , naturally belongs the duty of investigating every subject and circumstance that can affect the well-being of the people . It is the " grand inquest " of the nation . Inquiry naturally precedes and guides legislation . Unless a disease be thoroughly probed and ascertained , it is impossible to prescribe a suitable remedy . No evil can result from efforts , even superfluous , to throw light upon the management of the affairs of a nation . The legislature is bound to exercise control over all the departments of administration , to correct abuses , and to redress wrongs . All the powers , therefore , which are necessary for the due performance of these functions ought to be possessed by the legislature . Hence arise the claims of " privilege , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its aggregate capacity , or to its members as individuals . In the British Parliament these privileges are undefined , and have sometimes been stretched to a tyrannical extent . It is impossible to foresee every contingency that may justify extraordinary proceedings , in difficult times , but in the ordinary course of public affairs , it is very desirable that the privileges of legislative bodies should be strictly defined . The jealousy of a free nation is justly awakened , if its executive or judicial authorities assume to themselves any new prerogative without the sanction of the law ; and similar encroachments , on the part of the legislature , ought to be equally discountenanced . All power which is exercised , not according to known rules , but according to discretion , is arbitrary power ; and " arbitrary power " has become a synonyme for tyranny . Whilst , therefore , it is es- /z/ sential to the public interest that each branch of the legislature should possess the privileges which are necessary for the efficient exercise of its duties , it is also expedient that such privj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the privileges which may properly be claimed by a legislative Jody , we may notice in particular the follow-/z/ Perfect Freedom of Speech . In private life it is necessary to restrain language that cai give offence to individuals , and the law of libel imposes stric limitations upon the use , or rather upon the abuse , of speech J but in a deliberative assembly , which is intrusted with the dutjj of investigating and of correcting abuses of every kind , it necessary that the members should be allowed to designate actions by their real names . Good taste and good feeling will prescribe to a well-constituted assembly decorum and forbearance in language , but the utility of such a body would be very much impaired , if its memberswere liable to be called to account , in a civil or criminal proceeding , for expressions used by them in discussing public questions , or in animadverting upon the conduct of individuals . Freedom from Arrest This is a privilege enjoyed by members of the British Pa liament , respecting the expediency of which grave doubts have ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been wisely claimed and conceded . If members of Parliament had been liable to arrest for debt , there is little doubt that this liability would have been used for the purpose of intimidating them , and also , on critical occasions , for the purpose of abstracting them altogether from the sphere of their duties . In the case of criminal offences , which do not admit of bail , a member of Parliament may be taken into custody ; and considering that in cases of civil action the property of the debtor , not his person , ought to be the effectual security relied upon by the creditor , no great inconvenience can arise from the existence of this privilege , whilst great public injury might result from the practice of kidnapping members previously to a parliamentary division . As there are very few persons , who , whatever may be the extent of their resources , are wholly free from debt , creditors might sometimes use the power of arrest with . /z/ coercive effect , if members were not protected by this privilege . Power to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a privilege which is absolutely essential to the efficiency of a legislative body , when acting in its capacity of " Grand Inquest " of the nation . Without such powers it might be checked in the very first stage of an investigation , and its attempts to bring to light the misdeeds of wicked ministers might be rendered wholly nugatory . An occurrence which recently took place in the legislature of Van Diemen 's Land may serve as an illustration to show how necessary it is that this privilege should be possessed by legislative bodies . A committee appointed to inquire into the grievances of the colony , being desirous to examine into abuses alleged to exist in the convict department , summoned before them the principal officer of that department , but he refused to answer the questions put to him ; and the council not possessing by law any power to coerce the production of evidence , the object of the investigation was completely frustrated . Had the council been animated by a resolute spirit , they would immediately have sent up for the sanction of the executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them , and would have declined to enter upon any public business until such a power had been conceded to them : they preferred to acquiesce in a proceeding which has tended to deprive them of the prestige and prerogative which ought to be inherent in a legislative assembly . Power to publish such Documents as may he deemed necessary for the Information of its own Members and of the Public . This is a privilege which , like that of " freedom of speech , " may sometimes be liable to abuse ; but , nevertheless , it is advantageous to the public that it should be possessed by each branch of the le2 ; islature . In the case of " Stockdale v. Hansard , " an action was brought against the officers of the House of Commons for publishing , under direction of the House , matter which was held to be libellous . Upon that occasion , it was maintained by several eminent statesmen , that this power of publication is necessarily inherent as a privilege in every legislative body ; but the judges having taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question was at length /z/ set at rest by the enactment of a law which authorizes botl branches of the legislature to circulate whatever documents they may think it expedient to pubHsh for the information of the public . A discretionary power of publishing appears to involve th possession of a discretionary power of withholding from pul lication such documents and proceedings as are required fol the use of the legislature alone . By the standing orders of Parliament a single member may call for the exclusion of strangers from the debates . The habitual exercise of thil power would be in the highest dfigree objectionable , yet oc ( sions may arise when secrecy is desirable in the proceedings " both of the legislature and of its committees . It is right , therefore , that the privilege of withholding their proceedings from the public should be possessed by legislative bodies , even though the frequent exercise of this privilege is much to be deprecated . It may be laid down , however , as a general prin ciple , that the public ought to be made acquainted with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and th resolutions of each House , as also the votes given by indivic ual members , ought to be officially recorded and made known " to the public . The exceptional cases in which secrecy is de sirable are extremely rare , and secrecy should never be ii posed at the mere will of an individual member , but by tl deliberate act of the whole House . Power to maintain Order , It is scarcely necessary to observe , that power to maintaii order in debate is a privilege which ought to be possessed by " all legislative bodies . This power should be given not only with a view to control interruptions arising from the conduct of members of the assembly itself , but also interruptions arising from any other quarter . By some legislative assemblies , casual spectators have been allowed to testify applause or dissatisfaction , according as sentiments pleasing or distasteful to them have been uttered by the several speakers in debate . This is a practice which ought on no account to be permitted in a duly organized assembly , which represents the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the debates of an assembly may thus be acquired by a handful of individuals brought together by a skilful manager of mob-intervention . The speaker is insensibly led to conclude that the voice of m /z/ these casual spectators represents the opinion of the public , whilst in truth they may be nothing else than the hired condottieri of a faction . It is fitting that a member should pay due respect to public opinion ; but public opinion is not to be gathered from such interruptions ; and if demonstrations of this kind do not really indicate the public sentiment , but , on the contrary , may often be artfully used by a faction for the purpose of overawing the timid , or of influencing susceptible minds , it is surely expedient that they should be wholly suppressed . The use of mob-influence is the most dangerous mode of invading public freedom that a designing minister can adopt , because it overthrows liberty in the name of liberty itself . Let us suppose , for instance , that a wicked king or minister were desirous to extinguish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably fail in his design if he were to resort to what the French call a coup d'etat , and attempt to suppress by force the meeting of Parliament . He would command a much greater chance of success if he were to propose ultra-democratic measures which the legislature would certainly reject , and thus bring to his support the intimidation of a mob . A legislature divested of the support both of the executive and of the people is nothing more than a small assembly of individuals , in themselves wholly powerless . The British Parliament has frequently lost for a time the confidence of the public , but it has on such occasions been sustained by the physical power which is placed under the command of the executive . Were that support withdrawn , mob-intimidation might wholly paralyze its proceedings . Calm deliberation is at an end , when it is interrupted by the roars of a multitude . The proceedings of the different legislative assemblies which were convened in France , during the progress of the French Revolution of 1789 , sufficiently testify the results which must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legislature . It is not easy to say what course of proceeding ought to be adopted by a legislative assembly when the executive refuses to aid in preserving order throughout its deliberations . Perhaps the most l ) riulent course , and that which will best conduce to the pres'Tvation of public liberty , is to refuse altogether to proceed to business until perfect tranquillity shall be restored . In order to be able to meet every contingency that may arise , a legislative body ought to possess the right to adjourn from time to time , according to its own discretion . The exercise of this /z/ power may indeed be counteracted for a season by a prorogs tion , or by a dissolution , but the political institutions and laws of every country should be framed in such a manner that the executive should be under the necessity of calling together the legislature within a reasonable time after a prorogation or a dissolution , in which case the right to govern its own proceedings by the privilege of adjournment becomes again restore ( to it . Power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appears to be essential to the d conduct of legislation . It may indeed be argued that a mem ber is responsible to his constituents , not to his colleagues , and that if , with the consent of his constituency , he thinks it advisable to abstain from taking part in the proceedings of the legislature , no external force should be applied to compel his attendance . Questions often arise respecting which a conscientious member entertains doubts . Is it reasonable that he should be compelled to vote either for or against a propos respecting which his judgment is not fully satisfied ? Di cult also , if not impossible , is it to enforce the performance legislative duties against the will of a reluctant member , o : section of members , who possess firmness enough to brave to_the penalties imposed upon those who refuse to act . These are plausible objections , and occasions may arise i : which it would be inexpedient as well as tyrannical to enfon the attendance of members who are unwilling to take part i legislative proceedings which are distasteful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dispensed with by a legislature . It is not consistent with sound constitutional doctrine to maintain that a member acts solely on behalf of his ' own constituents . He is placed in the legislature for the purpose of superintending the affairs of the whole empire . When a question of great public importance is about to be discussed , " a call of the House " brings up a number of absentees whom indolence , not conscientious scruples , kept away from the labors of the session . There are also certain classes of business , which are so little attractive , that without compulsion few members would be induced to attend to them . Is it unreasonable that each member of the legislature should be compelled to contribute his share towards the performance of its necessary duties ? A juryman is fined if he refuse to attend the court to which he is summoned j and , though cases of /z/ hardship occasionally arise in the enforcement of this obligation , it is universally admitted that power to compel the attendance of jurymen is a prerogative essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to enter the army , but after he has voluntarily sought a commission he is bound to comply with the rules of the service . So a member of Parliament is not compelled to accept a seat in the legislature , but after he has accepted it , he is bound to perform the duties which belong to this function . It may seem strange that the writer of these pages should maintain this opinion , when it is recollected that he incurred the censure of the House of Commons , and submitted to imprisonment , rather than serve upon a private committee . But upon that occasion he did not deny that it might be expedient that the House should possess the power of compelling the attendance of its members . He simply maintained , that according to former precedent a discretion was enjoyed by members , as to whether they would or would not take part in the proceedings of private committees , and , in the exercise of that discretion , he judged that his time would be more beneficially devoted to the public affairs of Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Commons possessed an undoubted right to compel attendance , derived either from precedent or from statutory enactment , he would have obeyed the order , instead of resisting it . In the case of election committees such right is given by statute , and , in all cases , power of this kind should be defined by law . Otherwise a member might be called upon by the legislature to perform acts directly at variance , not only with his own inclinations , but with the interests of his constituency , and with the duties of citizenship . Perhaps this is ' as convenient an opportunity as any that will present itself for noticing a practice that prevails in the House of Commons , which appears to me to militate against every principle of judicial equity . When a charge is brought against a member of the House of Commons , he is called upon to state whether he has any observations to make in reply to it , and is then compelled to withdraw ; so that he is absent from a debate in which statements most injurious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afforded any opportunity of answering them , either personally or through his friends . In every description of trial , in the other courts of England , the accused is compelled to be present throughout the whole of /z/ // the proceedings , and can take exception to any stateraenf which are made that tend to disparage his character ; but irf the House of Commons , the issue of the debate may be influenced by assertions utterly at variance with truth , made in the absence of the person whose interests are at stake . This is a practice , which , though sanctioned by custom , is in itself so unreasonable , that it ought to be abandoned in the British legislature , and avoided in all others . It may be proper that a member , when accused , should leave his place and take his seat at the bar , but he should at least have an opportunity of hearing and of replying to all that can be said against him . In my own case , relying upon the advocacy and support of the party with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds upon which I refused to serve on an English railway committee , but when I found that those grounds were misrepresented by both friends and foes , I solicited an opportunity of addressing the House on my own behalf . That request was refused , so that the resolution under which I was imprisoned for twenty-five days , and subjected to a fine , was founded upon a series of misrepresentations which I was not allowed to refute . It may be doubted , whether a legislative body ought tqfll possess the right to expel any of its members . It has been ' seen in the British House of Commons ( as in the case of Wilkes ) and upon many other occasions in history , that eve assemblies , which have professed to represent the democracy , have often been led , by passion or partisanship , to use th power of expulsion in an unjustifiable manner . On thes occasions a wrong is inflicted , not only upon the member him self , but also upon his constituents . There are some contin gencies , which ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but those cases should be defined by law ; and expulsion should not depend upon the arbitrary discretion of the body itself . In the case of protracted absence without adequate cause , and without leave , in the case of lunacy , or when a member has become bankrupt , or has been convicted of treason , or felony , or bribery , or has been condemned after impeachment , his expulsion ought to take place as a matter of course . In trivial cases , when a breach of privilege is committed , the punishment should be imprisonment , in the nature of " an attachment for contempt of court ; " and such imprisonment should not extend beyond the duration of the session . When /z/ a crime , such as bribery , has been committed , the guilty party ought to be prosecuted according to law , before the ordinary tribunals of justice . It is scarcely necessary to observe , that every member of a legislative assembly ought to be allowed to resign his seat . In the British House of Commons , this resignation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crown such as " the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds " acceptance of which vacates the seat of the member who holds it , though its value is only nominal . This form of resignation is a very clumsy mode of effecting an object which is in itself legitimate . It is painful to many men even to appear to solicit a favor from an administration in which they place no confidence ; and , if I recollect rightly , cases have occurred in which this opportunity of resignation has been refused by the minister of the day . Power to appoint their own Officers , Sc* It is obviously essential to the independence of a legislative body , that it should possess the power of nominating its own officers . Perpetual collision might be expected to arise between the legislature and its officials , if such officials were named by the executive . They ought to be the agents , not to say the servants , of the assembly to which they are attached ; but if they were to be appointed and removable by an external authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , rather than obey the assembly for which they profess to act . The Speaker of the British House of Commons is now the organ of that House . He has neither eyes to see , nor ears to hear , nor voice to speak , except as it directs . If he were named by the sovereign , he would become the servant of the Crown , not the organ of the House of Commons . In losing that confidence which results from the free choice of his fellow-members , he would lose all moral control over them . He would become an object of jealousy , rather than of attachment and pride , to those on whose behalf he speaks and acts . Under the British constitution , it is provided , that the election of Speaker shall be subject to confirmation by the sovereign : but it is very questionable whether even a veto upon this appointment should be accorded to the executive . The exercise of such a veto would occasion more evil than could result from the selection of a Speaker who might not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the subordinate oiRcers of a legislative assembly ; such as the clerks , sergeant at arms , ' librarian , short-hand writers , &c.; It is , perhaps , better that the appointment of these officers should be left to the Speaker , than that they should be elected by the House itself ; but , in being named by the Speaker , they indirectly derive their situations from the legislative body , and are amenable to its authority , not to that of the executive government . The most important of all the derivative functions which are connected with the official administration of the affairs of a legislative body , is that of the tribunal which is constituted for the trial of controverted elections . It is absolutely essential to the independence of a legislative assembly , that this tribunal should derive its origin and power from the legislative body for which it acts not from the executive government . It is obvious that whatever authority possesses the right to nominate the tribunal for the trial of controverted elections , will practically obtain a commanding influence over the assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to get up a petition against the return of a member of the legislature ; and , if the judicature which tries such petitions be corrupted by partisanship or by subserviency to the executive , the composition of the legislature will be vitiated accordingly . In the British House of Commons , every sort of abuse has prevailed in connection with the trial of controverted elections . At one time election petitions were tried by the whole HousCj The divisions on points raised by these petitions were thei openly and avowedly made a struggle of party strength ; th ( claims of justice being deemed altogether subordinate to th ( triumphs of faction . A change was subsequently introduce ( by the Grenville Act , which transferred to committees , chosen ! by lot , the jurisdiction over controverted elections ; but it was found that the same disregard of principle , honor , equity , and truth , which had previously disgraced the House collectively , prevailed to an equal extent in these committees . Another change was consequently made , at the suggestion of the late Sir Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violations of decency and justice , than formerly characterized the trial of controverted elections ; but the organization which was adopted at his instance is capable of being perverted by an unscrupulous minister , or by an unscrupulous faction , to wicked purposes , with even more certainty of effect than that by which it was preceded . As the subject is /z/ attended with much difficulty , I offer with diffidence my own views as to the best mode of trying election petitions . li seems to me that this duty should be delegated by each legislative assembly to some competent tribunal , not consisting of its own members , yet deriving its authority from the legislative body for which it acts , and altogether independent of the executive . With this view the Speaker should nominate , subject to the concurrence of three fourths of the House , three barristers , or more if required , to whom should be assigned the duty of trying all cases of controverted elections . Hitherto committees have erred , sometimes from incompetency , and sometimes from corruption or partisanship . Hence has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election committees . Barristers would be competent to deal with those legal questions , which now confuse unsophisticated country gentlemen ; and it is to be expected that their decisions would be governed by some uniform principles , which would give to election law at least as much certainty as belongs to any other branch of jurisprudence . Corrupt partisanship would be eliminated from this tribunal , by the check which provides , that the barristers named by the Speaker must possess the confidence of at least three fourths of the assembly for which they act . As selection for such an office would be one of the highest honors incidental to the legal profession , and as the tribunal itself would be liable to reconstruction after every dissolution , these judges would naturally be desirous to maintain a character for strict impartiality , and would have more to lose by departure from the paths of integrity than they could gain by lending themselves to the machinations of power , or to the passions of faction . Upon constitutional principles , similar to those which apply to the nomination of officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inconsistent with the independence of the legislature that the executive should have a voice in the nomination of those officials whose duty it is to register the names of electors , and to revise the registered lists . If the electoral franchise be simple and well defined , the duties of a registering officer are of such a nature that there is little opportunity for the fexercise of undue influence on the part of the executive ; but in case the franchise be ill defined or complicated , the electoral privilege will be accorded or withheld , in great measure , according to the discretion of the registering officers . If the executive Government appoint these /z/ oflScers , they will be tempted to use their discretion so as give an undue advantage to the party which supports the " Government . Such influences act unconsciously upon the minds of even honorable men ; and , though actual corruption may not govern the decisions of an official so appointed , yet a corrupt bias will be imputed , whenever his decisions appear to favor the party which supports the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature should nominate the registering and revising officers ; or , at all events , that it should exercise a veto upon their appointment , ( if they be nominated by the Government , ) in case there be reason to distrust their integrity . This is one of those occasions upon which something more than a simple majority of the members of the legislature should be required to sanction an appointment . No such officer should be appointed , unless his nomination be satisfactory to at least three fourths of the legislative assembly , so that the minority may be protected against the usurpations of the majority . In Ireland the revising barristers have frequently been accused of partiality in the exercise of their functions , because they are dependent upon the executive Government . In England the judges have appointed the revising barristers ; and as the judges are supposed to be neutral in politics , imputations of partiality have not prevailed to the same extent in regard of their nominations ; but it , seems to be more consistent with constitutional principle , that the body whose composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those who are qualified t ( be electors , should , directly or indirectly , control the appoint ment of these officials , rather than they should be nominate ( by any extrinsic authority . This is , perhaps , the most convenient opportunity for re-j marking that a revision of the electoral lists should take place " annually , so that none but qualified electors may present them- . selves to vote at elections . If the lists be not annually re-l vised , they will exhibit the names of many electors who hav ( died or lost their qualification ; and thus an opportunity foi fraudulent voting will arise at the poll , which can only be corrected by the expensive inquiries of a tribunal for the trii ' of controverted elections . /z/ Power of Impeachment There is a class of oiFences against the state , the consideration of which can scarcely be assigned to a juridical tribunal , without giving to such a tribunal a political authority , which ought not to be conceded to officials nominated bj the executive , and dependent upon it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a treaty , a privy councillor advises and assists the sovereign in proceedings which are disgraceful to the royal authority , and disparaging to the interests of the realm , as occurred more than once during the reign of Charles II . ; if a high public functionary neglects to execute the duties intrusted to him , or performs acts not warranted by the law or the constitution , as in the case of StralFord in England , and Polignac in France ; if a governor oppresses the inhabitants of a dependency , as in the case of Warren Hastings ; if a judge , or other public officer , accept bribes ; for crimes of this class it is proper that there should be some punishment ; and since they do not naturally fall within the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals , it becomes necessary to constitute a special judicature for the trial of such offences . This form of trial is called impeachment . Under the British constitution , the House of Commons brings forward the impeachment , and the House of Lords adjudicates upon it . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Representatives brings forward the impeachment , and the Senate adjudicates upon it . Though it can not be denied that political bodies are generally liable to be swayed by strong party feelings , yet it does not seem easy to devise a more eligible form of trial than that which has been adopted in both these countries . Under this anangement , the concurrent opinion of both the bodies which conjointly represent the nation must pronounce that the accused is guilty , before he can be punished as a criminal . Whilst , if the trial of high crimes and misdemeanors against the state were assigned to a tribunal composed of the ordinary judges , there would be reason to apprehend that a desire to please the head of the government would sometimes induce the members of such a tribunal to convict the innocent , or to shield the guilty . In trials for ordinary offences , the judges are comparatively uninfluenced by prepossessions for or against the accused ; but in the case of political trials , as for high treason , sedition , &c.,; judges /z/ i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to whatever result will be most acceptable to the executive powers of the state . Power to sanction a Declaration of War , and to ratify Treaties . To the legislature ought to be reserved a right to declare war , and to give an ultimate sanction to treaties with foreign powers . Under the British constitution , an unrestricted right to declare war , and to make treaties , is delegated to the sovereign , and much evil has arisen from this prerogative . The Minister for Foreign Affairs pledges the nation to operations which are often founded upon his own personal views of policy , and sometimes upon his mere whims , rather than upon the considerate verdict of public opinion . Negotiations , while in progress , are veiled in mystery ; and it is not until the nation has been committed to some unjust or impolitic engagement , that the expression of its opinion is elicited . In recent times , several instances have occurred in which a minister has thus acted upon his own responsibility . I shall only mention the case of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was commenced , the opinion of the legislature was not taken . The war being concluded before Parliament reassembled , the British nation had no opportunity of expressing an opinion as to the expediency of that expedition until after it was accomplished . As the British arms , and the policy of the minister , were in this instance crowne with success , it was not to be expected that the legislatur should , by an unavailing resolution , condemn a proceedin which had terminated in triumph ; but these proceedings might have involved not only the British isles , but all Europe , in a protracted war , without the exercise of any previous deliberation on the part of the British people . When a nation is once engaged in hostilities , it is difficult for it to retire fro the contest ; and whether its issue be fortunate or disastrous , war brings with it such a ti*ain of calamities that every possi ble precaution should be taken to prevent the occasion of quarrel . Treaties are the public law of nations , and therefor naturally fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper that the conduct of negotiations with foreig powers should be confided to the Minister for Foreign Affairs , but he should not be at liberty to conclude any final engage /z/ ment , much less to plunge his country into a war , without the sanction of the legislature . An emergency may unexpectedly arise when the national honor will call for immediate action , or for demonstrations of a hostile kind ; but in such case the legislature ought to be specially convened for the purpose of : iking into consideration the circumstances of the crisis . By the fundamental constitution of the United States of America , the right of declaring war , and of granting letters of marque and reprisal , is given to Congress , not to the Pressident ; and it is provided that no treaties can be made by the President except with the consent and sanction of two thirds of the Senate . Hitherto , at least , no inconvenience appears to have resulted from these restrictions , as the foreign policy of the United States has been eminently successful . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaties should not be reserved exclusively to one only of the deliberative councils , which together constitute the legislature . A treaty being a solemn act of legislation , intended to bind two or more nations by an international agreement , it is only reasonable that the whole legislature of each country that is to be bound by it should deliberate upon its terms . The general adoption of this principle by all constitutional governments would indeed get rid of much of the mystery in which negotiations are now shrouded . So much the better ! Honest designs seldom require to be enveloped in darkness and secrecy , whilst , by the enforcement of publicity , many a noxious project would be prevented from germinating to maturity . Delay might also occasionally arise from the protracted deliberations of popular assemblies . But have we not seen that preposterous and mischievous delays have arisen in the negotiations of diplomatists , not unfrequently from the most trivial causes ? A treaty is either advantageous or it is disadvantageous . If it be advantageous , the legislature will naturally hasten to sanction it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long postponed . If it be disadvantageous , any intervention which tends to defeat it is usefully applied . That the House of Representatives , as well as the Senate , should possess a right to deliberate upon the terms of a treaty seems the more reasonable , when we remember that all the expenditure required to carry into effect the provisions of a treaty must be voted as a grant originating in that assembly . /z/ Power to grant Supplies . Although it may be said that taxation is but a branch of legislation , and that therefore it ought to be considered according to the general principles which guide legislation , yet , in a free state , the right to determine what financial burdens shall be imposed upon the community is justly regarded as one of the peculiar privileges which belong to the immediate representatives of the people . Chiefly through the possession of this privilege of stopping the supplies is control over the operations of government secured to the democracy . It is necessary for the well-being of society that much power should be concentrated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rendered independent of democratic influence , if the purse strings of the nation were not held by the representatives of the people . The experience of other nations of Europe , as well as that of England , shows that , when sovereigns possess hereditary revenues sufficient to enable them to abstain from making appeals to the liberality of their subjects , they naturally refrain from calling together the representatives of the people . Hence , the fundamental principle of the British constitution , which requires that all the ordinary supplies necessary for the management of public affairs shall be granted annually by the House of Commons , is deserving of universal imitation . The practice which restricts the Housfl of Lords from considering in detail the provisions of bills appears , on the other hand , to be unnecessarily stringent . * The enforcement of such a restriction upon a coordinatBI branch of a legislature derived from popular election would be wholly irrational . In Great Britain , this limitation originated in jealousy of oligarchical encroachment ; but in those countries ( as , for instance , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the House of Representatives , is ultimately , though indirectly , derived from the choice of the people at large , there can be no foundation for suchj jealousy . Some doubt may exist as to the question , whether it desirable to adopt the principle established in the British Par ? liament , that no money shall be voted by the Commons except upon the recommendation of the executive . According to the forms of the House of Commons , if any proposal be madej relative to a grant of public money , not recommended by the i /z/ ministers of state , it must be made by way of address to the Crown , not by way of direct vote ; and upon more than one recent occasion as in the case of " the Danish claims " ministers have refused to accede to the wishes of a majority of the House of Commons . This appears to be a very strange restriction upon the legitimate rights of the representatives of the people ; but it has been found necessary , in order to prevent irresponsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good nature of their brother representatives , to draw money from the public treasury for private " jobs , " or for local objects . In ordinary times , the practice is undoubtedly attended with convenient results ; but if ever a revolutionary struggle should arise between the executive and the representatives of the people , it would necessarily be set aside or suspended for the occasion . Not only ought the legislature to possess the privilege of appropriating , annually , out of the public revenues , such supplies as it may deem necessary for the management of public affairs , but it ought also to be provided that a portion , if not the whole , of the revenue should be raised under the authorization of temporary , rather than of permanent enactments . If the taxes be collected into the public treasury by virtue of permanent Acts , the representatives of the people lose half that power which belongs to the privilege of stopping the supplies . Though they might refuse to grant any supplies , the taxes would still be levied in conformity to law , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriating , without the consent of the legislature , the money so collected . But if the taxes be levied by virtue of an annual or periodical enactment , then , in the event of a collision between the executive and the legislature , the legislature , by refraining from reenacting the Revenue Laws , would render illegal the collection of taxes , and every citizen would be justified in resisting payment of them . Formerly it was the practice of the British Parliament to pass annual Acts authorizing the levy of a large proportion of the revenue . Until a very late period , the sugar duties were thus levied by virtue of an annual Act ; but the House of Commons , relying upon its assurance that it will always enjoy the same influence which it now possesses , has very unwisely abandoned this essential Miarantee of popular liberty . Almost all the taxes are now vied under the authority of permanent rather than of temliorary Acts . /z/ It is also to be remarked , that a periodical renewal of the Revenue Laws alFords frequent opportunities of revising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found to be productive of injustice or of inconvenience . Every one versed in the practical details of legislation knows how ditficult it is to procure the repeal of an existing law , or the correction of an existing abuse . The minister of the day generally finds some excellent reason for not changing that which is already established ; but when a measure is of necessity brought under consideration , with a view to its renewal , he will generally accede to any reasonable suggestion , rather than provoke an unfriendly discussion . Taxes imposed for the special purpose of securing the interest of the public debt ought , however , to be levied under the authority of permanent rather than of temporary enactments . It is of paramount importance that faith should be kept with the public creditor . A momentary advantage may sometimes be gained by violating plighted engagements ; but in the case of nations , as of individuals , " honesty is the best policy , " and no temptation or opportunity ought to be afforded to those who would sacrifice the national honor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temporary advantage gained by repudiating pecuniary liabilities lawfully contracted . Having considered the privileges which a legislature ought to possess , our time might , perhaps , be not unprofitably employed in inquiring what are the powers and functions which legislative assemblies ought carefully to abstain from exercising . But this negative research would lead us into details inconsistent with the object of this work . Let it suffice , therefore , to observe , that the legislature ought to refrain from assuming to itself duties which properly belong to executive , judicial , or municipal administration . Thus , for instance , it is expedient that the legislature should , directly or indirectly , possess the power of removing ministers of state and all other functionaries ; but it is not desirable that it should appoint these officials by direct nomination . The power of removal constitutes a useful check upon maladministration . The power of appointment would afford a temptation to jobbing and intrigue . Were the legislature invested with such a prerogative , the acquisition and exercise of patronage would become the main object of the exertions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be an object of secondary /z/ concern . Already the indirect influence obtained over the distribution of patronage by the parhamentary supporters of an administration , tends much to degrade the character of the British legislature , by rendering - the representative an agent for the acquisition of situations ; whilst , at the same time , it demoralizes the public sentiment , by introducing into popular elections an element of mercenary consideration , which ought not to be connected with the office of legislator . This evil would be greatly augmented if official situations were directly bestowed by the immediate act of either branch of the legislature . In like manner , though it be desirable that the legislature should reserve to itself the power of removing bad judges , it is by no means expedient that it should interfere with the ordinary course of judicial administration . The experience of the ancient republics tends to prove how ill qualified are popular assemblies for the exercise of judicial functions . In the British Parliament also , whenever individual interests or individual rights are involved in the questions under discussion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined by influences very foreign to the calmness and impartiality of a well-constituted judicature . So , in regard of the actual management of public affairs , whilst it is desirable that the strictest responsibility should be exacted from the officials who administer public affairs , it is not expedient that the legislature should take upon itself the task of managing the details of administration , whether imperial or municipal . There is a natural tendency in the human mind to grasp at the exercise of power , in the most trivial , as well as in the most important concerns of life . This tendency prevails in emblies of men as strongly as in individuals . Hence , it is n that in the British Parliament , whose functions naturally olve a legislative superintendence over the highest interests u " an empire containing one hundred and fifty millions of luman beings , there is often displayed more eagerness to in- ermeddle with the local politics of a parish , than to adjust he most vital questions that can affect the destinies of a con- iderable section of this empire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself the management of letty details , ought rather to reserve its energies for its higher nd nobler duties . It ought to construct administrative bodies a subordinate kind , in such a manner that they shall be /z/ competent to manage all local concerns , without requiring the constant interposition of the supreme legislative authority . By this means nearly the whole mass of that legislation , which is called " Private Acts , " could be eliminated from the statute book . If a turnpike trust , or a company , is to be incorporated , if a common is to be enclosed , it has been thought necessary to call into action the legislative machinery of the empire , while almost all the objects for which these special enactments are designed might be much better accomplished under the operation of general laws , which would embrace not only the individual case , but also all other cases of the same class . The supreme legislature would thus be released from the exercise of duties , which , though trivial , are onerous , and parties who require the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would at the same time be relieved from the expensive waste of money , and harassing waste of time , which are consequent upon the process of this kind of special legislation . /z/ It is scarcely necessary to remark , that the functions whicr we have hitherto recapitulated , however important in themselves , are to be considered merely as the accessory duties of a legislature . Its main business is legislation the enactment of laws . It is important , therefore , to consider in what manner , and upon what principles , legislation can be conducted with the greatest advantage to the community . Each of the legislative assemblies of the British Parliament has very wisely endeavored to avoid precipitation , by securing frequent opportunities of deliberation and debate , with respect to every measure propounded for enactment . Every bill* must be submitted for discussion upon several different occa- /z/ sions . Thus , in the House of Commons , there arise , during the progress of a bill , opportunities of debate and division upon the motion for leave to bring in the bill upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its committal upon the several clauses of the bill , while it is under consideration in committee of the whole House upon the report upon the third reading and upon the motion " that the bill do pass . " A power of suspending the standing orders is reserved to each House , by which , on critical occasions , the progress of a measure is accelerated , but , in ordinary cases , an interval of at least one day is allowed to interpose between each of the principal stages of a bill , so that even if a measure be unopposed , full opportunity is given for its consideration . If the bill be opposed , a variety of additional motions can be made consistently with the rules of the House , with a view to retard its progress , and to afford still more ample opportunity for discussion respecting its provisions . Yet every one who has watched the progress of law making in the British Parliament must have frequently had occasion to observe how imperfect it is . Measures which excite party debates are scrutinized with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills which pass through . both Houses of Parliament receive no attention , except , perhaps , from a few members who may happen to feel a special interest in the subjects to which they relate . The public in general knows little of such measures until after their final enactment . When a bill does not awaken party vigilance , it is easy to introduce into it amendments ( as it were , furtively ) which materially alter its original provisions . Even when such changes are not made , bills are frequently defective , not only in regard of the policy upon which they are founded , but also in regard of the technical form in which they are drawn . Through the incapacity of the persons who prepare them , their provisions are often obscure and contradictory , or inconsistent with the enactments of unrepealed statutes . The members of a popular legislature may be well qualified to ) rm an opinion respecting the policy of measures , but it is lot to be expected that they should be competent to undertand all the subtilties of the technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it ap ) ears to be a hopeless undertaking on the part of laymen to /z/ rescue common sense from legal perplexity , it is necessary to employ legal skill for this purpose . It is desirable , therefore , that every bill , before it is considered in committee of the whole House , should not only be referred to a select committee of members , but also that such committee should be assisted by an eminent lawyer , appointed by the legislature to revise bills in progress , This barrister should be called upon to certify in writing his opinion respecting the legal bearing of its provisions ; and if amendments should be subsequently introduced , the bill should be again submitted to him , before it finally passes , so that he may have an opportunity of calling the attention of the House to any ill-advised changes which it may have undergone . There ought also to be a staff of barristers , whose duty it should be to clothe in legal language the resolutions of the House , with a view to their final enactment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent professional assistance ; but a private member of the legislature , who may be qualified to submit useful proposals , may yet be unable to give to those proposals a technical form , or to obtain professional aid for such a purpose . In these cases the opinion of the legislative body ought to be taken by way of resolution upon the proposals so submitted say upon " the Leads of a bill , " and the responsibility of the legal verbiage should rest upon the officer of the House , not upon the member who brings forward the proposal . The legislator ought to be required to deal only with the substance of an enactment . He is not expected to engross upon parchment the bill which he brings forward . Neither ought he to be called upon to give to his suggestions the form of legal technicality . Were these aids to legislation supplied by the legislature , it might be expected that all enactments would bear a symmetrical character : and as the highest skill would naturally be sought for , under such arrangement it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise in the interpretation of statutes from ambiguity of expression , would be avoided . Quorum of Legislative Assemblies . In the conduct of business by deliberative bodies , it is found necessary to determine what shall be the quorum of he body /z/ that is , what is the minimum number of members whose presence shall be required , in order to give validity to the proceedings . It is not essential that the quorum should bear a fixed proportion to the whole number of members . When a deliberative council consists of a large number of members , a smaller proportionate quorum will be found sufficient for the conduct of business , than ought to be required when the council is less numerous . Thus , for instance , if the whole number of members do not exceed fifteen , the quorum ought to be not less than one third of the council , because a lesser number would not be sufficient to give authority to the deliberations of the body ; but if the council consist of six hundred members , it is not necessary to require that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present at all the proceedings . It is found , practically , that the ordinary routine of business will be better mapaged by a small number of attentive members , than by a crowd of careless observers , or even of assiduous disputants eager to take part in every discussion . It is impossible , therefore , to say what ought to be the quorum of a legislative assembly , unless we are first told what is the total number of members of which the assembly consists . In the House of Commons the quorum is not more than forty less than one sixteenth of the whole number of members of that assembly . Yet it frequently happens , that public business is arrested by " counting the House , " when , if forty members are not present , the House is adjourned until the next day . This process of " counting the House " is frequently used by the Government as a mode of getting rid of inconvenient motions . Even during great party debates , it often happens that about the usual hour of dinner the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called upon to count the House , the Speaker , after he has once taken the chair , is not bound to notice the deficiency . In the collision of great parties , this mode of suspending a debate is seldom resorted to by a ministry , because it would produce exasperation ; but when an independent member , acting with a view , not to the triumph of a party , but to the welfare of neglected classes of mankind , brings forward a useful proposal , he must expect to be encountered by this petty and contemptible expedient for evading discussion . The subordinates and hangers-on of the ministry , who on other occasions " whip in " their adherents to attend a division , now invite them to leave the House ; and /z/ when the number of members has been reduced below forb some underling rises and moves that the House be counted In order to check this discreditable practice , it is desirable that in case a motion be made for counting the House , a shorl interval ( say five minutes ) should be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the precincts of the building , though not actually present in the House , to assemble and reconstitute the quorum required for the transaction of public business . It frequently happens , that even those who are most solicitous about the progress and issue of a debate are compelled to leave the House for a short time . By adopting the arrangement here proposed , all such members would have an opportunity of reassembUng ; and some of the most useful discussions that are brought forward in Parliament would be protected from interruption . The House ought also to adjourn for an hcmr at dinner time , so as to allow members an opportunity of satisfying the requirements of nature , without neglecting the business under discussion . Some members of the British Parliament have perseveringly endeavored to induce the House of Commons to adopt the practice of sitting during the day , rather than in the evening and at night ; but this proposal has been uniformly resisted by the majority , upon the ground that those who have duties to perform in public offices , those who have mercantile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services are employed on Committees , would bfll unable to attend the sittings of the House , if it were to meet early in the day . Perhaps it would be an improvement upon the present practice if the House were to meet at two or three o'clock , instead of at four , and to adjourn for an hour at seven o'clock in the evening the usual dinner hour of members of Parliament ; but no arrangement can be suggested which will be wholly free from inconvenience . /z/ The Veto , It is generally assumed that in constitutional monarchies the sovereign ought to be a constituent branch of the legislature . A cavil might be raised against this dictum on the ground that practically the sovereign in some countries takes part in the process of law making , except that of withholding or granting his assent to enactments framed by the deliberative councils of the legislature . Under the British constitution the monarch is not at liberty to suggest alterations in the enactments submitted to him for approval . He simply accepts them or rejects them . By some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable security against undue influence . Possessing the prerogative of a Veto he can annul the legislative proceedings of both Houses of Parliament by refusing assent to their enactments ; but in modern days he never exercises this Veto so that practically he takes no ostensible part in legislation . We have now to ask ourselves whether the head of the executive ought to possess this prerogative whether a single individual ought to enjoy the power of annulling the will of the nation , as declared by its legitimate representatives in the legislature . It is difficult to defend this prerogative in argument ; but in the United Kingdom no practical inconvenience is found to result from it , because the machinery of government is so conducted as to render its exercise unnecessary . It has become absolutely essential to the harmonious cooperation of the three branches of the British legislature that the ministers of the sovereign should be able to command a majority in at least one of the Houses of Parliament , so that if they be desirous to prevent a bill from becoming law , they take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the royal prerogative , but by the vote of a majority in one of the Houses of Parliament . If a ministry were to continue to hold office for a considerable time after they had lost the confidence of Parliament , the whole government would be thrown into con- /z/ fusion , which would probably generate a revolution . Tl House of Commons would withhold supplies , or grant there for not more than a few months , and every means of clogging the machinery of government which could be used without injuring the essential interests of the nation would be adopted . In 1783 , Mr. Pitt , indeed , boldly ventured to carry on the government as minister in opposition to an adverse and factious majority of the House of Commons ; but in that case the House of Commons , not the minister , had lost the confidence of the nation , and he was enabled to defeat the machinations of his political adversaries by a dissolution of Parliament . It is now an established maxim that the ministry ought to retire as soon as it shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost the confidence of the country . But as it may happen that a measure might pass through both Houses of Parliament against the will of the executive , without any withdrawal of confidence from the administration , it would seem that the executive ought to possess the power of arresting for a limited time the enactment of such measures . It would be easy to enumerate a multitude of instances in which not only the popular branch of the legislature , but also the community at large , have surrendered themselves to some delusive idea , or to some unreasoning passion , under the influence of which proposals have been adopted which have . given occasion to much suffering , and have subsequently been denounced as follies , with unavailing regret . To provide that those who are peculiarly responsible for the prudent guidance of public affairs shall be able , upon such occasions , to interpose a check upon precipitate legislation , is as reasonable as it is unreasonable that they should have the power of thwarting the well-considered wishes of the nation by protracted opposition . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given to the President . He may send back a bill to the Senate and House of Representatives for reconsideration ; but if , after suMi- reconsideration , it be approved by two thirds of the members of both Houses , it becomes law , without the assent of the President . Some such arrangement as this appears advisable , with a view to obviate the inconveniences which may arise , on the one hand , from precipitate and ill-considered legislation , or , on the other , from an injudicious resistance to the public will on the part of the executive . When this sort of suspensive veto is granted to the head of the executive , it is proper that he should /z/ at liberty to state fully the grounds upon which he returns u bill for reconsideration .. lie thus becomes an active participator in legislation ; and it may with propriety be said that in such case the legislature consists of three coordinate briuiches . Power to convene ' prorogue , and dissolve the Legislature , It will probably be admitted without hesitation that the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislature whenever the circumstances of the country appear to him to require its intervention . In every constitutional state the legislature ought to meet at least once in every year . By the Constitution of the United States a stated day in each year is appointed for the assemblage of Congress . The British Parliament imposes upon the sovereign the necessity of convening the legislature annually , by granting supplies for the public service for the space of only a single year , and by passing an annual " Mutiny Act , " the expiry of which without renewal would necessarily cause the army to be disbanded . A special provision ought to be inserted in every constitutional Act , requiring that the legislature should be assembled in session at least once in every year , so that neither the executive nor the legislature may be permitted to evade this indispensable obligation . Power to prorogue the legislature is a prerogative which , under a constitution such as we have contemplated , can not be abused by the executive . On the other hand , if it were possessed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very possible that it might be misapplied . Thus , for instance , the legislature might be kept in permanent session an arrangement which might be productive of much evil . A large proportion of the members would be compelled by the requirements of their private affairs to return to their homes , and during their absence measures might be surreptitiously passed by those members whose personal inclinations or interests might induce them to occupy themselves without interruption in superfluous or mischievous legislation , rather than in the pursuit of business or the relaxations of pleasure . More danger is to be apprehended from too much law making than from too little . Less evil arises from the postponement of a crude proposal than from its hasty adoption . If it be really useful , it will be fortified and improved by discussion and /z/ delay ; if it be of doubtful expediency , its enactment will b advantageously deferred until doubt shall be converted into a certainty , which will dictate either its adoption or its rejection . For this reason , if for no other , we may conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislature to the executive than to either branch of the legislature . Nor can we hesitate to admit that the power of dissolving at least one chamber of the legislature ought to be confided to the executive . The sovereign of the British Empire is authorized by the constitution to dissolve the House of Commons without assigning any motive for such dissolution , and this prerogative is found to be equally advantageous to royalty and to the community at large . It sometimes happens ( as might naturally be expected under a system of septennial election ) that parliamentary combinations are formed , which have in view the advancement , not of the interests of the public , but of the interests of a party . By this prerogative the sovereign is enabled to test the opinion of the country as to the policy and relative merits of the contending parliamentary parties . A dissolution of Parliament under such circumstances is , in fact , an appeal to the people . If the result of that appeal be adverse to the ministry , and if in the new Parliament so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there should be a change of administration . In assuming here and elsewhere that a minist can not continue to hold office without disadvantage to tli country , after they have lost the support of a majority in tli ( popular branch of the legislature , I do not contend that ministry ought to resign whenever any of their measur happen to be defeated by an adverse vote ; such a principl would greatly tend to fetter the deliberations of the legislaJ ture . Votes would be given , not according to the merits o the question at issue , but with a view to the ulterior consequences of an adverse vote in relation to the existence of th administration . Such considerations already exercise toi much influence in the British legislature . It not unfrequenti happens that a member votes against his convictions , for th purpose of upholding a ministry to which he is attache When we say that an administration ought not to hold offie after it has lost the support of a majority in Parliament , wi mean , that after it ceases to possess the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sovereign of to_the United Kingdom ought always to be disposed to listen to to_the /z/ advice of Parliament with respect to the continuance in office of his ministers ; and when he finds that those wliom he has chosen have forfeited the confidence of the country , as expressed by Parliament after a dissolution , he is bound to appoint others , who will be more acceptable to the people and to their representatives . If the executive implicitly obeys the will of the majority of the legislature , no collision will arise between these powers ; but , on the other hand , if an irreconcilable difference arises between them , a dissolution of the legislature , that is , an appeal to the sense of the nation , appears to be the safest and most rational mode of putting an end to the controversy . The Long Parliament , in taking from Charles I. the power of dissolving the House of Commons , then sitting , suppressed not so much a prerogative of the Crown , as a privilege which belonged to the people , and by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the king , the constitution of England was invaded . Had Charles continued to possess the power of appealing to the people at large by a dissolution of Parliament , it is probable that he would never have lost his head . The voice of the nation , uttered through newly-chosen representatives , would have authoritatively repressed those collisions , which were generated by the struggle to acquire and the struggle to retain power , made respectively by the Parliament and the sovereign . In like manner , it is extremely probable that the recent usurpation of power by Louis Napoleon would not have occurred if , as President of the French Republic , he could have dissolved the legislative assembly , and could have invited the electors at large to decide , by a new election , whether he ought to be supported or opposed in the measures proposed by him , which were rejected by the assembly . If the nation had decided in his favor , he would naturally have preferred to possess constitutional rather than unconstitutional power . Had it decided against him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people so recently expressed . Unfortunately , by the constitution of 1848-49 , the President was not invested with the power of thus appealing to the sense of the nation by a dissolution , and the assembly continued to subsist after it had withdrawn its support from the resident , while , at the same time , it had itself forfeited the confidence of the people of France . It therefore became an /z/ easy task to suppress it by military force , and by its eve : throw to extinguish the constitutional liberties of France. * By the Constitution of the United States of America , the President is not permitted to dissolve Congress at pleasure ; but as the House of Representatives is chosen for a period of only two years , public opinion has an opportunity of expressing itself in a new election before a quarrel between the legislature and the executive can have become very inveterate . It seems to me , however , that the Constitution of the United States would be improved by giving to the President the power of dissolving the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to be made to the sense of the nation , in the event of a collision between the President and Congress . It is doubtful whether the Senate should be exempted from the operation of this prerogative ; but I incline to think that , as a second chamber is constituted chiefly with a view to give stabiHty to the deliberations of the legislature , it is not desirable that the Senate should be liable to dissolution by the Jiat of the executive . /z/ Before I conclude that portion of this work which relatej to the constitution of the legislature , I think it desirable set forth some fundamental principles which ought to be ol served in the legislation of every free country . It must not be supposed that this special notice of a few fundamental principles implies that others , not enumerated , deserve to be overlooked as of little importance . It is obviously impossible , in a work of this kind , to include all the topics which become subjects for legislation ; but there are some of paramount importance , respecting which the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of a constitution , framed to meet the requirements of a community which has /z/ rot previously enjoyed the full measure of freedom , ought to be accompanied by an express recognition of these fundamental principles constituting , as it were , a charter of public liberty , similar to the Magna Charta and the Bill of Rights of the British constitution . Let us first say a few words respecting the structure of laws . 1 . Laws should be clearly defined , and consistent with each other . 2 . Laws should be impartial and uniform in their operation . If a law be made or set aside in a particular case , in order to promote the interests of an individual , or to deprive him of advantages enjoyed by the rest of the community , such partial legislation almost always operates as an act of injustice . 3 . Ex post facto laws , inflicting pains and penalties , should rarely , if ever , be enacted . By the original Constitution of the United States such enactments are expressly prohibited . 4 . Laws should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be generally known by those who are called upon to obey them . " Whether the laws of a country ought to be digested into a code of moderate dimensions , and subsequently enacted by legislative authority , or whether they should be left to depend mainly upon precedents , as in the case of the common law of England , are questions upon which those conversant with forensic practice have been much divided in opinion . Common sense appears to suggest that a knowledge of the laws which regulate the transactions between man and man , and which govern his conduct by sanctions or penalties , should be rendered as accessible as possible to the whole community . It is true that in a very artificial and complicated state of society the laws must necessarily be artificial and complicated ; but this unavoidable evil , instead of reconciling us to hopeless ignorance of the laws which we are bound to obey , ought rather to stimulate enlightened statesmen to undertake the task of simplifying , as much as possible , that which is of necessity too abstruse , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of necessity too cumbrous . " With regard to the common law , there may be some difficulty in giving a codified form to precedents which determine the application of general principles to particular cases ; but there is no difficulty in digesting the statute law . In many /z/ branches of political regulation , the inquirer has hithert found it necessary to search through a long series of Acts , often conflicting with each other , before he has been able to satisfy himself as to the actual state of the law in its relation to points which are in their own nature perfectly simple . In all such cases as these , the want of a consohdating digest can arise from nothing but negligence may we not say from wilful neo-lio-ence ? on the part of those public functionaries whose duty it is to superintend the enactment and enforcement of the laws of the land . Among the fundamental principles which ought to govern legislation , we may specially notice the following : Natural Rights should he invaded or circumscribed only to such an extent as the welfare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each man possesses to say and do what he pleases . Social or civil liberty is the right to say and do every thing that is not injurious to others . Every restriction which unnecessarily interferes with this right is an infringement of social liberty . It will be found by the inquirer , that in almost all systems of legislation this principle is too much overlooked . Law makers prefer complex and artificial machinery to the simplicity of nature . Often , in order to obtain a trifling advantage , they inflict great injuries , or impose vexatious inconveniences . Take , as an instance , the passport system of the continental nations of Europe . There is no natural right which is more unquestionable , nor any less liable to abuse , than the right which each person possesses to go wheresoever he may please . There are few natural rights , interference with which is productive of greater vexation and inconvenience . The experience of England and America , and of other nations in which the passport system does not prevail , proves that it is unnecessary. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The experience of England and America is hardly applicable to the state of the European continent . England is protected by the sea from the visits of nearly all except those who seek her shores on business . If the Strait of Dover were spanned by a bridge , or a score of them , or if her frontier towards France was a mere imaginary line , her exigencies and her experience might be quite different . In these States , the federal law obviates all necessity of passports ; yet if the present Union were dissolved , especially in a conflict of interests and institutions concerning negro slavery , few /z/ sirable to exercise a control over the movements of bad men , the whole community is in several countries of Europe subjected to the annoyances of passport regulations ; and in order to carry these regulations into effect , a tribe of officials are maintained at a great expense , which must be defrayed by onerous taxation imposed upon the community at large . Another instance is to be found in revenue regulations , by which the growth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions and prohibition . Thus , the growth of tobacco is prohibited in the United Kingdom . The manufacture of spirits is prohibited , unless it be carried on in large distilleries . The sale and manufacture of many other articles , in maijy other countries , are subjected to penal restrictions of a very vexatious nature . It may be said , in defence of these infringements of natural liberty , that they are incidental to the necessity of collecting a revenue ; but they are often carried far beyond the necessity of the case ; and , by a different system of taxation , many of them might be wholly avoided . Another class of restrictions upon social liberty is to be found in laws which interfere with the liberty of the Press . Under pretence that a government ought to prevent those who speak and write from promulgating opinions or statements injurious to the community or to individuals , the natural right of man to give free utterance to his thoughts has been in many countries systematically infringed . To this class belongs the censorship of the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man should be held responsible for the sentiments which he utters , as well as for the actions which he commits ; but as a vague apprehension that an act of violence may be committed is no sufficient reason for tying up the hands of the whole community , or for depriving them of instruments by which death may be inflicted , so , in the case of writings , to subject the human mind to the restrictions of a censorship * is an infringement of natural northern travellers , we suspect , would be allowed to visit a slave state without passports . The European system is susceptible of improvement , but on a populous continent , so cut up between rival powers , it is difficult to understand how it could be altogether abolished . We should avoid as much as possible confounding dissimilar conditions of society what Mr. Everett calls ' * reasoning too much in the gross " in politics . M. * This is hardly the place to discuss the censorship of the press ; but until that profession , where free , is restricted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complaint will not be wanting against those who eal ill opinions without apprenticeship or license . Medicine and law are /z/ liberty , which tends , more than any thing else , to destroy the intellectual energy of a people . Right to hear Arms , The right of self-defence is a natural right , which legislation should aid , rather than supersede . By some it is thought that in a well-regulated community individuals should be altogether debarred from what is called " taking the law into their own hands , " and that they should , in every case , look to the public authorities for protection from injury . It is said that social order is best maintained by the enforcement of such a principle . A standing army is upheld , in or-der to protect the community from foreign aggression ; a police force is maintained , in order to protect individuals from private wrong ; and it is argued that the agency of these forces supersedes the necessity of individual effort . Undoubtedly , the maintenance of social order is an object of paramount importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear a rate , if it can only be upheld by extinguishing manly virtues in a population . During the middle ages , scenes of violence were of much more frequent occurrence than in modern days , and great evil arose from those breaches of social order ; but it can not be denied that the energies of individual character were by these very disorders developed , in a manner* almost unknown to the present generation . The right to bear arms is one of those fundamental rights upon which the liberties of a free people rests . In a wellordered community , the occasions may be rare in which an individual has occasion to protect his person from violence ; but such cases may occur , and when they occur , the tardy interference of the authorities often comes too late to repel the menaced wrong . For personal protection , therefore , every man should be allowed to possess arras . If he make an improper use of these arms , let him be severely punished ; but the apprehension of an occasional outrage is no sufficient reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If it will not make laws for itself , should not the state make laws for it ? Have not all of us a domestic index ? Are there not many books and papers none of us will pennit to be read in our houses , or by persons under our influence ? Why , then , this outcry against the general principle of limiting the press ? M. /z/ The use of arms by the population at large is the best security that a nation can possess against subjugation by a foreign foe . When a people rely exclusively upon a standing army for protection , then if that army be vanquished in a battle , or in a succession of defeats , no alternative remains except submission ; but a people accustomed to the use of arms , and courageous in spirit , may rally after a hundred defeats , and recover its freedom . Nor is it alone against foreign foes that a nation ought to be prepared to defend its liberty . The minister or sovereign desires to enslave a people naturally wishes to deprive them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which a nation should be slow to resort ; but the fear of such a contingency ought to be ever present to the minds of those who design to enslave a country . A patriotic legislator , therefore , will encourage rather than repress a disposition on the part of the people to possess arms , and to learn their use . The liberties of England are due to the maintenance of this right , which is secured , as a part of the constitutional system of England , by the Bill of Rights . The liberties of America were acquired by the use of the rifle , handled by brave men . The liberties of Switzerland were acquired , and have been maintained , by the possession of arms , and by a manly determination to use them in the hour of need . Such popular rights as are to be found among the nations of the Continent are secured by the practice of training to the use of arms , as a national guard or militia , a large proportion of the joopulation . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arms , because she desires to keep that nation in a state of subjection , and because she remembers that when Ireland possessed , in the Volunteers of 1782 , a military organization , of a national character , the interests of Ireland ceased to be sacrificed to those of England . Among the fundamental rights of a nation , the right of resistance to illegal acts ought to he distinctly recognized hy the law . In the case of misdoings by inferior functionaries , this right is admitted by the common law of England . If a constable arrest a person without proper authority , or beyond the limits of his jurisdiction , he may be resisted ; and though the law is not explicit in establishing a right to resist kings and parliaments , when they invade the fundamental liberties of the people , yet , the history of the English nation proves that the /z/ practical exercise of this right has been in no slight degree instrumental in animating the spirit , and in moulding the form , of the British constitution . Not to seek examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wrested from weak and wicked sovereigns , we may observe , that the general concurrence of thinking men now applauds the resistance of the Parliament to the illegal and tyrannical proceedings of Charles L , and sanctions the deposition of James II. , at the Revolution of 1688 , for infringing the laws , and invading the liberties , of the British people . A similar concurrence of opinion applauds the successful resistance of the American colonists to the misguided legislation of the British Parliament . Even upon the Continent of Europe , where , upon the whole , usurpation by oppressors has been more successful than resistance by the oppressed , we find instances in which this right has been vindicated , and its exercise approved by the general verdict of mankind . No one now hesitates to admit that the Low Countries were justified in resisting the bigoted tyranny of Spain , or that Switzerland was justified in liberating itself from the Austrian yoke . Few will be found to deny that Charles X. was justly deposed by the French people in 1830 , on account of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Press . It is unnecessary to multiply examples drawn from ancient or modern times . When successful , revolt and rebellion are almost always commended ; but our judgment respecting the lawfulness of resistance ought not to depend upon the test of success . I shall not attempt to argue this question upon religious grounds . The advocates of passive obedience and of active resistance have equally drawn from the Sacred Scriptures passages which appear to support and sanction their respective views and proceedings . The common sense of mankind , the implanted instinct of man 's nature is , in reference to this question , a surer guide than fanatical interpretations of doubtful precedents or dogmas extracted by forced constructions from either the Old or the New Testament . When a ruler attempts to violate the rights which belong to a nation , he ought to be firmly resisted by the conscientious citizen , even as the multitude ought to be resisted when they invade the province which has been assigned to the ruler , by the deliberate will of the nation . If , then , kings or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionaries ought to be resisted with as much promptitude as would be exhibited in oiposition to the PRINCIPLES OP GOVERNMEirr. 103 meanest bailiff , if he were to act without due authority . Resistance upon such occasions is a duty . Its exercise may be restrained by force , and then prudential considerations may in some measure excuse neglect of duty ; but the moral complexion of the act of resistance in no degree depends upon the chances of success . When Louis Napoleon , by the coup d'etat of December , 1851 , superseded all the constitutional authorities of the state , and invested himself , by the aid of military power , with a dictatorship , it was the duty of every French citizen to have opposed force to force ; and those who fell in the performance of this duty deserve to be honored as martyrs to the cause of constitutional freedom. * When the union between England and Ireland was effected by a corrupt traffic between the wicked ministers of England and an equally wicked majority of the Irish Parliament , it was the duty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender of their constitutional right of self-government . The Legislative Union between England and Ireland was perpetrated , in violation of the most solemn international compact ; and this violation was not sanctioned by an appeal to the nation . It was simply effected by purchasing the votes of a majority in both Houses of the Irish Parliament by the corruption of men , who under a defective constitution were invested with the function of making laws for the Irish people , but not with a right to extinguish their legislature . If the British Parliament were to abdicate their functions , and deliver over to the sovereign all authority , legislative , judicial , and executive , it would become the duty of every British citizen to resist by force such a treacherous surrender of their constitutional rights . In all such cases resistance is an obvious duty the highest of social obligations . Illegal usurpation , aided by military power and immoral corruption , often triumphs over right , and in such cases those who fail must expect to suffer the penalties which frequently attend the performance of virtuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bis life in fighting the battles of his country ; but in the case of both the citizen and the soldier , the merit or demerit of his conduct does not depend upon success . In the regulation of human affairs , Providence does not always award retribution to crime or reward to virtue . Yet crime is not the less crime , because it remains unpunished ; nor is virtue the less virtue , because it is unrewarded. /z/ I may here quote , in support of these opinions , the authority of Locke , who says , " In all states and conditions the true remedy of force ivithout authority is to oppose force to it . The use of force without authority always puts him that uses it into a state of war as the aggressor , and renders him liable to be treated accordingly . " But not only is the citizen justified in resisting acts which are clearly at variance with the law and the constitution of the country in which he lives , he may also be warranted in resisting misgovernment , even though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifiable , abuses and tyranny , once established , would be forever perpetuated . I will not avail myself of this opportunity for endeavoring to prove that the Irish nation would have been justified in rebelling against British misgovernment in the year 1848 , or that the inhabitants of Hungary and Northern Italy deserve to be commended for having endeavored to shake off the yoke of Austria . I will not go back to the times of the Sicilian tyrants , or of the Imperial Caesars , but will content myself with adducing the most recent instance that has fallen under my observation , in which resistance to misgovernment would have been justifiable , even though that misgovernment were not at variance with law . Only a few months have elapsed since the Australian colonies of Great Britain were engaged in a controversy with the mother country on account of the continued transportation of criminals to these colonies . A tissue of ftillacies had been woven , and used even till they became threadbare , by successive Colonial Secretaries , in defence of this persevering violation of the wishes and interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adolescent communities had resisted by force the importation of the concentrated crime of the empire into their bosom , all mankind would have pronounced that a resort to arms upon such a quarrel would have done honor to those who bore them , even though it should have led to an open revolt from the dominion of the mother country . This contingency was averted by a tardy concession to the opinion of Australia , but the concession was made rather through consideration for the interests of England , and through apprehension of the result of a struggle , than from a just appreciation of the claims and wishes of the inhabitants of Australia . In all such cases , however , considerations of expediency should control the emotions and acts that may be prompted by justifiable disaffection . We have seen that when a functionary violates the law , resistance /z/ becomes an imperative duty ; but when a ruler misgoverns a country , without absolutely contravening any existing law , those who desire to eftect , by force of arras , a change in the political institutions , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought carefully to weigh the chances of success . It is obvious that in such case failure will strengthen the hands of the oppressor , and tend to extinguish the hope of future amelioration . A civil war , indeed , is not the worst of evils , for patient acquiescence in servitude debases the spirit of a people and injures their character , if not their material hiterest , more than the most destructive civil war ; but still internal warfare is , undoubtedly , one of the greatest calamities that can afflict a nation . ! No one , therefore , ought to take upon himself the responsibility of exciting or of aiding such a conflict , until he is fully convinced that the misgovernment which his country endures is productive of more evil than can reasonably be expected to arise from a revolutionary struggle nor unless there appears to be a probable chance of success . It is scarcely necessary to discuss the question , whether individuals are at liberty to get rid of tyrants by means of assassination , because the common feeling of mankind revolts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of casuistry , indeed , it may be debated whether Charlotte Corday , in assassinating Marat , committed an act which ought to be condemned , or rather which was not deserving of applause. * We know that Cicero , no mean authority in regard of moral philosophy , commended the assassination of Julius Caesar . The memory of Harmodius and Aristogiton was cherished by the Athenians , for having delivered their country from servitude by the murder of a tyrant . It may be argued that an oppressor is like a wild beast , which may be lawfully killed by every brave man who has the hardihood to encounter it . Undoubtedly it will be found that not only many kings , but also many ministers , and even many private individuals , ' have been permitted to live , whose early destruction , by any means , fair or foul , would have saved the lives and abridged the sufferings of multitudes of human beings . But although we may admit that the extinction of such monsters would have been attended with benefit to mankind , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest degree dangerous to encourage individuals to become the executioners of those whom they may choose to regard as public enemies . It is obvious that sentiments of private revenge , or of fanaticism , or the suggestions of self-interest , would often be masked under pretensions of public duty ; and the life of such a king as Henry IV . of France would be as often exposed to the dagger of the assassin as that of a Dionysius or a Nero . The punishment of a tyrant is a solemn act of national justice . It can not always be effected by means of a regular juridical trial , but it ought always to be sanctioned by the verdict of the nation , and to be executed by the ministers of the national will . Hence , the legislator must denounce , and the law must punish , an individual assassin , even though his victim may be a monster , whose removal from earth is a blessing and a deliverance to mankind . Right of Individuals to enjoy Personal Liberty , The right of personal freedom obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bound to respect . The right to personal liberty can be forfeited only by crime . If an individual commit an offence against society , the interests of society require that he should be punished , with a view to deter others from the commission of similar offences . In the infliction of this punishment the person of the offender is necessarily subjected to restraint . Slavery in every form is inconsistent with this right ; and , though domestic slavery has existed in various countries , at every period of history , it is not defensible upon any principle of justice or policy . Conquest has been held to give a title to the conqueror over the persons of the conquered . In ancient times the doom which always awaited the captive was slavery ; and the most enlightened men of ancient Greece and Rome appear to have acquiesced in the practice of consigning the captive to servitude , as a custom , the propriety of which could not be contested . Undoubtedly , in time of war , it becomes necessary to subject to restraint the person of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued beyond the conclusion of the W'ar . To take a part in the defence of one 's country is a virtue , not a crime . Personal freedom may be lost in such a struggle , and the untutored savage may feel disposed to retain /z/ in servitude the captive whose life he has spared ; but reasonable and generous men will exercise towards such prisoners no restraint beyond what is necessary for their own protection . It is not unreasonable that a ransom should be exacted for the liberation of a captive , because such a ransom is only a demand for indemnification of the expenses incurred in the war . Until the stipulated ransom be paid , detention of the captive is justifiable ; but all such arrangements should be adjusted in the terms of a treaty of peace . For slavery such as has been upheld by European nations , in modern times , there is no justification whatever . It is purely a mercenary traffic . Man is regarded as an instrument of gain , which may be purchased and sold like a bullock or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of natural and revealed religion , is violated by those who uphold slavery , such as recently existed in the colonies of Great Britain , and such as still exists in the United States of America , in the Spanish colonies , and in the Brazils . Piracy , or any other crime , may be justified by such arguments as are urged in defence of slavery of this description . It is maintained , simply , upon the principle , that the strong may do what they please with the weak ; a principle which sanctions every sort of usurpation . It is a circumstance not a little disgraceful to modern society , which boasts so much its superior civilization and piety , that this foul blot should be allowed still to stain the social institutions of civilized communities . More especially is it a disgrace to that republic , which claims , in other respects deservedly , the merit of presenting the most perfect organization that the world has ever yet witnessed for the maintenance of social liberty . I admit that the English Government , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African slaves into North America . I admit that to extricate the United States from the evils which are connected with this fatal disease in their social system is a task of extreme difficulty . I concur with those who reprobate a reckless disregard of the existing circumstances of the slave population on the part of those who vindicate their natural rights . But , on the other hand , I contend that it ought to be the aim of the statesmen of America to secure the eventual emancipation of the slaves , and , in the mean time , to mitigate ' the sufferings incidental to their condition . Instead of finding in the legislation of the States evidences of such a humane and noble design , the friends and admirers of the great republic /z/ of the West are compelled to admit , with shame and sorrow , that the tendency of recent enactments leads rather to a restriction upon the rights of the negroes , than to their eventual liberation. * It is a question more difficult to determine , whether , in any case , individuals should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain . In some countries personal freedom has been held to be a sort of property , of which the possessor might dispose in exchange for a consideration which he might deem to be an equivalent . In ancient Rome the debtor became the slave of the creditor . The public policy of modern nations , for the most part , repudiates such engagements . An individual can not , according to the law of England , sell himself as a slave , but still it can not be said that such a traffic is wholly prohibited . Every contract for personal service involves , to a modified extent , a restraint upon personal freedom . Nor is it easy to say what ought to be the limits within which such contracts should be confined . In the case of the Coolies of India , who have been deported from their native country to the West Indies , to serve as indented laborers for a specified number of years , the difference between such engagements and domestic slavery is scarcely perceptible . Engagements of this kind can be enforced only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where domestic servitude exists . In the case of apprenticeship a father barters the personal liberty of his child , during a specified period , in consideration of advantages to be obtained either by himself or by his child ; and apprenticeship partakes much of the nature of domestic slavery . It appears by some of the recent disclosures which have taken place with regard to the * Our author 's views on this point will probably give rise to conflicting opinions in this country . It is certain that negro slavery in the Ur.itea States is not only a consequence of our antecedents , but of the negro 's also . What was he , when the African slave dealer drove him down to the coast , naked , branded , barbarous ? A savage , a thorough savage . The buyer bought a man in appearance , a savage in reality . He was transported illegally , I know ( and if his captor were caught , he ought to be hanged ) to a civilized state of society . Was civilization to go back , or was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his pai-t to serve and to obey . Every just man will desire with our author the ultimate freedom of the African slave ; but it is not for the savage to claim freedom of the civilized , not certainly for the civilized to grant it to the savage . He must be civilized before he is free . Unquestionably the obligation to act the civilizer 's part rests upon the master class ; and if they perversely refuse to perform that part , then the majority in the state , or even a foreign power , may have a right , in the interests of humanity , to compel them to abandon their claim* of ownership , or to discharge the duties those claims envelop . M. /z/ treatment of children in mines , that the condition of the young slaves of the United States has been infinitely preferable to that of the children , female as well as male , of many freemen of England . Ought such contracts to be permitted by law ? For my own part , I am inclined to think that no individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a period longer than twelve months . To forego the unfettered exercise of the will , perhaps to endure insolence and annoyance of all kinds , during a period of twelve months , is to make a sacrifice which pecuniary advantages can rarely compensate ; but on the other hand , there are some kinds of work which can not be carried on with profit , either to the employer or to the employed , without the intervention of a contract for personal service . In such cases the contract must be enforced by penalties which infringe personal liberty , but contracts of this nature should never exceed in duration the length of time necessarily required by the exigency of the service , and there are few cases in which this exigency extends beyond the period of twelve months . The case of the soldier and of the sailor must be dealt with upon exceptional , rather than upon general principles . Military discipline necessarily involves an entire surrender of personal freedom . Obedience the submission of one man 's will to that of another is the first requisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to all intents and purposes a slave . He is bound to go where his superior officer directs him to go . He is bound to do what his superior officer directs him to do , however much his own judgment or inclination may revolt against such directions . This being the essential nature of military service , we can only require , in behalf of the soldier , guarantees against the abuses of power ; and with this view it is desirable that no one should be compelled to enter the service , except with his own free consent ; that before an individual enters it , he should be fully apprised of all the privations and responsibilities which belong to it ; hat engagements for military service should be of moderate luration ; and that facilities should be afforded to the soldier or purchasing his discharge , whenever he becomes desirous to uit it . It may be said , indeed , that every citizen owes to his ountry an obligation to hold himself in readiness to share in ts defence ; and that the selfish or cowardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the brave and generous cheerfully undertake . This observation , however , /z/ applies only to defensive war . It is perfectly right that every citizen should be called upon , in case of necessity , to bear arms in defence of his country ; and every individual ought to be held liable to serve in a national guard , or , in default of personal service , to procure a substitute by pecuniary sacrifices . But such a service is very different from that of the modern soldier of a standing army . In the former case , the citizen is seldom required to move far from his own home . His service is only occasional , and is seldom incompatible with the other duties of life : whereas , the soldier who enlists in a standing army is liable to be sent out of his native country ; he is liable to be kept away from his home for a considerable number of years ; he is liable to be sent upon expeditions of offensive warfare against enemies , who have never done or menaced wrong to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the other occupations of life . It is doubtful whether , in point of morality , such an engagement is in its nature justifiable , but , without raising a futile controversy upon this question , we may safely lay down for the protection of the soldier the conditions above set forth , as conditions which ought to be sanctioned by legislation , in modifying that infringement of personal liberty , which is inseparable from military service . It is almost unnecessary to observe , that the foregoing remarks apply equally to the case of the sailor as of the soldier . With the principles which we have here enunciated , the practice of impressment ( which to a very recent period prevailed in the British navy ) is wholly incompatible . It is difficult to conceive any description of violence more brutal and unjustifiable than that of impressment . A sailor returning home to his family , after a long separation , was frequently torn from his domestic circle carried away as a prisoner , and placed in the condition of a slave aboard a man-of-war , destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept for an indefinite number of years in this state of servitude . What description of slavery , ancient or modern , presents features more hideous than those which belong to this detestable practice ? No considerations of state policy can justify such violation of the natural right of personal freedom . Nor would it be difficult to show , that even if the practice of impressment were justifiable , it is at least as impolitic in its results as it is detestable in its operation . Imprisonment for debt is an infringement of personal lib- /z/ PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT . Ill ertj which is very questionable in its principle , although it has been the practice of almost all civilized nations . Tlie non-payment of a debt is , in some cases , a criminal act , and ought to be punished as such . In other cases it results from unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances , and ought not to receive the punishment due only to crime . He who incurs a debt , under promise to discharge it , whilst he has no reasonable hope of being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a debt with a deliberate intention not to pay it , is a thief . He who , having means to pay a just debt , withholds payment , is guilty of fraud . In these cases , imprisonment for debt is but an equitable retribution , and ought to be inflicted upon the offender , as a punishment is inflicted for any other offence against society . On the other hand , there are numberless cases , in which the non-payment of debt arises from unforeseen accidents or misfortunes , and in which the debtor is willing , but unable , to discharge obligations which he has incurred . In such cases it is cruel , unjust , and impolitic to imprison the person of the debtor . No crime has been committed . He therefore does not deserve punishment . Imprisonment deprives him of the opportunity of regaining by his own exertions the means of livelihood , and of ultimately discharging the obligations which lie has incurred . The creditor gains nothing by his imprisonment , whilst society loses the benefit of his labor , and incurs the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the cases , in which a debtor fails to discharge a debt through fraudulent intention , and those in which non-payment of debt arises from innocent misfortune . On all ordinary occasions , the property , not the person , of the debtor should be placed at the disposal of the creditor ; and imprisonment for debt should be reserved only for those cases in which the intention to defraud can be clearly proved . The law already provides for the punishment of those who are guiUy of embezzlement and of swindling ; so that it recognizes the possibility of discovering fraudulent intention . The non-payment of debt , under circumstances in which the intention to defraud is manifest , should be placed jnder this class of crimes , and punished accordingly . The right of personal freedom can not be forfeited by non'onformity of opinion to any prevailing dogmas of either religion or politics . Among natural rights , the most unquesionable is freedom of thought . Civil disabilities consequent /z/ upon non-conformity , and all tests framed with a view to ascertain conformity or non-conformity , are unjustifiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an act of tyranny to withhold civil privileges , how much more unjustifiable must it be to inflict punishment on account of non-conformity of opinion I For instance , it is not necessary to inquire whether an elector entertain infidel or republican opinions , even in a country of which the established institutions are Christian and monarchical . Whatever opinions he may entertain upon these points , he is entitled , as a citizen , to be represented . Much less is it justifiable to extort from an individual a confession of faith , with a view to punish him by personal suffering for his involuntary deviation from orthodoxy . It is very questionable whether oaths of any kind ought to be imposed on any occasion , either upon private citizens or upon public functionaries . " Sweai* not at all , " is an explicit command , obedience to which can scarcely be otherwise than acceptable to the Divine Lawgiver , as well as useful to the state . Oaths make hypocrites , but afford no protection to society against the misdoings of dishonest men . The penalty attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , restrains unscrupulous men , and those who are conscientious do not require , or ought not to be harassed by , the imposition of such a test . A French functionary , who has held office during the last forty years , has been compelled to swear allegiance to not less than five different dynasties , whose rights are incompatible with each other ; viz. to the Emperor Napoleon I. to Louis XVIII . and Charles X. to Louis Philippe to the Republic of 1848 to Napoleon III . What security has this oath afforded to any of these dynasties in their hour of danger ? In connection with this question of conscientious obligation , we may inquire whether a citizen ought or ought not to be permitted to divest himself of the allegiance which he naturally owes to the land of his birth , and to the authorities which rule over it . As long as an individual claims and enjoys the privileges which are attached to citizenship in the land of his nativity as long as he acquiesces in the conditions of that citizenship he owes subjection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native country . But it seems to be a violation of natural liberty to deny to any one the right of selecting for himself a home different from that assigned to him by the accidental circumstances of his birth or origin . All persons /z/ ouglit , therefore , to be permitted to transfer their allegiance from the country of their birth to that of their adoption . But naturalization in a foreign country ouglit to be considered as an act of the most solemn kind , and ought to involve a forfeiture of the original right of citizenship . No one can reasonably expect to enjoy simultaneously the political privileges which are accorded to nations in two different countries whose interests are at variance with each other , and which are liable , at any moment , to be brought into armed collision with each other . It would surely be absurd to permit an Englishman or a Frenchman to become President of the United States , unless he had previously disclaimed allegiance to the rulers of the land of his birth . Violations of personal liberty founded upon imputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to be circumscribed within the most distinct limits , by every nation which desires to retain its freedom . Tyranny seldom attempts to accomplish its ends without inventing some pretext to justify its violence . The victim which it wishes to strike is therefore generally denounced as a malefactor . The executive power , in every state , is necessarily invested with authority to seize offenders ; and , if it be left to the discretion of executive ofRcers to determine what shall be considered an offence against society , it will be found that every act inconvenient or displeasing to them every act which tends to expose or to correct abuses every act which tends to prevent usurpation will be interpreted by the administrators of executive authority as an offence against the state . It becomes necessary , therefore , to provide guarantees for the protection of the citizen from an abuse of official power , as well as from the violence of the lawless miscreant . Under the British constitution , one of such guarantees is to be found in the " Habeas Corpus " Act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been confined by any person or authority , upon any pretext whatever , to appeal to one of the higher courts of judicature , with a view to ascertain whether such imprisonment has been conformable to law . If it appear that the grounds alleged in the return to the writ of " Habeas Corpus " are not sufficient to justify such imprisonment , the prisoner is forthwith discharged from custody . This Act serves most effectually to protect the personal liberty of the citizen , because it precludes the executive authorities from confining any person upon vague charges not recognized by law as /z/ offences . It is to be observed , however , that in order to give full etficiency to such a law , it is necessary that offences should be strictly defined . If an executive officer were authorized to seize an accused person upon suspicion , or upon vague charges of misconduct , the proceeding by writ of " Habeas Corpus " would become futile , because the return would set forth some such vague charge as a sufficient ground for the imprisonment . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from illegal imprisonment , it ought to be provided : That the friends of the person confined shall , by some process , ( such as that of the writ of " Habeas Corpus , " ) enjoy the utmost facility for bringing the case under the cognizance of a legal tribunal , in order to ascertain whether the imprisonment is conformable to law ; and , if it be not sanctioned by law , of procuring the immediate discharge of the prisoner . That no person shall be held liable to imprisonment except for the commission of some offence distinctly defined by law . That the allegation of mere intention , unaccompanied by overt acts , shall in no case be considered to form a sufficient ground for imprisonment . That , except in certain cases , specially reserved and defined , no person shall be imprisoned , unless regular information be laid against him by some person prepared to allege the commission of an offence cognizable by law . That redress and amends shall be secured , by an easy and inexpensive process , to persons imprisoned without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal liberty of the citizen to be omitted , even in the case of those who are legally committed to custody , upon charge of having been guilty of an offence distinctly known and defined by law . Every man ought to be presumed to be capable of proving his innocence until he is actually found upon trial to be guilty . It is true that an information , sworn upon the oath of a credible witness , and supported by concurrent circumstances , raises , prima facie , a presumption of guilt against the person accused , so that in the case of very heinous crimes it would not be safe to leave the person accused at large . The man who has committed one murder will seldom scruple to commit a second . So also with those who commit burglary , forgery , and similar crimes . It is therefore necessary , for the protection of society , to put restraint upon the persons of those who are /z/ charged with such offences ; but there is a large class of cases in which bail may , with propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , the person charged with an offence should be left at liberty until the day of trial , upon his finding sureties that he will then appear to abide the judgment of the court . Even in the case of the gravest offences , if the evidence is inadequate to raise a strong presumption of guilt , the person accused should be admitted to bail . It is an act of unjustifiable cruelty to subject an innocent man to confinement ; and it is not possible to provide reparation for such an imprisonment , after his innocence has been established on trial . Hence we may add , that if the person accused be not admitted to bail , he ought to be brought to trial with as little delay as possible . We may here also observe , that it is a violation of natural justice to condemn any person without hearing his defence . Except under very peculiar and exceptional circumstances , the accused ought not to be condemned in his absence . Were he present , it is possible that he would have it in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though the clearest evidence might , in his absence , seem to prove his guilt . He ought also to be entitled to a copy of the information laid against him , and of the names of the witnesses who are to be produced against him , so that he may be enabled to expose unfounded accusations , by bringing forward evidence calculated to rebut the charge . Many an innocent man has been convicted only because these opportunities of counteracting false evidence have not been afforded to him . A person accused ought always to be brought face to face with his accuser , and all trials should take place in the presence of indifferent bystanders . Secrecy in trials , and inquisitorial methods of procedure , necessarily tend to vitiate the administration of justice , by removing the restraints which publicity naturally imposes upon injustice , and by withholding the guarantees which afford protection to innocence . To extract a confession of guilt by torture of any kind , whether it be by imprisonment or by the excruciating torments of the rack , is a proceeding obviously at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumes guilt , and punishes equally the innocent as well as the guilty . Yet this practice has prevailed at various periods of the world 's history , among nations who have called themselves civilized , and has been sanctioned by philosophers and divines . The common /z/ law of England , contradistinguished from that which was administered by churchmen in the Courts of High Commission and Star Chamber , wisely presumes that the accused is innocent until he is proved to be guilty , and humanely provides that no one , either as a principal or as a witness , shall be called upon to criminate himself . An excellent regulation of law provides in England that no one shall be tried twice for the same offence . If the jury disagree , the accused may be again put upon trial , but after they have given their verdict he is exempt from further prosecution for the same offence . Though the substantial claims of justice are sometimes defeated by this practice , yet it affords a valuable security to the citizen against vindictive and harassing persecution on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all legal proceedings the statement of the defendant should be considered as equivalent to the uncorroborated assertion of the accuser or plaintiff . The law of evidence , which has heretofore prevailed in the administration of English jurisprudence , has been , in many respects , most objectionable . It appears to have been framed by crafty lawyers for the express purpose of rendering the development of truth as difficult as possible . Those who were best qualified to set forth the exact facts of the case were excluded from the witness box , on the plea that being interested parties they could not be expected to make a true statement of facts . Of late , some modifications of the law of evidence have taken place , which diminish the absurdity and injustice of the previous practice . I reserve , until we arrive at that part of this work which relates to courts of judicature , more detailed observations upon judicial proceedings . Right of Association , Among personal rights , we may specify the right of association , as one which is essential to the enjoyment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignificant , especially if he belong to the middle or inferior classes of society ; but power and importance are secured to classes by the aggregation of individuals . The right to associate for all justifiable purposes is a privilege of inestimable value to the democracy . It ought , therefore , to be proclaimed as a fundamental and indefeasible inheritance in every charter of public /z/ liberty . Despots being conscious that this power , like that of a free press , tends to check the misdoings of arbitrary government , have at all times sought to restrain it ; In some countries , all assemblages of more than a small number of individuals have been rendered illegal , and subjected to penal restraint , unless held under permission of the constituted authorities . In free states , the right to congregate for the peaceful promotion of all legitimate aims is wholly unrestrained . In the former case , public discontent resorts for redress to secret conspiracy ; in the latter , to noisy but harmless declamation . The sentiments of the people find expression at public meetings , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion , to be erroneous , or to be entertained by only a minority of the nation , they are overruled by the vis inertice , or by the active opposition of an adverse majority . If , on the contrary , they are directed to useful objects , which are sanctioned by the general sense of the community , they eventually coerce the Government and the legislature , by moral agency , to act in conformity with them . Whether armed associations should be permitted to debate social and political questions , or whether political clubs should be allowed to arm themselves , and to act in organized array , for the purpose of giving additional weight to their efforts to procure changes in the laws and institutions of a country , is a question which admits of controversy . As an Irishman , I can not but feel pride in calling to mind the noble array of the Volunteers of 1782 , when 40,000 men took up arms , on the one hand , to defend their country from foreign aggression , and on the other , to vindicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of those questions , the solution of which must depend upon the peculiar circumstances of each country in which it is raised , and which can not be settled by any predetermined rules . In general , it may be laid down as a principle , that armed associations ought not to be formed for the promotion of internal changes of a political kind . The possession of armed force often tempts men to exercise it , and if its intervention be used in civil affairs , resistance brings about civil war . On the other hand , a patriotic Government , which is thoroughly identified with the people , will encourage them not only to learn the use of arms , but also to organize themselves into armed associations , with a view to the defence of their country against foreign foes , and with a view to the protection of social order . In the United States of America , /z/ no evil is found to arise from the formation of armed associations ; and such associations are encouraged rather than forbidden by the constituted authorities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am convinced that if the gold diggers at the gold fields of Australia had been encouraged by the Government to form themselves into armed associations of a voluntary kind , much of the crime and disorder , which have rendered necessary the creation and maintenance of an extensive police force , would have been obviated or suppressed without difficulty . Might of Property , Though a natural sense of justice would not suggest that the right of property should be carried to such an extent , or be protected by such securities , as those by which , upon principles of expediency , it is fenced under the institutions of modern society , yet we are bound to place the right of property amongst the natural rights of man . I have not used any arguments to establish the position that men possess natural rights , because I conceive that the notion of such rights is implanted in the mind by an instinctive sense , independent of reasoning . " We do not require argument to convince us that a part is less than the whole . Neither do we require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state of nature , he who seizes the food which another has gathered by means of his labor , whether in hunting , fishing , or in tilling the earth , is guilty of a wrong . In like manner , it is felt that , if one man builds a hut for his residence , another can not justly take forcible possession of it . According to the principles of natural right , every one is entitled to enjoy unmolested the produce of his own labor , provided that he has not infringed the rights of others in the application of that labor . Such natural right , however , does not justify him in monopolizing any article which is limited in quantity . In this case the community has its rights as well as the individual , and its rights deserve at least equal consideration . The right of property is one of the few natural rights of man which have been rather confirmed and enlarged than infringed by the legislation of modern society . When a conquest takes place , this right is indeed generally violated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquest , for /z/ instance , nearly all the Anglo-Saxon possessors of the soil of England were forcibly deprived of their possessions . Confiscation and proscription generally result from tyranny , whatever may be its form . In revolutions , the rights of property are often invaded ; but , upon the whole , it is wonderful how much disposed mankind have been , in all ages , to maintain the inviolability of private property . Such a disposition is founded upon a sense not so much of justice as of expediency . It is obvious that unless security be afforded to property , there can be no advance in civilization . Men will not sow , unless they expect to reap . No one will accumulate wealth , unless he hope to be able to keep or dispose of it according to his own wishes . Commerce will not be carried on , unless the merchant who purchases commodities , for the purpose of selling them , be assured that they will not be ravished from him . To maintain the security of property is , therefore , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , easy to prove that , in many instances , property has been acquired by means which ill deserve the protection claimed for its possession and transmission ; and it may be contended that wealth acquired by spoliation is not entitled to protection . But such cases are rare , when compared with the immense mass of transactions which are connected with the possession of property ; and society would be involved in perpetual confusion , if general principles were to be violated in a vain attempt to secure retributive justice against those who have acquired property by a title originally defective . It may be said , that a share of the earth and of its fruits are among the indefeasible claims of every child of man , and that , therefore , laws which allocate or secure to individual proprietors large possessions , whilst others are altogether excluded from a share in that which nature has given to all , are in their essence unjust . There is much force in this reasoning , and nothing but the mandate of an inexorable expediency can justify such exclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged to defend the usurpation . In the establishment , for instance , of some colonies recently founded by Great Britain , thousands of acres have been appropriated to individuals by the governing power , whilst impediments have been designedly created in order to prevent poor men from acquii-ing possession of small lots of land . /z/ It should be the object of the legislator to provide compensation for the loss of natural rights , whenever they are invaded , so that it may be manifest that it is for the interest , even of the most destitute , to be born in a civilized rather than in an uncivilized state of society . It is to be lamented that , in general , there has existed a stronger disposition to secure the propeijj of the rich than that of the poor of the landlord than that of the tenant - of the capitalist than that of the laborer . The property of the working man is his industry ; and every facility should be afforded to him of applying it to the best advantage . Legal enactments , far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the manner most beneficial to himself , have frequently been framed with a view to promote the interests of the employer at the expense of the laborer . The working classes have themselves often infringed the rights of industry by regulations which prevent individuals from applying themselves to trades into which they have not been introduced by a customary process of initiation . Every infringement of the natural rights of property , whether arising from law or from custom , is to be guarded against , as involving a violation of natural justice . The right of property , however , must always be held subordinate to the public good . Thus , the imposition of a tax , equitably levied and usefully applied , is not considered an invasion of the right of property , although the tax may confiscate no inconsiderable portion of the property liable to it . Nor is it considered unreasonable to take away private property from individuals for public uses , provided adequate compensation be afforded to the possessor for its loss . When discussing questions connected with the development of trade , commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in detail , some of the principles which ought to regulate the acquisition , exchange , and transmission of property ; we may therefore now resume our review of the organization of constitutional governments . miNCIPLES OP GOVERNMENT . 121 /z/ Having , ill the foregoing pages , traced an outline of the structure and functions of the legislature , we have now to treat of the executive department of government . The executive is appointed , as the name indicates , to execute and administer the laws framed by the legislature , and is furnished with the powers and prerogatives necessary to carry into effect this duty . Among the functions which naturally belong to the executive , we may enumerate the following as the most jrominent /z/ Protection of life and property , and maintenance of social order . Enforcement of the laws of the land , as enacted by the legislature , and interpreted by the tribunals of justice . Superintendence of establishments supported by the state for the administration of justice for the restraint and punishment of offenders for the promotion of religion and education for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the healthy of the community for the advancement of agriculture , manufactures , and commerce for the construction and maintenance of public works . Dispensation of mercy . Grant of honors and dignities . Command of the military and naval forces of the state . Negotiation with foreign powers . Administration of colonial affairs . Collection and application of the public revenue . Coinage of money . It is not necessary to tell the reader of history that the organization of executive power has , in different states , as- sumed great variety of form . The political constitutions of the Jewish nation , of the ancient Egyptians , of the Persians , of the Republics of Greece , of the Roman Republic , of the German Empire , of the kingdom of Poland , of the Swiss Confederation , of the Italian Republics , of the kingdoms of France , of Spain , and of England , of the United Provinces , of the United States of America , of the Empire of Russia , of the various kingdoms of Asia , not only exhibit varieties /z/ of construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each state there have been , from time to time , fundamental changes in the system of executive government . It is no easy problem to determine which , among the many forms of executive administration that have existed , is the most conducive to good government . By some reasoners this problem can not be fairly discussed , because they fancy that the only form of government sanctioned by heaven is monarchy , and that kings rule by divine right . To me this theory appears so absurd as not to require refutation . I shall therefore assume that nations are at perfect liberty to choose that system of rule which is most acceptable to them , and most conducive to their interests ; and that , if they prefer a monarchy , the king so chosen rules as the first magistrate of the people by virtue of their will not by any self-inherent or sacred right so that a consul , equally with a king , is invested with that sacredness which belongs to authority confided to one man for the benefit of a community . Hereditary monarchy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government which has found the most general acceptance amongst mankind . . Elective monarchy , which perhaps is the most natural of all forms of government , has been proved by experience to be attended with many inconveniences . A sovereign who - enjoys during a lifetime supreme power is generally desirous to transmit to his posterity ihe inheritance of such power , and must be destitute of capacity if he fail to acquire at least a considerable party in the state prepared to uphold his design . Thus , according to the inherent tendencies of human nature , a foundation is laid , in elective sovereignties , for a struggle upon the death of each monarch . If there be no member of the immediate family of the late sovereign desirous to contend for the crown , the claims of other powerful competitors give rise to contentions , to intrigues , and to corruption , which are fraught with the most disastrous consequences . In the case of the Roman Empire , how often was the peace of the world disturbed by contentions for the supreme authority , which might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession ! Upon the death of the prophet Mahomet , a similar contention was engendered amongst his followers ; and even to the present hour , the claims of the house of Ali to the caliphate , in preference to those of the rivals by whom his dynasty was excluded , forms a subject of controversy /z/ which divides the Iahoraetan world . In the case of the German states , the election of an emperor was found to be attended with so much inconvenience that the dignity of emperor was at last rendered hereditary in the house of Austria . There is every reason to believe that Poland would now be an independent and integral kingdom , instead of being a subjugated province , if the succession to the crown had been hereditary , not elective Tiie true interests of an hereditary monarch are always identical with the permanent interests of the people whom he governs . His power , and that of his family , will necessarily increase in proportion as the prosperity of his people increases . His influence and his happiness depend greatly upon their attachment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can feel but a temporary interest in the concerns of the realm which he governs . Unless he entertain an expectation that his family will be called to succeed him , he will naturally endeavor to use the power intrusted to him , not so much for advancing the good of the people , as for securing to his own family some permanent advantage . An hereditary monarch , holding an authority which is not liable to question , needs not the support of coercive laws or of mercenary armaments . An elected monarch , on the contrary , if he desire to perpetuate his dynasty , will constantly be tempted to effectuate this object , either by corruption or by force . From these considerations we conclude , that although it seems most rational , upon the decease of a monarch , to choose as his successor the ablest , wisest , and best man that can be found , yet experience of the dangers which attend such elections compels us to prefer hereditary monarchy . To invest with supreme authority , without regard to personal qualities , the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign is , undoubtedly , a course of proceeding which appears to be indefensible in theory , and which , in practice , has been found , not unfrequently , to place upon the throne individuals wholly unfitted for the exercise of regal authority . Yet such is the imperfection of every other system of government as yet devised , that it is doubtful whether any form of government has been more conducive to the happiness of nations than hereditary monarchy . If the sovereign really exercised , in person , all the prerogatives with which he is nominally invested , there : ould , indeed , be no hope of enjoying a continuance of good /z/ government under hereditary monarcliy . An excellent prince might be succeeded by a fool or a tyrant . This is a contingency to which nations subjected to despotic rule are always liable , and the probability of its occurrence is a sufficient reason , if no other existed , for refusing to confide arbitrary power to any dynasty . In the hands of a wise and good prince , absolute power is sometimes employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community . Perhaps at no period were the Roman people so happy as under the autocratic rule of Trajan and the Antonines ; but the danger which arises from confiding unlimited power to individuals was amply illustrated during the reigns of many both of the predecessors and of the successors to these emperors . To guard against the abuse of power wielded by bad men is , unfortunately , a task which requires much more skill than to make arrangements for the advantageous exercise of power by those who are well disposed . In the construction of a political constitution , we have to consider not only how the greatest possible amount of good can be developed , but , still more , how contingent evil may be prevented . When we say , therefore , that hereditary monarchy is a form of government which is compatible with the happiness of the community , we do not advocate the maintenance of despotic rule , but of a monarchy limited by such restrictions as shall guarantee the liberties of the citizen . Practically , there have existed very few monarchies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will of the sovereign . The sum of affairs brought under the personal observation of a single individual must necessarily be extremely limited . With regard to the great mass of administrative details , the most absolute ruler must rely upon the agency of others , rather than upon his own inspection , to give effect to his wishes . He is thus liable to be thwarted by those in whom he confides . Sometimes his good intentions are defeated by the persons who are intrusted with the task of carrying them into effect ; but sometimes also his mischievous designs are counteracted by the agents appointed to execute them . Even the most absolute despot is subject to the influence of public opinion , and is often coerced by the passive resistance of those who surround him ; so that the evils which in absolute monarchies might be expected to result from the succession to the throne of a fool or a tyrant are mitigated by a variety of counteracting circumstances . PRINCirLES OF GOVERNMENT . 125 In all monarchies the sovereign is aided by a council , . , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some states the name and intervention of the sovereign are used only to give authority and dignity to the determinations of his council . In England , for instance , royalty is little else than a mere pageant . Ever since the Revolution of 1()88 , the Parliament has been the governing power of Great Britain . No ministry has been able to hold office , except when supported by a majority in Parliament ; so that virtually the ministers of the Crown have been chosen by the Parliament . The sovereign has , in many cases , been prevented from appointing to office those who would have been most acceptable to him ; and in the administration of public affairs the ministry so chosen virtually dictate to the sovereign , whilst nominally they receive his commands . Even the language held by the king , in addressing his people from the throne , is not his own . It is an accepted principle that the speeches and acts of the sovereign are the speeches and acts of his ministry . Until the period of the Reform Bill of 1831-32 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even still it may be said that the influence of the aristocracy prevails more in the government of England than that of either the democracy or of the Crown . It is almost a misuse of words to call such a constitution a monarchy . It has been an aristocratical republic , of which the nominal head has been called a king ; but that king has possessed less personal influence than has been enjoyed by the President of the United States , or by the chief magistrates of many other republics . At Sparta , two kings possessed , by inheritance , the title of royalty , but they exercised few of its prerogatives . Their power was so limited , that Sparta must be considered as a republic , in which the prevailing influence was aristocratic in its nature . Venice was called a republic , but there was less of popular liberty in Venice than has existed in many monarchies . It was an oligarchy . From these observations we conclude that when we compare limited monarchy with a republican form of government , we ought not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the executive department of a state , prudence suggests that the structure of the constitution should be adapted , not Lo a speculative theory , but to the circumstances of the people for whom it is created . We have already observed that the leaders of the last Belgian revolution acted wisely in /z/ establishing a monarchy rather than a republic ; and there is every reason to believe that a vast majority of the French people would have preferred a popular monarchy to such a republic as that which they were compelled by circumstances to adopt after the downfall of Louis Philippe . In England , a limited monarchy is unquestionably more , acceptable to the nation at large than the simplicity of republican institutions . It is in the nature of mankind to love pomp and pageantry , and to worship idols . They , therefore , willingly proffer homage to the 23erson or object which they invest with a factitious grandeur . A democratic republic can not be permanently maintained in any country , unless there prevail amongst the j ) eople much public spirit and intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the highest kind are required to prevent the existence of evils incidental to the abuse of power . In the republics of ancient Greece , oppression was practised by the dominant majority of the multitude , with as much recklessness as has ever been exhibited by the caprice of imperial tyranny . The republic of Rome was never free from faction . The struggles between plebeian and patrician power between usurping dictators and the vindicators of popular freedom not only called into action vehement passions of mutual antipathy , but also gave occasion to proscriptions and bloody conflicts ; so that it is not surprising that the Romans should have willingly sought refuge from civil contentions under the mild rule of such an emperor as Augustus . The history of the Italian republics during the middle ages presents a continual series of internal dissension and of external conflict . Even the Swiss Confederation does not offer to those who closely examine the constitution of the several states , and the conduct of its internal affairs , much to justify a belief that popular liberty is always found in republican institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reconciling the reader to the maintenance of tyranny in any form ; not for the purpose of deterring him from seeking the greatest possible perfectibility in political institutions ; but in order to prevent him from being misled by mere names , and in order to convince him that much of evil must be expected under ever the most perfect form of government that can be devised . In the British constitution , as it has existed since the Revolution of 1688 , there has been much imperfection , arising miNCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT . 127 fhiefly from corruption in the legislature and from corruptibility in the people , as also from the selfishness of the aristocracy and of the middle classes , who have generally neglected too much the interests of the laboring population ; but it is difficult to discover in history any country which has enjoyed during so long a period ( nearly 180 years ) so large a measure of popular liberty , exempt from tyranny on the part t ' the prince on the one hand , and from the tyranny of the multitude on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the idea of a mixed form of government put forward as the most desirable in Cicero 's treatise " De Republica : " Placet esse quiddam in repid ) lica prcestans et regale : esse aliud auctoritate principum partum ac t7'ihiLtum ; esse quasdam res servatas judicio voluntatique midtitudinis , &c.; It is not surprising , therefore , that the British constitution should have become a model , to which the nations of modern times have sought to conform their own institutions . When I speak of the comparative excellence of the British constitution , I speak solely of its operation in England . In Ireland , as well as in the colonial dependencies of Great Britain , tfie English government has almost always sought to rule . by means injurious to the people subject to British sway ; but in such cases misgovernment has existed because the leading principles of the British constitution have been violated in these dependencies , not because they have been enforced .

Under the circumstances of America , at the time of the declaration of independence , in 1776 , it would have been difficult , if not impossible , to constitute a monarchy which would have been acceptable to the people , and calculated to secure at once both popular freedom and good government . The revolted Americans , therefore , very wisely resolved to found a republic . They fortunately enjoyed the unspeakable advantage of being directed , whilst organizing their government , by some very able and very virtuous men . As the government of the United States still forms the most perfect model of republican institutions , I shall not hesitate to refer to its organization whenever we have to seek a precedent in the course of this inquiry . Indeed , in the hemisphere in which I now write , a familiar acquaintance with the institutions of the /z/ United States is , perhaps , more necessary than acquaintance with the constitution of Great Britain , because when the era of Australian independence shall arrive , the statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America for guidance , rather than to the monarchies of Europe . From what has been already said , the reader will perceive that I am not prepared to advocate the adoption , in every country , of one and the same specified form of executive government , to the exclusion of all others . I conceive that a an hereditary monarchy , restricted in its prerogatives by con- ' ' I stitutional limitations , is a form of government compatible wuth the maintenance of popular freedom , and that , therefore , we ought not to undermine or overthrow such a government , except under the coercion of an inevitable necessity . On the other hand , cases will sometimes arise , in which none of the elements necessary for the creation of a monarchy exist at the time when circumstances compel a nation to organize a new form of government . In contemplation of such cases , it is desirable to consider beforehand what form of republican government is best calculated to develop with advantage the newly-acquired independence of these states . As I propose to discuss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in connection with the questions which will arise respecting the government of colonies , I shall defer , for the present , the remarks which I have to offer upon this important subject . I may , however , here observe , that if the circumstances of a country be such as clearly indicate that unity is desirable , a federal organization would rather impede than promote good government and social progress . Thus , a federal constitution appears to be wholly unsuited to the circumstances of France . Thus , also , if Ireland should ever become independent of Great Britain , an attempt to sectionize its nationality by erecting the provinces into separate states , connected together by a federative constitution , would be so obviously at variance with the general interests of the whole island , that , at least under present circumstances , no rational statesman would propuse to make such an attempt . On the other hand , if the British provinces of North America should hereafter revolt from Great Britain , the most natural mode of providing for their internal government and external security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great republican confederations . The state /z/ of New Brunswick , for instance , is so naturally connected with Nova Scotia , that entire separation from it would involve a disruption of natural ties ; yet , these colonies having been accustomed to the exercise of self-government , through the agency of separate legislatures , would be very reluctant to consent to an incorporate unity of administration . In such cases , an endeavor should be made to combine the advantages of local self-government with those arising from consolidated power , by means of federative institutions . In like manner , in the event of a revolt of the Australasian colonies against Great Britain , the natural circumstances of their geographical position , as well as the antecedent arrangements of their governmental administration , indicate that the interests of all would be best promoted , not by an attempt to force them into an incorporate union , through a centralized system of government , but rather by an organization which should secure to each settlement its own local selfgovernment , and , at the same time , by a federal combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Upon a future occasion I shall endeavor to point out , in detail , what sort of organization is best calculated to attain these ends . One of the principal features which characterize a republic and distinguish it from monarchy is , that the chief magistrates are periodically elected by the people , or by their representatives . That the wisest and the best ' men should be selected for the guidance of public affairs is a course of proceeding obviously more consistent with natural reason than that supreme power should be delegated to individuals who are recommended merely by lineage , and who may possess no qualities fitting them for the government of men . Yet this process of election is attended with many inconveniences . We have already observed , that in the case of elective monarchies the appointment of a successor to the throne is an occasion full of danger to the internal peace of the state , and that those dangers are so great as to induce us to prefer hereditary to elective monarchy . In republics , the chief magistrate , being usually chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity of consolidating his power , with a view to the establishment of his dynasty , that is enjoyed by a sovereign chosen for life ; but even recently we have had occasion to perceive that Louis Napoleon , when elected President of the French Republic for a period of three years , employed /z/ all the resources while his position enabled him to command , not so much for the benefit of France , as with a view to his own reelection , and to the perpetuation of his own power . Nevertheless , this is a hazard which must be encountered boldly by every nation which desires republican institutions ; and no people deserves to enjoy such a form of government , unless they be able and disposed to keep in check the ambition of the officers whom they may place at the head of affairs . Experience shows us that when public spirit prevails , the ambition of individuals may be so restrained within the bounds of patriotic duty . In ancient Rome , from the time of the expulsion of the Tarquins to the dictatorship of Sylla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consuls , elected annually , took up and laid down the insignia of sovereignty , in an almost unbroken succession , without endeavoring to perpetuate their own power . In Venice the Doge was elected annually , during many centuries , without interruption . In the various cantons of Switzerland , some of which have been very oligarchical in constitution , magistrates have been selected in succession , without the occurrence of an attempt , on the part of any of them , to grasp the exercise of an independent sovereignty . In the United States of America , a series of illustrious men have been elevated to the highest office in the state , without even an imputation having been raised against any one of them , to the effect that they have been desirous to create a sovereign dynasty in their own persons and in that of their families . In the present temper of the American people the idea of such a project would be treated with ridicule rather than with apprehension . There is an inconvenience incidental to a system of election , from which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ferment and agitation which attend a contest ; and the frequent changes of policy which are occasioned by a change of executive officers may also be regarded as a disadvantage . That some inconveniences arise from these distractions can not be denied , but , perhaps , they are productive of more good than evil . That climate is not the most healthy in which the air is most tranquil . The storm that sweeps the sky carries away all noxious vapors , and gives new freshness to the animal and vegetable creation . So the spirit of liberty is fanned and kept alive by the movements which disturb the political atmosphere . The preliminaries and incidents of an election the selection of a candidate /z/ the canvass the newspaper controversies respecting his opinions and his qualifications the speeches at the hustings , and the celebration of his triumph , tend to direct the thoughts of the community to a consideration of their political interests , and to generate that vigilance and that discrimination with respect to public men and public measures , which are essential to the maintenance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent elections involve frequent changes of policy , we may observe , that changes of policy can take place in republican and in constitutional governments , only when a change takes place in the current of public opinion ; because these governments are supposed to embody and give eifect to public opinion . Now , if we have to choose between permanency of policy , maintained in antagonism to public opinion , and mutability of policy , varying according to the changes of public opinion , we shall not hesitate to prefer the latter evil , if it be an evil , to the former . How often such elections should take place , is a question to which it is not easy to give a dogmatic answer . When the duties to be performed are of a simple nature , no evil can arise from frequent change of officers . No one objects to the annual election of a churchwarden ; but in proportion as the duties of a station are complex and arduous , a longer time is required to develop the capacity of those who are appointed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were chosen for a period of only one year , his individual influence would probably be much less than it now is ; whilst that of the Senate and that of the House of Representatives would be proportionately increased . If he were chosen for a period of seven years , he would , if he were an able man , become so skilled in the management of parties , that it might become ditficult to displace him . Upon the whole , I am inclined to think , that the period for which the chief officer of a republic should be chosen ought not to be less than two years , nor more than four . In the United States of America , the President is chosen for a period of four years , and he may be reelected ; but it is now considered to be an established point , that he ought not to be reelected more than once . This appears to be an unnecessary restriction upon the nation 's liberty of choice . If a public officer have shown preeminent ability in the service of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than upon the individual , to limit the period of such service to a maximum term of eight years . /z/ Ought the supreme executive authority to be confided to one individual , or to two or more ? In Lacedjeraon there were two kings ; but the experience of Lacedasmon would rather lead us to decide against , than in favor of such a division of the executive power ; because , the kings were in the habit of thwarting each other , and of sacrificing the interests of the state to their jealousies towards each other . In Rome , the chief executive authority was delegated to two Consuls ; and this division of power was productive of less inconvenience than might have been expected . In the French Republic , a directory of five was at one time tried , but its short-lived existence tends to prove that it was a form of executive government ill adapted for the administration of public affairs . When supreme power is divided among , several individuals , it must inevitably happen that collisions will arise between them . Conscientious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere caprices of self-will , generate such collisions . When they develop themselves , each chief endeavors to strengthen his position , by collecting around him a faction of followers ; and thus dissensions are carried into the vitals , and into the extremities of the republic . Now , this is an evil not necessarily inherent in the nature of human institutions . It , therefore , ought not to be factitiously introduced by an injudicious construction of the constitutional arrangements of a state . To illustrate our reasoning by a practical instance , we may ask whether it is probable that the functions of the executive , in the United States of America , would have been as well performed by a directory of five , as by a succession of individual Presidents , who are assisted by the advice of a cabinet , but who are not liable to be thwarted by the opposition of an authority equal to their own . It seems , therefore , that both theory and experience lead us to conclude , that greater efficiency and responsibility in the exercise of executive functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magistrate , rather than of several . In the United States of America , a Vice-president is elected simultaneously with the President , but he possesses few independent functions ; and his appointment seems to have been suggested , rather by a desire to provide for the contingency of a vacancy occurring in the office of President , than by a feeling that his services are substantially necessary for the proper management of public affairs . /z/ By whom ought the chief magistrate of a repubUc to be chosen ? The framers of the last constitution of France that of 1848 answered this question by referring the election of President to the people at large . Louis Napoleon was chosen President by the exercise of universal suffrage . In the United States , the people at large , or rather those who enjoy the ordinary franchise , which entitles them to elect members of Congress , nominate in each state deputies , to whom is intrusted the task of electing the President . Practically , there is little difference between these two modes of election , because , under the arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of those whom they represent . The choice is virtually made by the people at large . Tliere is another mode of choosing the chief magistrate , which deserves consideration . He might be chosen by the general Congress , or Parliament . If we could feel assured that , in all cases , the Congress would represent the will of the nation , there could perhaps be no simpler or more satisfactory mode of electing the President of a republic , than that he should be named by the members of the legislature ; but unfortunately we have been taught by experience , that majorities in representative assemblies can err as well as monarchs . It is therefore desirable , that the different authorities in a state should hold each other in check , so far at least as is necessary to prevent misgovernment . A President , elected by Congress , would be a mere creature or instrument of the majority which might happen to prevail in Congress at the time of his election . If that majority should , from corrupt motives , feel disposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally lend themselves to such a design . It may be said , that this is a contingency so improbable , that it is unnecessary to guard against it ; but since it is possible , and since the dangers which it involves may be provided against by a different system of election , it is better that a direct appeal should be made to the people at large , in the nomination of the chief magistrate of the republic . In some countries , as , for instance , in ancient Rome , it has been customary , upon great emergencies , to supersede the ordinary authorities of the state , and to assign despotic power for a time to a dictator . Such a practice is greatly to be deprecated , and under a well-constituted government can never be absolutely necessary . It may indeed sometimes happen /z/ that inconveniences arc avoided , such as delays in civil or military procedure , by having recourse to the simple Jiat of despotism . The necessity of having recourse to such an expedient is itself an evidence that the executive authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally unwilling to concede too much power to the executive , because they have been taught by the experience of all history , that the concession of power to an individual generally tempts him to make encroachments upon the rights of others . But it is very unwise to abridge too much the prerogatives of an officer appointed to give effect to the laws , and to protect the state . If the executive authority be found too feeble to meet emergencies , it becomes necessary , on the occurrence of such emergencies , to provide , by a dictatorship of one kind or other , a substitute for the regular authorities of the state : and such a substitution is more dangerous to public liberty than a permanent authority , possessed of defined prerogatives , and checked by constitutional guarantees . A people once accustomed to the exercise of dictatorial power , lose much of that vigilance which is necessary to protect public liberty . If the temporary dictator be a popular man , and employ his power in a manner agreeable to the people , they will insensibly leam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be productive of satisfaction , to the more complex rule of constitutional government . If , therefore , a dictatorship be established at all , it is desirable that its pressure should be severely felt by the people , rather than that its rule should be mild and acceptable . If it be distasteful , every effort will be made to shorten its duration ; if acceptable , its permanency will be desired . When a revolution occurs in a country , it generally becomes necessary to establish , for a brief period , a provisional government armed with dictatorial powers . It becomes necessary to remodel many of the institutions of the state ; and during the interval of transition anarchy would prevail , if plenary authority were not confided to some chiefs , as representatives of the national will . On such occasions , it is safer to commit dictatorial powers to a select body of eminent men , rather than to a single individual . The members of a Decemvirate will naturally be jealous of each other 's authority , and will seldom concur in a united effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual rarely obtains unlimited authority , without some secret longing for an opportunity of appropriating it to himself and his family , as a perpetual inheritance . /z/ This is , perhaps , a suitable occasion for observing , that in the establisliment of a constitutional monarchy some defined arrangement should be provided , respecting the temporarydelegation of supreme power to a regency , upon the occurrence of any of those contingencies which incapacitate the hereditary sovereign from exercising the functions of royalty . Tlie lunacy of the reigning monarch , or the minority of a successor to the crown , furnish instances of such contingencies . No opening should be left for the intervention of intrigue or violence on the occurrence of these contingencies . Unless provision be made beforehand , for the appointment of a Regent , there will arise a risk of incurring all the evils which have been experienced in elective monarchies , upon the death of the reigning sovereign . In the United Kingdom such provision is generally made by a special enactment , framed according to the circumstances of the reigning family ; but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of George III. , much painful discussion was excited , and much factious spirit evoked , by the want of some settled rule with respect to the appointment of a Regent , and wuth respect to the prerogatives which ought to belong to the regency . I incline to think that the temporary possession of the royal authority , upon the occurrence of a regency , should be regulated , according to a settled order of succession , on the same principle of hereditary devolution as is applied in regard to the succession of the crown . Thus , for instance , upon the occurrence of the lunacy of George III. , the Prince of Wales ought to have become Regent of the United Kingdom , by right of defined succession , not by the appointment of the British Parliament , made specially for the occasion . In like manner , in the event of a minority , the surviving parent , or the nearest of kin to the minor , ought , de jure , to become Regent ; but , in order to avoid , as much as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the guardian of the minor , except , perhaps , in the case in which the surviving parent is invested with the regency . There appears to be no rational ground for depriving the Regent of any of the prerogatives that are possessed by the sovereign . Those prerogatives are confided to the monarch , not for his own individual pleasure or profit , but for the benefit of the nation , and the exercise of them may be needed just as much under a regency , as under the rule of the hereditary successor to the throne . Yet , upon this point the statesmen /z/ of England were divided when the lunacj* " of George III . rendered necessary the appointment of a Regent , and Mr. Pitt , then the Tory Minister , advocated a limitation of the royal prerogatives , whilst exercised by a Regent . It seems to me to be an inevitable conclusion from this precedent , that whatever prerogative can be dispensed with during a regency , ought to be abrogated altogether , as unnecessary to the due exercise of executive authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prerogatives and functions which naturally and reasonably ought to be confided to the chief magistrate of a state , whether he be called a sovereign or a president . The functions of executive government being nearly the same in every country , there are certain prerogatives which must in every country be possessed by those who are appointed to administer these functions . Those with which the chief magistrate of a repubUc must be invested differ little from those which , in a limited monarchy , naturally belong to a constitutional king . From the chief magistrate of a republic greater personal responsibility is exacted . The policy of the Government of the United States is the policy of the President , who may be considered the official exponent of the wiU of the nation . The policy of the sovereign of England is the policy of the ministers of the Crown , who are , themselves , agents for carrying into effect the wishes of Parliament . Hence , the President of the United States , individually , possesses much more personal influence , in the management of public affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The constitutional maxim , that " the king can do no wrong , " in his official capacity , is founded upon an assumption that he acts under the advice of his ministers . Every public act of the sovereign of the United Kingdom is countersigned by some minister of state j and , if it be contrary to law , the minister PniNCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT . 137 who sanctions it , not the sovereign , is held responsible for it . Taken in any other sense , the maxim that " the king can do no wrong " is a falsehood and an absurdity . English history abounds with examples , which tend to prove , not only that the king can do wrong , but also that he is punishable for such wrong . It is not probable that any occupant of the throne of England will be induced by this maxim to forget that one Stuai't lost his head , and that another lost his crown , because they violated the rights and liberties of the British people . In a limited monarchy , the sovereign ought not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration carried on in his name . Kings can do no wrong , unless they find agents who will give effect to their mischievous designs , and it is easier , as well as safer , to punish an agent than to overthrow a dynasty . This maxim , however , is not applicable to the chief magistrate of a republic , chosen for a limited period . The founders of the Constitution of America , therefore , wisely decreed , that the President , as well as all other magistrates of the Republic , may be deprived of their offices for crime , or even for misconduct . In a constitutional monarchy , a nation will find means of protecting or of avenging itself for the misconduct of the king , whenever it has reason to believe that misgovernment may be traced to the sovereign rather than to his ministers . The deposition of Charles X. , and of Louis Philippe , as well as the great French revolution of 1789 , and the Belgic revolution of 1830 , prove that the nations of the Continent of Europe , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of a dynasty , which by its misconduct forfeits the allegiance of its subjects . Prerogative of conferring Titles of Honor and Offices of Emolument . We have already discussed the propriety of Conceding certain prerogatives to the chief executive officer of the state , in regard to the exercise of legislative authority . Thus we have assigned to him a suspensive veto upon the enactments of the two houses of the legislature . We have accorded to him the ri-ht to convene and to prorogue the legislature , and also to dissolve the House of Representatives . We have suggested that his power of declaring peace and war , and of making treaties , should be subject to confirmatioa /z/ by both houses of the legislature a restriction upon the prerogative which would be found as useful in a constitutional monarchy as in a republic . We have now to consider the prerogatives which he ought to enjoy , in regard to the exercise of executive authority . First , we shall treat of the prerogative which entitles the chief of the executive to confer titles of honor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctions prevail , it is natural , if it be ruled by a monarch , that the sovereign should be , what he has been called in England , " the fountain of honor " that is , that all honorary titles should be conferred by him . An aristocracy is generally considered to form a rampart round the throne , and to be essential to its protection from the impulses of democratic force . Perhaps this theory is somewhat fanciful , for we have seen that , during the middle ages , the feudal nobility often domineered over the kings of Europe , in a spirit as factious as could be evinced by the most turbulent democracy. * Royalty was compelled to seek alliance with the commonalty , in order to protect itself from the aristocracy . It is , therefore , not so much with a view to strengthen the monarch against democratic power , as to establish an harmonious relationship between the nobility and the sovereign , that the sovereign should be regarded as the fountain of honor , and that all honorary titles should emanate from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferring titles of nobility , and if such titles were to carry with them substantial power in the state , they would soon establish an oligarchy equally inimical to the interests of the sovereign , and of the people at large . If the reader will refer back to what has been said respecting the peerage , he will find that I am of opinion that peers should derive their legislative power from the people ; but under a constitutional monarchy the right to confer honorary titles may , perhaps , be safely confided to the sovereign . * The feudal nobility - were hardly an aristocracy ( as we now use the term ) in their relations to the monarchs of the middle ages . They were the descendants of the chiefs of a common conquest ; their honors were gathered on the battle field , and many of them were of older date and more renOAvn in the land than the sovereign they consented , under certain conditions , to obey . " The right of insurrection , " as claimed by the Spanish hidalgos , is an illustration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or unmade the king , as often as the king made or unmade them ; yet we can not conceive , either then or now , of Lafayette 's theoiy put in practice " a monarchy with republican institutions . " M. /z/ In eveiy country honorary distinction operates as a powerful incentive to action . Tiiis sentiment is not less influential in republics than in monarchies . To be fed at the public expense in the Prytcmeum was an honor probably as much coveted by the Athenian patriot as the blue ribbon of the Garter is now coveted by the lordly parasite of Britain 's court . Whoever possesses the power of awarding titles of honor naturally acquires thereby an amount of influence which is ridiculously disproportionate to the intrinsic value of the favor conferred . Lasting distinction , indeed , is earned , not granted : it is awarded by the voluntary sometimes by the involuntary homage of mankind to those who have performed memorable deeds ; and a mind that is truly great can despise the mere gauds that captivate the frivolous and the vain . But such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol the ribbon and the cross will ever be prized , when awarded as marks of favor by those who hold supreme authority . In the United States of America an attempt was made , after the revolutionary war , to establish an order called " The Cincinnati , " but republican jealousy was , very properly , directed against it , and it was ultimately suppressed , because its establishment was considered to be a covert mode of introducing aristocratic distinctions amongst a people whose political constitution proclaims the perfect equality of all citizens . In a constitutional monarchy , the sovereign is , perhaps , the organ through whom honorary distinctions may , with propriety , be conferred . Practically he will be but the organ . The nomination will originate with his ministers , just as every other act of executive government is directed by their will , and as those ministers are responsible to the legislature in other words , to the nation , through its representatives it is to be presumed that the application of this prerogative will generally be conformable to the public sentiment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferred at all , should be conferred by the chief magistrate only , at the instance of those bodies which represent the nation . This principle is already recognized , to a certain extent , in the practice of representative assemblies . Thus , the highest honor that can be awarded in Great Britain to a successful commander is , that he should receive the thanks of Parliament ; and the grant of a pension , or other mark of honor , may be accorded with safety to those distinguished men whom the representatives of the nation , as well as the chief of the executive , unite to consider as public benefactors . /z/ By the Constitution of the United States , it was provided that the President shall nominate , with the assent of the Senate , all the officers of the general Government . It is manifest that he could not be held responsible for the executive administration of public affairs , carried on in his name , unless he were invested with power to appoint and to remove the officers employed in such administration . The chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a republic , ought to be intrusted with this power . In England the ministers of the Crown , acting in the name of the sovereign , exercise the right of nominating almost all the subordinate officers engaged in executive administration , but their power of removal is restrained , in many cases , by custom and public opinion , if not by law . The number of offices which are usually vacated upon a change of ministry , bears but a very inconsiderable proportion to the whole number of those which are held at the will of the Crown ; and many patent offices , being held during good conduct , can be vacated only by the misconduct of the holders of them . This unwillingness to change public servants is a feature of administration which is not only liighly honorable to the English people , but which also tends much to promote the interest of the publiQ service . It gives to the departments of government the advantages which belong to experience , and to the holders of office an inducement to conduct themselves with propriety . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Government , naturally feels little interest in performing faithfully the duties of his situation . His thoughts are rather directed to the necessity of making provision for the contingency of a change . If he be corrupt in principle , he is ' subjected to a temptation which is almost irresistible . Take , for instance , the case of an officer of excise . The nature of his duties is such , that upon his honesty the payment or non-payment of large sums to the exchequer may depend ; and he is brought into communication with capitalists , who possess the means of rewarding handsomely his connivance at frauds upon the revenue . If such an officer feel that he holds but a short tenure of his situation , he will be tempted to accept the proffi3red bribe , whereas , on the contrary , if he knows that , by such a dereliction of duty , he may forfeit the employment , upon which he might otherwise have reckoned as a provision for himself and his family during life , he will be acted upon by a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ The Government of India presents an exception to the practice which prevails in the I3ritish empire , that all officers of executive administration should be nominated by the sovereign , or rather by the ministers of the Crown . A few of the most important offices in India are filled by persons appointed by the confidential advisers of the sovereign , but the Directors of the East India Company have possessed the privilege of nominating almost all the functionaries engaged in the administration of the Indian empire of Great Britain . Such a system of government is perfectly anomalous . It has grown up as a sort of excrescence to the British constitution , nurtured by a series of unforeseen circumstances , and it has been maintained , because more danger would arise from attempting to symmetrize it with the general configuration of the imperial government , than froni allowing it to expand to its natural dimensions . There has been much in the past proceedings of the Anglo-Indian government that is utterly indefensible . The natives of India have been systematically plundered , both as nations and as individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been based upon a desire to promote the interests of England and of Englishmen , not the interests of the inhabitants of the Indian empire . This policy has too often been carried actively into effect by means of fraud , perfidy , violence , and extortion ; and passively , by neglecting all those appliances , by means of which the prosperity of the country might have been advanced . Thus , whilst state after state has been absorbed in the Indian empire of Great Britain whilst dynasty after dynasty has been deposed , and their treasures confiscated whilst the natives have been excluded from all liisih situations of honor or emolument whilst the cultivators of the soil have individually been subjected to oppressive exactions , by augmentation of the land tax and other extortions little , comparatively speaking , has been done to develop the prodigious resources of this fertile territory . Public works have been neglected . Large districts have been left without a road or a bridge ; and , not only have the Indian Governments omitted , in many districts , to construct new works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the culture of the soil , such , for instance , as tanks and reservoirs , required for irrigation , have been allowed to fall into decay . The education of the natives has been almost to an equal extent neglected by the Government , although there is no people on the face of the earth who are more capable /z/ of intellectual culture than the natives of India . But , for sev eral of the most unjustifiable portions of this policy , the min isters of the crown , rather than the directors of the India Company , have been blamable . Upon the whole , it may be doubted whether British India would have been so well governed as it has been , if the East India Company had , at an early period , been deprived of the administration of political affairs . It is certain that the appointments to important situations , made by this company of merchants , will bear advantageous comparison with those made by any regular government of modern times . The concurrent testimony of all writers and observers who have studied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of ability has been displayed by the functionaries nominated by the East India Company , and employed in the administration of Indian affairs . Though it would be unsafe to erect any new government elsewhere upon the model of that which has governed British India , it would , on the other hand , be extremely unwise to overthrow that system , until some other , much more advantageous to the people of India , can be substituted for it . Improvement in the political institutions of India is to be sought , not by transferring to the ministers of the Crown the power and prerogatives now exercised by the East India Company , but rather , by striving to develop in India itself the principle of self-government . A transfer to the ministers of the Crown of the right of nominating to the vast number of lucrative offices , now at the disposal of the East India Company , would so greatly increase their patronage , that much danger might result to the liberties of the empire from investing unscrupulous men with such exuberant means of corruption as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the influence obtained over majorities in Parliament , by means of patronage , is so great , that the minister relies less upon the merits of his measures than upon the secret influences which procure support to his administration . How greatly would this tendency be increased , if he were furnished , in the patronage of the Indian empire , with an almost inexhaustible repository of the instruments of corruption ! It is hopeless to expect that the spirit of aggrandizement , which has led to the gradual enlargement of the Indian empire of Great Britain , will ever be checked by any impulse , except that of successful resistance on the part of the Easterns PRINCirLES OF GOVERNMENT . 143 themselves . Ambition is a passion which is common to all nations , and to all governments , whether they be autocratical like that of Russia , constitutional like that of the United Kingdom , or republican like that of the United States of America . The Indian empire will , therefore , probably be increased , until it shall arrive at such a magnitude , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps it has already attained this point . Be this as it may , I leave to the cynic the task of reproaching with hypocrisy the government of Great Britain , which affects moderation in Europe , and declaims against the lust of conquest evinced by other nations , whilst it quietly and gradually takes possession of enormous tracts of territory in the East . But , assuming that it is the destiny of the population of Hindostan to remain subject to British rule , it is surely a question worthy of consideration by British statesmen , whether the improvement of British India is not an object in which Great Britain is interested as well as the natives of India . In a material point of view it is obvious that the greater the wealth of these territories , the greater will be their capacity for ministering to the avarice of British administrators , and of British commerce . Even the most selfish , therefore , of rulers ought to desire that such a system of land tenure should be established , as would stimulate the cultivators of the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which vill never be made by those who are subject to overwhelming exaction . Even the most selfish of rulers ought to encourage the formation of roads , bridges , canals , railways , reservoirs for irrigation , &c.,; which are essentially required for the production or conveyance to market of the commodities which this country is capable of yielding , in incalculable abundance . Even the most selfish of rulers must feel , that a system of government , which is upheld solely by the bayonet , can never be permanently safe . If , in the event of a Russian invasion , for instance , the Sepoys of the Indian army were to waver in their fidelity for a moment , the Indian empire of Great Britain might be lost more rapidly than it was acquired . They ought , therefore , to perceive , that the only effectual way of securing the permanency of British sway in India is to make the natives of all classes feel that it is their interest to uphold it . This can only be done by identifying their aspirations with the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by admitting them to a full pai'ticipation in the government of their native country . /z/ It is the opinion of the best informed politicians in India , that improvement of every kind has been retarded by excessive centralization . Thus , for instance , in the administration of the Madras Presidency there is a large class of operations which can not be undertaken by the local government , without the Sanction of the governor general and council at Calcutta . It may be quite right that the governor general should possess a veto with regard to affairs , which , though apparently local , may affect the general policy of the other presidencies ; but it is obviously absurd to refer questions connected with the internal improvement of the country to a functionary , who can know little or nothing about the matter at issue . It often happens , that the efforts of zealous men to effect improvement in their districts are checked , if not wholly paralyzed , by these vexatious and dilatory references to a distant authority . I should be led into too much detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of administration , but I have said enough to justify the opinion of those who think that the local governments of India should be allowed , upon their own responsibility , to undertake all manner of operations , connected with the internal improvement of the territories over which they preside subject to the ultimate sanction of the directors at home . I would , however , go farther , and contend that endeavors should be made to prepare the natives of India for self-government , by organizing , throughout the whole of these territories , local municipalities for the administration of local affairs . Should this sort of administration be successful , we may infer that the natives of India are capable of taking part in a system of government , similar to that which prevails in the British colonies ; and the principle of legislative representation may , within the course of a few years , be brought into operation in British India . It would seem unnecessary to observe , that the sale of public offices is a practice wholly indefensible , if it were not a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving most important functions , have been , at various periods , habitually sold . In France , for instance , this system of appointment appears to have been sanctioned for a long time as a recognized principle of administrative policy , and even to have extended to judicial offices . It is obvious , that when offices are sold there can be no sufficient guarantee for the due qualification of public functionaries . The possession of a certain amount of wealth , not the possession of intellectual , /z/ physical , or moral preeminence , becomes the primary test of qualification . Nor can any adequate responsibility be exacted from those who have purchased public offices , because it will be felt that , except in case of the gravest delinquencies , to deprive an individual of an appointment , for nomination to which he has paid a large sum of money , would be to commit an injustice towards him . It may also be surmised , that one who has purchased any situation will deem himself at liberty to obtain from it , by peculation or corruption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In England , as well as in France , titles of honor have occasionally been sold by the sovereign , and if men are sufficiently vain to pay large sums for mere titles , it may be argued that little injury results to the public from such transactions . But they tend to degrade the order into which the individual is introduced by wealth alone . The sale of advowsons of benefices in the church , and the sale of commissions in the army , is ojien to these and many other objections objections which can only be neutralized by imposing a rigorous test of qualification upon all candidates for purchase , and by defining within the strictest limits the privileges to be obtained as an equivalent for such an outlay of money . The system of disposing of public offices by sale has , however , the advantage of limiting the influence of the executive ; and this incidental consequence aflfords some compensation for the other evils which result from it . The appointment of public functionaries by lot is a practice which seems to be inconsistent with the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend that , upon the breaking out of a war , the command of a fleet should be assigned to the admiral whose name should be first drawn from a list committed to the chance of a ballot-box ; or that , upon the occasion of a vacancy , a chief justice should be nominated in a similar manner ? Yet the practice of selecting public functionaries by lot has prevailed in several states , as , for instance , at Athens , and at Florence , during the most brilliant eras in the existence of these republics . Indeed the practice has not been wholly unknown in England . Not many years have elapsed since the members appointed by the House of Commons to try election petitions a department of jurisprudence which often involved legal questions of great perplexity were selected by lot . These instances tend to prove , that even the wisest men will resort to proceedings which can not be justified in theory , in the hope of escaping /z/ from evils which appear to be otherwise inevitable . Selection by lot is indefensible , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favoritism or corruption . In contemplation of these alternatives , it has been thought that official incapacity results as much from favoritism as from appointment by lot ; and , therefore , in some countries a preference has been given to that system which is the least liable to corruption . In regard of those functions which require for their discharge nothing more than the exercise of common sense , selection by lot is preferable to any mode of appointment which admits the possibility of undue influence . Thus , in the composition of juries , it is much safer to trust to the chances of selection by lot ( subject to challenge for cause ) than to leave their nomination to administrative officers , who may be influenced by motives founded upon prejudice , partiality , or corruption ; but , in the general administration of public affairs , we can not advocate nomination by lot as a desirable mode of selecting public functionaries . We may take this opportunity of observing , that , in a constitutional monarchy , officers connected with the royal household , and personally attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting , &c.,; ought not to be allowed to interfere in political affairs , in virtue of the offices which they hold . Their responsibility to the public extends no farther than that they may be expected duly to administer that portion of the civil list expenditure which is disbursed by them . As they are immediate attendants upon the person of the sovereign , the sovereign ought to be allowed the choice of such attendants , unrestricted by political or party considerations . When Sir Robert Peel , in 1838 , refused to hold office under Queen Victoria , unless he were allowed to nominate her ladies of the bedchamber , he intrenched upon a tive which ought to be held exempt from ministerial influence . The monarch would , indeed , be the most unhappy person in his empire , if he were to be debarred from the selection of his immediate associates . This is a privilege which the meanest individual enjoys , and which , therefore , ought not to be withheld from those who are placed in an exalted station for the general good of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry on , in detail , the administration of public affairs . It can determine principles , it can suggest or sanction measures , but it is incapable of elaborating all the details which are connected with the execution of such measures . Imagine the confusion which would arise if the House of Commons were to undertake to appoint all the subordinate officers of administration . The time which ought to be devoted to legislation and to a general superintendence over the affairs of the empire would be wasted in petty squabbles about the distribution of patronajre . Imagine the confusion which would arise if it were to undertake to determine in what localities each regiment should be stationed , or what particular ships should be sent on each service . Imagine the confusion which would arise if it were to undertake to conduct the requisite correspondence with foreign powers and with the subordinate officers of the various public departments . It is not necessary to proceed with additional illustrations of the difficulties involved in such a scheme for the conduct of public affairs , because it will at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is physically impossible that a deliberative assembly could carry on all the duties of executive government . Delegation , therefore , becomes indispensable . " Whatever be the organization of the government whether it be republican or monarchical executive officers must be appointed for the administration of public affairs . The following are the departments under which the affairs of a great empire naturally classify themselves . Over each of these departments one or more ministers preside : Department of the Interior . Department of Finance . Department of Military Affairs . Department of Foreign Affairs . Department of Commerce and Trade . Department of Colonial Affairs . These departments admit of subdivisions , which shall be noticed hereafter . The chief magistrate of the state , whether he be a monarch or the president of a republic , is naturally the supreme head of all these depaTtments . According to /z/ the principles already developed , lie nominates the principal officers of state . These , through the agency of subordinates , carry on the details of public business . The assemblies which represent the nation at large do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the officers of the executive are responsible to these assemblies . If any misconduct take place on the part of officials , it is the privilege and the duty of the representatives of the nation to bring to account those who so misconduct themselves , and to adopt measures calculated to remedy the evil ; but it has been found by experience that confusion and disasters always arise when representative assemblies attempt to encroach upon the legitimate prerogatives of the executive . Councils of State , The functions of executive government are almost always carried on under the advice of a counciL In those states in which the sovereign takes a part in the direction of affairs , he naturally seeks the advice of able and experienced councillors , and is present at their discussions . Such was the practice in England in early days , when the Privy Council was in reality an executive council , which assisted the deliberations of the sovereign . But in modern times the Privy Council has lost almost entirely the character of a consultative body , and is now a sort of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of judicial questions , the administration of particular kinds of public duties , and the authorization of acts which have been taken out of the sphere of parliamentary operation . Since the Revolution of 1688 , the public policy of the state has been directed , not by the Crown or the Privy Council , but by a Cabinet Council . Sir James Mackintosh , in his history of the Revolution of 1688 , thus describes this innovation : " It was a little before this time ( the accession of James II. ) that the meetings of such ministers began to be generally known by the modern name of the ' Cabinet Council . ' The Privy Council had been originally a selection of a similar nature ; but when seats in that body began to be given or left to those who did not enjoy the king 's confidence , and it became too numerous for secrecy or despatch , a committee of its number , which is now called the Cabinet Council , were intrusted with the direction of confidential affairs , leaving io /z/ the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater part of its members an honorable distinction , instead of an office of trust . The members of the Cabinet were then , as they still are , chosen from the Privy Council by the king , without any legal nomination , and generally consisted of the ministers at the head of the principal departments of public affairs . " Thus the Cabinet is composed of the principal ministers of state , and its members are called the confidential advisers of the Crown . In point of fact , however , they can scarcely , with propriety , be called advisers of the sovereign , as he is seldom present at their deliberations . Practically , he is compelled either to adopt the measures suggested by them , or to dismiss them , and to procure in their places a new set of ministers , who in their turn dictate rather than advise the measures which are to be executed in his name . Some have thought that the duties of executive government would be better conducted under the advice of a body such as the Privy Council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers called the Cabinet . With this opinion I can not concur . If the sovereign were really the governing power of the state , it would be desirable that he should be assisted by the formal discussions of a Council of State . But with a constitution such as that of the United Kingdom , under which substantial power resides in the Parhament , and under which the ministers of state , not the sovereign , are responsible , the intermeddling of the monarch with the deliberations of ministers would probably embarrass , rather than advance , the conduct of public affairs . Under a republican constitution , the chief magistrate being personally responsible , it is quite proper that he should take part in , or rathor that he should direct , the consultations of his ministers . They are subordinate agents carrying into effect the policy for which he is responsible . It is therefore necessary that , on the one hand , they should perfectly understand his views , and on the other , that they should supply him with information derived from their official experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for the welfare of the state . If the chief magistrate of a republic were to be compelled to consult an executive council of state , nominated directly or indirectly by the people , that council would gradually absorb to itself the virtual exercise of all executive functions ; and even the authority of the legislature would be endangered by /z/ the encroachments of its influence . It is not necessary fo refer to the history of Venice , or of other states , in support of this opinion . Reason , independently of experience , suggests that a functionary Avho is compelled to consult others before he acts becomes to a great extent the organ of their will more especially if he hold office for a term shorter than that for which the councillors whom he consults are chosen . Deriving its authority from the people , such a council would naturally consider itself at least as much an exponent of the national will as any other individual or body in the state ; and if it were to consist of only a few persons , it would enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action , combined with those which result from the consultative deliberations of able and experienced men . Whatever may be the form of government , a council composed of the confidential advisers of the chief officer of the executive is absolutely indispensable for the conduct of public affairs . The composition of this council may vary according to the peculiar circumstances of each constitution , but it is obvious that it ought to include the heads of the several departments ; and with a view to the maintenance of confidence and harmony amongst its members , it is desirable that the number of its members should be very limited . /z/ It is not necessary to discuss the question whether one department ought to have precedence over the rest , or to consider which of the public departments ought to obtain such precedency . " VYe shall therefore commence our review of the several branches of executive administration by considering what in England is called " the Home Department , " and in France " the Ministry of the Interior . " To this department naturally belongs every thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allotted to this department not being the same in all coun- /z/ tries , we shall consider rather what branches of public affairs naturally belong to it , than attempt to present a view of the organization which exists in any particular country . In Eno  - -  land , the organization of the public departments has been very informal , and is totally deficient in symmetry . It has not been cast in any regular mould , but its several parts have been framed to meet each temporary exigency that has required an addition to the machinery already existing . In some branches of administration this machinery is excessively cumbrous and complex ; in others it is scanty and defective in the extreme . It therefore can not be safely taken as a model . Every thing that relates to the administration of justice to the preservation of internal order , by means of police regulations and by means of municipal government to the education of the people to the construction of public works to the relief of the poor to the health and recreation of the community naturally falls under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large empire the circle of these duties is so wide that it is generally found expedient to subdivide the functions of the Minister of the Interior , and to place at the head of each of these sub-departments a responsible minister of state . Thus , in France , there is a Minister of Justice , a Minister of Instruction , and a Minister of Public " Works . /z/ " We ought , perhaps , to treat the judicature of a country as a branch of its political institutions which is , or ought to be , quite independent of the executive . As it is the duty of the legislature to make the laws , so it is the duty of the judicature to interpret them , and of the executive to put them in force . The judicature , therefore , is not , in its own nature , dependent upon the executive ; but since political writers , tor the most part , agree in thinking that it is expedient that the judges should be appointed by the executive , rather than elected by the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country among those /z/ institutions over which the executive , and especially the Minister of the Interior , ought to exercise a qualified superintendence . I assume that the judges ought not to be elected by the people , for the following reasons : The people at large are not competent to form a correct opinion of the qualifications of the several candidates who would be competitors for their votes , in case judges were appointed by popular election . In regard of the appointment of judicial functionaries of the lowest class , such , for instance , as justices of the peace , the local electors might possibly make a wise selection ; but the very qualities which best fit a lawyer for the highest class of judicial office are precisely those which would least recommend him to a popular constituency . A man accustomed to profound meditation and laborious research , calm and imperturbable in demeanor , firm and undeviating in his sense of rectitude , would have but a slender chance of obtaining preference , when brought into competition with a noisy declaimer or an active intriguer. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must , in the case of a contest , rely upon the support of a j ) arty , and , insensibly , his mind will become swayed by the reciprocal influences of partisanship ; whereas , on the contrary , a judge ought to be wholly removed from the operation of such influences . Nevertheless , it is very desirable that a person appointed to administer justice should possess the confidence of the people as well as of the executive . It would , therefore , seem expedient that the representatives of the people should , in the appointment of judges , possess a veto upon the nominations made by the executive . When a vacancy occurs in one of the judicial seats of the highest class , the executive ought to be permitted to nominate a successor ; but his final appointment ought to be subject to confirmation by one or both houses of the legislature . In regard to the lowest class of judicial officers , the municipal representatives of the people ought either to originate the nomination , subject to a veto on the * The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgeship has been tried certainly confirms Mr. O'Brien 's view . Third and fourth rate lawyers have generally been elected judges , through party influences , while the men of solid reputation in the profession remain at the bar , pleading before their own subalterns . M. /z/ part of the executive , or the nomination made by the executive ought to be subject to a veto on the part of the municipal representatives . When a veto of this kind is interposed to clieck an abuse of patronage , the party who nominates is compelled to select persons who are acceptable to the community at large . This principle of conjoint action between the executive and bodies rej ) resenting the people has been adopted in Belgium in the nomination of judges , even of the highest class . The following are the terms in which this matter has been regulated by the constitution of Belgium , A. D. 1831 . " Les conseillers des cours d'appel et les presidents et vice presidents des tribunaux de premiere instance de leur ressort sont nommes par le roi , sur deux listes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par les conseils provinciaux . " Les conseillers de la cour de cassation sont nommes par le roi sur deux listes doubles , presentees Tune par le senat , Tautre par la cour de cassation . ' ' Les cours choisissent dans leur sein leurs presidents et vice presidents . ' * The commercial judges are chosen by the principal merchants of the chief towns . The administration of impartial justice between man and man is the most important of all the functions of government . Vain is the wisest legislation , unless the laws enacted by the legislator be efficiently and impartially administered . Vain is the protection afforded by military force against the foreign conqueror , or against the domestic marauder , if corruption and injustice preside in the courts of judicature . A foe more dangerous than the foreign conqueror than the domestic marauder holds possession of the citadel of the nation 's strength and virtue . A people must be happy , though governed by a despot a people may be happy , though subject to continual alarms , and compelled to maintain perpetually an attitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontented , if those who are appointed to arbitrate the diiferences which arise between man and man , inflict that intolerable oppression which a sense of violated justice carries into the bosom of every family in the community . To secure purity , uprightness , and capacity in the tribunals of judicature is , therefore , an object of paramount importance in the construction of the social system . This is an object which can not be attained by mere constitutional regulations . Justice will not 154 rRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT . be administered impartially , unless a high sense of rectitude and public principle prevail throughout the community . If this be wanting , judge and jurymen become the abettors , if not the perpetrators , of wrong . Quid leges sine moribus Vanse proficient . Dangerous tendencies may , however , be in some measure checked by wise institutions . Thus , for instance , in all contentions between the Crown and the subject , between the citizen and the executive , the judge will naturally be acted upon by a strong motive tending to bias his decision , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable to removal in case his judgments displease those in authority . Experience shows that when judges hold office merely during the pleasure of those by whom they are appointed , they become subservient creatures of power , rather than upright ministers of equity . Hence , in order to obtain an impartial administration of justice , it becomes necessary to secure the independence of the judges . They should be removable from office but removable only for misconduct . In this respect the precedent adopted by Great Britain shortly after the accession of George III. , when the judges were rendered independent of the Crown , deserves universal imitation . Among the fundamental articles of every constitution , there ought to be a provision securing the independence of the judges . In regard to judicial establishments , the practice , if not the theory , of the British constitution has undergone much change . In early times , the king was accustomed personally to administer justice in his own hall Aula Kegis or wherever else he might be in England ; hence the title of " the King 's Bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference on the part of the sovereign with the discretion of the judges would have been justly considered as an invasion of the dearest rights of the subject . The connection of the sovereign with legal proceedings has become one of those fictions , which mankind delight to uphold on account of their reverence for ancient forms . So long as the doctrine , that " the king is the fountain of justice , " is unproductive of any officious intermeddling with the administration of the judicial tribunals , the dictum is harmless ; but if it were interpreted to mean , that the sovereign is entitled to tamper with the independence of the judges , it would become the duty of the legislature to resist with its /z/ Utmost power , as an unjustifiable encroachment , this return to the ancient practice of the Britisli executive . The sovereign of the United Kingdom is " the fountain of mercy , " as well as of justice ; and the exercise of the prerogative of mercy may be more advantageously confided to the chief of the executive than to any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to day , in which some mitiiration of the original sentence under which an offender hiis been punished is suggested by reason or expediency , the power of dispensing mercy must be confided to some public functionary . To whom can it be more advantageously delegated than to the chief of the executive ? Not to the legislature for if it were confided to them , discussions would be perpetually raised respecting the propriety of dispensing it to all manner of criminals . Not to the judicature for the judge has already assigned the amount of punishment which his discretion suggests as applicable to the circumstances of the case . There is but one case in which the executive can be distrusted in regard to the exercise of this prerogative that is , the case in which an offender has been convicted upon impeachment of having , by crimes and misdemeanors , abetted the pernicious designs of the executive itself . It seems unreasonable that , in such a case as that of Strafford , the king should be placed in a position in which he is compelled to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his designs , or of exercising , by prerogative , an intervention in his favor which may cost him the loss of his own crown . When a sentence has been pronounced after impeachment , it seems reasonable that the executive should exercise the prerogative of mercy only upon the joint address of both those Houses which , acting on behalf of the nation at large , have concurred in procuring the condemnation of the criminal . It appears impossible to protect the community from that sort of partiality which arises from strong passions or prejudices in the minds of those who are appointed to administer justice . The best corrective of tendencies of this kind is to be found in public opinion , as expressed by a Free Press . The most prejudiced judge will be more or less affected by the opinion of others , and will hesitate before he expose himself to the animadversions which a display of partiality will evoke . Against partiality arising from corruption the laws may provide some protection by the terror of severe penalties ; but /z/ the best security is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally observed that , in those countries in which judges are inadequately paid for their services , they endeavor to indemnify themselves by indirect extortion for the parsimonious treatment which they receive from the state . To secure capacity of the highest order , it is also necessary to provide adequate remuneration for the judge . If the labor of the advocate be better rewarded than that of the judge , the ablest lawyers will abstain from accepting judicial appointments . A judicial tribunal must necessarily be brought into contempt , if the advocates who plead causes before it display more ability than is shown by the judges who preside . However able and upright a judge may be , he is liable to be rendered inefficient by the advance of old age , or by physical infirmity . For incapacity arising from confirmed disease , or from old age , a remedy is to be found in a liberal system of superannuation . If superannuations be not allowed to officials , they will cling to office as long as life will permit ; and if they be irremovable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties , and public feeling will be shocked by a display of their decrepitude . Every functionary , therefore , whose services are of a permanent nature , and especially judges , ought to be entitled to a retiring allowance , graduated on a scale of remuneration proportionate to the length of his service . Procedure in Courts of Justice . Not only integrity and capacity in the judge , but also simplicity , economy , and despatch in the form of the procedure , are requisite to constitute excellence in judicature . If the process bjp* which rights are vindicated be expensive , those who are unable to defray the costs of litigation are debarred from the prosecution of their just claims . To them , justice is in effect altogether denied . It has been thought by some , that a costly form of legal procedure is advantageous to the community , because it checks litigation : but , if it be reasonable to compel the poor to acquiesce in wrongs , it would be equally reasonable to deny to the rich the legal prosecution of their rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege of the wealthy . On the contrary , the ideal perfection of a system of judicature would seem to be /z/ an arrangement of such a nature , that , whenever a controversy arose between man and man , there should be a third party at liand to arbitrate between them . Such an arrangement can not , indeed , be fully realized , but a near approach may be made to it by providing tribunals , which shall be equally accessible to the poor as to the rich . To those who are acquainted with the manner in which legal proceedings have been conducted in England , it is needless to remark that the power of seeking a remedy for wrong in a court of justice has hitherto been , to a great extent , a privilege enjoyed only by the rich . The expenses of legal proceedings have been so heavy , that the poor have been almost entirely excluded from courts of justice . Even amongst those who possess a competency , it has been an accepted maxim , that it is generally more prudent to forego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to encounter the anxieties and costs of litigation . Justice is frustrated , not only when legal proceedings are expensive , but also when they are dilatory . Delay necessarily involves expense ; but even if it imposed no additional cost , it often would be equivalent to a denial of justice . What prudent man would engage in a Chancery suit , when he has reason to believe that it may be protracted throughout half his life ? Far better is it to waive a just claim , than to be harassed by the anxieties and expense attendant upon protracted litigation . To the suitor whose property is filched away by lawyers , while it is under controversy in a court of justice , it matters little whether such spoliation take place under pretexts suggested by legal chicanery , or by the more glaring iniquity of corrupt extortion on the part of the judge . To the unhappy victim the result is the same in both cases . The English jurist declaims against the peculation which is alleged to prevail in the administration of justice in several states of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judicial tribunals of the United Kingdom . But to the suitor , the direct extortion of a corrupt judge , or even the blind chance of adjudication by a throw of the dice , would be preferable to the lingering anxieties , the authorized pillage , and the capricious uncertainty which have often attended the progress and result of suits in the British courts of justice . These observations apply with nearly equal force to criminal , as to civil judicature . A large proportion of those who are tried for alleged crimes are ultimately acquitted . Some /z/ PRINCirLES OP GOVERNMENT , offenders undoubtedly escape from want of evidence , but manyJ also are acquitted , because they are innocent . What can bo more cruel than to detain innocent persons in prison , or even to leave them , though at large , under the imputation of crime ? The lapse of a few weeks may be necessary for the collection of evidence in favor of or against the prisoner , but the interval preliminary to trial ought to be reduced to the shortest duration that is consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitors from expense , it is desirable , not only that fees should be reduced to a very low scale , but also that courts of justice should hold their sittings in all parts of the country , so that parties and witnesses and jurors shall not have occasion to travel more than a moderate distance to attend trials . It is impossible to define what this distance ought to be , because it must depend in some measure upon the population and other circumstances of each district ; but in countries which are densely peopled , it may be laid down as a general principle , that the ordinary courts of justice ought to be brought within the reach of a day 's journey to every individual in the community . Upon these grounds we may conclude , that in framing a system of judicature , the assizes , or circuits , instead of being held only twice in each year , should be held quarterly . Thus the legal administration of the courts of quarter sessions and of assizes might be consolidated . The tendency of recent legislation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions , and there seems to be no reason why all the same classes of cases which are tried at assizes twice in the year should not be tried quarterly . To the public at large , attendance on juries , and the other duties connected with the administration of justice , would be less burdensome , under the proposed arrangement , than they are at present , and delay would be avoided . There are particular classes of legal proceedings which must , in every country , from their own nature , claim for themselves a special system of investigation . Such , in England , are the laws relating to the conveyance of real property , the execution of wills , trusts , &c.,; which have been assigned to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery . All questions which can be best determined by the intervention of juries , ought to be tried at the circuit courts of quarter sessions . All legal questions , which can be decided only by those who are versed in the principles and technicalities of law , ought to be reserved rniNCirLKS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) cnnancnt session in the metropolis , or in some principal provincial city . Under r- wise system of judicature , this class of cases should be as much restricted as possible . The simple good sense of the jury , when aided by the instruction of the judge , will generally be sufficient to determine questions of equity , which are not in their own nature very complicated : but , upon the other hand , it can not be contended that a jury is capable of determining all the abstruse questions which arise in the process of le2 ; al investijjration . It is also necessary that a tribunal should be erected for the trial of appeals . If the primary courts be well constituted , appeals ought to be discouraged . An appeal is often little else than a rehearing , which involves great expense and delay . It is a resource which gives to the rich a great advantage over the poor , in litigation . With a view to prevent vexatious and frivolous appeals , the appellant ought to be compelled to make a deposit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the costs incurred by him on the appeal , in case the decision of the court of appeal shall be adverse to the appellant . In cases in which the opinion of a higher court is desired , upon questions which have arisen during the trial of the cause in an inferior court , the parties ought to be allowed to prepare , in writing , a statement of the points at issue , and to submit the ultimate decision of such questions to a court of appeal . Though this work has not been written as a commentary upon the principles and practice of the British constitution , it may not be amiss here to remark , that the construction of the highest appellate tribunal of the United Kingdom is not such as can be justified by theoretical reasoning ; and that , therefore , it ought not to serve as a model in the abstract design of a well-constituted judicature . The House of Lords is a body composed of individuals , the great majority of whom are , from want of forensic education , utterly incapable of forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tribunal , by way of appeal . Fortunately , in practice , the decision of all legal questions is left to those peers who have filled high judicial situations ; but this forbearance , on the part of the lay lords , is due rather to their good sense than to contitutional restriction . The highest appellate tribunal of every fountry ought , obviously , to consist of a few lawyers , distinguished not only for their professional attainments , but also for their impartiality and integrity . /z/ Trial hy Jury . It will have been perceived that , in the arrangements above suggested , we contemplate the continued maintenance of trial by jury . Much has been said in favor of this institution ; much , too , may be said against it ; but , upon the whole , the arguments in its favor greatly preponderate over those adverse to it , and experience , the best of all arguments , ratifies this decision . The theoretical reasoner may , indeed , be forgiven for deriding the idea that twelve uneducated men , or even men possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimously , in any decision . It would seem probable , a ' priori , that such agreement would scarcely ever take place among twelve men , respecting even a matter of fact still less respecting matter of opinion ; but in practice it is found that the instances in which juries disagree and can not find a conscientious verdict are , comparatively , rare . It might , also , be assumed that juries would be swayed by local prejudices and partialities , but in practice it is found that though such partialities may occasionally exist , yet upon the whole the adjudications of juries are as free from bias as those pronounced by judges who have been appointed by executive authority . Nor ought it to be forgotten that , in trial by jury , the citizen finds his most sure protection from the oppressions and usurpations of administrative authority . It may be argued , indeed , that as long as a country possesses a legislature subject to popular control , the rights and liberties of the citizen can not be endangered : but the efficacy of laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon those who administer them . Judges , appointed by the executive , are always liable to be biased in favor of the authority by which they have been appointed ; and in contentions between the citizen and the executive , naturally lean to the side of power . The jury , on the contrary , if fairly chosen , represents the people , and its intervention checks the natural tendency which induces those who are invested with authority to seek an extension of their own power , as well as to endeavor to exercise that power in an arbitrary manner . Whilst , however , we ought to uphold with strenuous zeal tiie institution of jury trial , we are not bound to contend that the unanimity required from juries is essential to the beneficial operation of this system of judicature . In Scotland , unanimity is not required , and I am not aware that any incon- rniNCIPLKS OF GOVERNMENT . 161 venlence results from this modification of trial by jury . It is , howcvel* , safer to adhere to tliat form of this institution which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safeguard of personal liberty in Great Britain . In ail ' cases of doubt , the benefit of the doubt ought to be given to the prisoner . Therefore , no man ought to be convicted , unless his guilt be so palpable as to be manifest to all . In like manner , when a right to property is disputed , there naturally arises a presumption in favor of the title of him who is in actual possession ; and he ought not to be deprived of that possession , unless the case made out by his adversary be so clear as to bring conviction to all impartial minds . It is to be remembered that the disagreement of a jury does not frustrate altogether the punishment of crime or the distribution of justice . A new trial may take place in the event of such disagreement , and if the case be made more clear on a second trial , a second jury will find a unanimous verdict . It is true , that juries , if selected indiscriminately from the people at large , may often contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thwart than to forward the due administration of justice . In some countries , as for instance in Ireland , an attempt has been made to obviate the possible occurrence of this inconvenience , by intrusting to a public official the duty of selecting from the general jurors ' list persons specially qualified to act as jurors ; but an arrangement of this kind produces an evil greater than that which it seeks to obviate . It has given rise to the practice o packing juries , by which the executive authorities can generally secure such a verdict as they desire , and has thus weakened the confidence which the public ought to feel in the administration of justice . In other countries , as for instance in certain portions of the United States , the inefficient administration of justice by popular tribunals has given rise to an extra-judicial system of retribution in the enforcement of what is called " Lynch Law , " and in the operations of " Vigilance Committees . " Though substantial justice is often administered by this irregular process , and though crime is prevented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a system of operations so liable to abuse is itself a sufficient evidence that there is something imperfect in the constitution or procedure of the ordinary tribunals of justice . It deserves to be considered whether this imperfection is to be found in the practice of requiring unanimity in the verdicts of juries. /z/ It has been suggested that the preliminary investigation which takes place before grand juries , in the case of criminal trials , is superfluous and might be abrogated . The question is not one of great importance , but it appears advisable to retain in this instance the custom handed down from the time of our forefathers . The inquiry which takes place before the grand jury does not occasion any material inconvenience , delay , or expense , because the parties and witnesses are all in attendance awaiting trial in the court which is ultimately to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused . The intervention of the grand jury is a shield to innocence . If there be not sufficient evidence against the prisoner to justify a conviction , in the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason why he should be subjected to the pain which results from exposure in the dock , and from the animadversions of counsel or from the perjuries of witnesses . On the other hand , if the grand jury commit a mistake , and ignore a bill of indictment brought forward against a person who is really guilty , the due administration of justice is not defeated , because a new indictment can be laid against the delinquent , and the case against him can be made clear by more satisfactory evidence . This , perhaps , is a proper occasion for observing , that under a well-constituted system of police and judicature , the expenses attendant upon the trial of offenders should be borne by the public , not by the party injured . An individual who is robbed renders a service to the public in prosecuting the thief ; he ought , therefore , to be rewarded , rather than discouraged , for bringing the offender to conviction . If , as was formerly the case in England , he be subjected to a heavy expense in prosecuting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from incurring expenses and trouble which enhance the anxieties occasioned by his first loss . The gratification of the passion of revenge becomes almost the sole inducement which will , under such a system , lead to the prosecution of offenders ; since experience shows that the number of those who will voluntarily make sacrifices of time and money for the public good is very limited . Now , the operation of the passion of revenge ought , if possible , to be altogether eliminated from the sphere of jurisprudence . Under a corrupt government , it may happen that the official authorities , whose duty it is to originate legal proceedings against offiinders , will sometimes from sinister motives /z/ screen the criminal . In such cases , the party injured should be allowed to prosecute on his own behalf . If he fail to establish his case , he should be compelled to bear not only his own expenses , but also those of the party criminated ; whilst , on the contrary , if the person whom he accused be convicted , the expenses of the prosecution should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the law officers of the executive enter what is called , in England , a nolo prosequi , that is , refuse to sanction a prosecution , they ought to be called upon to state in open court , the grounds upon which they take this course , and the concurrence of the presiding judge should be required to stay the prosecution . In order to check groundless litigation , it is desirable that costs , sufficient to indemnify the party groundlessly assailed , should be paid by the plaintiff when he fails to substantiate his case ; and on the other hand , the defendant who resists a just claim should be compelled to indemnify the plaintiff for the costs incurred in the prosecution of such claim . This is a principle of natural equity which is applicable to all kinds of legal procedure , but it must be applied with discrimination ; because the mere issue of a trial is not a sufficient evidence that the action or the defence was groundless . A just claim may sometimes be defeated , and a just defence may sometimes fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be held responsible . It may be asked , whether a suitor ought to be compelled to pay any fees towards the maintenance of the court and of its officials , by whom his action is tried . Much may be said on both sides of this question . On the one hand , it can not be denied that the courts of justice are institutions , in the maintenance of which even those who are not engaged in litigation are interested , and therefore they ought to be supported mainly by the public . On the other hand , it seems reasonable that those who avail themselves of the active operation of these institutions should contribute more largely to their support than those who do not require their immediate intervention . The practice of exacting fees appears , therefore , to be defensible , but it is in the highest degree inexpedient that these fees should be excessive . Nor is it desirable that the salaries of officials engaged in the administration of justice should depend upon the amount of fees which they receive ; for wherever such is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is for their interest to promote litigation . The fees of /z/ court ought to be carried to a fund which should be applied in ' aid of the general expenses of the tribunal . We have already seen that , in addition to the quarterly sessions of the circuit courts , it is desirable that there should ' be metropolitan or provincial courts sitting in permanent ses'Sion . The number , constitution , and functions of these courts " will , necessarily , depend upon the local circumstances of each country upon the amount of its population upon the character of the employments in which the people are engaged upon the laws and customs which prevail amongst them . In regard to the courts of judicature , we can not propose the institutions of England as a model to states hereafter to be constituted . The whole legal and judicial system of England is far too complex and cumbrous . Courts of equity , courts of law , ecclesiastical courts , county courts , courts of request , seneschals ' courts , courts of bankruptcy and insolvency , courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administer systems of law differing from each other in essential principles , and conduct their procedure through forms discordant with each other . In the construction of a system of judicature , simplicity in constitution , simplicity in principles , simplicity in procedure should be sought after as an essential requirement . The principles of justice are uniform and universal . That which is unjust in the Court of Queen 's Bench can not be just in the Court of Chancery . Neither can a form of procedure which is found advantageous in one court be inconvenient when applied to a similar class of cases in an adjoining court . I forbear to specify the details of construction to which these principles lead , because they must vary according to the local circumstances of each country ; but , I may observe that I contemplate the maintenance , not only of superior courts , but also of at least one class of tribunals inferior in jurisdiction to the circuit court of quarter sessions . The inferior tribunal to which I now refer is the court of petty sessions , held once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a district , and attended by paid or unpaid justices of the peace . The justice of the peace is an official who unites in his person a twofold function . When he sits upon the bench he acts as a judge , and exercises a summary jurisdiction ; when he places himself at the head of the police or military , to suppress a riot or to arrest an offender , he acts as a police officer . It is desirable that the justice of the peace /z/ should act as seldom as possible in the latter capacity , for it is almost impossible that the same person whose energies , perhaps I sliould say whose passions , have been excited in pursuit of a criminal , can bring to the juridical bench that calmness which is necessary to the due consideration of all that may be said in behalf of , as well as against , the accused . Justices of the peace ought not to be regarded as partisans evenin the prosecution of crime . It has been proposed by theoretical writers who love centralization , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intrust the local administration of justice entirely to legal functionaries , appointed by the executive . But we ought to hesitate before we adopt such a proposal . Even if it were certain that the laws would be better administered by legal functionaries than by country gentlemen , yet , upon constitutional grounds , it would be highly objectionable to give to the executive so large an increase of patronage as would be derived from the nomination of the numerous officials who would be required to perform the duties now discharged by unpaid magistrates . We may add , that the legal attainments requisite for the adjudication of those questions which are brought before petty sessions , are not of a very high order . They may be easily acquired by any well-educated man , and , as a matter of public policy , it is of great importance that amongst the class of society from which magistrates are usually selected , there should be cherished a familiarity with the elementary principles of justice , as also a disposition to perform , without hire , the various duties of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . On the other hand , it is desirable that there should be , in each district , at least one magistrate thoroughly versed in the principles and practice of jurisprudence . The administration of justice in the courts of petty sessions would , therefore , be improved by providing that a barrister , of at least five years ' standing , should act as stipendiary justice in each district , and that it should be his duty to attend the several petty sessions held within the district for which he shall have been appointed . A stipendiary justice might very well attend three , four , five , and , in some cases , even six courts of petty sessions in a district , as it would not be necessary that the sessions should be held more often than once a fortnight . Under an organization of this kind , a large proportion of the cases which are now /z/ tried at quarter sessions might be tried at petty sessions . Tiius , delay and expense might be avoided , whilst , at the same time , the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from accumulating to an inconvenient amount . It might even be found expedient that not only matters in regard of which the magistrates now ordinarily exercise summary jurisdiction , should be brought before the courts of petty sessions , so constituted , but also that cases of minor importance , in which the intervention of a jury is required , should be subjected to jury trial at such sessions . In order to overcome the constitutional objection which may be urged against increasing the patronage of the executive by giving to it the nomination of these functionaries , it would be desirable that the stipendiary justices , as well as all other justices of the peace , should be nominated by the municipal council of the district , subject to confirmation by the Minister of the Interior . I shall hereafter have occasion to develop fully the principle and details of municipal government . I therefore defer for the present an explanation of the constitution and functions of the district council . It is in principle as necessary that the judge who administers justice in the pettiest court should be independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme courts should be secured . Magistrates subjected to the undue pressure of popular influences are nearly as liable to be biased in their decisions as those who act under apprehension of incurring the displeasure of the executive . Whilst , therefore , it is necessary to provide for the removability of those justices in case of incapacity or misconduct , it is at the same time expedient to protect them from the capricious dictation of popular passion or prejudice . For this reason it is desirable that the stipendiary justices and other justices of the peace should be removable from office only upon allegation of misconduct , established by investigation ; but that in case of such misconduct , they should be removable by the district council , with the concurrence of the Minister of the Interior . It seems to me that such a mode of appointing magistrates will best secure the attainment of the qualifications which these functionaries ought to possess . As the district council will represent the population of the district for which the magistrate acts , it is to be presumed that it will select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , if perchance a selection be made to which grounds of just objection /z/ may be raised , the executive Government will possess the prerogative of disallowing such election . The magistrate , when appointed , will be equally independent both of the people and of the executive , as he will be removable only in case of misconduct ; and if there be a disposition on the part of the people to get rid of him through popular caprice , that caprice will be checked by the negative of the executive . Under a republican form of government , the magistrates are generally chosen either directly or indirectly by the people , and for a limited period , so that if they forfeit the confidence of the public , they are practically dismissed , by exclusion from future reelection . Magistrates chosen by the people will undoubtedly sympathize , or affect to sympathize , more with the humbler classes than those appointed by the executive . Sometimes they will be too much swayed by popular passions , even as justices chosen from amongst the aristocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property ; but , perhaps , upon the whole , magistrates chosen by the people are found to administer justice with as much impartiality as is shown by those who are nominated by the executive . The mayors of the corporations of the United Kingdom , for instance , are at least as impartial and efficient as any othA* class of justices . In England the office of coroner is one which has been filled by direct popular election ; and its duties have probably been as well performed by officials so chosen , as they would have been by coroners appointed by the executive . As , however , inconvenience frequently arises from the direct intervention of the multitude in regard to the appointment of judicial officers , it may be advisable that the coroner , as well as the recorder , or stipendiary justice , should be nominated by the district council , rather than by direct popular election . Since there may be some countries in which the municipal councils would not possess sufficient enlightenment or integrity to entitle us to expect that they would select persons duly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative of confiding the nomination of such officials to the executive Government . In such case the municipal representatives of the people should possess a veto upon the nomination made by the Government . Under this arrangement the executive would be compelled to select functionaries who would be acceptable to the community . It is , perhaps , unnecessary to provide for the possible case /z/ in which the authority that possesses the veto may continue to obstruct an appointment , by repeated interposition of the veto thus depriving the district of the services of a useful functionary . Every pubHc institution is liable to be brought into difficulties , if there be , on the part of those who administer it , a reckless or corrupt disregard of all prudential considerations ; and therefore it is usual to assume that the powers delegated to coordinate authorities will be exercised in a spirit of mutual forbearance : but even if mutual resistance were to be apprehended , it would not be necessary to abandon altogether the principle which requires the concurrence of the executive and the municipality , in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged , for instance , that in case this concurrence were not obtained , within a specified period , the judges of the supreme court of justice , or some other neutral authority , should appoint persons to act , ad intenfn , until the required concurrence should be obtained . AVhilst discussing the construction of courts of justice , we may observe that ecclesiastical courts should not be allowed to interfere with matters which naturally belong to the jurisdiction of courts of law . During the middle ages the ecclesiastical power made continual encroachment upon the domain wdiich properly belongs to lay authority . There is no reason , for instance , why all questions which are connected with testamentary dispositions should not be determined in the courts of law . If ecclesiastical courts be maintained at all , their jurisdiction should be strictly limited to questions of an ecclesiastical nature such as controversies amongst the clergy , in regard of doctrine or discipline. * * This general nile is somewhat vaguely laid down , and perhaps there was no need of making it plainer .
