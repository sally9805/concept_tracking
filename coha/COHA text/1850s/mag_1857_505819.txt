txt THE MORAVIANS AND THEIR LEADER . N a high summer day in the month of July , *J14l 5 , the city of Constance was seen to pour her excited multitudes through every portal and gate , to witness a sight that was to cover Europe with shame and a11 Christendom with . disgrace . For in their midst was led the martyr John Huss , and there , on a pleasant and sunny meadow , surrounded by all the pomp of nature , in the light of that glorious sun that shines alike on the just and the unjust , by the side of those trees , and flowers , and flowing streams which seem ever to be whispering , but never telling , the wondrous secrets with which they are charged , he suffered death at the stake rather than renounce his long and dearly-cherished faith . They could call him before their council ; they could give , and then violate , a safe-conduct ; they could throw him into a loathsome dungeon washed by the waters of the Rhine , and fasten him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall ; they could tear off his priestly garments and crown him with a paper mitre ; they could deliver his soul to Satan , his body to the executioner , and his ashes to the flowing Rhine ; but they could not hinder his faithful followers from singing in muffled tones the prophetic elegy : " His ashes will be scattered over every country-no grave and no river , no wall and no rampart , will ever arrest them ; for those whom the enemy thought of silencing forever in death , thus sing and proclaim , up and down the wide earth , the glad tidings of the Gospel . " The world believed not then what wise men in every age have well known , and what yet no generation has learned from their fathers , that not more surely d6es the blessed rain refresh and strengthen the tender grass , than the blood of martyrs enriches the soil and calls forth an abundant harvest . When the sad news was brought home to the land of his fathers , where Huss had preached the true Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathed the plains of Germany in blood , they were at the time of peace abandoned by the other Protestant powers without one stipulation in their favor ; and the poor , dispersed Brethren , who had first led the way to that Reformation , now secnred by treaty , were alone left to the mercy of their enemies . Alas ! they knew no mercy , and with savage joy they wreaked their vengeance on the defenseless , helpless Brethren . Their churches were destroyed , their pastors imprisoned , their families driven from the home of their fathers . Then came the days when " the woman fled into the wilderness from the face and fury of the great red dragon . ' Henceforth their " church was in the wilderness , the caves of the earth were her hiding-place , and the perpetual hills her refuge . " Their name was forgotten among men , and the great army of faithful followers of Christ upon earth was no longer led by that noble band that had so long formed the " Ancient Church of Moravian Brethren . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it forever . " Bold to bear God 's heaviest load , dimly guessing of the road , " some crossed the Atlantic and peopled Georgia and Pennsylvania with the descendants of martyrs , while others turned their face toward the east , and found refuge in Poland and Russia . It was among these that their last bishop , Conmenius , escaped into Poland , and , as Montgomery sings , " from the boundary rock Cast o'er Moravian hills a look of woe , Saw the green vales expand , the waters flow , And , happier years revolving in his mind , Caught every sound that murmured on the wind , As if his eye could never thence depart , As if his ear was seated in his heart , And his full soul would thence a passage break , To leave the body for his country 's sake ; While on his knees lie poured a fervent prayer That God would make that martyr-land liii care , And nourish in that ravaged soil a root Of Gregor 's tree , to bear perennial fruit . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every right under Heaven , and where every rock and mountain , from the Danube to the Elbe , was associated with the imperishable history of their brethren . The vine that had been planted in that land of hills and valleys had not ceased to grow , though sorely trodden under foot . There they remained in humble silence and solitude , meeting but rarely-r*xiv in the dark forests of Bohemia , and now in the secret chamber of some wealthier brother  --  to read by stealth the Word of God , and to comfort each other with songs of fond hope and unshaken reliance on Him who would surely not forget those that obey Him . And God did hear their pious bishop 's prayer , and " that Church thro ' ages past Assail 'd and rent by persecution 's blast , Whose sons no yoke could crush , no burthen tire , IJnaw 'd by dungeons , tortures , sword , or fire , That Church which Satan 's legions thought destroyd , Her name extinct , her place forever void , Alive once more respired her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So these last descendants of the ancient Church determined also to leave their sweet home . It was in the year 1722 , and toward the close of spring , when four plain , wayfaring men , weary but not faint , with wayworn feet and drooping limbs , but eyes in whose mild flash could be discerned firm resolve and conquering patience , approached a village in Saxony . They had left kindred and friends in the enemy 's land , going out they knew not whither-they had arisen at midnight and wandered forth by by-roads and mountain-paths , a noble band of pious pilgrims . Thus they crossed the lofty chain that parts Bohemia from Saxony , and as they entered upon the fertile plains of that happy land , where freedom reigned and Protestants lived unharmed and undisturbed , they heard the good people speak much of one Count Zinxendorf , a real Christian , who had bought an estate in the neighhorhood and stationed there a faithful minister of the Gospel . So the four men resolved to see for themselves , holding , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are sharers in misfortune and sharers in hope . The most remarkable of these men was Christian David , who had tended his flock in peace , until he heard , in the dark of night and from the depth of a prison , the singing and praying of some pious friends . A devout and zealous Papist , he had never even heard of the Bible , and when these solemn hymns revealed to him now an entirely new world , he procured at once a copy , and made it his constant study . Meeting some Moravians and joining their brotherhood , he also had to leave his native country and went as a soldier abroad , but soon returned to his home and wandered about from place to place , stirring and gladdening his neighbors by singing hymns and repeating the Scriptures under their porches . Three other men , humble artisans like himself , united with him , and together they went forth to spread their simple faith and to find a place where they might worship in peace . It was thus that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Egypt , and the house of Jacob from a strange people , " a begging soldier began , and humble artisans carried on this glorious revival . Count Zinzendorf 's mother assigned the exiles a piece of land where they might build themselves houses . It was a dreary wilderness , covered with forest-trees and bordering upon vast marshes but when care and doubts began to darken their hearts , David took his axe , struck the nearest tree , a gigantic oak , and said , " Horn the sparrow bath found a house , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may lay her young , even thine altars , 0 Lord of hosts . " ' Thus they began their first settlement . They were laughed at by the passers-by ; they were so weak from fatigue and want of food , and often so faint in spirit , that they seemed to themselves like children building houses with cards ; but they ceased not to cheer each other , and to commune of Abraham , who had gone forth into a strange land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // qwq preacher , " as he was called , soon gathered from far and near true believers around him ; they paid fines as long as their substance lasted , and endured confinement with meek patience . But at last the grievances became intolerable , and once , being attacked by soldiers , they refused to disperse , and replied to the officer 's summons by singing Luther 's famous hymn , " If the whole world with devils swarmed , That threatened us to swallow , " . over and over again , until be was struck with terror , and left the field in awe and dismay . They determined , however , now to claim the mournful privilege of seeking a freer home far from the graves of their fathers , where they might worship their Maker in their own tongue , in their own manner . Thus it happened that on the very day when Zinzendorf ; with his three friends , was laying the foundation stone of a new building , and singing songs of praise and thanksgiving , a number of weary travelersfrom Moravia slowlywended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what.they beheld moved them so deeply that with one accord they said , " This is the home of God ; here we will take up our abode ! " New immigrants soon arrived from all sides , now humble but pious exiles from distant lands , now scions of noble houses that were to be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord , and then again meu of mature age and ripe experience , who sought a peaceful home in the midst of the loving Brethren . The Moravians had brought with them the ancient discipline of their fatisers , preserved by tradition from the times of the Apostles . But as more than onehalf of the assembled Brethren belonged to the Lutheran Church , much dissension followedsome desiring to establish a separate sect , and others preferring a union with their own Church . Here it was that the preference of Count Zinzendorf for the manner in which the twelfth Apostle was chosen to replace Judas the traitor , first led to the employment of the lot for a decision even in the gravest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lord of the manor , threw the whole weight of his opinion on the side of union-an idea for which he ever cherlshed an anxious fondness -- while on the opposite side was a majority of nearly six hundred brethren . Solemn prayers were held , and two papers were placed in an urn with words of the Bible written on them , referring to the pending question . A child under four years was then chosen , which drew from it the paper with these words : " Brethren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which ye have been taught ; " upon which there was much rejoicing , the Count and all submitting as to a decree of God . On that day , therefore , the Unites Fratrem , the Ancient Brotherhood of Moravians , was , as it were , regenerated and renewed . It has since flourished in our midst , a separate sect , independent of the State , but subject to bishops , and differing in a few points only from other Prot estant churches . The officers are all chosen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the lot ; of dogmas , that of salvation is treated with a great preponderance of feeling , and the hiblical image of the " Lamb that bears our sins " is in sermon and song more literally and tangibly brought forward than elsewhere in Protestant worship . In the mean time the remarkable growth of the colony and their peculiar usages , their worldly success , which literally made the wilderness lAoom as the rose , and their piety , acknowledged and admired by all who saw it , excited great public attention . Enemies also arose ; Catholics attacked them as heretics of the most dangerous kind , because so ancient in time , so stainless in conduct ; Protestants reviled them as those who wished to be better and purer than others ; and when the too boundless zeal of some members had led to sad indiscretions , the Saxon government was prevailed upon to banish the Count , and to order the sale of all his estates . This latter calamity was averted by the transfer of Zinzendorf 's property into his wife 's hand long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Count himself had resigned the office he held from his King , and , after arduous studies and a satisfactory examination , obtained ordination as a minister of the Lutheran Church . On his return home he was met by a messenger , bearing the order of his banishment . " Then , " said the Count , in a transport of joy , " the moment is come for collecting together a church of pilgrims . We must go and preach the Saviour to all the world . " Thus arose Count Zinzendorf 's far-famed Church of Pilgrims , a kind of missionary congregation , wandering from land to land , and supported by their own means and exertions . While his noble wife employed at home her time and the whole of her fortune in support of the parent establishment of Herrnhut , the Count pursued his silent , sacred pilgrimage , which ended only with the last day of his life . It was about this time that John Wesley , the great founder of Methodism , with his brother Charles , and their associates , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moravians , who , by their extreme meekness , their performance of the most servile offices without reward , their composure when the great deep was as if about to swallow them up , even the women and children , devoid of all fear , continuing calmly to sing the hymn they had begun , so moved his heart that he joined them as a brother . He faithfully submitted to their discipline while in the colony , even in the tender point of marriage , which was decided among them by lot , probably because , as we find in an old Moravian hymn , it was included among the " services of danger , " for which brethren must be prepared , That like the former warriors each may stand Ready for land , sea , ge , at command . After his return to Europe , he resolved to make a journey to Herrnhut , as he said , " for the establishment of his faith . " Unfortunately , // lie found Count Zinzendorf a banished man ; and when they met in after life , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hearts than whom few nobler and purer ever beat in human breast . Both were leaders . But the Count , though a humble pastor , washing the feet of his disciples , was still the feudal German baron  --  the prophet , priest , and patron of a great multitude , ruling supremely in a spiritual empire , within which his written and spoken words were received almost as oracles . Wesley , who had for many years never mentioned the Brethren except in terms of high admiration , first doubted and then accused them with a severity surely wanting in charity , and after he had seen many adherents and his oldest associates join the Church of the Brethren even , we fear , with more zeal than candor . Whitfield also attacked the Brethren , who , in the beginning especially , were by no means free from a fondness for extravagant ceremonies and almost monastic discipline . Their public worship was often stained with scenes of ludicrous display , and their songs not nufrequently breathed a spirit of mystic piety , very different from the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's high position in life , and his surpassing zeal , led his followers at times to show him a reverence due only to the one Master above ; and Zinzendorf himself , perhaps unconsciously , to exercise an authority which , though ever well meant , still could not but he liable to open censure . Although he and the Brethren were ever ready to confess these and all other faults , they were proclaimed to the world by Whitfield in terms of such fierce invective , that Lord Granville , the President of the Council , advised Zinzendorf to bring suit against him , as he was punishable according to English law . Zinzendorf 's reply is worthy of the man . " Mr. Whitfield , " he writes , is still listened to with benefit by many , and therefore I would not even write any thing that might destroy his reputation . " One of those accidents which , under Providence , become often the fountain-heads of mighty movements , led Zinzendorf 's attention first to this continent . His devotion to th' simple but grand work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been ordained a bishop by the anxious desire of the Brethren and the wish of the King of Prussia , and since the Archbishop of Canterbury had publicly acknowledged in the Moravians the episcopal succession , and obtained their official recognition in England by an Act of Parliament . There was no service of danger , no forlorn hope , in which the Count was not ever ready to go for the furtherance of his great purpose . In his constant visitation of the churches he had planted , the death-breathing swamp and the huge iceberg were as welcome to him as the mountain heath and the smiling meadow . Thus he found himself once in Copenhagen , where the servant of a great nobleman attracted his attention by his color . He questioned him , and heard of the negro how he had been carried from Africa to St. Thomas , and how he had there often sat by the sea-shore , praying for a word from above , until , by the providence of God , his master had taken him to Denmark , where he had embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent wish to see " his sister Anna and his brethren in captivity " rescued from dark Paganism , struck Zinzendorf so forcibly , that he immediately called upon two Brethren , sent them on the spot to St. Thomas , and a few years later followed them himself to look after the infant Church . There he learned much of the sad fate of the natives of this continent ; and at last he also heard , like Saul of Tarsus , the words , " I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles . " So he resolved to go to America , and to see himself what God would allow him to do for the poor savages . " Some of the Brethren had preceded him here , settling in Georgia , under the auspices of General Oglethorpe , who paid their passage , and procured for them land and houses , both in Savannah and on the banks of the River Ogeeche . Unwilling , however , to take up arms in any worldly struggle , and therefore refusin* to fight in the ranks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new homes in the South and gone to Pennsylvania , where Whitfield had sold them a farm and a school-house , originally intended for negroes . It still stands , a venerable relic of those early times , in the village of Nazareth . So small was the beginning , so humble the manner in which the Episcopal Moravian brotherhood led the way in Christianizing the world I But their enterprise has been blessed by Providence in a manner approaching the miraculous . Without any permanent fund for missions , and unable to raise among themselves more than one-half of the sum annually required , they have still never yet lacked the necessary means-such has been the liberality of friends and of strangers . Their whole number of actual members amounts but to 12,000 in Europe , and 6000 in this country ; and yet they have been able to maintain , scattered over all parts of the world , 70 missionary stations , with 300 missionaries , and at least 70,000 converts from Paganism ! Nor have men ever been wanting , in spite of all privations and dangers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the confidence felt in the efficacy of their prayer , that their Labrador vessel pays , on its annual voyage to that distant land , a far less premium for its insurance than other ships  --  a singular testimony , surely , to the manifestly gracious care of the Lord . The same rich blessing followed the labors of the earliest Brethren in this country . Earning their own bread chiefly by working for those among whom they dwelt , they lived and dressed in their manner , so that in traveling they were often taken for Indians . It is true that at times they suffered want , and were obliged to hunt , or to seek roots in the forest . // 792 The Indians were astonished that they should ranges of the Alleghanies . The tale bore that thus submit to live in poverty merely from love a stranger had appeared among them , who , by to them , and endure hunger abroad when they some magic influence , and for some inscrutable might have enjoyed plenty at home . But what end , had bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their work !

Divinely melted , moulded , and renewed . qwq thus form the first congregation of believing Indians in North America ! This success encouraged him soon after to undertake a third , and much more perilous journey , to the Shawnee nation , who dwelt on the banks of the Susquehanna . Owing to the late season , his path was beset with dangers by storms and by floods , but fearlessly he and his brave daughter made their waythrough regions which are found upon Jefferson 's map under the expressive names of St. Anthony 's Wilderness , the Great Swamp , with a solitary shelter-house in the centre , and a dismal waste known as the Shades of Death ! From these he emerged at last  --  the first European whose feet trod these plains-upon the sweet valley where , on Susquehanna 's side , fair Wyoming was later built . Here God 's mercy was signalized in a manner so marvelous that it might well produce the effect of a miracle . The Shawnees , among , whom he dwelt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Europeans , and had laid all around them so thoroughly waste that from the headquarters of the Santee to the banks of the Susquehanna there was but one wide wilderness . They would not believe that Zinzendorf had come for other than the usual purposes of trading or buying land . They listened not to his explanations ; they refused his fair offers . Their hearts were closed against the truth , and filled with suspicion and bitter enmity against the mysterious stranger . Nothing was left to Zinzendorf but to pray for their souls . Few know what he there suffered in silence . At such times he endured true martyrdomnot by fire and fagot , nor in the dark dungeon . His was not the poetry of martyrdom , to be led to death amidst the cheers of friends and the still more exciting taunts of enemies . His was the far humbler , and yet in nowise less glorious fate , to suffer while he wandered on foot through a savage land , where the sun scorched by day and the assassin lurked by night , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit of his labors , and yet cheerfully , ceaselessly to live and to work for his faith  --  a task far more difficult and rare than to fight and to die for heartfelt convictions . In his open tent  --  the frail curtain a blanket fastened aside by a pin-he would kneel down with his daughter Benigna and pour forth his ardent prayer that God would strengthen the faint heart and the feeble knees , and at last permit him to lead these stray children back to their great Father in heaven . There he was seated one evening upon a bundle of dry weeds which formed his bed , and engaged in reading . The cool air of a September night was tempered by a small fire built against the trunk of a huge sycamore , and its bright blaze fell full upon his venerable face . Without all was still and silent ; only the gentle murmurin* of a brook was heard as it fell playfully over rocks and roots . At this moment dusky shadows were seen flitting from tree to tree , and Indians appeared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ col ors which to theexperienced eye betokened their bloody purpose . Their hand upon the tomahawk , they glided up to the tent . But the missionary heard not their stealthy footsteps-his thoughts were bent upon the holy writ on his knees-he saw not even that danger was nearer , and death within reach of his hand ; for a large rattlesnake , allured by the warmth of the fire , had crawled forth from its lair in the hollow tree , and was at that very moment gliding slowly over his knees . The strange sight struck the heart of the savages with awe and wonder . Silently as they had stepped forth into the glare of the fire , they shrank back again into the welcome shade of the forest , and , hastening home to their tribe , related how they had found the great stranger with no door but a blanket , no weapon but a book , and a venomous snake in his bosom ! At the same moment the Count 's guide and interpreter had re-appeared . Far away on a distant errand , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and driven him back , he could not tell how and why , to his master . Henceforth the Indians looked upon Zinzendorf as protected by the Great Spirit ; they listened to his words , and when he left them after some weeks , the seed was sown and the fruit was not long wanting . Many thought the " sweet words of Jesus , " as they called them , over in their hearts ; others brought their children to be taught by . the good white men , and one couple even gave their daughter a present to the Brethren , because they could not educate her as well as they ought . In the following year Count Zinzendorf returned to Europe , having done every thing in his power toward the conversion of the heathen and the furtherance of the Gospel among Europeans . His mission had failed , if we judge of it only hy its outward success . He had wished to form a truly Catholic church , having , not as of old , a visible throne and a triple crown , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either collected into a sacred college at the Vatican , or at least represented by mitred bishops in unbroken succession , but proclaiming the Scriptures as the only rule of life , and the Divine Redeemer as the sole , supreme , and central object , to whom every eye must turn , and on whom every hope must rest . Engaged in such arduous and lofty designs , Zinzendorf also lived , to a certain extent , in an imaginary world , pursuing a sublime abstraction , and recruiting his exhausted strength with ideal prospects . These were not to be realized . Amidst the shock of contending creeds , there were but few who would listen to the gentler and more kindly sounds of his voice . He invited them all to unite not in one law and one administration , but in one object of worship and affianceone source of virtue , and one cementing principle of mutual love which was to pervade and animate the whole . This he could not accomplish . So Zinzendorf contented himself with the humbler but still most happy result of // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , the ancient brotherhood of the Moravians . He thus gave one nook upon earth where all Protestants could unite , and one family among men that enjoys to the fullest extent the peace of religious concord . It is true that this is obtained in his Church at some cost of liberty within , and of progress without ; for the great characteristic of the religious practice , and , indeed , of the whole manner of life of the Brethren , is extreme regularity , often approaching to formalism . Wesley already objected to it , and so do many among modern critics . But is this not a proof of wisdom ? Formal , but free from superstition , these regular practices hold the convert , as has been well said , by a new chain of habit , as bis former life or Pagan superstitions kept him before converted , and they edify him at the same time by the spiritual lessons they contain . Such is , for instance , their custom of assigning beforehand a verse of the Bible to each day of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the dangers of duties abroad , these words often cheer and console . At times their appropriateness has all the effect of a miracle . Thus when two of their messengers of peace were once obliged , in the State of Virginia , to pass through a forest of fire , and on the same day to cross an overflowing , turbulent stream , their heart was failing them and their courage sank . They turned to the watchword of the day , and behold ! it ran thus : " When thou passest through the waters , I will be with thee , and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee ; when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned , neither shall the flame kindle upon thee . " Their hearts revived instantly , and cheerfully they completed their journey . The coincidence was , of course , accidental ; but Providence uses accidents also as means , and even the readiness with which the Holy Word is thus brought to bear upon actual occurrences has its great and undeniable value . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthful country , thank him that , while new sects are springiag up all around us , mostly fresh , impulsive , and free , he should have preserved us one eminently conservative in its character and tenacious both of its forms and its doctrines . - He has left us in our midst a simple order and a sound creed , older than all distinctions between Catholic and Protestant churches , and proved , in its durability , by a history such as no other Church can present . Concerning what they fondly believe to be true , pristine Christianity , they have moored themselves here and there in sheltered nooks of the world amidst the waters of increasing infidelity or formality , and thus remained a Church more ancient than the race of our fathers , and yet even now full of spirit and life . The second great purpose of Zinzendorf in coming to this country , had been to carry " the glad tidings of mercy to a fallen world . " Like all who have caught the genius as well as the creed of Christianity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destitute , and the oppressed . So , when he heard of the poor savages in the Far West and their forlorn condition , he left at once the sweet home of his childhood , the warm love of his kindred , and went forth to a life of peril and pain , of contempt and ill-usage , at the hand of barbarians , and of utter isolation from all that makes life safe and pleasant . In this also he followed not the voice of wisdom , but the inner voices of his heart . Personally , he was successful beyond expectation . Neither the callous nerves of hardy settlers , nor the stately self-possession of the Indians , could resist the enchantment of his overflowing love . He was literally unto them as a very lovely song of one that bath a pleasant voice , and they loved him in deed and in truth as their father . But here also , his ideas were grand but premature . He left the Indians what he had found them-Pagans . But he sowed seed for a harvest which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gathered even now in lowly silence in our midst . For , thanks to Zinzendorf , the Moravian Brotherhood now stands foremost in the list of missionary churches . When he left the United States , a community of laborers and artisans , not 600 in number , and but lately settled as exiles in a foreign land , began the noble work , and in the short space of eight years they had already sent missionaries to Greenland , to St. Thomas , to St. Croix , and to Surinam , to the Indians of the northwest and the negroes of South Carolina , to Lapland and Tartary , the Cape of Good Hope and the island of Ceylon . Since then , they have pursued their work in unobtrusive obscurity , not shrinking from peril or suffering , yet never aspiring to the name of saints or heroes , not boasting of themselves , not deifying one another . Their laborers are usually men of humble origin , without much education ; for , in general , they think that the habits of a student are not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardships of missionayy life as those of a mechanic . There is little romance , therefore , in their history ; no startling triumphs , no sublime martyrdom . But the position of these Moravian missionaries is in no degree impaired in its solemn beauty . Disinterestedness is eternally beautiful , and pious self-sacrifice is above all things solemn . Like true children of their ancient Church , they go forth upon their perilous errand with a quietness and simplicity truly touching . Preferring , in Europe at least , the favorite appeal to the lot , after devout and fervent prayer , slips of paper are marked with the names of distant nations , and , by the hand of a child , drawn from an urn . The chosen brother accepts the call without doubt , without hesitation , as coming from above , and , bowing his head in humble submission , he at once sets out for the icy shores of Greenland or the tropical regions of West India . Few scenes are more touching than to see these chosen men , usually // 795 qwq With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
