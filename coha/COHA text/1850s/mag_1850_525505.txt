CONGRESSIONAL SUMMARY . THE interests of the State are becoming daily more involved in the great subject of Slavery . Prominent political questions that have served hitherto to distinguish parties , seem to have lost all their vitality , and are either not heard of at all , or are merely introduced as affairs of form , and are then postponed to some future season of leisure and tranquillity . In truth , the old party lines , that were marked out by economical principles , have , to a great extent , been erased , and a new line , one of the most dangerous that could possibly be formed , is taking their place . The country has been accustomed to see men divided on points of general legislation ; now they are separating on geographical bountlaries . The Slave States are organizing a firm , united , compact opposition to the Free . It is a great Southern interest no less than a political principle , opposed to a moral principle asserted where slavery does not exist . On the one band , human bondage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistent with the political axioms of our government , with the doctrines of the people , with the common rights of humanity , with the opinions of the enlightened world , amid with Christian morality and religion , and , therefo* , while it must be permitted where it already is established , its exclusion from territories that are yet free from it is believed to be demanded by every benevolent consideration , and to be sanctioned by the law and by precedent . The South replies to such reasons by reasons of a more practical kind . She is willing to admit , that taking a merely moral view of the question , bondage is a wrong to the slave , but that in effect it is not half so bad as it is commonly represented . She alleges that if it were abolished , the actual condition of the negro would be rendered far worse than it is at present , while the whites would inevitably be ruined . The Wilmnot Proviso , or any similar measure , although it does not *retend to meddle with slavery in States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South , both by denying to her equal *onstitutional privileges , and by the fatal moral effi ? cts that such legislation would produce among the slave population as well as among the free . She declares that slavery was one of the essential conditions of the country when the Union was organized , that its political rights were at that time acknowledged , amid that , under the constitution , every territorial acquisition that the nation may make , belongs as fully to the people owning slaves as to those who are horror-struck at such an enormity . She adds , with them rest all the evils-on their heads be the guilt . They are willing to take all the responsibility-all they desire , and which they are resolved to contend for to the last extremity , are equal legal privileges to go where they choose with their possessions . We shall endeavor to furnish in a condensed form , such a view of this subject as can be obtained from the Congressional manifestations within the last month . In answer to a call made by the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitted to that body , on the 21st of Jaminary , a special Message , which he begins by saying , that in coming into office and finding the military commandant of the department of California exercising the functiomis of a civil governor , he had thought it best not to disturb the arrangement that had been made by his predecessor , until Congress should take somne action on the subject . With a view to the faithful execution of the treaty , so far as lay in the power of the Executive , and to enable Congress to act at the present session , with as full knowledge and as little difficulty as possible , on all matters of interest in those territories , he sent the Honorable Thomas Butler King , as hearer of despatches to California , and certain nfficers to California and New Mexico . He proceeds to say : " I did not hesitate to express to the people of those Territories my desire that each Territory should , if prepared to comply with the requisitions of the constitution of the United States , form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Congress , with a prayer for admission imito the Union as a State ; but I did not anticipate , suggest , or authorize the establishment of any such government without the assent of Congress , nor did I authorize any government agent or officer to interfere with or exereise any influence or control over the election of delegates , or over any convention , in making or modifying their domestic institutions , or any of the provisions of their proposed consti 316 March , // qwq " Seeing , then , that the question which now excites such painful sensations in the country , will , in the end , certainly be settled by the silent effect of causes independent of the action of Congress , I again submit to your wisdom the policy recommended in my annual message of awaiting the salutary operation of those causes , believing that we shall thus avoid the creation of geographic parties , and secure the harmony of feeling so necessary to the beneficial action of our political system . Connected as the Union is , with the remembrance of past happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of future peace and prosperity , every dictate of wisdom , every feeling of duty , and every emotion of patriotism , tend to inspire fidelity and devotion to it , and admonish us cautiously to avoid any unnecessary controversy which can either endanger it or impair its strength , the chief element of which is to be found in the regard and affection of the people for each other . " Z. TAYLOR . Washington , January 21 , 1850. " 5*NATE . ON the 16th of January , Mr. FooTu , a Senator I ruin Mississippi , who has made himself conspicuous by his ultra Southern doctrines , his apparent anxiety to settle the slave qtteslion before any other business shall engage the attention of Congress , and by ( legrading the Senate Chamber into a theatre for a kind of charlatan oratory , introduced a Bill to " provide for the or*ani ? ation of a Territorial Government in California , Deseret , and New Mexico , and to ena*Ae the people of Jacinto , with the assent of the State of Texas , to provide a Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State into the Union , upon an equal footing with the original States , in all respects whatever . " On the ' 22d , the same subject came up as the order of the day , when Mr. CASs delivered a very long and elaborate speech , which occupied the greater part of the time for two days . There are two principal questions , he said , in the controversy respecting the Wilmot Proviso , as indeed there are in all the legislation of Congress first , whether the measure is constitutional and next , if constitutional , whether it is expedient . He liropOsed chiefly to argue the constitutional question , though , before closing , he should offer a few remarks on the expediency of exercising the power , provided the power exists . In the discussions which have taken place on the subject , formerly and recently , all those who have contended for the power of Congress to pass this Wilinot Proviso , , have contended for a general and unlimited power of legislation over the Territories . The right to institute governments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as convertible terms . This is true , both in Congress , and on the judicial bench . He quotes from Sargent , Story , Rawle , and others , who entertain this opinion . It was precisely this claim of unlimited legislation which led to our separation from England . He had listened , he said , with amazement to the long and subtle metaphysical inquiries into the rights of sovereignty , and the powers it brings with it , as if the rights of sovereignty were everything , and the rights of mail nothing . A great princilile is involved in this controversy -- the inseparable con neetion between legislation and representatiolt . And what paramount necessity calls for its violation 3 Are not the people of the territories competent to mana*e their own affairs ? Are they not of us , and with us 3 The same people . with the same views , habits , and intelligence -- all , indeed , which constitutes national identity ? Can not such a people administer their own government safely and wisely 3 Experience says they can . It is clear there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have never legislated exclusively , and the very few instances of the exercise of such a power upon the statute-book , were not only unconstitutional , but were acts of supererogation . He considered that it was no objection to the application of this argument to the new Territories , to say , that they contained a very large foreign l ) opuilation , who were ignorant of out  |p01-itical  institutions ; for , he thought , in all of them there would be a majority of the active population , who are American citizens , emigrants from the older States , that would exercise a preponderating influciuce on all public affairs . He then referred to the late proceedings in California for organizing a Government , as an evidence of their ability to manage their own concerns , and of their devotion to republican principles . There is no clause in the Constitution , giving Congress express power to pass any law respecting slavery in the Territories . Every construction which would give to Congress such a power , would equally give it jurislliction over every department of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wife , of parent and child , as well as over the relations of master and servant ; it would embrace the whole circle of human rights -- life , liberty , and property -- in all their various modes of enjoyment . If Congress possesses the power to abolish or exclude slavery , it has the power to institute it . If , as many speakers contend , said Mr. C . , this right of Congress is derived from that clause of the constitution , which provides " that Congress shall have power to ( lispose of and make ill nee ( lful rules and regulations respecting the Territory and other property belonging to the United States , " then is the phraseology employed but little creditable to 318 March , // qwq ces . When the time comes that he should be required to vote upon the question , as a practical one , in a bill providing for a Territorial Government , he should know how to reconcile his duty to the Legislature and duty to himself , by surrendering a trust that he could no longer fulfil . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate in the same character in which he appeared thirty years ago  --  the pacificator between the slave and the free States  --  and introduced the following Resolutions , accompanying each one with proper explanatory remarks : 1st . Resolved , That California , with suitable boundaries , ought upon her application to be ad mittad as one of the States of this Union , without the imposition by Congress of any restriction in respect to the exclusion or introduction of slavery within those boundaries . 2d . Resolved , That as slavery does not exist by law , and is not likely to he introduced into any of the territory acquired by the United States from the Republic of Mexico , it is inexpedient for Congress to provide by law either for its introduction into or exclusion Irom any part of the said territory ; and that appropriate Territorial Governments ought to be established by Congress in all of the said territory , not assigned as the boundaries of the proposed State of California , without the adoption of any restriction or condition on the subject of slavery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State of Texas ought to be fixed on the Rio dcl Norte , commencing one marine league from its mouth , and running up that river to the southern line of New Mexico ; thence with that line eastwardly , and so continuing in the same direction to the line as established between the United States *id Spain , excluding any portion of New Mexico , whether lying on the east or west of that river . 4th . Resolved , That it be proposed to the State of Texas that the United States will provide for the payment of all that portion of the legitimate and bonafide public debt of that State contracted prior to its annexation to the United States , and for which the duties on foreign imports were pledged by the said State to its creditors , not exceeding the sum of $-.  - -   - -   - -  -  , in consideration of the said duties so pledged having been no longer applicable to that object after the said annexation , but having thenceforward become payable to the United States ; and upon the condition also that the said State of Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Legislature , or of a convention , relinguish to the United States any claim which it has to any part of New Mexico . 5th . Resolved , That it is inexpedient to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia , whilst that institution continues to exist in the State of Maryland , without the consent of that State , without the consent of the people of the District , and without just compensation to the owners of slaves within the District . 6th . But resolved , That it is expedient to prohibit within the District the slaves-trade , in slaves brought into it from States or places beyond the limits of the District , either to be sold therein as merchandise , or to be transported to other markets without the District of Columbia . 7th . Resolved , That more effectual provision ought to be made by law , according to the requirement of the constitution , for the restitution and delivery of persons bound to service or labor in any State , who may escape into any other State or Territory in the Union . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibit or obstruct the trade in slaves between the slave-holding-States , but that the admission or exclusion of slaves brought from one into another of them , depends exclusively upon their own particular laws . Although Mr. C. desired , on submitting these Resolutions , to avoid bringing on a general debate , and proposed that they should be made the order of the day , seine days ahead , when he intended to enter into a more elaborate argument than he designed on that occasion , there was , nevertheless , a pretty sharp onset made upon them by several meinhers from the South , and some undue warmth of language was indulged in . Mr. FooTE and Mr. DAViS , the two Senators from Mississippi , were particularly vehement in their onset , and most eager to engage in the conflict . Mr. MASON , Mr. RUSK , Ma . KING , Ma . DowNs , Ma . BERRIEN , and Mr. BUTLER , all from the slave States , thought it necessary , lest their silence might be construed into an assent , to interpose their objections without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall offer a sketch of the second ,  --  the more elaborate orie ,  --  that was delivered on the 5th of February , when the Resolutions came up in order . Mr. CLAY began by saying that never , on any former occasion , had he risen under feelings of such painful solicitude . He had witnessed many periods of great anxiety , of peril , and of danger in this country , but never before had he ris3n to address any assemblage so oppressed , so appalled , and so anxious . He had , again and again in his chamber , implored Him , who holds the destinies of nations , as of individuals , in his hands , to bestow upon our country his blessing , to calm the violence and rage of party , to still passion , and to allow reason once more to iesume its empire ; and he hoped it would not be out of place to make the same supplication there . He attributed all the present dangers and difficulties to party-spirit ; that was busy in the North , the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Representatives had felt its influence so strongly , that it had spent a whole week this very session , in the vain endeavor to elect a door-keeper , and the only question was , whether he entertained 320 March , // opiniOns upon certain great national measures , coincident with this or that side of the House . Nearly eight years since he had taken his final leave , as he had supposed , of the Senate . He had not conceived the possibility of his ever returning to it , and if his private wishes and inclinations , his desire , during the short remnant of his days , to remain in repose and quiet , could have prevailed , he would not he seen occupying the seat which he now occupies on that floor . But the Legislature of the StatE to which he belonged , unsoli*ited , had re-elected him : and he had come there in obedience to a sense of stern duty , with no personal objects , no private views , now or hereafter , to gratify . He begged to assure all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitol , who hope in the race for honors and elevation , for higher honors and higher elevation , that he , at least , would never interfere with them in their pursuits ; and if his wishes could prevail , his name should never be used in competition . When his service was terminated in that body , his mission , so far as respects the public affairs of this world , and upon this earth , would be closed , he hoped , forever . It is impossible not to perceive that party-spirit affects all our affairs . At the moment when the White H3use is itself in danger from conflagration , instead of all hands uniting to extinguish the flames , we are contending about who shall be its next occupant . It is passion-passion , party , party , and intemperance , that he dreaded in the adjustment of the questions , which unhappily divide our distracted country . At this moment , besides the legislative bodies of the Capitol , there are t*venty-odd furnaces in full blast , emitting heat , and passion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison with the present . Now , all is uproar , confusion , and menace to the existence of the Union , and to the happiness of this people . He conjured senators , by all their hopes now and hereafter , to repress the ardor of these passions , to listen to the voice of reason . He had cut himself off , he said , from all the usual enjoyments of society during this whole session , and had confined himsel , almost entirely , to his own chamber , anxiously meditating on some plan of accommodation , which would restore the blessings of concord , harmony , and peace to this great country . The first Resolution relates to *I*a1ifornia . There is no concession by either party . if slavemy is interdicted within the limits of California , it is done by California herself , and not by Congress ; and has it not been the doctrine of all parties , that when a State is about to be admitted into the Union , it has a right to decide for itself , whether it will or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the introduction of Missouri into th' Union . The great argument used by those contending for its admission was , that she had all the rights of any pre-existing State , and was legally as competent to decide whether she should have slavery or not as New York , or any other of the old thirteen were . No one doubts now that those Northwestern States to which the ordinance of 1787 applied , have just as mtich right to introduce slavery within their borders , as Virginia has to maintain the existence of it within hers . lf , then , in the struggle for empire between the two classes of States , a decision in California has taken place , adverse to the wishes of the South , it is a decision respecting which they can utter no complaint towards the General Government , for it is made by California , who unquestionably had the constitutional right to make it . Respecting the second resolution , he said he knew that every one of the free States in this Union , without exception , had by its legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representatives to have the restriction of the Wilmot Proviso incorporated in any Territorial Government which might be established under the auspices of Congress . He knew how much they had set their hearts upon the adoption of this measure . In the second resolution he asked them , for the sake of l ) eace , and in the spirit of mutual forbearance to the other members of the Union , to give it up . As a compensation for doing so , he felt botind to offer something in return , though it was not by any means an equivalent . What he offered was what he considered two indisputable truths ; the first is , that slavery no longer exists , by law , in any part of the acquisitions made by us from Mexico ; and the second is , that according to all the probabilities of the case , slavery never will be introduced into any portion of the territories so acquired from Mexico . It is said that these two are tantamount to the Wilmot . Proviso . But he did not think so , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other was the simple expression of an opinion . He then adverted to the condition of the territory while it was still Mexican . At that time , slavery had been formally abolished , whether regularly done or not was no question for this Government to settle . The last act of Mexico , when arranging for a surrender of jurisdiction , showed the abhorrence with which she would regard the introduction of slavery into any portion of the territory that she should cede away . This was sufficient , he thought , to prove that slavery does not exist there by law , unless slavery was carried there the momeat the treaty was ratified by the two parties , under the operation of the Constitution of the United States . This idea he declared was irreconcilable with any comprehension of rea 1850. 321 // son that he might possess . How can it be argued that the fifteen slave States , by the operation of the Constitution , carried into the ceded territory their institution of slavery , any more than it can be argued , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fifteen free States carried into the ceded territory their principles of freedom . Suppose , said he , that we had obtained the new territory with slavery existing in it , in fact and in law would gentlemen from the slave States patiently listen to any argument which undertook to show that , notwithstanding this fact , the Constitution of the United States abolished it the moment it took effect over that country 3 The argument was just as good for one side as the other . Amid the conflict of interests , principles , and legislation , which prevails in the two parts of the Union , can you come to any other conclusion than that which I understand to be the conclusion of the public law of the world , of reason , and justice , that the status of law , as it existed at the moment of the conquest or the acquisition , remains until it is altered by the sovereign authority of the conquering ofacquiring power 3 This is the established public law of the world . The laws of Mexico , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same until and unless they were altered by that power which had newly obtained sovereign rights over it . Mr. CLAy then noticed the general power which appertains to the Government on the subject of slavery . Congress has no power , under the Constitution , to touch slavery within the States , except in the three specified particulars in that instrument , viz to adjust the subject of representation , to impose taxes when a syste*i of direct taxation is made , and to perform the duty of surrendering fugitive slaves that may escape from service which they owe in slave States , and take refuge in free States . If , said he , Congress were to attack , within the States , the institution of slavery for the purpose of its extinction , then would his voice be for war , for then would there be a case which would justify , in the sight of God , and in the presence of the nations of the earth , resistance to such an unconstitutional and usurped attempt . Then should the slave States be acting in defence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , if unfortunately civil war should break out , and there should be presented to the nations of the earth the spectacle of one portion of this Union endeavoring to subvert an institution in violation of the Constitution and the most sa*cred obligations that can bind men , the slave States would have the sympathies of all men who love justice and truth . Far different would be our case if the same fearful condition should arise from an attempt to carry slavery into the new territories acquired from Mexico . We have all read of the efforts made by France to propagate on the continent of Europe not slavery but the rights of man . If a civil war should break out in this country in the strife to establish slavery on the one hand , and to prevent it on the other , iii the territories where it does not exist , what a scene would be exhibited to the contemplation of mankind 3 It would be a war in which we , of the slave States should have no. sympathy , no good wishes , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the commencement of the revolution down to the present time , we have constantly reproached our British ancestors for introducing slavery into this country ; and it is one of the best defences which can be made for the institution that it was forced on this country against the wishes of the inhabitants . He declared his belief that Congress has power over slavery in the territories , and referred to the argument of Mr. CAss in opposition to this view . When a point is settled , said he , by all the elementary writers of our country , by all the departments of our Government , legislative , executive , and judicial , when it has been so settled for a period of fifty years , and never was seriously disturbed till recently , then if we are to regard anything as fixed and settled , should this question be , which has been always decided in a particular way . The power of Congress over this subject he derived both 1mm the right to regulate the territories and other property of the United States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written , the whole country northwest of the Ohio river was unpeopled . Is it possible that Congress had no right whatever , after it had become national property , to declare what description of settlers should occupy the public lands 3 If they had supposed that the introduction of slavery would enhance their value , would they not have had the right to say , in regulating the territory , that any one who chooses , may bring slaves to clear and cultivate the soil , &amp;c. 3 Or , suppose that Congiess might think that a greater amount of revenue would he derived from the waste lands beyond the Ohio river by the interdiction of slavery , would they not have a right to interdict it 3 The exercise of the power to make Governments for territories is temporary , and it ceases whenever there is a sufficient population for self-government . Sixty thousand is the number fixed by the ordinance of 1787 . The first settlement of Ohio was about Marietta. and contained two or three hundred people from New England . Cincinnati was the next point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Jersey . Did those few persons , the moment they arrived there , acquile sovereign rights , and had they power to dispose of these territories 3 Had they even 322 March , // power  --  a handful of men established at Marietta or Cincinnati  --  to govern themselves 3 The Constitution no doubt contemplates that , inasmuch as the power is temporary , the Government who owns the soil may , through Congress , regulate the settlement of the soil , and govern the settlers , until they acquire numbers and capacity to govern themselves . The power of Congress to introduce or to exclude slavery in the ceded territory he finds in the acquiring , or treaty-making provision of the Constitution . Such a power exists somewhere . It existed-no one will deny it - in Mexico prior to the cession of these territories , and when Mexico made the transfer of territory to the United States , she also transferred her sovereignty . What Mexico alienated , the United States received . This Government then possesses all the power now that formerly was possessed by Mexico over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits of the Constitution , what Mexico could have done . On this subject there is no limitation which prescribes the extent to which the powers shall be exercised . Although , in the Constitution , there is no grant of power to Congress , in specific terms , over the subject of slavery , yet the same is true over a great variety of matters over which Congress may unquesti'mably operate . The general grant of power comprehends all the elements of which that power consists . If there be a power to acquire , there must be a power to govern . From the two sources of power to which he had referred , and especially the last , did Congress obtain the right to act in the territories in question , and he considered the right sufficient either to permit or prohibit in them the introduction wit slavery . As respects what he calls the second truth , what are the facts , said Mr. C. , that have occurred within the last three months 3 California ,  --  where , if any where , slavery would most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has declared , by the unanimous vote of her Convention , against the importation of slavery within her limits , and that Convention was composed of persons from the slave-holding as well as from the free States . California has thus responded to the opinion contained in the resolution . The mountain-region of New Mexico ,  --  the nature of its soil-its *unproductive character , every thing relating to itevery thing that we hear about it-must necessarily lead to the conclusion that slavery is not likely to be introduced there . If these are truths , said Mr. CLAY , why hesitate to promulgate them 3 Senators coming from the free States , said he , when this Wilmot Proviso was disseminated through your States , and your people and yourselves became seriously attached to it , you apprehended the introduc tion of slavery into California . You did not know much ,  --  very few of us heard much of these territories , and owing to this want of information , the whole North blazed up in behalf of a prohibition . You left your constituents under this apprehension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a Constitution had been adopted by the people of California excluding slavery from that country . If what we all know now , bad been known in the free States two years ago - if all the present excitement and danger , as well as the probability that slavery will never be conveyed to those territories had then been known , do you believe that the agitation on the Proviso would ever have reached the height that it has attained 3 Do any of you believe it 3 And if , before leaving your homes , you bad had an opportunity of conferring with your constituents upon this most leading an ( I important fact-of the adoption of a Constitution excluding slavery in California - do you not believe , Senators and Representatives coming from the free States , that if you had had the advantage of that fact told in serious , calm , fire-side conversation with your consiituents , they would not have told you to come here and settle all these ( listurbing questions without danger to the Union 3 What do you want 3-what do you want 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want that there shall be no Slavery introduced into the territories acquired by the war with Mexico 3 Have you not your desire in California 3 And in all human probability you will have it in New Mexico also . What more do you want 3 You have got what is worth more than a thousand Wilmot Provisos . You have nature itself on your side-fact itself on your side  --  and this truth staring you in the face , that there is no slavery in those territories . If you are not mad , if you can elevate yourselves from the struggles of party to the height of patriots in every sense , what will you do 3 Look at the fact as it exists You will see that this fact was unknown to the great majority of the people ; you will see that they acted upon one set of facts , while we have another set of facts before us ; and we will act as patriots-as responsible men , and as loveixs of liberty , and lovers , above all , of this Union . We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our constituents , and appeal to their justice and magnanimity to concur with us in this action for peace , concord , and harmony . Mr. CLAY then passed to the resolutions relatin* to Texas . He considered this question as the most difficult with which Congress had to deal , because it was une of boundary . The North would probably be anxious to contract Texas within the narrowest possible limits , in order to diminish the theatre of slavery , while 1850. 323 // the South would entertain an opposite wish for an opposite reason . By the resolution of annexation , slavery was interdicted in all the country north of 36 deg. 30 mm . There is , therefore , houndary and slave territory mixed together in the settlement of this perplexity . The state of things now existing in New Mexico renders it necessary that we decide this matter the present session . There is a feeling approximating to abhorrence on the part of the people of New Mexico , at the idea of any union with Texas . If these questions are not settled , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agitation here . The Wilmot Proviso will still he insisted on in the North , and we shall absolutely have done nothing , if we fail to provide against the recurrence of these dangers . He read an extract from the instructions to their Delegate to Congress , adopted hy the Convention of the Territory of New Mexico , held at the city of Santa Fd , in September , 1849 . The extract sets forth the deplorable condition of the country , from want of an efficient government which government they represented as undefined and doubtful in its character , and they looked to the Congress of the United States for effectual protection against all the ills they complain of . After dwelling at some length on the necessity of furnishing the people of New Mexico with a government , and taking them under Congressional protection , he directed his argument entirely to the boundary of Texas . He alleged that the western and northern borders were unsettled at the period of annexation , and quoted the resolution of annexation in proof , which says : " said State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ques*ons of boundary that may arise with other Governments , and the Constitution thereof , ' &amp;c . That is to say , she was annexed with her rightful boundaries , without a specification of them ; but inasmuch as the boun March , United States has Jull power to settle the undecided boundaries . He admitted that it was a delicate power , and it ought to be exercised in a spirit of justice , liberality , and generosity towards the youngest member of the great American family . He thought that if Congress should fix a boundary , which , in the opinion of Texas , was adverse to her rights , it was possible the question might be carried into the Supreme Court , for a new adjudication-he , however , conceived there were certain matters too momentous for any tribunal of that kind to try . He alluded to the fifteen millions paid for territory . Texas can not fairly come into the Union , and claim all that she has asserted a right to , without paying some portion of the sum which constituted the consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Government of the United States being her agent , but she was no more her agent , than she was the agent of the twenty-nine other States . Mr. CLAy then urged that what he proposed as the boundary , was liberal , and gave Texas a vast country to which she could not establish any undisputed title  --  a country , almost equal in extent to what she actually possessed before , and large enough to form two or three additional States . In addition , he proposed to pay off not less than three millions of the debt of Texas , that accrued before she came into the Union . Indeed , he thought the United States should , in justice , pay the debt for which Texas had pledged her custom 's revenues , when she was authorized so to do by virtue of her sovereignty ; and the Government of the United States , having appropriated those revenues to itself , as a just power , was bound to pay the debt for which those duties were assigned . He concluded this part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to Texas were so liberal , that he should be greatly disappointed if the peo- qwq ground he took then was consistent with his present position . But when Virginia and Maryland ceded the District to the General Government , there was an implied understanding that the subject would not be interfered with without their consent . Congress , therefore , can not , without the forfeiture of all those obligations of honor which men of honor and nations of honor respect , disturb the institution of slavery in the District of Columbia . By the retrocession , however , of so much of the ten miles square as belonged to Virginia , Maryland is the only State now that we are bound to consult . If Maryland should give her consent , the consent of the people residing in the District should also he obtained , and this being given , then the owners of slaves have the right to look for compensation . These are the three conditions of the reso ! ution . There is a clause in one of the amendments of the n , declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without just compensation being made to the owner . Literally , he said , it may be that the property would not be taken for the public use , hut it would be taken in consideration of a policy and purpose adopted by the public , and , by a liberal interpretation of the clause , it ought to be so far regarded as taken for the public as to demand compensation . If it is denied that this clause is a restriction on Congress , then is there no restriction of any kind , except the great one of the obligation of justice . The North have the Constitution in their favorthe South have expediency and honor in theirs . The resolution asks of both parties to forbear urging their respective opinions  --  the one to the exclusion of the other , but it concedes to the South all that the South ought to demand , insomuch as it requires such a condition as amounts to an absolute security for property in slaves in the District , and which will probably make the existence of slavery in the District co-eval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beyond it . He then insisted that the slave trade ought to be abolished . The introduction of slaves in Kentucky , Mississippi , and in many other of the States , is prohibited . lt is a right belonging to each State . It also belongs , in an equal degree , to the United States in the District , and there had been , he said , no time in his public life when he was not willing to concur in the abolition of the slave trade in the District . XVhy should slave-traders , who buy their slaves in Maryland or Virginia come here with them in order to transport them further South 3 Why are the feelings of citizens here outraged by the scenes exhibited , and the corteges which p ass along our avenues of manacled human beings brought from the distant parts of neighboring States 3 Who is there having a heart that does not contemplate a spectacle of that kind with horror and indignation 3 This is an object in which both the free and the slave States should unite , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effecting , as it would lessen one of the causes of inquietude which is connected with this District . He then took up the next resolution , and declared that he would go as far as him who went the farthest for this clause of the Constitution . He held that the Constitution required every man to assist in recovering fugitive slaves* and the obligation was especially binding , as in cases o ? fugitives from justiceupon all officers of the several States , who had taken an oath to support the Constitution of the United States . The Constitution applies precisely the same language to both classes of fugitives . He theui alluded to a recent decision of the Supreme Court , and said he thought that that decision had been misapprehended . The true meaning was that any State laws which acted as an impediment to the recovery of fugitive slaves were contrary to the Constitution . It is , however , only fulfilling the duties imposed by the Constitution , for States to enact laws which may afford facilities for the more perfect observance of the obligations imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole class of legislation , beginniiig in the Northern States , and extending to some of the Western , by which obstructions have been placed in the way of recovering fugitive slaves , is unconstitutional . He then referred to the difficulties and losses of Kentucky in consequence of living contiguous to Ohio . He believed that the slave States had just cause of complaint on this score . It is no mark of good neighborhood , of kindness , or of courtesy , that a man living in a slave State can not now , with any sort of safety , travel in the free States with his servants . On this subject , the legislation of the free States , within the last twenty years , has altered greatly for the worse . There used to be laws guarantying to the sojourner the possession of his property during his temporary abode or passage in a St ate , when there was no intention of residing permanently in the Commonwealth . He complained strongly of this unkindness , and alluded to circumstances that had occurred in his own family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found inadequate , he thought it was incu , nbent on Congress to ( 10 something to remove this subject of complaint by making the law more effective . But , said he , I do not think that the States , as States , ought to be responsible for all the misconduct of individuals , and the doctrines they propagate , unless the State itself adopts the doctrines . He then referred to the circumI stances under which Massachusetts repealed 1850. 325 // her laws for the restitution of slaves , and he considered it was an act of retaliation , because an agent of the State , Mr. Hoar , had been driven from Charleston , whither he had gone to protect the rights of negroes from Massachusetts , whom she regarded as citizens . After making a remark or two on the last resolution , Mr. CLAy sketched a history of the Missouri compromise , and of the agency he had had in effecting that important measure . Then , as now , the Union seemed to he in danger , and now , as then , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool reason and judgment to rule . He then drew a glowing picture of the growth and grandeur of the country-of its wonderful increase in population and in all the elements of power , and of its successful wars . " Sir , " he said , " our prosperity is unbounded ; nay , I sometimes fear that it is in the wantonness of that prosperity that many of the threatening ills of the moment have arisen ; there is a restlessness existing among us which I fear will require the chastisement of Heaven to bring us back to a sense of the immeasurable benefits and blessings which have been bestowed upon us by Providence . At this moment-with the exception of here and there a particular department in the manufacturing husiness of our country-all is prosperity and peace , and the nation is rich and powerful , and if it does not awe , it commands the respect of the powers of the earth , with whom we come *n contact . " He then pointed to the history of the great public measures of the country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation ; and the three great acquisitions of territory , those of Louisiana , of Florida , and of Texas , have almost wholly redounded to the benefit of the South . The South have no reason to complain , as they have constantly been the gainers , and now , after all this , " I put it , " said he , " to the hearts of my countrymen of the South , if it is right to press matters to the disastrous consequences -- extending to a dissolution of the Union-which have been indicated , on this very morning , on the presentation of certain resolutions 3 " If the Union is dissolved , for any existing cause , it will he because slavery is not allowed in the ceded territories , or because it is threatened to be abolished in the district of Columbia , or hecause fugitive slaves are not restored to their mas*ers . If the Union is dissolved , can you of the South carry slavery into California and New Mexico 3 You can not dream of such an occurrence . Are you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escapes now , hundreds and thousands would escape , if the Union were dissevered . War and dissolution are identical and inevitable , if the Union were dissolved by mutual consent , still war would follow in less than sixty days , ( in consequence of the border difficulties respecting fugitive slaves ) in every part of this now happy and peaceable land . it was his opinion that , in the event of a separation , we should begin with at least three distinct Confederacies-one of the North , one of the Southern Atlantic slave-holding States , and a Confederacy of the Valley of the Mississippi ; and , subsequently , there would be many more growing out of these . He concluded his speech in the following patriotic and thrilling strain " Sir , I have said that I thought there was no right on the part of one or more States to secede from the Union . I think so . The constitution of the United States was made not merely for the generation that then existed , but for posterity-unlimited , undefined , endless , perpetual posterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every State that has since come into the Union , came into it binding itself by indissoluble bands to remain within the Union itself , and to remain with in it by its posterity forever . * * * " Mr. President : I have said , what I solemnly believe , that dissolution of the Union and war are identical and inevitable ; that they are convertible terms ; and such a war as it would be following a dissolution of the Union ! * * * " Look at all history-consult her pages , ancient or modern-look at human nature ; look at the character of the contest in which you would be engaged in the supposition of war following upon the dissolution of the Union , such as I have suggested ; and I ask you if it is possible for you to doubt that the final disposition of the whole would be some despot treading down the liberties of the people  --  the final result would be the extinction of this last and glorious light which is leading all mankind , who are gazing upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty which prevails here will sooner or later be diffused thoughout the whole civilized world . Sir , can you lightly contemplate these consequences ? Can you yield yourself to the tyranny of passion , amidst dangers which I have depicted in colors far too tame , of what the result would be if that direful event to which I have referred should ever occur 3 Sir , I implore gentlemen , I adjure them , whether from the South or the North , by all that they hold dear in this world-by all their love of liberty-by all their veneration for their ancestors-by all their regard for posterity-by all their gratitude to Him who has bestowed on them such unnumbered and countless blessings-by all the duties which they owe to mankind  --  and by all the duties which they owe to themselves , to pause , solemnly to pause at the edge of the precipice , before the fearful and dangerous leap is taken into the yawning abyss below , from which none who ever take it shall return in safety . " Finally , Mr. President , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven can bestow upon me upon earth , that if the direful and sad event of the dissolution of this Union is to happen , that I shall not survive to behold the sad and heart-rending spectacle .
