txt KINGS AND COMMONS . " THERE 'S A DITINITY DOTTI IIEUGE A IiING. '  - -  SITAKS. fox populi vex i . EVERYBODY , that is , every newspaper and magaziuc body , reviews European affairs after some fashion or other , and what everybody reviews , probably everybody reads . It is a fine thing , too , when you desire to let off a smart thing , or a witty thing , or an ill-natured thing-and , by the way , somebody says the three are the same thing  --  to be able to fire away at folk who are so far off that there is no danger of their shooting back again . With what a charming philosophy we can consider of a revolution in France . The slaughte of several thousand // people three or four thousand miles off , affects one 's nerves no more than killing a caterpillar nearer home . The ruin of empires , changes of dynasty and policy , war , pestilence and famine , afford us rather an agreeable recreation , and produce no more than a pleasurable excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , when you do not happen to be one of them ; so easy to prescribe the remedy , when you have never been prostrated with the disease . Shoot a few people uf town , call out our invincible militia to quell a riot , and all the influences of poppy and mandragora will fail to bring a quiet night 's rest to half the worthy citizens of the town . Their pillows will be " a watch-case and a common larum bell " for a month . Every whooping urchin in the street , or sudden gust of wind , or stroke of the fire-bell , starts them to their feet , and all the old ladies within a mile of the place where the terrible occurrence took place , are morally persuaded that half the population of the city are waiting to pounce upon them in their unprotected weakness , and have no other object in life than watching when Biddy leaves the basementdoor open , that they may rush in , massacre the whole family in their beds , and pocket the silver spoons . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two across the water ; flog twenty or thirty Italian women or so to death ; starve half a million of Irishmen ; decimate the population of ilungary ; quarter the combined armies of rampant absolutism on the quiet citizens of Germany , to eat them out of house and home , and turn them , fleeced to the skin , beggars upon the world ; burn up San Francisco two or three times a year ; exhibit the ravages of the pestilence which walks at noonday amongst the " still vexed Bermcethes , " or any amount of such little bagatelles , and " nature 's soft nurse " does her duty untroubled . We are reluctantly forced to the conclusion , a very strange one , indeed , to come to in New-York , that the world is selfish , positively selfish-in fact , " we say it boldly " - it 's a selfish world as well as a mad world , my masters . And having arrived , by a severe process of ratiocination , at this startling conclusion , we give a slight review of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and arranging the shifting scenes of the drama now enacting upon that mighty theatre , was the contrast between our own institutions , and those against which the mass of mind and matter is there heaving and surging up , sometimes with strange inarticulate murmurs - sometimes with wild and almost despairing curses ; but always with the evidences of a sombre and settled resolution , today , // to-morrow , sooner if it may be , later if it must , to change the old relationships between the governor and the governed ; to limit the course of governmental authority to its proper channels , and prevent it from overflowing its banks , and sweeping away whatever opposes the wild fury of its waves . Trite , perhaps , as the observation may be , the glorious distinction we enjoy , the pride and gratitude with which we ought to remember it every moment of our lives , was brought home to us with unusual force by a sentence or two *f Daniel Webster 's , descriptive of the unique and distinguished position which we occupy among the nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , and we can imagine the glow of mingled happiness and pride with which an American gives utterance to such words : " Who among you is there at this moment who would exchange his political or social condition for that which is enjoyed by the inhabitants of any other country under the wide scope of the canopy that is over us ? Where would you go with satisfaction ? No ! You would stay at home with satisfaction , under the institutions of your country , with satisfaction . You would enjoy that political power which is so universally disseminated , when a popular principle , with satisfaction and gratification . For here , every citizen feels that he is man ; that , if he is one of the governed , he is also one of the governors ; that he has a voice in every great transaction of public policy or national concern ; and let others say what they will , commend what they please ; let them like either a mere royal , a mere despotic , or a mere democratic constitution of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , we are satisfied with our condition as people of the United States , living under a free , popular and glorious Representative Government , which makes us one all over the world . " Who , indeed , would exchange this fair mountain of American liberty for the waste and barren moor of European turmoil , and war of caste and orders ? Yet , perhaps for that very reason , perhaps from the mighty contrast offered by the conditions of the old and new worlds , Americans take a peculiar interest in European affairs , and so , what Prussia is doing or undoing ; what England and France are not doing ; and what Austria and IRussia are attempting to do , all the American world either knows , or imagines it knows . Their embassies and conferences , and general grand sham of diplomacy , deceive no one . One thing we see clearly from our point of view , and that is , Absolutism and Democracy are in the field from one end of the old world to the other . Which will conquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nationalities destroyed , either way . In all probability they must and will be . But which will conquer ? Let us look over the great battle-field ofjarring interests , hostile elements , and national jealousies from that // point of view which none but Americans can as yet command . In the middle of the battle-field towers up to heaven the fair mountain of equal rights . The struggle is to obtain possession of it . On it we Americans can seat ourselves , truly " alone in our glory . " The nations which have been battening on the moors of prescriptive feudality , or sinking in the all-devouring quagmire of divine right , are looking to it as the holy mountain ; panting to taste the waters oozing from the clefts of its rocks , and repose in the shadow of its majestic trees . But the cannon of absolutism is in position on its first slopes ; and all around its base the veterans of an hundred campaigns against human liberty and progress are drawn up-grim and silent at their batteries . The first desperate effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , has been frustrated . The smoke of the cannonade yet hangs over the field or goes slowly floating away upon the wind . The carnage has been terrible on both sides ; but discipline has retained its position , after a desperate contest , and mere enthusiasm and heroism is repulsed with loss . Absolutism holds the base of the bill yet ; but the attacking force has fallen back gloomily-defeated , but not altogether demoralized . By mutual consent a kind of truce has been struck up , whilst either side buries its own dead . Looking from the hill-top , what appears to be the wiser counsel for the army of the people to follow-peace , or war ? The advocates of peace say , judging from the failure of this grand attack by the combined peoples-army of Hungary , Germany , Italy and France , upon the position of absolutism , the chances against success are too great for wise men to venture a further expenditure of life and material of war upon another attempt at this time . iRevolutionary success is always problematical , revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonistic to sudden changes ; it is a trade spirit , and whatever breaks up the ordinary course of trade and interchange of commodities is hostile to it . It may be , after all , a transition only from one form of despotism to another . The body is too weak for further blood-letting . It requires stimulants  --  a change of diet rather than active medicine . Food , organization of labor , division of profits , social reform , rather than saltpetre , increase of burdens by war , and new political machines built out of old elements , and novel in nothing but the form . These are the main heads of the peace argument , and socialistic suggestions . We shall not stop to examine them in detail . That has been already done an hundred times over , and an hundred times better than we can do it . To the latter argument , however , we // have always thought humanity itself presented the reply , and that , before the world can be re*$rganized upon principles altogether new , human nature must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will , you canassociate only their bodies . Before perfect justice and an equal division of the profits of labor can become the rule of human association , the heart of man must be changed . So long as thrift is stronger in one man than another , one man will make more than another ; and so long as avarice or the pride of superiority are qualities of the mind , the man who gets will keep what he gets . The biblical law of love , of doing unto others as we would they should do unto us , is one which will only universally obtain when all men shall be imbued with the spirit of him who enjoined it . It is not to a re*Irganization of labor , then , that Europe can look as the panacea and succedaneum for the healing of its nations . That which is possible , that which alone can open and smooth the way to a successful reconstruction is the education of the masses . We do not mean by this an education beginning with the A-B-C 's , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masses in the principles of constitutional and well-regulated liberty , by which the spirit of mutual confidence is made to enter into every man 's form of thought , moulding it , and so shaping the masses ultimately into durable and happy communities . To this end their first defeat , from which they are yet smarting , will conduce powerfully . Our security is based upon the fact that it would be impossible to raise an army in this country to operate against the people ; the material for it is wanting . An American may be illiterate in every thing else , but in one thing he is always educated-he knows his rights-he is always , to some extent , a constitutional lawyer ; he can not be made a machine nor will not blindly obey . This is the education which men must have in the old world before they can redrganize upon new principles , or recombine in new proportions . Obedience even to what they detest or distrust is a life-long habit , and when they break away from it for a moment , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from school . They have no confidence that any of their comrades will sustain them in their rebellion , and creep to bed at night to dream of a whipping on the morrow , instead of laying plans for a new course of independent existence . So soon as the men of the old world throw aside " isms , ** and schemes for making angels of human beings-of turning nations into workshops to manufacture new creatures without frailties or vices , out of the very poor raw // material at their command-they will begin the work of education for the possible and real , instead of wasting their energies on the impossible and fantastic . Their schools must be the bar , the pulpit , the press , the cafe , the theatre-in short , wherever men meet and operate upon each other . The interchange of opinion must beget a common thought-that thought will be the true reconstruction . That thought will be beyond the power of bayonets to repel , or absolutism to repress . It may be commented on by the mouth of cannon , preached from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it will be irresistible in the end , and carry conviction to every heart . That thought will be the great idea of true republicanism - the right of every man to do as he pleases , so long as he does not interfere with the same right in any other man . The whole theory and practice of free governments and human happiness , is contained in that simple formula . Paris , that charming city which retains so many agreeable memories of the Regency ; where life is a gambler 's stake , played with desperate sangfroid upon any card , and a shrug of the shoulders answers all the reproofs of Solomon-Paris. above all , is not the place from which to expect the dawn of the true Republican era for Europe . With such social elements as hers , out of which to combine it ; with such principles governing , or rather undermining it , la belle France , beautiful but meretricious , may ogle Liberty , and coquette with Republicanism , but they will never make a match of it , or if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a joining of hands , not hearts , with little comfort in the present , and less hope for the future . A constitution and frame of government , to e stable , must grow up out of the daily life of the people ; it must be built upon a foundation laid deeply in their history , and constructed , piece by piece , from their necessities developed from age to age . It becomes thus not only an existent objective reality , a thing seen and felt in its operations , and submitted to from habit and necessity ; but it is " the outward and visible sign " of the habits of the people 's mind . Every American , and every Englishman , thinks law , lives law , and teaches law to his children . lie may not talk learnedly of it , or be able to expound its principles ; but he knows that the great system called law , and making up the constitution of a free country , has been hammered out and shaped , little by little , from the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmen . He knows how this right was won ; and how that truth was fixed , like a bright jewel in the handle // of the sword of justice , to " light the passage of the blade " constantly to fresh victories . The traditions of his family , all look back to some one of his name who contended for , or was successful in establishing a principle . His fireside talk to his children is of constitutional rights . A policeman , therefore , can do in London or New-York what a file of gens d'armes would fail to do , nine times out of ten , in Paris . A true and durable republican constitution is a grand epic , written by a nation of God-fearing men . Republicanism is , in fact , not only a kind , but a high development of Christianity . Therefore , G-uizot is right when he accounts for the sudden success and harmonious operation of a republican form of government on this continent . " The United States , " he says , " composed a new society  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as in denomination . At the same moment they were quarreling with their king , they lived humbly in the sight of God , the king of kings . " The idea of our Republic was not struck out in the salons of a Countess , or the ante-chamber of a minister . Matteson 's picture of " The First Prayer in Con0ress , " is a key to the whole mystery . This is not a new discovery , by any means , and yet one would think it were , to hear the world wonder why that great and holy thing , a government of equal rights , is not created at once out of such materials as exist upon the continent of Europe . In short , the whole thing reduces itself to this : the false nobility of title , and the arrogance of prescription , may support a throne but only the God-inspired principles of truth and virtue can form a basis broad enough and strong enough to sustain the superstructure of a republican government ; and the old world must unlearn almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught to believe in , before it has any chance of success in its imitation of the new . For , how can men in masses safely assume the power to frame and wield a government , that power emanating from and delegated by themselves , when they could be made neither to appreciate nor understand its theory or practical application . Men have been by the policy of arbitrary rulers kept too long ignorant and enslaved , and until that ignorance and that spirit of subjection have yielded to the lights of experience and education , and beneath a system of privileges gradually extended , there will , we fear , be no permanent free governments that shall constitute the greatest good of the great mass of a sovereign people . IRevolutions prematurely made with a view to this end , result in certain defeat ; or if they gain a temporary // success , want the great requisites of stability . It is knowledge that gives power ; and where knowledge is in the hands of a few only , the power must , as a general rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of all arbitrary governments , from Egypt to the present day , to enlighten the few instead of the many . A few instruments despotism may trust and control-it would be trampled on by the many , if you dare to give them light . We fear , then , that apart from any external influences that have been brought to bear , the great movements that have convulsed Europe have been too sudden , and were premature . There was a want of enlightenment , a want of union , and of a single , resolute purpose . There was no adherence to one great united cause . It was not wide and universal . Jealousy and dissatisfaction have nothing to do in the breasts of men who struggle for great free principles . And yet all the Italian States acted under these influences . Had they adhered faithfully to the league under Charles Albert , they might have achieved their liberties , and banished their oppressors for ever from their soil . But they returned with a recre ant spirit to a voluntary servitude under their former rulers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German States . The action was but partial . The banner of freedom was raised on the walls of their cities . It never floated over the broad fields of their country . The poorest peasant clung to his native hills and plains , regardless who was at the head of power , and who was striking a blow in the defence of his natural rights . It was not the mass that moved . We contend , then , that the cause for which men have struggled , failed , because they require to be more enlightened in order to estimate freedom aright , and wisely to wield the power which it confers on them - because that power , if not rightly understood at first , is invariably apt to be abused  --  and that abuse , which has led to present incalculable evils on the soil of Europe , has given great force to the reUctionary party , which is now in the ascendant . But thrones have not yet ceased to tremble . It is but the beginning of a mighty end . Men have not bled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds of liberty have been wide-sown throughout the world . Men have learned to feel that they were not born to be slaves . And kings have not yet learned the lesson that the only safe way to maintain their own rights , is to respect those of their subjects . Armies will not be always , perhaps , the tools of their arbitrary will . Already , indeed , the tone of some rulers is softened  --  the charters of men 's rights , now being framed , or existing , are enlarged . // Hungary , brooding over the stern and rapacious rule of Austria , and her violated faith , will not slumber for ever amid her wrongs . Throughout Germany and Italy is an underswell of large , and generous , and noble thought , that will yet ride triumphant through the storms of some revolutionary era . And we doubt not , that amid the footsteps of his fiery tread upon the soil of nations , may be traced the hand of the Most High , pointing to the regeueration of man , and the blessings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are antagonistic , will express the mingled feelings to which , therefore , a careful consideration of the state of Europe gives rise : Despair-Hope . Despair for the present . Hope for the future . Hope lives eternal in the human breast . Pardon us the horrible quotation , horrible for its triteness ; but here , if anywhere , or ever , glorious for its consolation and its truth . " Out of this nettle danger we pluck the flower safety . " Out of that dull poison of despair must come , in the great providence of God , the healing balm of hope . It is not astonishing that the action of those j ust souls and true , who believe ever in the heavenward march of human destiny , whose faith , an eternal spark of fire from the altar of the Highest , neither common nor uncommon storms can quench , should be slow to act in Europe . Men have to think out slowly and with great labor there , what , in our new world is ready to their grasp ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into action and made tangible ; at once a part of their household words , and their daily business . The word Democracy , separated from its mere local party meaning , startles no one here . It does not mean men maddened by grievous wrong and oppression to the committal of wild excesses . The people is not a term of terror . The might of the people , instead of barricades and pikes , means law and custom . Every American is necessarily born into the world a Democrat , in the European and Greek sense ; a believer in the People ; one of them-bone of their bone , flesh of their flesh . We have , therefore , to resort to other names to distinguish our local political differences , since it would be as false for any one party to claim that they are the People , the Democracy , in the European sense of the term , as it would be for them to claim that they were all angels and their opponents all devils . In Europe , however , the great line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The People or the Kings . One or the other must be chosen by all . There is no middle ground now to stand upon . The farce of constitution- // 205 ality has been played out to a most lame and impotent conclusion . Sober , steadfast , earnest , but conscientious people , thereiore , are for a while paralysed . Their sympathies are with the people ; which is little more than saying they sympathize with themselves-their memories with the kings . Democracy there , is incomplete , in a great part , inconsequential ; not free from much absurdity ; and , like all very young things , heady and disposed to rush away towards strange and startling , if not suicidal extremes . It is natural , therefore , that the solid middle classes should hold off from it , and stand aside , rather spectators than actors in the drama , which yet , after all , involves them in its consequences as deeply as the highest and the lowest . To us who , however we quarrel in newspaper or speech , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men or measures , stand upon the same proud plat-4 ? form that " all power is from the people , " and all officers , from the President to the town-crier , the servants of their sovereign will ; it is hard to understand how a state of society can continue where this principle is denied ; hard to understand how any number of state 's prison inspectors , magniloquently called kings and emperors , and their uniformed bands of military turnkeys , can keep whole nations and continents locked up . It is true old IDekkar says : " An the world 's a prison : Heaven the high wall about it ; sin the jailor . And certainly kings are sin 's deputies. ; and the prince of the powers of the air is a close connection of earthly princes but the balance of power , physical and moral , appears so great on the side of the millions , that we can not get it into us , how the units manage to overawe them ; how it is that the prisoners do not change places with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is difficult for us to understand how such an anomalous state of things continues to exist in Europe , is it difficult for the best minds there to understand the existence of an universal Democracy upon this continent . They have so long been accustomed to reason down from government to the governed , that they have no logic by which to reason the governed up to the dignity of governing . Time will , however , do it for them . There breaks the light of hope through the almost universal night of despair now brooding over the continent of Europe . The sprint , can not be forced back much further . It must recoil . It is not in the nature of humanity that // such a state of things should be permanent . Look at it for a moment . Europe awoke from her lethargy . Everywhere she rushed to the battle-field and the forum . Everywhere words of energy , of faith , of hope , resounded . Everywhere men said to each other , Let us stand up in the full stature of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to live as immortal men should live , or die as brave men shoulQdie , when hope deserts them , and their testimony to truth and right can be sealed only with their blood . Alas ! everywhere the deep-ranged artillery of Absolutism crashed through their ranks . The fire was too hot . The people broke , and fled crouching from its storm of iron hail . Only here and there stood up a few for whom death had no terrors , and so it passed them unscathed and unterrified , and left them looking over the bloody field with a calm and holy sorrow . Perhaps the noblest of them all looked his last ( for a time only let us hope ) upon the shores of the Old World , from the deck of the Mississippi . Then commenced , and still continues , the jubilee of tyranny ; the saturnalia of kings . A pigmy and a counterfeit ; a despicable copy of despicable models ; a prince-president , mounted on the shoulders of the French Republic , plays the old man of the sea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third . The press is gagged ; the writers imprisoned ; every respectable paper fined or seized ; public opinion scorned ; all rights trampled on ; all safeguards broken down ; all principles confounded in one overwhelming tide of infamy and proscription . Who believes in the eternity of this ? Not we . Will not Louis Napoleon 's fine state sword , which he flourishes so grandly , spite of himself ; be like the skilful surgeon 's knife , and , cutting beyond the . wound , " make the cure complete " ? If the actual cautery of the Bonapartist government in France do not heal her divisions , and bring the factions to their senses ; if it do not sow the seeds of the Republic in the blood of its martyrs , then , indeed , it will be vain to hope , vain to believe in the capacity of Frenchmen for self-government . The Rutssian Bear ceased to conceal his claws . He determined to embrace all Europe in his hug of death . He said so broadly , by enormous levies of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England and France , a monstrous and unnatural league , combined against him . Sebastopol fell . Peace ensued . But for how long ? The renegade king of Prussia disarms the Landwehr , the last shadow of a popular army , and surrounds his throne with mercenary bayonets . Ferdinand of Naples offers holocausts of victims , forty-six at a time , to the Moloch // of reiiction . Deputies , ministers , ambassadors , clergymen , mingled their blood with the unrecorded carnage of the common crowd . " Lords , rich in a dozen paltry villages ; Strong in some hundred spearmen Only great in that strange spell  --  a name , " haul men and women , from St. Petersburg to Naples , to prison and to death , without even the farce of a trial , and for the sole crime of not believing that kings are God 's vicegerents in this honest world of ours . Volumes might be filled with tales beside which the " Newgate Calendar " would be a book of pious meditations ; all acted by crowned cowards , and suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despair ; but here also is the Hope . The farce of constitutional royalty is over . The curtain fell on it when FrantzJoseph lighted his Austrian pipe with his own statutes . Between the throne and the hovel is nothing now but bayonets ; preaching to the poor the gospel of cold steel , and kingly charity of hemp and dungeon . . No one any longer deceives himself . Henceforth Europe must be either Republican or Cossack  --  the veritable barbarism of absolutism must repress , or IRepublican freedom loose her . The dark ages must return with added gloom and terror ; or the millenium of liberty must burst everywhere in light  --  the morning of a new day of promise to the world . Is it doubtful which will be the issue ? Can it be conceived that the nineteenth century can turn backwards , and learn its lesson from th&amp;*twelfth ? Who believes it ? There is more hope than sorrow in these crimes of kings . lit is necessary that freedom should be baptized in blood . There are men yet living amongst us whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have half forgot , in our prosperity , how terrible was the offering ; and look with apprehension at another hemisphere just entering on a like experience . We ought rather , remembering our own fortunes , to see with hope the excesses of tyranny , since the sharpness of the medicine is the best guarantee of the absoluteness of the cure . We say , therefore , that to us the word of the European enigma is-Hope . And so-hoping ever-we bid farewell to our review of the state of Europe .
