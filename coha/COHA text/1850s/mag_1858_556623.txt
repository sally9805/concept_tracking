A MORE interesting work than the Memoirs of Count Miot it has rarely , we think , been the fortune of the public to meet with . It is not only the register of the first Napoleon 's progress towards supreme power , kept by a man who , if he was not an ultra Bonapartist , was a determined anti-Royalist , and served Bonapartism ; but it shows how the Bonapartist element works out its ends , and may serve as a perfect explanation of much that is now going on in France , and of what Louis Napoleon has planned and executed since he returned to the country he now governs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we recollect , these souvenirs of Count Miot are the first genuine record given to the public of the actual conduct of Napoleon I. in the transition from the Republic to the Empire . The victor of Marengo and Lodi has hitherto been represented , even by those opposed to his ambition and to its later results , as almost forced by circumstances and by the // deplorable state of anarchy into which France had fallen , to perpetrate the coup dYtat of 18th Brumaire , and to give security to the country by a strong government . The version given by Count Miot is a different one , and from the beginning to the end he sees in Napoleon Bonaparte a resolute , and even a short-sighted usurper . When simply general of the army of Italy , Bonaparte formed with M. Miot an acquaintance which was fated to become more intimate with each succeeding year , and to transform the author of the Memoirs before us into an active agent of the Bonapartist policy , and into one of the constant objects of the favor of the new sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and the projects of the man than the following passage , which we can not refrain from giving to our readers entire . The date is the 16th of December , 1802 . M. Miot had just returned from a mission , intrusted to him by the First Consul , in Corsica , in describing which , by the by , he takes occasion to state the utter indifference with which the compatriots of Bonaparte saw his elevation to the Consulat a ' vie , and remarks , that , " if the Consul had had to do with Corsicans , instead of Frenchmen , his subsequent usurpations would not have been so easy . " The first thing that strikes M. Miot on his return to the country so recently shaken to the very basis of the social edifice by revolution , is the alteration in all the outward manners and customs of what he is not yet used to call a court , but which he can hardly find any other name for . " What a change within two years ! The old Royalist habits , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just begun to show timid signs of revival , were now to be observed everywhere , and as to any vestige of republican austerity , there remained no trace of anything of the kind . Brilliant liveries were to be seen in the streets , such as were the fashion in the days of Louis XV . No man now wore boots , or affected even a military garb . Silk stockings , shoes with buckles , dress swords , and hats carried under the arm , were as usual as before 1789 But the change was not only on the surface ; it was still more at the bottom of political life in France . The Tuileries and St. Cloud were no longer , as I had left them , the official residences of the first magistrate of a republic ; they were , to all intents and purposes , // the palaces of a monarch . Everything in and about them , the etiquette , the honors rendered to this and that person and to their wives , the existence of a household , - everything , in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and savored of royalty alone . " M. Miot 's chief friend , both at this period and later , was Joseph Bonaparte , the First Consul 's brother . Barely returned from his Corsican expedition , the first thing he does is to seek out Joseph ; and finding him , as he does , confiding and communicative as ever , he immediately imparts to him what his impressions are upon the striking change of affairs . He also expresses his astonishment at seeing so near a relative of the virtual chief of the state * placed in the comparatively insignificant post of a senator . But Joseph has no scruples whatever in enlightening his friend as to the " Dictator 's " character and plans . " You are utterly wrong in your estimate of what he is , " says the future Emperor 's brother . " You fancy that my indolence lies at the root of my obscurity ; but that is an error . I am all that I can be , or that he will let me be . The idea of dividing power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own death , is so hateful to Napoleon , that he is to the full as jealous of me as of no matter whom . Above all , he wishes the notion of his necessity to be so firmly adopted , that beyond him nothing shall be regarded as possible . He knows that he reigns far more by the force of that idea , than in virtue of his own capacity even , or of others ' gratitude . Believe me , if to-morrow an order of things was established such as that people could look forward to his end without terror , and rely upon the social and governmental edifice he had built up , my brother would no longer deem himself safe for a single hour . " - Vol . II . pp. 48 , 49 . This is a deeper view than has ever yet been presented of what may be called the Bonapartist policy ; and if it be the true view , which is not unlikely , it explains most things , not only in the career of the first Emperor , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been found so ambitious and so selfish , ( and in the case of Napoleon III . we must add , so pecuniarily necessitous , ) as to calculate in cold blood upon the * The Consul Bonaparte so evidently intended to be esteemed as such , that he had already isolated himself from the other two Consuls , who were confounded with inferior functionaries , whilst he alone had a court . von . Lxxxvii. - NO. 181. 37 // permanent enslaving and degradation of their country , as the means whereby to achieve their own personal aggrandizement , then , indeed , the principle of the Bonapartist policy stands clearly evident , its first failure forty-three years ago is perfectly comprehensible , and it is no less easy to predict what the probable result of the second attempt must be . This plan of abolishing all solid and stable institutions , and of putting a man in the place of a government , will , if we suppose it to be deliberate , give the key to the entire drama . The defenders of both the first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really national institutions , as the one perpetual and strong desire of the ruler in both cases ; and they assert that in both cases , too , the inability to establish these institutions was the bitterest disappointment possible , but that the fault lay , not with the sovereign , but with the people , whom they affirm to be " ungovernable , " and only to be " kept down " by brute force . But how , if M. Miot were in the right upon this point , and if the absence of any stable institutions in France were a calculation on the part of the Bonaparte race , - the policy by aid of which they could maintain dominion over the French nation ? It is certainly curious to observe what , in December , 1802 , M. Miot , a Councillor of State , a Bonapartist official , thought himself authorized to answer to his friend , when the latter revealed to him what he knew of his brother 's character and intentions . " He is a wonderful being ! " exclaimed Joseph ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ambition make me giddy . Be assured , he is not yet at the term of his undertakings . " " I am ready to believe it , " was Miot 's reply , " and I think I can see even whither he is tending ; probably to the division of all Europe between himself and the Czar , to the creation of two empires , and to the ruin particularly of Austria and England But , " he then adds , " I am anxious to know whether he is fated to be a founder of a regenerated order of things , - one of those men whose name , like C*esar 's , is meant through ages to be synonymous with a particular form of power ; or whether he will be simply one of those shining , useless meteors , that shoot across the sky , dazzle for an instant , and then , becoming extinct , leave the same darkness as before . In all the // great changes of rule , you must examine institutions as well as individuals . The real founders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found not only new but durable institutions , - institutions , the spirit whereof so freely answers to the wants of the larger number , that they subsist long after their founder has disappeared . Mere usurpers , on the contrary , simply overthrow the persons whom they happen to find at the head of government , and put themselves in their stead . These rarely have successors ; their rule dies with them , and die former rulers return . " Count Miot goes on to show how , in the first dawn of Napoleon Bonaparte 's prosperity , he clearly discerned whither his ambition was likely to lead him , and even foresaw by what disasters his glory was possibly to be purchased . M. Miot readily admitted that , by altering the institutions of France , and , above all , by giving them a more liberal and republican character , the First Consul might insure his own supremacy in the state , and transmit that remodelled form of power to his heirs ; but at once and stoutly declared , that if , on the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could have no chance of anything beyond a life-long reign " at most " ; and he added : " Lucky indeed if , in such conditions , Bonaparte can manage to make his authority endure as long as his life . " He avoids no argument to prove to Joseph that his brother is upon a totally wrong scent . " To conceive the notion of being king of France as were Louis XIV . and his successors , and of governing as they did , by the same arbitrary rule , surrounded b*r the same guards , flattered by the same courtier train , and requiring for his wife the homage reserved until now for the daughters of royal houses , - this is simply to put himself in the place of him who by hereditary right filled an hereditary throne ; this is simply to usurp . As to leaving such a royalty as this to his descendants , it is out of the question , and it is of no use to disguise the fact . Unless with a view to a great and radical change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the name of Bonaparte ; on the contrary , if it comes to a choice between the names merely of Bourbon and Bonaparte , the governing principles to be the same in both cases , there can be no doubt that the nation will not hesitate , and that it will take its old reigning family . " When it is remembered that M. Miot was not a Royalist , // that he had been a Conventionalist , and that he was attached to the fortunes of the First Consul by interest , this seems to us one of the most curious passages of the history of the last sixty years that we have had occasion to study . But not only was Napoleon 's usurpation of empire planned in 1802 , but he had , even at that early date , and when still under the influence of his passion for Josephine , retlected upon the possible necessity of a divorce from her , with a view to an heir ; and already he had thought of Russia as of the country where , for several reasons , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met . It was avowed in confidence to M. Miot , that , during his mission to Madrid , Lucien Bonaparte had for a moment been instructed to feel his way as to a marriage at some future period with a princess of the Bourbon race , but that this was speedily set aside , and the Russian project taken into serious consideration . Upon the observation made by his interlocutor , that " he wondered , in that case , at the honors the First Consul caused to be paid to his present wife , " Joseph Bonaparte 's answer was , " Why , do you not see , on the contrary , that he is accustoming people to the fact of his wife 's being treated like the wife of a sovereign , so that , if the day comes when Madame Bonaparte is succeeded in her place by some royally-born princess , nothing will have to be altered , and the house he marries into will have no objection to make on the score of etiquette ? " From the portrait given of the first Napoleon by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine that it is painted without any aim at artistic excellence , it would seem that never was a man more completely of his nation , more essentially and thoroughly Italian , with all the cunning , all the patience , and all the long foresight of his race . It would seem almost as though , from the moment of the eighteenth Brumaire , he had resolved to frame circumstances to his will , and not to let them influence his actions or his destiny . It is impossible , after reading M. Miot 's Memoirs , to retain any of the ideas which some Bonapartist writers have attempted to establish touching the necessity that existed for Napoleon 's conduct , and the law which the situation of France imposed upon him of restoring order to the country , of governing it // with " determined firmness " ( the periphrasis for despotism ) , and of recurring to monarchical forms , as to those best adapted to the genius of the people . All this is evidently a fiction . After his return from Egypt , Bonaparte found France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of affairs , but by no means anti-Republican , by no means indifferent to freedom , and perhaps , in fact , nearer than she has ever been since to the adoption of a true constitutional and representative form of government . All these symptoms he disregarded , and conceived a deliberate plan for subjecting France to his single and undivided rule . He did not even find the execution of this plan altogether so easy as has been pretended , and an attentive perusal of the two interesting volumes before us will suffice to prove that France was never the willing accomplice of her own enslavement , which she has been so often asserted and supposed to have been . Plots of all kinds , originated by men of every different shade of opinion , were at each instant discovered , and the life of the first Emperor was nearly as often threatened by assassins as is that of his nephew . Nay , one would almost fancy that the recent Orsini tragedy had taken for its model the attentat of 1801 , in which a Roman sculptor named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Miot says : " The First Consul was extremely uneasy at the notion of the public trial of these Italians , for he well knew that they would by popular opinion be transformed into heroes , and martyrs to liberty , as they were . " If the date of 1858 were affixed to these words , it would be as thoroughly in keeping with the events described as that of 1801 . But perhaps the most curious of all the episodes related by Count Miot is that touching the death of the Due d'Enghien ; and here , for once , we have the real and unvarnished statement of the direct participation of Bonaparte in what it has till now been the perpetual aim of his historians to represent as a dark drama , in which he played only an involuntary part . For the first time , we see the First Consul avowing , and almost congratulating himself upon , what he has done ! Count Miot has preserved to us the speech made by the tern37 * // ble Dictator upon the occasion of his presiding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bourbon prince . This is a document that is without price . The real reason that caused Bonaparte to make it was the general diffusion of a report that another prince of the exiled royal family was in Paris , hidden in the house of the Austrian ambassador , M. de Cobentzel . Coming suddenly one day to the Conseil d'Etat , he uttered to his " faithful servants " the following discourse , which M. Miot says he took good care to note down exactly on the very same day - " I am really at a loss to understand how , in such a city as Paris , in the capital of such a vast empire as this , such ridiculous reports can gain credence as that which has just come to my ears . How can it be credited that in this city there exists a Bourbon prince , that he is hidden in the house of the German Emperor 's ambassador , and that I have not ventured to seize him yet ? This is to know me but ill , - this is to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . XVhy , if the Due de Bern , or any Bourbon prince , were hidden at M. de Cobentzel 's , not only I would have had him seized , but I would , in one and the same day , have had him shot , and M. de Cobentzel with him . More than that ; if the Archduke Charles were in Paris , and had given refuge to one of the said princes , I would have done the same thing with the Archduke Charles himself . We are living in no times of sanctuary . ' Other ideas , in our days , animate the nations and governments of Europe Let not France remain in error : she will have neither rest nor comfort till the last of the Bourbon race shall be exterminated . I have had one of them seized at Ettenheim ; the Margrave of Baden made no objection to my laying hands upon him ; and , indeed , what political rights have those who in reality only contemplate , and plot , and pay for assassination ? And you come now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sanctuary , ' and what not ! What strange absurdity ! I repeat it , - this is not to know me . I have not water in my veins : blood flows there I caused the Due d'Enghien to be promptly tried , and executed , and I should fancy other *m*grJs will scarcely be tempted now to follow in his steps . He was judged by a court-martial , as he ought to have been , for he had borne arms against France . His death may atone in some measure for the interminable wars his house has entailed upon us . As for me , I will never make peace with England till she consents to the total expulsion of every Bourbon and every Jmigr6. " - Vol . IL pp. 153 , 154. // We think our readers will agree with us , that this is the very first time Bonaparte is brought before us as he really was , and in his true colors , apropos of the murder of the Due d'Enghien . The testimony of Count Miot , which is in every point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy as they actually were . We have before us here , sans phrases , the unscrupulous , hard-handed , ruthless , selfish policy of usurpation , which for some years put Bonaparte at the head of the counsels of nearly all Europe , to let him sink down at the end into far less than he was at the outset , and which , perhaps , when years are past , and the final moral of the tale is unfolded , may be found to have produced the ruin and degradation of France . It is curious to examine how far the Napoleon of our day revives , under paler colors , the schemes and combinations of his uncle ; but it is no less curious to reconstruct from two different works , whose authors could have had no possible knowledge of each other , the entirety of that uncle 's character as it really was . Count Miot was a very old man when he died , not many years ago ; he had lived through all the revolutions of the last half-century , and had learned impartiality from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colonel Charras , is a young man even now , has acquired his knowledge of the men of the past from documentary , not from personal experience , and is a hot , enthusiastic republican , wedded to those forms of government that shall call into play the largest portion of the living forces of the nation . He is the very opposite in all respects of Cotint Miot , yet his estimate of Napoleon I. is precisely that of the former . He arrives at exactly the same conclusions as to his character , the predominant features of which he holds to be hypocrisy and astuce . His book is perhaps the most terrible blow that has ever been levelled at the first Emperor 's reputation ; for it not only attacks the sovereign and the man ; it weighs and finds wanting the hero , - it reduces in an extraordinary proportion the value of the military commander . The title of Colonel Charras 's book is one that easily accounts for the dread in which it is held by the present government // of France , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing the frontiers . It is entitled , " History of the Campaign of 1815 , Waterloo " ; and it does severe justice to all parties , and forces into the ears of the French nation what its own puerile vanity and the manifest interests of its chiefs and leaders , of no matter what party , had hitherto disguised and carefully concealed from its mental sight . Colonel Charras has the courage and the honesty to show that the French army was beaten , and completely beaten , at Waterloo , - that Napoleon was vanquished by the Duke of Wellington , and this without any accident , or any surprise , or any chance , but from the simple fact of the superiority of the English army and it leaders over those of the opposite side , and from the genuine and intrinsic merit of the plans and combinations by which the " Iron Duke ' * met the all but insane fugitive from the island of Elba . It is the first , the very first time , that the real truth has been spoken by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time a French hand has had the courage to trace upon paper the confession of a national short-coming , the frank and sincere avowal that the success achieved on the 18th of June , 1815 , was due to the general England had put at the head of her army , and that the victory won by him was as legitimate in every respect as it was unequivocal , and to be contested only by the rankest bad faith . We need not waste many words to show our readers what was the necessary reception of this work by the reigning authorities of France . A copy of it was sent six months ago to the Tuileries , at the Emperor 's express desire , and for his particular inspection . He read the two volumes , and commanded that no one single copy of the book should be allowed to pass the frontier . This order was executed with more complete success than is usual in such cases , and it is generally believed that M. Thiers is the only individual in Paris who contrived to obtain possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perusal of it , the eminent historian at once declared it to be a production of unparalleled importance , and confided to his intimates that it would oblige him almost entirely to write over again the chapters he had // intended to consecrate to the " Disasters of the Hundred Days . " The book has not been more read since , nor less well watched ; nor has it been the subject of any review articles or newspaper criticisms . Silence and darkness have surrounded it . Yet , such is the force of an idea , such the subtilty of its essence , that the public is as well acquainted with the scope and the details of Charras 's work as though it had spelt out every word in it . What it contains has diffused itself in the atmosphere , and penetrated the public sense . It may easily be imagined that it has not been for the pleasure of complimenting England , that such a patriot and such a republican as Charras has undertaken to set public opinion right as to the campaign which ended in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies of his country is , as it were , incidental ; he discovers such and such facts staring him in the face , and to do homage to truth he states them as they really are ; but the chief object of the book is to prove that in the fight of Waterloo it was Liberty which gained the victory over Despotism , and that had Napoleon , instead of following out his own purely selfish aims , developed France as she was capable of being developed , and had he then called upon her to put all her really national strength , her really national " nerves and sinews " into the contest against the coalition and its armies , France would have gained the day , as would any free country the instant its freedom , its dignity , and its territory were in danger . It is easy to see that the same individual , the selfsame despot , the identical Napoleon sketched in 1802 by Count Miot , is painted as a finished and definitive portrait by Colonel Charras , in his Campaign of 1815 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count Miot complains that , instead of " institutions , " Bonaparte simply changed individuals , just so , in a military point of view , Colonel Charras accuses him of having seen only the fortunes of a man , where he ought to have seen those of a nation . " People have falsely grown to picture to themselves France , whole and entire , " he says , " where in fact there was merely an army and a man ; - a man whose military genius even had become exhausted by the many excesses of tyranny ; an army , numer // ically weak , deprived of its best resources by delays and inconceivable hesitations in the defensive organization , and , above all , deprived of its principal force by the hypocrisy and falseness of a policy the most odiously enervating to a country that can be imagined . " With what passed both before and after the supreme struggle of Waterloo ; with the alternate rhodomontades and discouragements of the " Hundred Days " ; with the base flatteries attempted upon the popular masses ; with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-despot after the Belgian defeat ; with his pitiably diminished attitude after the so-called Political Corps of the empire had thrown him off , and angrily desired him to abdicate , - with all this , many works have , within the last ten years , made us familiar . Above all , Chateaubriand 's " M6moires d'Outre Tombe , " and Villemain 's matchless " Souvenirs des Cent Jours , " have taught us how utterly unworthy of his early fame was Napoleon in the hour of evil fortune . But until now no one has had the courage or the desire to trace him to the very field of Waterloo itself , to that blood-drenched plain , where , by the completest de'route of modern ages , he paid the price of his ill-gotten , ill-kept power . Colonel Charras is the first to track him to the spot where he lost in a few short hours all the gains amassed in a life of ruthless , useless usurpation ; and he passionately , resolutely , inexorably hunts him to earth , nor leaves him till the capacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For military men , Colonel Charras 's book is incomparable , and of absolutely inestimable value ; for he has employed seven years of undeserved exile in amassing the details of whatever took place in the organization of the French troops , from the moment when Bonaparte left the island of Elba on the 20th of March , 1815 . Not a man or a musket escapes him , and , from the founding of a cannon to the purchase of a horse , he will tell you , from the official document , every single incident , however apparently trifling , that took place in the ranks of the imperial army exposed at Waterloo to the shock of the allied powers . As to calling in doubt One single statement of Colonel Charras , this is at all events impos // sible . It may be objected by some persons , that , for patriotism 's sake , he should not have shown facts as they really were . This may be a ground assumed by those who admit the possibility or the expediency of disguising truth ; but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly veracious , this is what it is impossible to attempt . He answers with documents in hand , and produces in his support the papers deposited in the archives of every war department in Europe , including those of Paris . Had there existed any chance of refutation , any way of cavilling at one of his statements , the hired scribes of the present Empire would have been set to work but too willingly , and have proved that Colonel Charras 's book is no more to be relied upon than so many others , the statements in which are mere subjects for discussion . But this resource has not been opened to the imperialist writers of France , and of the authenticity of Charras 's work no one has raised even the faintest shadow of a doubt . The book remains , as we say , the most formidable record at present extant of the selfish ambition , the culpable folly , and the at last glaring incapacity of Napoleon Bonaparte . We think there is no country upon the globe that will not read with interest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army under Bonaparte and of that under Wellington on the eve of Waterloo . " It was a brave army , " he says , speaking of the troops under the orders of the Emperor ; " but , whatever has been said to the contrary , it was not and could not be the equal of the armies that had preceded it in the recent annals of war . The formation of its brigades , its divisions , and its corps d'arm6e , dated from only two months before . The regiments had had no time to acquire any cohesive force , or any of that unity which is given to troops only by community of labors , whether in peace or war . In June of the preceding year all the regiments had been reorganized ; in December , a mass of men had been incorporated with them who had returned from furlough , or from the enemy 's foreign prisons ; in April and May , a fresh amalgamation of this same sort took place , and throughout the ranks mutation had been universally the order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers , had as yet had no time or opportunity of gaining anything in the shape of the so requisite knowledge of one another . This was a great cause of weakness , but it was // not the only one . Enriched and systematically corrupted by the prodigalities of the empire ; enervated by luxury and by enjoyment of ' all kinds ; worn out by twenty years of war , - many of the generals and chiefs would have far preferred the quiet occupancy of their fine hotels and ch6teaux , to the labors of forced marches and the inconveniences of the bivouac . They had tasted peace during one whole year , and they regretted its loss . Some amongst them had been rudely defeated in separate commands , and preserved the memory of their ill-luck . Others , shaken by the sad recollections of 1813 and 1814 , quite despaired of the issue of the war , when they compared the masses brought to bear by the coalition , and the weakness of the defence on their own side . All had remained brave and intrepid ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the foolhardy energy of early days . Many there were in whom the moral man was no longer fit to confront a disaster . " The soldier might still be said to have unlimited confidence in Napoleon ; but he was not without suspicion of his chiefs . Those very men , - he had seen them in less than a year pass with equal enthusiasm from the Emperor to the Bourbons , and from the Bourbons to the Emperor . Those courtiers of fortune , - he had heard them , in addresses , proclamations , orders of the day , without end , abuse the overthrown master , and adore the master who was for the moment victorious . It was impossible that the soldier should believe in the fidelity of these men to the imperial cause . He suspected them of plotting some monstrous treason ; and these same suspicions , vague , but persevering and irritating , had penetrated as much into the higher regions of the staff as into the inferior ones and among the privates . Suspicion was everywhere , and even the officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The moral state of the troops under Napoleon 's orders was , therefore , the worst that can well be imagined . Discouragement seemed the only reasonable feeling to their minds ; and of anything in the shape of the enthusiasm that animated them in the first days of Bonaparte 's career , there remained not a vestige . Now let it be remarked , that the peculiar sentiments by which Charras describes the men and officers of the imperial army to have been possessed , were those which every ensuing day tends the more to instil into the minds of the masses in France . Whether with generals or bishops , peers of France or senators , public functionaries or deputies to the legislative assembly of the moment , the cause of sus // picion must be everywhere the same , and in all divisions of the upper classes the same want of principle is on every side offered to the contempt ( we must use even this word , for none other is so proper ) of the lower orders . This ready passing from one power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavishly obeyed , this prompt adulation of what had been shrunk from when falling , - this eagerness to barter honor for gold , or rather to attach consideration to the whereabouts of wealth , - this has , since the period to which Colonel Charras alludes , been cited by the people of France , as often as a revolution of this or that species has come , to show the readiness of the so-called " leaders of society " to serve no matter what power , so long as that power could insure to its insfruments any material advantages . That this disposition to look with distrust upon the higher classes is now animating nearly the entire mass of the nation , is not to be denied ; but that its deleterious influence had already been at work in the army collected on the eve of Waterloo is , we think , a fact less familiar to general readers . Opposed to what he shows us to have been the very indifferent moral condition of Napoleon 's troops in June , 1815 , Colonel Charras draws a picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirable for its impartiality . " The allied army was by no means homogeneous . All the elements composing it had not the same value in a military point of view . Nothing is more evident . But the bad consequences of this were less than Napoleon had calculated . " The English troops were composed of old soldiers , almost all tried by the hard campaigns of the Peninsula , and proud of having delivered Spain from a foreign yoke , and of having , after six years of constant struggle , borne the British flag from the mouth of the Tagus to the borders of the Garonne . Those said six years had begun with uncertain fortune , but had ended by a long , uninterrupted series of successes , the battle of Vittoria crowning the whole as a sort of Southern Leipsic. " - Vol . I. Chap . V. p. 73 . " Full of confidence in themselves and in their commanders ; convinced that their generals were superior to ours , as Wellington , they believed , was superior to Napoleon ; actuated by that inflexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained in Wellington 's // severe school , these troops formed a corps d'Jlite in the widest acceptation of the word . " Passing in review the contingents furnished by the various courts of Northern Europe to this army which was about to fight the battle of Europe 's liberty against the direst tyrant of modern times , the writer of the work before us speaks of Prussia in the following terms - " The Prussian corps d'arm4e was the vigorous representation of nearly all the classes of Prussian nationality , and was animated almost to fanaticism by the love of country and of that country 's independence . In every Frenchman the soldiers of Prussia saw an enemy . Fatal results of Napoleon 's outrageous ambition ! These were no longer the soldiers of Yalmy or of Jena , cold and full of indifference for the quarrels of their king , easy to be defeated and put completely to the rout . The hatred of victorious invasion , the wounds of their country , had made heroes of these men . Beaten over and over , in action after action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had won the force to resist in their reverses . Two names and two dates were at the bottom o all their thoughts , - Leipsic and Paris . " Their officers and their chiefs shared all their passions as well as their enthusiasm , and inspired them with unlimited trust . Napoleon was wrong when he fancied that one Frenchman was worth two Prussians . Colonel Charras observes , that one cause for supposing that the allied forces might be vanquished by the imperial army was , that the former were under the necessity of submitting to two separate generals , whose character was as opposite as could well be conceived . He gives a slight and spirited sketch of Bliicher ; which done , he passes to Wellington , and we may fairly say that no one even in England has ever painted the British hero more fairly , more justly , more as he really was . It is not a matter of indifference for us , on this side of the Atlantic , that such a man as Wellington should be well understood . He is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefathers and of ours has mingled ; and unless we choose to forego our pride in our origin , which lies in that glorious old " Norse boat of ten centuries since , " of which Emerson speaks , we can not but take something to ourselves of all the real greatness of the greatest Anglo-Saxon of modem // ages . Charras 's portrait of the " iron man " is the prose of Longfellow 's " Ode " upon his death . Both conceived of him in identical form ; and , unless we revert to the Latin authors , we do not know of many better pictures of an illustrious man than this - " Wellington had never yet been face to face with Napoleon ; but he was the first - and by how far the first ! - of all the chiefs ever opposed to him . Napoleon , however , was determined not to recognize in him the qualities of a commander-in-chief . By describing him in the JJfoniteur as an ignorant and presumptuous officer , destined to great catastrophes ' ; by changing his victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France Yittoria , the INivelle , and other engagements disastrous for her fame , - the Emperor seemed to imagine that he had successfully lowered the English general to a second-rate rank and importance . " That there was a difference , a wide difference even , between the English general and Napoleon , is not to be gainsaid ; but it was far less wide than the latter chose to fancy , or than we have had any notion of ; misled as we have been by prejudice and falsehood . " Napoleon had the genius of war developed to the highest conceivable degree ; but the insensate ambition of the monarch destroyed the judgment of the tactician , and very often physical energy and activity failed the conqueror , and left him inadequate to the requirements of his position . " Wellington was perhaps , strictly speaking , but a general of great talent ; yet this talent was so complete , and was based upon qualities of such strength and intrinsic worth , that it almost attained to genius . Gifted with the extreme of good sense ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his country ; an excellent judge of character ; informed to the utmost of whatever concerns the profession of arms and war ; committing faults perhaps sometimes , but never persisting in them ; careful of his soldiers , sparing of their blood ; harsh towards indiscipline , implacable to theft ; ready to plan , and to execute readier still ; prudent or rash , temporizing or sudden , as the case required ; inflexible in evil fortune ; hard to be elated by success ; an iron soul in a body of iron , - Wellington , with a small army , had done great deeds , and this army , whole and entire , was of his own making . He had a right to remain , and he has remained , one of the first military figures of our age . Born in 1769 , he had , in 181* , like Napoleon , attained his forty-sixth year . " We hope our readers will agree with us , that the man who // can write of an enemy as Colonel Charras here writes of Wellington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements he makes . When we reflect upon the amount of national vanity wounded , of national prejudice inflamed , by the very name of Waterloo in France , we can scarcely find terms of eulogy sufficient to express our admiration of the uprightness , the sincerity , and the liberality manifested in Colonel Charras 's book . There is no man caring to know the real truth about one or two of the greatest events of our half-century , who ought not to find a pretext for attentively studying this extraordinary work . It is as full of information for Englishmen as for Frenchmen , and may most justly be denominated , in the favorite French phrase , un *v*nernent . M. Guizot 's Memoirs , in some respects , form the sequel to the two works we have just noticed ; for they treat of France as she was on the morrow after Waterloo . As yet , the first volume only has appeared of these iSouvenirs , which are , as a whole , to consist of five or six volumes . The space of time under consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Guizot prepared himself for public life , and might , had the moral part of his composition been equal to the merely intellectual part , have laid the foundation of a career infinitely more useful than his has been . He is one of the first writers who has described the condition of France during the struggle at Waterloo , and immediately after it . " There was no enthusiasm whatever for the Emperor , " says M. Guizot , " and there was small confidence in his success ; but no one attempted anything against him . Napoleon acted in full and entire liberty , and with all the force which he could command in his situation ; and considering the isolation in which he was placed , and the material and moral exhaustion of the country , France had become a whole nation of spectators , of tired and worn-out spectators , who had lost altogether the habit of interfering in their own affairs , and who really scarcely knew what issue they desired to the terrible drama of which they themselves were the stake . As to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of merely looking on ; and foreseeing neither how nor when the performance would end , I resolved in the very middle of March to start for Nimes , where my mother resided . I can see in my mind 's eye even now the aspect of Paris , - above all , of the Rue de IRivoli , which was just then half built . It comes back to me as I saw // it on the morning of my departure . No workmen ; no movement ; materials heaped up apparently without any object ; unpeopled scaffoldings ; half-raised edifices left unfinished ; the want of money , of workmen , and of confidence visible everywhere ; and , on all hands , the ruins of yesterday , - des ruines neuves . Throughout the ranks of the population was an air of uneasiness and anxious idleness , the air of those who are in want at once of both labor and repose . During my journey I everywhere saw the same thing , along the roads , in the villages , and in the towns ; everywhere were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the same impoverishment of the whole land stared one in the face . More women and children , on all sides , than men . Here and there troops of young conscripts , with sad faces , marching to join their regiments ; wounded and sick men pouring hack largely towards their homes , - a nation mutilated and at its last gasp . " It is impossible to read M. Guizot 's first volume of Memoirs without feeling that it bears most emphatic witness to the almost fathomless amount of mischief done to France by that modern Attila , Napoleon Bonaparte . If M. Guizot were alone in the putting forth of this opinion , one might feel that it required further confirmation , - a scrupulous respect for truth forming by no means one of the distinctive points of the ex-minister 's character ; but coming as it does in corroboration of what every impartial historian for the last ten years has affirmed , it deserves to be accepted as one testimony the more . " That man whose glory entailed upon us so much shame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and this coincides perfectly with the view taken of Bonaparte by M. Guizot . At the end of the chapter from which we have just quoted , the sometime leader of the Doclrinaires announces that he had hardly reached Nimes before a letter from M. Royer- Collard brought him back to the capital , where he was quickly named Secretary-General to the Abbe de Montesquiou , whom Louis XVIII . had raised to the dignity of Minister of the Interior . The following extract is well worth reading - " I did not hesitate under such conditions to take office . No prior engagement , nor any of my antecedents , bound me at all to the Restoration . I belong to those who were carried upwards by the impetus of 1789 , and who will not relinquish that position . But , : 3S * // though not holding to the ancien regime by any interest , I never felt any bitterness against the France of other days . Born a Protestant and a Bourgeois , I am devoted to the principles of the liberty of conscience , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great conquests of our social organization . But my confidence in these conquests is also very considerable , and I feel at my ease about them , nor believe that , in order to support them , I am at all obliged to regard the house of Bourbon , the nobility of France , and the Catholic clergy as dangerous enemies . " This passage is a really important one ; for it touches upon one of the principal causes of disunion throughout French society , which is no other than the uneasiness of possession felt by certain classes with regard to the social conquests of 1789 . If , once for all , Frenchmen would feel that there are some gains which can not be snatched from them , that there are retrograde steps which no government and no body of men in their senses would dream of taking , - if all Frenchmen aspiring to the name of politicians would , once for all , look upon this as a settled fact , and chase from their minds the insane alarm at incessant encroachment on the part of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding between all classes than has been done since the days of the first revolution . Here , in reality , lies the secret of the mischief , which begins in evil feeling and ends in 6nieute . Each party is , and has been all along , afraid of the intentions of its opponents , and , above all , the so-called liberals are haunted by the fear that the party of the ancien regime will seek to recapture some of its old privileges and worn-out abuses . There is no denying that a few individuals of the last-mentioned party do exist , whose absurdities are such , . and whose political incapacity is so glaring , that they would probably return to the monstrous immunities and oppressions of Feudalism , just as the ultra-Jesuit party in the Church would favor a revival of such practices as disgraced the government of certain Spanish kings ; but these - although there is no denying that they do exist - these are merely individuals , and , as we have said , a very few individuals , not to be counted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ridicule is the best arm against them , and to ridicule they ought // to be abandoned . But in France everything is a pretext for fear , and , politically speaking , a country more given over to terror does not exist . To act courageously , to make the stand a citizen ought to make when his rights are assailed ,  --  of this hardly one Frenchman within the last fifty years has proved himself capable ; but to tremble lest some one should do him some fantastic wrong , and to resist the best measures of the governing force because he so trembles , - this is a game in which every individual man in France is a proficient . At the present moment France is severely suffering for this identical " uneasiness , " at which M. Guizot hints in the passage we have above quoted . Had not men of the shallow policy and irritability of fibre of Messrs . Thiers , de R6musat , and some others , descried dangers of which there was not a shadow in the only national combinations for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , France would not be in her present enslaved and comparatively degraded condition . M. Guizot alludes to what is taking place now , as to what took place in 1815 . We will continue our quotation , as it is one of the best passages we know of in recently written history , so far as the Restoration is concerned - " Because full now of fresh elements , the social edifice of France is not fresh built of yesterday . France can no more renounce her past , than she can her present . She would most effectually establish in her own internal self the seeds of mischief , and indeed of eventual ruin , if she showed herself hostile to her own history . Her history is the nation itself ; it is the native country dear to every one , seen through the modifications of ages . As for me , I have always borne to names and facts that have held a great place in our national destinies a most respectful love . When Louis XVIII . returned , the Charter in his hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to enjoy our liberties , or , if necessary , to defend them , under the royalty of the ancient race of France 's kings , and in common with my countrymen of all classes , nobles or Bourgeois , even though their old rivalries were for some short time still a cause of agitation and distrust . " Foreigners ! les 4trangers ! the remembrance of them was the sore of the Restoration , and the nightmare which beset France while it lasted . The feeling itself was , doubtless , a legitimate one enough . The jealous love of their native soil , and of its independence , doubles the strength of // a people in prosperity , and saves their honor and dignity under adverse fortune . Had I been placed in Napoleon 's army as a soldier , I should probably have been insensible to everything , save to this one only point . Placed , as I was , in civil life , other ideas , other instincts , have led me to seek the greatness of my country elsewhere than in her predominance by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esteem before no matter what else , a just and upright policy , * and liberty under the safeguard of law . Of this I should totally despair under imperialism ; I hoped for both under the Restoration . " The most absurd of all unjust appreciations is that which would aim at making the Restoration accountable for the presence in France of those foreign armies which only the mad ambition of Napoleon had attracted into France , and from which the Bourbons could deliver us only by a prompt and certain peace . The enemies of the Restoration indulged upon this subject in contradictions the most absurd and strange . First , they said that the Restoration was imposed upon France by foreign bayonets ; next , that in 1814 nobody wished for it , foreigners no more than natives , exterior Europe no more than France herself . This party affirmed the Restoration to have been brought about by the smallest possible causes , and to have had no adherents save some few individuals of old and almost worn-out fidelity , or some sudden renegades from the adverse camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused the restoration of the Bourbons in France . Singular blindness of party spirit ! the more this or that party proves that no one , particular current or force established this rigime in France , the more the intrinsic , and as it were intimate , principle of vitality of the Restoration becomes evident , and the more it is clear that the Restoration was in virtue of a great and dominant necessity . I can not understand how really clever and superior minds can allow themselves to be so led astray by petty passions as not to he able to see things as they really are . In the crisis of 1814 , the recall of the house of Bourbon to the throne was the only imaginable , the only serious solution of the difficulties of the position , - the only one which rested upon principles , and made the future government independent of the sudden changes brought about by human caprice and the caprices of fortune as manifested in the various chances of war . " M. Guizot says with truth , that the two benefits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1848 , by precisely the reverse of anything like justice or uprightness in his policy , should venture upon this declaration , is assuredly somewhat strange . But M. Guizot has never thought it needful to adapt his actions to what he sets forth as his principles . // France longed the most , and which had the most signally failed her during twenty-five years , were liberty and peace . He is undeniably right when he says that these two advantages were amply secured to France by the government that succeeded the downfall of the empire at Waterloo . There is a remark made by M. Guizot which is as true as it is worthy of notice , and which records a fact that may have escaped many students ; namely , that with the fall of the traditional monarchy in France began the era of falsehood universal . The Convention and the IRepublic screamed out at the top of all their voices that France was free , and never at any period was she more enslaved ; for men answered then with their heads for displeasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save peace , and France was bled within an inch of death by ; var . " The Emperor Napoleon , " says MI . Guizot , " concluded , in fifteen years , more treaties of peace than any sovereign had ever before concluded . Yet never did war so often break out and begin anew ; and never was peace so completely a lie , or a lie of such short duration . All the treaties were merely truces , during which fresh combats were preparing . And this also was the story of freedom . Promised in the outset , and celebrated with enthusiasm , Liberty first fled before civil strife , but not without her praises being chanted all the same , and her existence being sworn to . One fine day , however , civil strife was said to he terminated , but liberty was found to be terminated at the same time . The word liberty had , at one moment , been sufficient to inebriate the nation , who took no trouble to verify the existence of the thing ; and at another moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were , the crime of intoxication , both the name and the thing were equally proscribed and sunk in oblivion . " Here , again , Louis Philippe 's ex-minister touches upon a point which is essential , and which the student of French his . tory should examine , - the facility that exists for the entire nation 's being governed in the name of a lie ! We do not believe that an example of this sort has ever been afforded by any country except France , or that any save a French government has ever tried the experiment of telling a whole nation the precise reverse of what in fact exists , and of expecting that nation to take the official word for what the // evidence of the nation 's own senses flatly disproves . Yet this was the system of the first Emperor , from Wagram to Waterloo . He had no belief in , nor respect for truth . He possessed in his own hands the communicating medium between the government and the public mind , and he fancied it depended upon him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . When fortune played him false , he either concealed the fact , or transformed it , or represented it in a shape exactly contrary to what had been its genuine one ; and taking the public apathy for acquiescence , he seriously believed he had fashioned the public understanding to his hand . He forbade any spontaneous word or movement on the part of the people , and then , when his fantastic announcements were received in silence , he thought that silence betokened approval , as though they who thus held their tongues had been free to dissent and criticise . Napoleon I. lived ostrich-like as to what regarded public opinion ; but he was one of the first who deliberately undertook to pervert the sense of truth in the mass of the French nation . Since then it has lost its respect for its rulers in its complete scepticism upon the subject of their veracity , and those who resort to falsehood do not see that the end they contemplate by their misstatements is never attained , and that the one only thing achieved is the degradation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people 's minds of any idea of credibility or honesty . An untruth is a dishonesty , and the government convicted of lying may be deservedly suspected of any amount of improbity . Emerson says justly , " The English value themselves on their truth , as distinguishing them from the French " ; and in another passage he observes that the " English are veracious ' * as from some " superiority in organization " and " as if they could afford it . " Now , it is exactly this strength produced by constitutional veracity that has been sapped in the French race by the mendacious policy of the Bonapartes , and it is one of the chief injuries their advent to power has caused to society in France . This is preeminently a tradition persevered in by the present Emperor ; and absolute falsehood , the systematic perversion of truth , may be looked upon now as a governing medium employed // by Louis Napoleon . The consequence is , that the idea of truth is nearly destroyed in the national mind , and through the neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has crept gradually in ; and what is termed in English " want of principle , " has grown to be the one leading characteristic of Frenchmen , whether morally , socially , or politically speaking . Perhaps the quality most to be noted in this first volume of M. Guizot 's Memoirs is the perfect impartiality of his tone towards the men whose names fall under his pen , or whose acts he has to appreciate . Louis Philippe 's minister evidently has a leaning towards the Restoration , ( which , since what has passed in France during the last twenty-eight years , is conceivable enough , ) and he takes good care at once to establish the fact , - so distasteful to the Napoleon family , - that the government of a Bonaparte is not , and can never be , anything save a phase of the Revolution . A very different work from either of those we have mentioned , and different as are all its author 's creations from those of any other man , is the " Richelieu " of Michelet . Rapid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the qualities of poet , painter , and musician , more than of a prose-writer or an historian . As we have remarked before , Michelet resembles Victor Hugo far more than any writer of his own immediate kind , and while reading his brilliant pages one longs for the harmony of rhyme , and feels that something is wanting to the completeness of the work . As yet , his volume upon Henri IV . remains the best of his historical series , and we do not anticipate that this new work upon the famous Cardinal will eclipse the admirable fantasia dedicated to the lover of la belle Gabrielle , which even Michelet 's enemies were obliged to admire , and to admit as a chef d'oeuvre of a portrait . The one chief obstacle to Michelet 's success as an historian is his bitter , deadly , irrational hafred of whatever belonged to the pre-Revolutionary history of France . He can see no grandeur , no beauty , in anything that precedes 1789 , and the consequence is , that , unless in particular cases , ( as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve his enmities towards royalty and religion , ) Michelet can never present the reader with a trustworthy picture of what the // acts , and , above all , the motives , of this or that king or statesman may have been during the centuries that elapsed before the Revolution . Set aside the erroneous appreciations resulting from this perpetual bias , and you have before you a series of chronicles almost as dramatic as the historical plays of Shakespeare , but in which History - statesman-like , matterof-fact History-plays nearly the same part that is usually allotted to her in works of fiction . Yet it is not erudition that fails Michelet ; on the contrary , he is perhaps more learned than most of his contemporaries , and in the matter of dates , for instance , has remarkable precision ; but it is the faculty of clear and direct vision that he wants , - he is constrained by prejudice , and distorts facts and men to his own private purposes . We would reproach him with having followed the vulgar notion of Cardinal IRichelieu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Richelien had to execute , how vast his plans were , and how judicious ( though he died before he could carry them out ) , - instead of admiring the genius that at a glance saw how the impending union of Germany under Austria by Wallenstein 's agency was to be prevented , and how ( by hard means , it is certain ) the internal unity of France was to be secured , - Michelet has been haunted by the phantom of Hugo 's tragedy of " Marion Delorme , " and every time he introduces the giant form upon his stage , you feel that he is pointing at it , and exclaiming , in tones of terror and disgust , " Voil* l'homme rouge qui passe ! " The picturesque element distracts Michelet , and he sacrifices everything to his mania for word-painting . He has succeeded in perfection , and there are pages of his before which one lingers in admiration , as before a Titian or a Tintoretto , the colors are so splendid , the draperies so ample , the expression and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , and has nothing to do with the stern record of the facts that were . Witness his Prince de Cond6 . If ever a man was born a hero , Cond6 was that man . Glory was his element ; he could not help being glorious and heroic ; it came naturally to him ; and the proof of its being so is , that to his qualities as a warrior he added all the other more tender graces of // character ; and his deep , chivalrous , pure passion for Marthe du Vigeau proves what was Cond6 's heart . Of this man , because he was a Bourbon and a prince , Michelet has been unable to prevent himself from making a type of arrogance , vanity , avarice , and littleness of all kinds . A more untrue picture than that drawn of Cond6 in this new work of Michelet 's has seldom been given to the public . " Richelieu et la Fronde " is an unsafe book to put into the hands of any save those whose historical opinions are already fixed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the most magnificently-colored historical romances it has ever been our fortune to peruse.
