ART . 111. - AARON BURR . The Life and Times of Aaron Burr , Lieutenant colonel in the army of the Revolution , United States Senator , Vice President of the United States , &amp;c . By J. PARTON , Author of " Humorous Poetry of the English Language , " and " Life of horace Greeley . " New York : Mason Brothers . 1868 . WE may as well concede at the outset , that the book whose title we have given , is a very readable one . We have no wish to deny to Mr. Parton great tact and skill in the art of bookmaking . His Life of Horace Greeley , ' published a few years since , gave ample evidence of his capacities in this line . Whatever faults that book may have , no one will dispute that it has been eminently popular . In every part of the land it has been read by eager minds , and we are not without hope that it has done more good than harm . There was much in it that was directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minds of the young  --  to kindle in them a sense of latent power , and to inspire them with high intellectual and moral aims . But there was also much that tended directly to unsettle the great foundations upon which that which is highest and noblest among men , securely rests . What the ultimate results of its influence may be , it would be difficult to determine ; but that it has been , and is , a popular book , no one will question . The same is true of the work before us . Mr. Parton has so managed the subject in hand , has made such skillful use of the materials within his reach , and has treated the whole in a style so fresh and glowing as to insure for his b*k a very large number of readers . And yet we can not think that there was any natural demand for a book of this kind . In the rapid movements of the world there are many themes which are constantly made ready for the hand of the professional writer . They come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attention and calling for his labor . But we have been utteily unable to // perceive what occasion there could have been for a new life of Aaron Burr ; least of all , one which , like the present , should be of the nature of an apology , or defense . We are quite sure that none of the numerous living members of that illustrious family to which Burr belonged , by his mother 's side , could have felt any sense of slight or neglect , because his name was not more familiarly before the public . We are quite sure that they . one and all , would have been very well content to have left their distinguished relative to take his chances with posterity , without any new letters of introduction . Time was quietly and gradually weaving a veil of forgetftilness around that in his life which might as well be forgotten , and it seemed quite unnecessary to disturb his renose . We have said that least of all was there any occasion for a book which should be of the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Col. Burr , in the year 1836 , appeared his biography , in two volumes , prepared by Matthew LDavis . Such a work was at that time naturally called for , and was , as we well remember , read with great interest and curiosity , and was for a time a leading topic of conversation and discussion in literary circles . That work was regarded as an ample apology for Burr . While there was evidence enough that Mr. Davis aimed at a truthful narrative , he was under as strong motives , as a writer could well be , to say nothing worse of the man than he was absolutely compelled to say . He had had for forty years , ( as he tells us in his preface , ) an intimate acquaintance with the subject of his memoir , and was selected by Burr himself as the man who should write his life . Frequent conversations had passed between them on this subject through a long course of years , in which Burr had enjoyed ample opportunities for giving his own construction to every important fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , Mr. Davis applied himself to the preparation of this book , every incident connected with the life of Burr stood out before his mind in as favorable an aspect as it would possibly bear . Moreover , the pitiable condition of Burr in the closing years of his life ,  --  the victim of disease , struggling against the most pinching poverty , an exile from society , those nearest and dearest to // him in this world cut off by untimely death ,  --  all this , viewed in contrast with the rapid and brilliant successes of his earlier days , naturally inclined the heart to mercy , and made it hard for any one , and especially for one so long his acknowledged friend , to speak harsh and cruel things respecting him so soon after the grave had closed over him . We may be sure , therefore , that Mr. Davis , in that work , meant to place the whole life of Burr before the public in as favorable a light as he could , and that he published nothing to his disadvantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrative . There can be no question , that if an enemy had had in his possession the papers which were in the keeping of Mr. Davis at the time of Col. Burr 's death , he could have consigned his name to everlasting infamy and shame . Mr. Davis , in his preface , frankly tells us , that just so soon as Col. Burr 's death was known , he , with his own hands , committed to the flames a mass of letters and copies of letters , which he had selected and kept apart for this express purpose , and which he had earnestly sought permission to destroy during Burr 's life , but could not obtain his consent . It is one of the strangest facts on record , that an old man , having reached the age of almost fourscore years , and trembling over the grave , should have so gloried in his shame ' as to preserve with such scrupulous regard all these records of his own and of others ' guilt , and transmit them , along with his other papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted the part of a true friend to Burr and a true friend to society when he destroyed those letters . Their publication , while it would have placed the chDracter of BulT in such a light that Mr. Parton , in the year 1857 , would not have been likely to try his hand upon a new biography of him , would have carried distress into many families in different parts of the land , and wrought only mischief in society . Mr. Davis tells us in his preface , that " No sooner had the newspapers announced the fact that the memoirs of Col. Burr were to be written by me , than I received letters from various quarters of the country , inquiring into the nature of the revelations that the book would make , and deprecating the introduction of individual // cases . These letters came to hand both anonymously and under known signatures , expressing intense solicitude for suppression . " We see that Mr. Parton is disposed to treat this whole sub ject of Mr. Davis and the destroyed letters very cavalierly in the thirty-fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloss over a matter of this kind , when there are so few persons living who of their own knowledge can positively contradict the writer . And so Mr. Parton , after giving evidences which , at the best , seem shadowy and uncertain , gathers courage to assert , that Mr. Davis was utterly mistaken as to the character of the letters to which he alludes . He received no letter8 nece8-sarily criminating ladies . ' Mr. Davis is dead and gone , so that he can not answer for himself iu this matter ; and Mr. Parton , we think , might reasonably presume that no one would appear who could , with positive knowledge , answer for him . A writer , however , in the Albany Journal ' comes forward and claims to be a competent witness . He has doubtless been moved to speak by this chapter in Mr. Parton 's book , though he does not directly tell us so . He says , " We feel it a duty to state facts within our own knowledge , which , but for a provocation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have publicly revealed . " His testimony upon the point before us is as follows : " During our long and close intimacy with the late Matthew L. Davis , and particularly while he was engaged in writing his life of Burr , we enjoyed confidentially the privilege at his house in Cherry street , of perusing the materials out of which the history was woven . The Confidential female correspondence ' was before us , with ' all its strange and startling revelations . We thought and felt then , as we think and feel now , that only a devil incarnate-some fiend in human shape let loose upon earth to scourge our race-could have deliberately preserved such evidence of his own perfidy , and of the frailty of others ; for many of these letters were written in bitter anguish , and contained scathing imprecations . Instead therefore of doing gross wrong ' to Col. Burr in this respect , Mr. Davis , by suppressing that correspondence , relieved the character of Burr from deep and general execration. " // All this is designed to confirm the statement we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend to Burr as a man could well be ; and that while he aimed at an honest and truthful narrative , so far as it went , it was his purpose in the publication of his book , to set the character of Burr before us in as decent a dress as it would possibly bear . We must think therefore that there was no occasion whatever for Mr. Parton 's book , and we will venture the suggestion that he was not in the first instance moved to write it because of any injustice done to Burr , or because he wished his true character to be better understood by his countrymen ; but because his life presented those strong and salient points , those strange and striking episodes out of which a biography could be wAtten that would sell well , and yield large returns ; and doubtless he has his reward . And yet Mr. Parton sets out with the assumption , that the true character of Burr has hitherto been in a great measure concealed and unknown , and that it is reserved for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says in his preface , respecting Mr. Davis ' work- " the story of the man 's life is not to be extracted from these volumes , for the simple reason that it is not contained in them . " And again of all the other principal publications which treat of this subject , " they leave Aaron Burr at last , to the consideration of the reader a baffling enigma . " And again , " so superior is spoken to written language , that a few hours close conversation with people who were really intimate with Col. Burr , threw just the needed light upon his character and conduct , which ransacked libraries had failed to shed . But for such conversations I should never have understo6d the man nor his career . " It is surprising what an infinite number of things that have never been comprehended before , have been found out by the brilliant minds of this generation . Matters of the most common-place and every day character , about which men have supposed there could be no mistake whatever , have suddenly been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions respecting them utterly exploded . The character of Col. Burr , it is claimed , was never understood // by his contemporaries . Thongh he lived a long and eventful life , and was for many years moving in the most conspicuous circles , where he was the observed of all observers , it seems to have been reserved for a man twenty years after his death , putting together the things which he had found out from conversation with those who had seen him in his lifetime , to construct a new character , and tell us exactly what sort of a man Aaron Burr really Was . We confess that we are heartily tired of all such pretensions . There is nothing certainly in Mr. Parton 's book which tends to convince us that he had any new sources of genuine and important information from which to draw , or that he understood the character of the man of whom he writes any better than any other intelligent biographer would have done . It is not our purpose in this Article to follow out the strange career of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Mr. Parton has been true or not to the facts of history . There is an ample field of inquiry here open to those whose historical knowledge is comprehensive and minute enough to render such labor interesting to themselves , and satisfactory to their readers . We believe the book open to the charge of historical inaccuracy in many important points . Yet after all , this is a matter of very small consequence as compared with its general spirit and moral tendencies . The main question , so far as concerns the morals of society , is , whether such a man as Burr obviously was-such a man as even Mr. Parton himself has shown him to be-is to be apologized for and held up to the favor and admiration of men , or whether he is to be sternly condemned by the voice of history , so that he may stand through all time as a warning and a terror to those who might be tempted to tread in his footsteps . This is a question which infinitely outweighs all the questions which can arise as to mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great evil and wrong of the book . Notwithstanding such a life as Burr lived , and such a man as he was , even by Mr. Parton 's own showing , he would still set him before us , as , on the whole , a very fair and estimable character , so that , as some one has well said , his book is an apology , not so much for Burr , as for wickedness in general . " // Though , as we have already said , we do not propose to go over the book in detail , there are a few things in it of a semitheological nature , that the more secular reviews will not be likely to notice , and which , therefore , merit our attention . No part of the book has been more of a curiosity to us , or has afforded us more amusement , than the first chapter , in which Mr. Parton attempts to treat of the life and character of Burr 's grandfather , the great Jonathan Edwards . The whole chapter exhibits a singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exalt Edwards into the loftiest position , so as to give a magnificent starting-point for his hero ; and an ill-disguised contempt for all that Edwards ever thought and believed . It is perfectly clear to any intelligent theological reader , that Mr. Parton was singularly unqualified for this chapter-that he had but the dimmest and most confused idea as to what Jonathan Edwards really was , or what was his position in the world of theology . He had occasion to allude to the contest which went on in Northampton a hundred years ago , respecting the half-way covenant ; and lie sets the subject forth after the following lucid and edifying manner . " Then there arose a dispute between pastor and flock , whether saints and sinners were equally entitled to partake of the sacrament , or saints only . The pastor was for excluding , the flock for admitting sinners . The people appealed to the established custom of the parish : the pastor to the spirit and letter of the authoritative writings . The people grew warm , refused their minister a hearing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was dismissed . " And again , in his summing up of tf*e great qualities and wonderful acts of this same Jonathan Edwards , he has another remarkable sentence touching this same matter . " The thing he chiefly did in this life was this : the church and the world , two hostile bodies , were beginning as it were , to relent towards one another , to approach , to mingle . Jonathan Edwards , with his subtle , feminine intellect and resolute will , threw himself between the two bodies , kept them apart , made more distinct than ever the line of demarcation , and rendered compromise between the two perhaps forever impossible . " There , reader , you have the life and times of Jonathan // Edwards before you in a nutshell ! Be pleased to notice how all the interests of the church universal-even the very existence of the church itself , stood suspended upon the contest which was going forward in Northampton about the year 1750 , between Edwards and his people-how it was then and there to be forever decided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' should lay down their arms , give over their long opposition , and join in fraternal embrace , or whether the old war should still go on ; and then notice a still more curious fact , how , though our distinguished champion was worsted in this contest , so that the people had their own way , yet the victory somehow was all on the side of Edwards . He kept the church and the world ' from rushing into each other 's arms , and rendered compromise between the two , perhaps , forever impossible . ' How unfortunate that he should have been the means of thus perpetuating , to the latest generations , this old and bitter hostility . Standing in the position which he occupied at that memorable crisis in the history of the church , how sad it is , that he could not have remembered that Blessed are the peacemakers . ' We find a great many other curious things , in this first chapter , i*especting Edwards , a few of which we will venture to point out . We find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princ*pia of Calvinistic theology . ' What will our Princeton friends say to that ? We are afraid ,  --  as Calvin himself lived something more than two hundred years earlier than Edwards , and wrote in his day , a very respectable book , called the Institu*es of the Christian Religion , ' and as his followers were scattered over all the earth long before Edwards was born ; and moreover , as Princeton has long claimed to hold the purest kind of Calvinism , while it has looked askance upon Edwards , and upon anything coming from New England ,  --  we are afraid they may say that they can not allow this claim which Mr. Parton has set up , and that they must insist , that Calvin 's Institutes ' shall be called the Principia ' of Calvinistic theology . It is obvious that they might urge an argument of this kind with considerable force . In another place , Mr. Parton quotes a passage of some // length , in which Edwards describes ( in language so plain and simple , that a child would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early interest in the things of religion , and in the prosperity of Christ 's kingdom . In regard to this , our author says , Through the obsolete phraseology of this passage , one easily discerns a fine disinterestedness of character . ' Where , we should like to know , is this phraseology obsolete ? ' If Mr. Parton moves in a world , where all such experiences are entirely unknown , and where language like this is never heard , he is sincerely to be pitied . But let him not suppose that his circle makes the whole world . ILet him not presume that the ideas with which he is day by day familiar , have quite yet overspread and submerged all such thoughts and feelings as those expressed in the passage quoted from Edwards . Not a year passes , in which thousands and tens of thousands of souls , touched by the Spirit of God , are not brought into the same essential condition of thought and emotion ; and though they may not all be able to express their feelings in language so clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tbein to make known that they love the same things which he loved , and are moved by the self-same spirit . Obsolete I Mr. Parton will yet find , that the religion called evangelical ' ( to use his own language ) is not quite so near extinction , as one might suppose , from what he says of it . Mr. Parton 's mode of speaking of Edwards , reminds us of Carlyle 's treatment of Cromwell . Both writers , for the time being , were certain to find nothing in the men of whom they wrote , except what was in some way great and praiseworthy , though it is made apparent to the reader , that they have no religious sympathy with the men they praise , and in other circumstances they would be very free in their condemnation of them . The whole volume abounds in passages showing the author 's hostility and contempt for the orthodox or evangelical faith . He tells us that Aaron Burr 's father , while pursuing his studies at colleo*e " was arrested , as college students frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' Mr. Parton evidently supposes that revivals of religion in college , are imow , // like Pres. Edwards 's phraseology , ' obsolete . And yet the fact is , that revivals of religion , whether in the colleges or in the churches generally , were very rare events in those times of which he writes , as compared with what has been witnessed within this present century . Last year was by no means a remarkable year , in respect to college revivals , and yet fortyseven colleges , ont of the one hundred and twenty-two in the land , report four hundred and twenty-nine conversions as having taken place in them . If we had reports from all the rest , we should probably find that not far from a thousand conversions had taken place in them the past year . Mr. Parton also tells ns with a seeming unction , that Burr " rejected the gospel , according to Jonathan Edwards ; rejected it , as he always maintained , after a calm and full investigation ; rejected it completely and forever . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Burr did a wise and manly thing , in thns forsaking the religion of his fathers , but the whole spirit of the passage seems to imply as much as this , and the suspicion is abundantly confirmed by what is said in many other places in different parts of the book . The gospel according to Jonathan Edwards , ' is evidently , in the eye of our Author , a miserable compound of superstition and bigotry , and all free , enlightened , noble souls will of course reject it . And yet one can not help thinking , that the result in this case certainly furnishes no great occasion for boasting . Orthodoxy is seldom made to appear to better advantage practically , than in this book . After reading the whole story of Aaron Burr 's life , one is very curious to know what injury Mr. Parton snpposes the religious principles of his grandfather would have been likely to have wrought upon him , had lie cordially embraced them and acted upon them . Jonathan Edwards and Aaron Burr both graduated at their respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at seventeen , the latter at sixteen . They were alike , in that they were both possessed of a very delicate and attractive physical organization  --  a clear and subtle intellect , and a resolnte will . Looked at , thus early in life , the points of resemblance between them are many and striking . Edwards , // after many doubts and struggles , embraced the orthodox faith . He embraced it , as Mr. Parton himself confesses , with his whole soul , so that it became in him the ruling principle of life . Burr deliberately rejected it , and accepted , as our author informs us , the gospel according to Philip Dormer Stanhope , Lord Chesterfield . ' Both were at length started upon their respective courses of life . Both have finished their earthly career , so that their lives are spread out to our view , and we can estimate the grand result of their living . Edwards towers before us , as one of the majestic figures in human history . No mean or low associations gather about his memory . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , but he stands before us clothed with an exceeding dignity and purity of character . We wonder not that his descendants everywhere are proud to trace their lineage to him . Throughout the Protestant Church , yea , throughout the civilized world , his name is familiarly known among all scholars . and is mentioned only with reverence . Burr , on the other hand , with remarkable powers of intellect , stands before us only as a loose and disjointed character ; a notorious profligate ; a more than half-suspected traitor ; a cool and revengeful duelist ; and altogether a man , whose name can not be mentioned , without calling up a traii* of foul and gloomy images . If there is anything in all this comparison , which shows the earnest and hearty believer in the orthodox faith to disadvantage , and gives to Mr. Parton and to those who think with him , any occasion for triumph , they are heartily welcome to it . We propose , in conclusion , to notice some of the prominent features of Burr 's moral and intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our estimate of him quite different from that of Mr. Parton . Aaron Burr had undoubtedly a clear and penetrating intellect . We are ready to concede about all that is claimed for him in this respect . His mind , however , was not remarkable for that breadth and comprehensiveness , which we always look for in a truly great man ; but rather for sharpness and intensity of action-for tact and skill -- for a quick , subtle power-an ability to bring all his energies to bear directly upon the point before // him . He was characterized by great efficiency , rather than compass of thought . Though he was for some time moving in the highest circles of public life , and was familiarly associated with the great statesmen and political thinkers of his generation , we are not aware that he has left behind him any writings or speeches which reveal a philosophical spirit , or a profound statemapship , such as we have from the pens of Hamilton , Jefferson , and many others . And this fact is the more significant , when we remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republic , when there was everything to move the recd thinker to grapple with those great questions of government which were up for discussion , and which were forcing themselves upon the attention . While Hamilton was steadily bending his mind to that sublime problem , how the Commonwealth could be so balanced and adjusted , in all its internal and vital arrangements , as to secure its future safety , prosperity , and glory , Burr seems always to have been dealing with the petty questions of to-day . Rarely , if ever , did he rise above the low circle of party politics and personal relations , into the serene heights of cahn and philosophic inquiry . had he been a mere lawyer , his mind occupied with the business of his profession , we might conceive that he had power to deal with these greater questions , but lacked the time and the opportunity . But for a considerable period of his life , he had the time and the opportunity , but the power seems to have been wanting . He was a vigorous , skillful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect was no doubt of a high order , but by no means of the highest order . Yet his principal deficiency does riot lie here . Iad his moral nature been as good as his intellectual ; his intellect would have been vastly better than it was . Burr , in his early years , and we may say through his whole life , appears to have been almost utterly wanting in reverence . He had no respect for authority -- no spirit of true subordiuation . The story told of him while in college , how , though only a mere stripling of a boy , he proceeded to reprimand with the utmost gravity one of the college professors , who had come in late to one of the meetings of the Cliosophic society , while // Burr was in the chair , may be very amusing and droll , but the boy who could do this with such composure , is likely to be fearfully and hatefully impudent , in the general relations of life . The best , the choicest minds among the young , are almost always modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out again in strong relief , during his brief sojourn with Dr. Bellamy . He writes to his friend , Ogden , that he has the old Doctor completely under his thumb . ' He has entirely vanquished him in argument , and shut his mouth . Mr. Parton , in noticing this , seems to think it was about so-that the poor old Doctor was completely non-plussed and silenced , and that it was a very dangerous piece of ' business for him to attempt to play at the Socratic method ' with such a keen and powerful antagonist as Burr , especially when the Doctor had to defend orthodoxy , and Burr had nothing to do only to overthrow it . We are not able to see the matter exactly in this light . In using such language respecting his venerable instructor , we see simply a pert youngster , utterly wanting in reverence , and devoured by a miserable self-conceit . Dr. Bellaniy was a man in the full maturity of his powers , of wide fame and reputation as a preacher , of rich and varied culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college , and he went to reside with the Doctor ostensibly as a scholar . But it would seem from this account , that his vocation there was that of teacher ; or , at least , that he very soon found out that he knew a great deal more than his instructor Dr. Bellamy used occasionally to go down from his quiet country parish in Bethlein to New Haven , to preach . The college was there , and the men of culture were largely gathered there , and so the country ministers would naturally have a little dread of preaching in such a literary atmosphere . Dr. Bellamy used sportively to say , that he did n't feel afraid to preach before anybody in New Haven , except the Sophomore8 . ' We presume that he stood in this kind of fear of Aaron Burr , and in no other . He doubtless found him flippant , tonguey and self-conceited ,  --  altogether too wise even at that early age , to be taught by anybody . So too in Burr 's relations with Washington , this same trait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that broad and many-sided wisdom which dwelt in Washington , and that calm justice , which was looking for the good of all . He sympathized not with him , in the exceedingly trying position he occupied as commander-in-chief of the American army . He saw nothing in him but a common man , elevated to a place above his abilities and his merits , and standing in the way of the advancement of better men ; and among these better men , in the eye of Bnrr , the one most conspicuous , the one who occupied the front position , was Aaron Burr himself . It is confessed on all hands , that Burr was exceedingly vain of his military talent and reputation , and we think it very probable that he was better fitted to achieve success in a military career , than in any other . He had great physical courage . He was constitutionally brave and daring . His perceptions were quick . His will was resolute and determined . We do not by any means think that he had the powers of mind , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as a commander-in-chief must form . But in a subordinate capacity , he would very likely have made for himself a great name . It was not perhaps strange that Burr should find fault with some of Washington 's military movements , while the war of the revolution was still in progress . We could forgive him for that . During those slow and tedious years , it was often very trying to the patience of men , that matters should go on as they did . But when our independence was at last secured , when the dust and smoke were cleared away , and men were enabled to see more distinctly what Washington was , and what he had been doing-with what wisdom he had pursued his *nd , with what patience he had borne the reproaches of his enemies , and how , in all this , he had been acting not for himself , but for the country which he loved ; then for Burr to thrust himself into comparison with such a man , reveals a self-conceit altogether contemptible and disgusting . And yet Burr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would have been glad to find some one , who would come forward before the public , and institute such a comparison . Mr. Davis , in his preface , tells us , that when // Burr first applied to him to write his memoirs , this subject came up for consideration . " I soon discovered , " says Mr. Davis , " that Col. Burr was far more tenacious of his military , than of his professional , political , or moral character . His prejudices against General Washington were immovable . They were formed in the summer of 1776 , while he resided at head-quarters ; and they were confirmed unchangeab lyby the injustice which he said he had experienced at the hands of the commander-in-chief , immediately after the battle on Long Island , and the retreat of the American army from the city of New York . These grievances he wished to mingle with his own history ; and he was particularly anxious to examine the military movements of General Washington on different occasions , but more especially , at the battle of Monmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Stirling 's division . I peremptorily refused entering upon any such discussion ; and for soiue time all communication on the subject cea*sed . " We might dwell upon many other facts in Burr 's history illustrative of the workings of this same trait , did our limits allow . But we have said enough to show that he was wofully deficient in that quality , which is always pres* ent in truly noble souls ; and which especially in the young , is one of the most beautiful and hopeful elements of character , Burr was also an exceedingly 8e*fi8k man . He was , no doubt , a polite man , according to the rules of fashionable society , and knew how to do things graceful and winning in his intercourse with men , and especially in his intercourse with women . But it was the ruling principle of his life to keep his eye upon himself his own success , his own gratifica* tion , his own aggrandizement . In all his public life , we fail to discover in him one real hearty desire to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that there are a great many men in public life at the present day , who are very much like him in this respect ; but the trait is none the less detestable on this account . A man who has entrusted to him in any measure the keeping of a nation 's interests , but who , by reason of his selfishness , can not rise to any conception of the sacredness of that trust , and has no sense of the // responsibility to God and to man under which he ought to actwho can not look away from himself , and bend his mind honestly to the question how will this and that measure affect the country at large for the present and for the future , merits no praise or commendation from any quarter . We believe there are men in Congress at the present moment , who would give their votes to fasten eternal slavery upon Kansas , against all their instinctive sense of justice , and all the convictions of their reason , simply to pnrchase for themselves a senatorship or an ambassadorship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these . But nowhere does this selfishness show itselt*to be the hateful thing it is , more clearly than in these high positions . Henry Clay , iu one of his speeches in Congress , near the close of his life , breaks out into the following eloquent language . " Mr. President , what is an individual man ? Au atom , almost invisible without a mnagnif*ing glass ; a mere speck upon the surface of the immense Universe ; not a second in time compared to immeasurable , never-beginning and never-ending eternity ; a drop of water in the great deep , which evaporates and is borne off by the winds ; a grain of sand which is soon gathered to the dust whence it sprung . Shall a being so small , so petty , so fleeting ; so evanescent , oppose itsvlf to the onward march of a great nation , to subsist for all ages and ages to come ? * * * Let us look at our country and our eourse ; elevate ourselves to the dignity of pure and di*interested statesmen , and save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the march of this nation to greatness and power , we should be buried beneath the wheels that propel it onward ? What are we , what is any man worth , who is not willing to sacrifice himself for the benefit of his country , when it is necessary ? " We are quite sure that such considerations as these might have been addressed to Aaron Burr without any effect . There was nothing in his nature to respond to any such appeal . lie was a cool and calculating egotist , studying continually his own chances of success . Burr was hard hearted . We do not mean that he was not kind to Theodosia and to her child , that he was not pleasant and agreeable to every one whom his pride or his ambition // prompted him to please . Few men , probably , had a more charming address or a more graceful exterior . But in the depths of his soul he was hard and cruel . The whole story of his experienees and his inward exercises in connection with his duel with Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nether millstone . His perfect composure immediately after his return from that deed of blood , when a friend from Connecticut , who chanced to call at his house that morning found him at breakfast , the same polite and agreeable cornpanion as usual ; and went down into the city , where all was uproar and confusion from the news of the duel , without having received the remotest intimation that anything * nusual. had transpired : is one of the most striking instance record of a fiendish coolness and self-possession , when * e whole man , by all the laws of our moral nature , ought t have been passing through an agony of repentance . Though the whole country was plunged at once into mourning by the untimely death of Hamilton , Burr wore the same unrelenting sneer , and gave no signs of sorrow for what he had done . All this may be in perfect consistency with the gospel according to Philip Dormer Stanhope , ' which Mr. Parton . tells us Burr had accepted , but it shows a nature utterly lost to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exercises of hamilton 's mind in connection with that duel , as well before as after the event-his honest efforts to escape from the meshes of that cruel system which as a military man he had foolishly accepted-his deep and tender regard for his wife and children-his generous determination te reserve and throw away his fire , and the general feeling of soleulnity by which his mind is pervaded in view of the anticipated meeting . In Mr. Parton 's account of this matter , there are some things said which we are constrained to pronounce utterly heartless . hamilton is alone in his study on the night before the duel , adj imsting his affairs for the morrow . Mr. Parton says , " the paper prepared by Hamilton on that occasion , in the solitude of his library , reveals to us the miserable spectacle of an intelligent and gifted man , who had , with the utmost deliberation , made up his mind to do an action which his intellect // condemned as absurd , which his heart felt to be cruel , which his conscience told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify Hamilton for the part he took in this affair , yet , after studying the exercises of Burr 's mind on this occasion , where we discover not a trace of anything tender and emotional , we confess that it is the greatest relief to turn to a heart ' that can feel an*qt1d*g to be cruel , and to a conscience ' that condemns anythinrj ' as wrong . We find ourselves again in contact with our common humanity . We feel the beatings of a genuine human soul . It would doubtless have been hard for the American people in any event to have forgiven Burr for killing Hamilton as he did . But as the case stands , he makes imo claim upon us for forgiveness . He lives and dies without one sign of sincere and genuine repentance . He even gloried in the deed , and narrated the story on certain occasions with evident satisfaction and spirit . This is so different from the ordinary feelings of men who have been so wicked or unfortunate as to kill a fellow-man in a duel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-hearted . Some years since a man from the North who had occasion to transact some business in Texas , was frequently in the office of a lawyer in Galveston . Calling one day and finding the door open , he walked in , and found the lawyer taking an after-dinner nap in his chair . Thinking lie would not disturb him , lie sat down and was amusing himself with a book for a few moments , when the lawyer started up suddenly , in a kind of mental agony , exclaiming , I ought not to have killed that man , I ought not to have killed him ; ' when , discovering some one present , he felt called upon to explain , that some seventeen years before he had killed a man in a duel ; and that his dreams even yet , were often haunted by this terrible experience . If we had evidence of any such workings of conscience in the case of Burr , we might find our hearts drawn toward him in pity . But as it is , he seems to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take him very much out of the range of our sympathies . Even in his extreme old age , it appears he could crack a flippant joke about his duel with Hamilton . One day , as Mr. Parton tells // us , after he had been reading Sterne 's story of Le Fevre , which contains Uncle Toby 's memorable speech to the fly that had been buzzing about him , il3urr remarked , " If I had read Sterne more and Voltaire less , I should have known that the world was wide enough for Hamilton and me . " If any one will take the trouble to recall the precise words that Uncle Toby used when he put the fly out of the window , ( to say nothing of the utter heartlessness of joking at all upon such a subject , ) he will have Burr 's very modest estimate of himself , as compared with Hamilton . The story becomes a fine illustration , not only of his cold , unfeeling nature , but of his boundless self-conceit . Mr. Parton says that Burr never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( his duel with Hamilton . ) " Despising the outcry made about the duel , he would indulge sometimes in a kind of defiant affectation respecting it : Jly friend Hamilton , whom I 8/tot , ' he would say with amazing nonchalance . " Still , he had also a tender regard for Hamilton 's character and reputation , as appears by the following incident . Was Hamilton a gentleman ? ' asked a foreigner once in Burr 's hearing . Burr resented the question , and replied with hauteur : Sir , I met him ! - an answer strictly in keeping , no doubt , with the Chesterfieldian gospel , ' but otherwise a very contemptible one . So , too , we have in this book , the whole story of Burr 's visiting the scene of the duel twenty-five years after the event* in company with a young friend , and there rehearsing all the particulars of that bloody morning . Mr. Parton tells us that " He dwelt much on the meanness of hamilton . He charged him with being malevolent and cowardly  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it unless he was cornered . When he stood up to fire , ' said Burr , lie caught my eye and quailed under it ; he looked like a convicted felon . ' " " These isolated expressions , my informant says , convey no idea whatever of the fiery impressiveness with which lie spoke . He justified all be had done ; nay , applauded it . " We bring forward these illustrations from the book to show that we have not judged Burr harshly , when we pronounce him a man of almost unparalleled hardness of heart . // We feel that there is a demand laid upon us , in order to complete this sketch of Burr 's character properly , to say something of his notorious 8ensuality . And yet we hardly know how to treat this point . We have already introduced the subject in general , in what we have said of the Confidential Female Correspondence ' which Mr. Davis destroyed ; and we are inclined , for the most part , to let it rest there . Suffice it to say , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged in Burr 's behalf , and we do not feel that he has broken the force of the old testimony , or done anything of importance to efface the old and almost universal impression . We think if we had no other evidence on this point , except what we can glean from Mr. Parton 's book , we should pronounce Burr a systematic and confirmed sensualist . For a general estimate of his character in this respect , it matters little whether he was or was not sometimes charged with crimes of which he was innocent . It is , of course , very difficult to know precisely when he was , or when he was not , guilty . But leaving out all that others have said , and confining ourselves strictly to Mr. Parton 's narrative , we know not what else to make of Burr , than that he was notoriously , shamefully , heartlessly , and systematically licentious . In the early part of our Article , we called this book an apology for Burr , and we know not what else to denominate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious kind of an apology . Though its main drift is to exculpate Burr , it is often very severe in what it says of him . Mr. Parton seems at times disposed to atone f*er what he is doing , by a sound and hearty condemnation o* iThrr 's conduqt and character in particular instances . The book bears the impress of this two-fold tendency , which may , perhaps , obtain for it , with some readers , a reputation for fairness and candor . But its general aim is unmistakable . And what offends us as much as anything in it , is this ; that the author seems to expect us to admire that in Burr , which we perfectly hate . Many facts and incidents like some we have given , are presented to the reader , apparently with the intention that they will elicit his admiration for Burr , when they really present Burr 's moral character in a most // odious light . The reader is made to feel insulted by this claim upon his sympathy and love for that which is intrinsically detestable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration for Burr is demanded . We 4o not believe that Mr. Parton , by this book , will succeed in making Aaron Burr 's character attractive , or even respectable , in the eyes of the American people . So long as Burr stands in our history where he has stood , as a character to be despised and abhorred-as a man whose life was not only an unhappy failure , ' but one long exhibition of pride and vanity , hard heartedness and terrible guilt ,  --  he may indirectly be the means of good . lie may serve as a warning to others not to follow in his steps . We have too many men , both in private and public life , who would like a little encouragement in the course they are tempted to pursue . They would rejoice to have it made out , that Aaron Burr , notwithstanding his strange career of wickedness , is still deserving of our sympathy and respect . We have already heard it several times suggested , that if Mr. Parton succeeds with Burr , he had better try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now for many years been waiting for some sympathizing biographer , to tell us of the wrongs he has suffered , and of the hard measure he has received at the hands of his countiymen. @
