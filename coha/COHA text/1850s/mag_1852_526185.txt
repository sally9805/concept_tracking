NARRATIVE OF TilE LIFE OF GENERAL LESLIE COMBS , OF KENT1ITOKY7 E ) I3RACIXG INCIDENTS IN THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE NORTH-WESTERN TERRITORY . CONCLUDED . THE defeat at Raisin , and the discharge of the remainder of the Kentucky troops , made the situation of General Harrison , and the whole north-western frontier , extremely critical . Of our old forts there remained in our possession Forts Wayne and Harrison . Fort Winchester had been erected on the site of old Fort Defiance , and General Harrison had built Fort Meigs at the foot of the Maumee Rapids , on the south side of the river . The latter was the only place at all prepared for an attack by heavy artillery ; and it was to be expected that as soon as the ice on the lake and river broke up in the spring , the British , having command on the waters and entire possession of Michigan Territory , would assail that position . It was of the first importa*ce , therefore , to have General Harrison reinforced as soon as possible , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fire and desolation . For this purpose , General Green Clay marched from Kentucky , early in April , with two regiments of volunteers , taking the same route which General Winchester had done . Having made the ; cce*sary picperations , Combs started himself soon afterwards to rejoin General Harrison at Fort Meigs , as he had promised to do , and overtook General Clay at Dayton . Totally unprovided as that general was with maps of the vast wilderness into which he was about to phmge , the practical information which young Combs had obtained on the previous campaign , as to the geography of the country , its watercourses , newly cut roads , Indian villages , &amp;c. , &amp;c. , was deemed of much importance ; and before the expedition reached Piqua , he tendered young Combs the appointment of Captain of Spies , with the privilege of selecting his company from Colonel Dudley 's regiment . He had not expected a position so high or responsible , and felt much diffidence of his ability to discharge its dangerous duties . The next day , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an old indian fighter under Wayne , named Kilbreath ; and by way of distinction afterwards , our young volunteer was called the boy captain . Their pay was thirty dollars per month extra ; and he had no difficulty , therefore , in filling his company with active , gallant riflemen , but one or two of whom , however , had seen service . When they reached St. Mary 's Blockhouse , General Clay divided his brigade , sending Colonel Dudley 's regiment across to the Auglaise river , and descending the St. Mary 's himself , with Colonel Boswell 's , intending to unite them again at old Fort Defiance . Captain Combs was attached to the former ; and on their march down the Auglaise , an express reached them from Fort Meigs , with the intelligence that General Harrison was in daily expectation of an attack , and urging them to proceed with all possible dispatch . Colonel Dudley immediately summoned a council of officers to meet at his quarters , where it was unanimously resolved that General Harrison ought to be apprised of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manner , received . How this was to be accomplished was then the question . It was fifty miles from Fort Defiance , where they expected to meet General Clay , // to Fort Meigs ; and it was deemed extremely hazardous for any one to attempt to open a communication between the two points , especially as no one present , except Captain Combs , knew the exact position of Fort Meigs , or had &amp;ny knowledge of the intervening country . He had remained silent during the consultation , but now all eyes were turned upon him , and he felt bound to speak . " Colonel Dudley , " said he , " General Clay has thought proper to intrust me with an important command , attached to your regiment . When we reach Fort Defiance , if you will furnish me with a good canoe , I will carry your dispatches to General Harrison , and return with his orders . I shall only require four or five volunteers from my own company , and one of my Indian guides to accompany me . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Colonel specially complimented him for his voluntary proposition , as he said he should have had great reluctance in ordering any officer upon such an expedition . The troops encamped at Fort Defiance on the afternoon of the first of May . General Clay , meanwhile , had not arrived . Captain Combs immediately prepared for his perilous trip . The two Walkers , Paxton , and Johnson , were to accompany him , as well as the young Shawanee warrior , Black Fish . As they pushed off from shore at the mouth of the Auglaise , the bank was covered with their anxious fellow-soldiers ; and Major Shelby remarked , looking at his watch , * Remember , Captain Coitbs , if we never meet ao*ain , it is exactly six o'clock when we part ; " *and he has since told Mr. Combs that he never expected to see him again alive . Captain Combs would have started some hours earlier , could his frail craft have been gotten ready ; for he knew it would rec*uirc hard work , even with the aid of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning . Placing his Shawanee in the stern , with a steering-oar , and two men at the side-oars , alternately relieving each other , the Captain took his position in the bbw , to take care of their rifles and direct the course to be pursued ; keeping as nearly as possible in the centre of the stream , for fear of Indians on either side . By dark they had come within distinct hearing of the distant roar of heavy artillery in their front , and knew that General Harrison 's apprehensions of an early assault upon his enfeebled position were verified . Ihese sounds were new to their ears , and highly exciting . It was late in the night when they struck the head of the rapids , and it seemed every moment as if their light canoe would be dashed in pieces . By lying fiat on his face , the Captain could form some idea of the course of the deep channel , amid the war of waters which nearly deafened them , by seeing the foaming breakers glistening in the starlight . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a considerable perpendicular fall in low water , they were forced to land and haul their bark along the margin of the southern bank till they had passed the main obstruction ; and daylight dawned upon them before they were again afloat . They were still some seven or eight miles above the fort , and well knew that the surrounding forests were alive with hostile savages . When the frightful appearance of the swollen river first presented itself to the view of our voyagers , one of the men urged Captain Combs to land , and endeavor thus to get to the fort ; but this plan was not to be thought of . Three other alternatives remained to him : to return and report the reason of his failure to go any farther ; to remain where he was during the day , and make an attempt to enter the fort the next night ; or to proceed at once . The first plan would have been most prudent ; and if he had been an old and experienced officer , of established reputation for courage , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he has since expressed himself , a mere boy , with but little military experience , intrusted with a most important duty at his own instance ; and his aged mother 's last injunction was fresh in his heart , as well as in his recollection ; he could not retreat . If he should determine to remain where he was during the day , they would most probably be discovered and tomalzawked before night . He therefore resolved instantly to go ahead , desperate as the chances seemed against him , and risk all consequences . Not one of his brave companions demurred to his determination , although he told them they would certainly be compelled to earn their breakfasts before they would have the honor of taking coffee with General Harrison . No one can well conceive his deep anxiety and intense excitement as he was ap // proaching the last bend in the river which shut the fort from their view . He knew not but that , after all his risks , he might only arrive in time to see the example of Hull imitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from the walls ; but , instead of that , as they swept rapidly round the point , the first object that met their sight was the British batteries belching forth their iron hail across the river , and the bomb-shells flying in the air ; and the next moment they saw the glorious stars and stripes gallantly floating in the breeze . " Oh , it was a grand scene , " writes Captain Combs . " We could not suppress a shout ; and one of my men , Paxton , has since declared to me , that he then felt as if it would take about a peck of bullets to kill him 1 " Captain Combs had prepared every thing for action , by handing to each man his rifle freshly loaded , and , in the mean time , keeping near the middle of the river , which was several hundred yards wide , not knowing from which side they would be first attacked . He hoped that General Harrison might now and then be taking a look with his spyglass up the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out an escort to bring them in . He did not know that that general was beleaguered on all sides , and hotly pressed at every point . At first they saw only a solitary Indian in the edge of the woods , on the American side , running **33;694;TOOLONG ; and they took him for a friendly Shawanee , of wlmm they knew General Harrison had several in his service as guides and spies . His steersman himself was for a moment deceived , and exclaimed , in his deep guttural voice , " Shawanee , " at the same time turning the bow of the canoe towards him . A moment afterwards , however , when he raised the war-whoop , and they saw the woods full of red devils , running with all their speed to a point on the river below them , so as to cut them off from the fort , ir drive them into the mouths of the British cannon , CaptainCombs ' young warrior exclaimed , " Pottawatamie , God damn I " and instantl*r turned the boat toward the opposite shore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not long doubtful . The latter had the advantage in distance , and reached the point before the former . Combs still hoped to pass them with little injury , owing to the width of the river and the rapidity of the current , and thereibre ordered his men to receive their flr* , without returning it , as he feared an attack also from the near shore , which would require all their means of resistance to repel . If successful , he should still have time and space enough to recross the river before he got within range of the British batteries , and save his little band from certain destruction . The first gun fired , however , satisfied him of his error , as the ball whistled over the canoe without injury , followed by a volley , which prostrated Johnson , mortally wounded , and also disabled Paxton ; not , however , before they had all fired at the crowd , and saw several tumbling to the ground . Captain Combs was thus , as a last hope , forced to run his craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Meigs on the north side of the river . To some extent they succeeded . The two Walkers soon left the party , by the Captain 's order , to save themselves ; the Indian nobly remained with Paxton , and helped him along for six or seven miles , until he was so exhausted with the loss of blood as to be unable to travel farther . Captain Combs was less fortunate with poor Johnson , who , with all his aid , could barely drag himself half a mile from their place of landing , and both he and Paxton were very soon captured and taken to General Proctor 's head-quarters . They even reported , as was afterwards learned , that they had killed the Captain , and showed as evidence of the fact his cloth coat , which he had thrown off , putting on in its stead an old hunting-shirt , after he left Johnson , so as to disencumber himself of all surplus weight . His woodcraft , learned in the previous campaign , now did him good service , as it enabled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights of starvation and suffering , he again met Major Shelby and his other friends , at the mouth of the Auglaise , on the fourth of May , in the morning , after all hope of his return had been given up . The two Walkers were a day ahead of him , and his brave young Indian succeeded in making his way to his natiVe village . Tke historian McAfee , page 264 , in speaking of another expedition of a somewhat siniilar character , subsequently undertaken by Major Trimble , at the instance of General Clay , thus alludes to the above : - " To penetrate to the camp Fort Meigs thus exposed in an open bc*at , wa* deemed extremely // hazardous . Such an attempt had already been made by Captain Leslie Combs , who was sent down in a canoe with five or six men by Colonel Dudley , on his arrival at Defiance . The Captain had reached within a mile of the fort , when he was attacked by the Indians and compelled to retreat , after bravely contending with superior numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Combs ' mouth and throat were excoriated by eating bitter hickory buds , and nothing else , for the last forty-eight hours . His feet were dreadfully lacerated by travelling in moccasins through burnt prairies , and his body and limbs were all over sore and chafed by constant exercise in wet clothes , as he was compelled to swim several swollen creeks , and it was raining part of the time most violently . In this situation he was ordered to bed . in one of the boats just preparing to descend the river with General Clay 's brigade . He could not for days afterwards eat any solid food , and yet early next morning he found they were making a landing , just above the scene of his disaster four days before , and that the two companies of spies and the friendly Indian warriors were paraded on the beach , seemingly waiting for him to come , although the surgeon had told them he was unable to leave his pallet . Colonel Dudley 's regiment was soon all landed and formed in three lines , preparatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Combs was informed that the spies were to constitute the vanguard . A battle  --  a real battle-was to be fought I delightful thoftght ! The British batteries were to be stormed and destroyed , while General Harrison was assaulting the Indians and their allies on the opposite side of the river . At last he would have a chance to do something to make up for all his previous sufferings and misfortunes ; and he forgot every bodily pain . In a few moments he was on his feet , dressed . He was received with a glad shout at the head of the vanguard , and commenced the march in front of the left flank , towards the enemy . Colonel Dudley himself led the attacking column , and captured the batteries from the rear , *rithout the loss of a man . " The British flag was cut down , and the shouts of the American garrison announced their joy at this consummation of their wishes . General Harrison was standing on the grand battery next the river , and now called to the men and made signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , as he had previously ordered them , but all in vain . " - AfcAfre , page 2 ' 7O . Just before the batteries were taken , a body of Indians lying in ambush had fired upon Captain Combs ' command , and shot down several of his men . He immediately formed in front of them , posting Captain Kilbreath on the left flank , while he himself occupied the right , and maintained his ground till reinforced by Colonel Dudley , who felt the necessity of bringing him off the ground , inasmuch as he had given him no orders to retreat , and had determined not to sacrifice him . Captain Kilbreath was killed at his post , and Captain Combs was slightly touched by a ball before he received any assistance . They soon after routed the enemy , and pursued them by successive charges of bayonet some two or three miles through the swamp . In the mean time the British had retaken their batteries , and driven off our left column , which had been left to guard them . The Indians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surround the American detachment , or , at any rate , to cut them off from their boats . Under these circumstances , a retreat was ordered , with directions again to form at the batteries , it not then being known to the party that they had been retaken . As had been the case at Raisin , and will ever be repeated with raw troops , the retreat caused much disorder and confusion , and cost the Americans most dearly , for many of the wounded were now tomahawked and scalped ; among them their brave , unfortunate commander , Colonel Dudley . Captain Combs ' position threw him in the rear in this movement , and , although severely wounded in the shoulder by a ball , which remained lodged in his body , and bleeding profusely , he was enabled now and then to make a rally and drive back the painted devils , when they would be rushing up too closely upon his command . He had no idea that those in front of him had surrendered , until he found himself in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Kentucky troops . And here and thus his long-desired. battle ended  --  a second rive r Raisin bloody massacre. * * " The prisoners were taken down to the British head-quarters , put into Fort Miami , and the Indians permitted to garrison the surrounding rampart , and amuse themselves by loading and // The brilliant early history of an Alexander and a Napoleon , which had ever vividly floated in his mind in glorious visions as to his own unaided military career , were now exchanged for the agonizing reality of a prisoner of war ; and yet he had not half reached the gQal of torturing exposure which the aftemoon of that dreadful day was to bring upon him . The pen of the historian has long since given to the world some of the leading events to which we refer , and they have , perhaps , passed from the memory of the reader ; but we do not recollect ever to have seen an authentic account published from any one of the unfortunate captives , and shall , therefore proceed to give in substance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his elevation from a colonelcy to a previous victory , stained by the most revolting atrocities , and who witnessed , if not permitted those horrid atrocities committed on the present occasion by his Indian confederates , was afterwards dismissed from the British army for his disgraceful flight from General Harrison and retributive justice , at the battle of the Thames . Immediately on the surrender of each successive squad or individual , as they arrived at the batteries , they were marched off in single file down the river towards the British head-quarters near old Fort Maumee , then in a very dilapidated condition , having been given up to us and abandoned shortly after Wayne 's victory , some twenty years before th' time . Very soon the Indian warriors , fresh from the conflict , ( in some instances , boys and squaws , ) commenced the operation of insulting and plundering the prisoners . A grim Indian on horseback , painted black and red in alternate rings around his eyes , firing at the crowd , or at any particular individual . Those who preferred to inflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims , led them to the gateway , and there , under the eye of General Proctor , and in the presence of the whole British army , tomahawked and scalped them ! . . . As soon as Tecumseh beheld it , the carnage , he flourished his sword , and , in a loud voice , %rdered them " for shame to desist . It is a disgrace to kill a defenseless prisoner . " His orders were obeyed , to the great joy of the prisoners , who had , by this time , lost all hopes of being preserved . In this single act , Tecumseh displayed more humanity , magnanimity , and civilization , than Proctor , with all his British associates in command , displayed in the whole war on the north-western frontier . " - JfcAfee , pp. 27l-*. rode up to CaptainiDombs and snatched his hat from his head . Soon afterwards , another rushed upon him , and , regardless of his pain , tore his coat from his back , tearing loose at the same time the bandages with which his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what little money he had in his pockets , not sparing even a small penknife and pocket-comb . In one instance , when he had nearly arrived at the old fort , and a " devilish-looking fellow " was handling him very roughly  --  the more so , perhaps , as his honest intentions upon the captive were unrewarded , in consequence of his having been previously cleaned out  --  a good-looking Canadian non-commissioned officer , as the Captain judged from his dress , interfered for his protection , and lost his life for his humanity . The Captain was hurried onwards , and suddenly observed , as he approached the fort , a number of painted warriors ranged on each side of the pass-way from the opening of a triangular diteh in front , some sixty feet or more to the old gateway of the main fortification ; and on either side and among them were lying prostrate in the mud a number of human bodies , entirely naked , and in all the ghastliness of violent deaths produced by the war-club , the tomahawk , and the scalping-knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . A man would not be able to recognize his own father or brother after the scalp had thus been torn from his head , his whole countenance would be so distorted and unnatural . There was some poetry in the great excitement of mortal strife and skill in open battle , when all were armed with deadly weapons ; but here the prisoners were nearly naked , with a chilling rain and fierce hail beating upon them for the last hour , and totally defenseless , in the midst of infuriated foes bent on their destruction . There was not the slightest poetic thought in our captive 's head ; all now was matter-of-fact-real prose . He felt very uncomfortable , and decidedly averse to proceeding any farther , and so notified an English soldier near him ; but he replied that there was no alternative , and urged the prisoner forward . During this brief delay , the prisoner in his rear stepped before him , and in another moment the work of death was done upon him . He was shot down with a pistol in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the terrific gauntlet , and fell across the track , which was all the way slippery // with fresh-shed blood . Our Captain leaped over his body , and ran through into the fort unhurt , and found himself at once in the midst of several hundred of his fellowsufferers , who had been equally fortunate . They were surrounded by a small British guard ; but , thank Heaven ! no more Indians were in sight . Whether it was our Captain 's youthful appearance , his bloody shirt , or mere savage fancy that saved him , he did not know , nor stop to inquire . He again felt safe from cold-blooded massacre , whatever else might befall him . He was left to indulge this pleasant delusion for a few short minutes . Very soon , however , after the last prisoner had followed him in , by which time it seems the Indian hosts , who had driven them into the net of the British , had assembled around the prisoners ' unsafe temporary habitation , they at once demanded that the latter should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously broke in the old crumbling walls of the fort , and surrounded theiA on all sides , giving utterance at the same time to the dreaded war-whoop . When the prisoners first entered the old fort , they were ordered to sit down , for fear the Indians would fire on them over the walls , which had crumbled down and were very low in some places . But as soon as the savages had burst in upon them , they all instantly rose to their feet , and an old friend near Captain Combs proposed that they should attempt to break through the enemy and get to the river . Captain Combs showed him his *rippled shoulder by way of reply , and he afterwards told the Captain that he himself could not swim , but preferred drowning to death by the tomahawk and scalpingknife , and presumed the Captain would also . The guard quieted their apprehensions for a short time , until a tall , raw-boned Indian , painted black , commenced shooting , tomahawking , and scalping the prisoners nearest to him , and could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose reeking scalps were immediately seen ornamenting his waist-belt . One of these was a private in Combs ' own company , who fell so near the Captain that his blood and brains sprinkled his clothes . The shrieks of these men in their dying agonies seemed for months afterwards to ring in his ears , and the crushing in of their skulls by the repeated blows of the war-club was most horrid . At this time , too , the immense mass of Indians around the prisoners again raised the war-whoop , and commenced throwing off the skin caps which protected the locks of their guns , preparatory for immediate use . The unfortunate captives then firmly believed their time had come ; and they prepared to sell their lives as dearly as possible . There was a rush towards the centre , with a cry of terror , the guard calling as loudly as possible for General Proctor or Colonel Elliott to come in , or all the prisoners would be murdered . At this critical juncture , a noblelooking Indian , unpainted , dressed in a hunting-shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the midst of the surrounding savages , and , taking his position on the highest point of the wall , made a brief but most emphatic address . Combs could not understand a word of what he said ; but it seemed to receive the general assent of the Indians , as was indicated by their grunts and gestures , and he knew from his manner that he was on the side of mercy . The black devil only , who had just committed the four murders , growled and shook his head ; but upon receiving a stern look and apparent positive command from the speaker , whirled on his heel and departed , much to the general joy of the prisoners , as it convinced them that the orator had power as well as eloquence . The next day Captain Combs asked of a British officer the name of the Indian who had thus interfered and saved them . He replied : " It was Tecumseh. * ' * " It was the first and last time , " Mi- . Combs afterwards writes , " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no single Indian had ever possessed so much power over his race ; for , from the Capes of Florida to the Lake of the Woods , he had been able to produce one simultaneous uprising of the tribes against us , in the war with Great Britain . And yet I do not think , judging by his appearance , he could at that time have passed his fortieth year . When afterwards I heard of his untimely death at the battle of the Thames , while attempting to urge forward his forces , and regain the battle which Proctor 's cowardly flight had lost , I could not repress a sigh of regret , a feeling in which I doubt not all of my companions on the bloody third of May participated . " " The prisoners , " says McAfee , page 272 , // " were kept in the same place the old fort till dark , during which time the wounded experienced the most excruciating torments . They were then taken into the British boats , and carried down the river to the brig Hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stowed away in the hold of the brig , and kept them for two days and nights , " without , we are assured on the authority* of Mr. Combs , either food or bedding of any kind for the wounded , or the slightest surgical attention . Fortunately for himself , Captain Combs was on board the schooner , which was less crowded than the brig , and had the ball extracted from his shoulder by a British surgeon early the next morning ; and , as soon as his name and rank were known , he was invited into the Captain 's cabin , and treated with marked attention and politeness . It was there he learned that the party which had defeated him on his forlorn trip had borne back his uniform-coat in triumph , which was recognized by Paxton , and they asserted they had killed the wearer , showing some recent rents , which they averred were bullet-holes . Paxton himself , whom Captain Combs found on board , believed he was dead , as he last saw him with the coat on ' his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent across the lake in open boats to the mouth of the Huron river , with a wilderness of some forty or fifty miles between them and the nearest settlement in Ohio , ' at Mansfield . Captain Combs had neither hat nor coat , and did not exchange his shirt , although covered with mud and blood , till he reached the town of Lancaster . There they were all decently clad , and most kindly entertained by the citizens . Late in May , he again reached his father 's humble farm in Clarke county , and soon afterwards was sent to McAllister 's school , near Bardstown , to improve his somewhat neglected education . It was a year or two before he was notified of his exchange ; and in the mean time he had commenced the study of the law , which was to be hi* means of livelihood through life . Whether it was in his blood , or that he took the disease in his early boyhood from hearing his father talk of his revolutionary services and Indian " scrimmages , " certain it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Combs used to feel as young Norval did , while with his father on the Grampian hills , an humble swain-an anxious desire for military renown . " I am not even yet , " he writes , " entirely cured of the disease , and have all my life , till within the last few years , devoted a portion of my time to military tactics , in training the militia , having long since reached the highest grade . At the first tap of the drum , I instinctively catch the step , and keep it as long as the music reaches my ear . " When the Mexicans were invading Texas , in 1836- ' 7 and 8 , and General Gaines was posted on our south-western frontier , which was considered in some danger , he called upon Kentucky for help . The Governor immediately gave General Combs authority to raise ten companies , and march to his relief . He accordingly issued his proclamation , and had the offer of more than forty volunteer companies in a very short time . He selected ten , formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Louisville , when tbe President of the United States countermanded the order , and they were discharged . So , too , ten years afterwards , when rumors reached us that General Taylor was in front of a Mexican force , on the Rio Grande , of more than double his strength in point of numbers , and Congress had authorized the President to receive the services of fifty thousand volunteers , General Combs issued his general orders , commanding all the regiments under his command to assemble at their several places of annual parade , to see what could be done . The following is an extract from that order , dated May 18 , 1846 " The Major-General does not doubt that tho same noble spirit which precipitated the gallant sons of Kentucky upon every frontier where an enemy was to be found , during the late war , will again animate his fellow-soldiers ; and he calls upon them , in the name of liberty and patriotism , to hasten to the rescue of the American army on the Rio Grande , to share their victories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Several regiments of volunteers were soon enrolled , and it was supposed by all that the command would be given to General Combs . But such was not the case . He was not in favor at Washington ; and , although his proclamation was republished in the " Union , " and his energy and patriotism every where complimented , none but political partisans // were appointed to high offices ; some of I whom were made generals , who had never " set a squadron in the field , " nor were fit to do it . The Constitution of the United States was , in the opinion of General Combs , violated by depriving the States of the right to officer their own militia ; and he was overlooked and superseded . Again , although opposed to the annexation of Texas , as proposed and finally consummated , yet , when war was declared , he desired to see it speedily fought out , and terminated by an honorable peace . He , therefore , again made an effort to be employed in the military service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the President , when more volunteers were called for , offering to raise a full division , if he would only allow those who were willing to risk their lives for their country to choose their own officers . He even went to Washington , and renewed the offer in person to the President and Secretary of War ; but it was declined politely , but positively . His remonstrances on the occasion were in plain English , as may be remembered , for they formed the subject of remark by the public press at the time , and very likely Mr. Marcy has not entirely forgotten them . No one was pi*esent at their brief interview in his office . General Combs soon afterwards resigned his office , in consequence of the gross injustice which he felt had been done him . He would not consent to be treated as a mere recruiting-sergeant to raise troops for those whom he regarded as party pets , without m*itary experience or aptitude to command in the field . Having risen from the ranks to the office of captain in two campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated acts of selfdevotion , Leslie Combs had returned home naked and penniless , a cripple for life . Yet he did not apply for a pension from the War Office , as did others-even Colonel Johnson , who received his in full . When urged to do so , he replied , that his blood was as red , and shed as freely , as that of Colonel ( afterwards Governor ) Preston , of Virginia ; and that , poor as he was , he would never receive a pension unless granted freely by special act of Congress , as had been done in Colonel Preston 's case . But he had no friend at court ; and no member of Congress looked into the matter for twenty years , when Mr. Allan , of the Lexington ( Mr. Combs ' ) district , took it in hand , and the result was a report in favor of granting the pensioi . A bill was then , and not till then , passed by Congress , unanimously , we believe , in both Houses , which was approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life  --  but nothing for the past . By the aid of a relative , who allowed him the gratuitous use of his office and books , he studied law , and obtained a license as an attorney at the age of twenty-three , and immediately went to hard work . Although far from being as well versed in his profession as he felt he ought to have been , his energy , industry , and punctuality soon procured him a large share of business , and enabled him to marry , and take upon himself the responsibility of a family . This was his situation when the great effort was made in Kentucky to destroy HENRY CLAY , because he voted for Mr. Adams for President . His enemies in the Lexington district , and especially in Fayette county , were most violent and bitter in denouncing him ; and at one time , in 1826 , thougli4 they could at the next election certainly carry the county against him ; their leader , General MeCalla , having only failed by some nine or ten votes at the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was urged to become a candidate for the Legislature . From his early boyhood he had been devoted in feeling to that illustrious man , looking upon him , as he ever since has done , as the " foremost man of the age , " as well as the most vilely pursued , persecuted , and calumniated by his enemies . Although in a manner a stranger to him-for Combs ' youth , and Mr. Clay 's almost continued absence from Kentucky in the public service , had given the latter no opportunity to know the former except as a passing acquaintance - Mr. Combs determined to enter upon his defense and support ; and for three successive years he canvassed the county from end to end , meeting Mr. Clay 's enemies every where before the people ; literally taking his life in his hand , and defying them . The first year he was elected by nearly one hundred majority , and the last by about five hundred ; thus placing the party in an impregnable majority . He then returned to his profession , and soon not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ones . // But it was contrary to Mr. Combs ' nature to be an idler , or an humble follower of any man . When , therefore , he entered upon the public service , he went earnestly to work , as he had previously done in his profession . Kentucky was at that time flooded with a depreciated paper currency , worth about fifty cents to the dollar , issued by the " Bank of the Commonwealth , " an institution which owed its origin to what was then called the " Relief " party , and which afterward became the Democratic or Loco-foco party in that State . Of public improvements , the State could boast none ; there were not five miles of turnpike-road within her wide borders ; a railroad had not even been thought of west of the mountains . As Chairman of the Committee of Finance , at the second or third session of his membership , he digested and reported a bill , which , after a severe struggle , and some slight modification , became a law , providing for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole paper system ; and no attempt has since been made to renew it . He also devoted himself to the euse of internal improvement , advocating turnpike charters , and proposing the first one for a railroad , when even Massachusetts could only boast of one , some four miles long , from the granite quarries to Boston . He was again a member of the Legislature in 1833-4 , and , as Chairman of the Committee on Internal Improvements , reported a volume of bills , under whose salutary infiuei*e that noble State has ever since been rapidly rising in wealth , comfort , and power . His means , too , were fi-eely contributed in taking stock ; all of which has since been bestowed upon a public library in Lexington . He was not again a candidate until 1845 , when he was chosen without the trouble of a canvass , and was at that session elected Speaker of the House of Representatives . The next year his name was again presented for the same office , by a large majority of the Whigs of the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inasmuch as there were several highly promi*ing young Whigs who desired it , and he was satisfied with the honor previously enjoyed . He has not since been a candidate for any State office . Mr. Combs never asked for an executive appointment of any kind in his life , having an utter disgust to office-seeking , and being wholly averse , in feeling to such self-abasement as is generally necessary to obtain favor at court . His first demonstration as a politician and public speaker on a national scale , was at the Harrisburg Whig Convention , in 1840 , when Governor Metcalfe and himself were the delegates for the State at large , fi-om Kentucky . They were very desirous for Mr. Clay 's nomination ; and it was , in Mr. Combs ' opinion , by a most unfortunate combination of circumstances and individuals , that his nomination was defeated . His never-to-beforgotten , self-sacrificing letter to the Convention had been handed to Mr. Combs by Mr. Archer , of Virginia ; and after General Harrison 's nomination , he read it to that body with a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken by surprise , and a large portion of the Whig party shocked by the injustice done to their great leader . He had kept Mr. Clay fully advised of every step taken , of every hope and fear which he entertained , up to the final consummation of the combined efforts of General Harrison , General Scott , and Mr. Webster , which finally defeated him . He believed then , and has never doubted since the election , that Mr. Clay could easily have triumphed over Mi ' . Van Buren . The people were tired , sick to death of his heartless selfishness and evident incompetency , and a change was inevitable . And what a blessing it would have been to the country to have had Henry Clay President foi- the succeeding four or eight years , instead of Tyler and Polk ! We need not dwell upon the facts of history , and the imaginings of such a contrast . Although Mr. Combs ' first and only choice had been defeated in the Convention , and by means which he boldly condemned , still , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an honorable man , had been nominated , he determined at once on his course . He felt that he owed a duty to the Whig party , to the country , to a gallant old soldier , under whose command he had suffered many hardships , and had shed his blood on the field of battle ; and he resolved to devote himself to the coming canvass . His first public address was in Philadelphia , to an immense multitude , the Monday night succeeding the nomination . All knew his devotion to Henry Clay , and were therefore // anxious to hear what he had to say for General Harrison . He had numerous clients in the crowd , who had known him for many years as an energetic , prompt , and vigilant attorney , but never dreamed that he had once been a soldier . " I shall never forget their evident astonishment , " says Mr. Combs , " when I took up the military life of the hero of Tippecanoe , and spoke of its leading events as familiarly as if they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been assailed as the cause of the defeat of Winchester at Raisin , and of Dudley at the Rapids ; and my vindication of him from these two charges was overwhelming and conclusive . I had been so connected with both of these disastrous events , as to render my testimony irrefutable . " From that time until the succeeding November , he almost gave up his profession ; and from New-York to New-Orleans , from Kentucky , through Tennessee and Virginia , to Delaware , was day after day addressing large multitudes . His dress was a simple hunting-shirt and sash , such as General Harrison wore at the battle of Tippecanoe , and when he first saw him afterwards ; such as his father had worn when he helped Daniel Boone to drive the Indians out of Kentucky , and such as the volunteers generally wore when they marched to the frontiers during the late war . The Whig press every where teemed with the highest-wrought eulogies of his speeches , and its applause might have turned the head of a man pr&amp;npted by less high and holy feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seem only to have stimulated him to still higher efforts . He spoke on the battlements of Yorktown on the anniversary of the surrender of Cornwallis , with Seargent , and Upham , and Wise ; at Lynchburg , a few days afterwards , with Rives , and Leigh , and Preston ; at Richmond on three several nights , the last time to some thousand ladies . Thousands of living witnesses still remain to attest the effects of his addresses ; while the files of the Richmond Whig of that day , then edited by th' talented and lamented Pleasants , bear testimony to the character and effect of these appeals . The election over , and General Harrison President , General Combs asked for nothing , and nothing was offered to him , while hundreds , who had rendered comparatively but little service , were clamorQus for reward , and some of them received high offices . The real champion of the conflict-he whose morning bugle had often roused a thousand men to arms , and who never wearied , day or night , in doing his duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph , while others stepped forward and enjoyed the fruits of the victory . If Peter the Hermit felt the inspiration of his holy cause when preaching a crusade against the infidels in possession of Jerusalem , so did Mr. Combs in his against the corruptions and usurpations of power in the city of Washington . All selfishness was absorbed in his burning desire to drive the Goths from the Capitol ; and he valued more highly the outpourings of public approbation which every where greeted his efforts , than he would have done any official position which could have been offered him . The noble-hearted Whigs of little Delaware presented him with a most substantial evidence of their confidence and gratitude , by the presentation of a magnificent piece of plate , with the following inscription " To General Leslie Combs , of Kentucky , from a number of his Democratic Whig friends of Newcastle county , Delaware , in testimony of their high regard for him as a patriot and soldier in the Northwestern compaiga of 1812 and 13 , whilst yet a youth , and as the able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tippecanoe and the Thames , in the political campaign of 1840 . " Four years afterwards , when the farmer of Ashland received the nomination of the Baltimore Convention , he again took the field , although he knew that he would thereby lose a large portion of his remaining clients and business , which had become more important to him from pecuniary embarrassment , induced by large investments in the Texan War Debt . After canvassing a large portion of Kentucky , previous to the August election , he directed himself during the months of September , October , and November , to Virginia , Pennsylvania , and NewYork . He made a rapid passage through Virginia , from Abingdon , by way of Lynchburg , Richmond , and Yorktown , to Norfolk , arousing the Whigs every where , and urging the Democrats to stand by their noblest son , towering as he did in fame and public services as high above his competitor as the peaks of the Alleghanies above the mole-hills // at their base . But all in vain . They were wedded to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice , truth , gratitude , fraternal or maternal love ? Henry Clay was to be immolated under the remorseless car of this modern Juggernaut ; and who so proper as his own mother to use the sacrificial knife ? It was done . Mr. Combs appealed to Pennsylvania and New-York to stand by and sustain the great father of the American system , the steadfast friend of human labor in all its forms , against the false traitors and pretended friends , who would certainly prostrate our rising manufactures and mechanical pursuits ; but they would not heed him . They , too , cried out , " Crucify him , crucify him 1 " and he was crucified . Oh , what a reckoning they have yet to settle for this outrageous wrong to America 's great statesman ! Of the many scenes of deep excitement through which the subject of our notice passed during this ever-memorable campaign , we shall refer but to one of prominent interest . It occurred at New-Haven , Connecticut . Mr. Combs had been invited to be present at a great Whig gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointed time . The principal streets were most magnificently decorated with flags and banners , bearing mottoes of appropriate significance . The crowd was innumerable , and moved by the highest enthusiasm . Senator Berrien , of Georgia , first addressed them , followed by Mr. White , of New-York , from a broad platform , covered by the most venerable and distinguished sons of the pilgrim fathers . " Indeed , " says Mr. Combs , in allusion to this occasion , " when I looked around me , I felt as if I were in the midst of that daring band of holy men who had crossed the broad Atlantic in quest of civil and religious liberty . " Instead of speaking from the stand , a light wagon was placed for him to stand in , near the centre of the crowd , so as to be better heard . He spoke about two l*ours . At the commencement , be had asserted his belief in an overruling Providence in all things ; that there was ever present " a Divinity that shapes our ends , rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the orphan 's father and the widow 's husband had , in early life , taken an orphan boy in the slashes of Hanover , and led him on , step by step , from one great deed to another , till now , When his history should be written , and justice done him , he would occupy a pinnacle of glory high as Chimborazo 's loftiest peak , with Mount Olympus piled upon it . Like an eagle high in air , shot at by the poisoned shafts of calumny on every side , he still flies higher , and with prouder pinion , towards his mountain eyrie . " Look at him 1 " exclaimed the speaker , as he threw his hands upwards , and involuntarily the eyes of the multitude followed his gesture . Such a shout as instantly rent the skies was scarce ever heard before , or such a waving of handkerchiefs seen as was exhibited by the thousand ladies who were present . Casting his eyes upwards , he beheld an American eagle some few hundred feet distant , grace* fully flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He folded his arms , and , looking at it for a moment , exclaimed , in a thrilling tone of voice , " I have told you , fellow-citizens , that there were no accidents on earth or in heaven , and I hail this as a happy omen . Fly on , and still fly higher , proud bird of my country 's banner ; and long may you continue to ornament the flag which waves over the land of the free and home of the brave ! " No one present will ever forget the scene . As the Whigs of little Delaware manifested their gratitude to him by the presentation of a magnificent piece of plate in 1840 , so also did those of the Empire State in 1844 , with the following simple , but touching inscription " From the Whigs of Kings county , New-York , to General Leslie Combs , of Kentucky , the friend of Henry Clay . " November , 1844 . " Si Pergama dextris , Defendi possent , etiam hAc defensa fnissent. * ' The defeat of Henry Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profound sensation throughout America ; and when the vile duplicity and falsehood of the Democratic party in Pennsylvania is remembered , where every standard was emblazoned with " Polk , Dallas , and the Tariff of 1842 ; " while every where in the North it was unblushingly asserted that Polk was a better protective tariff man than Henry Clay , at the same time that he was supported in the South as an advocate of free trade ; it can not be wondered at that both he and Dallas // afterwards betrayed the North ; and the ruinous Tariff Act of 1846 was passed , which has already prostrated some of our most important manufactures . Indeed , but for the opportune discovery of the rich gold-mines of California , we should , ere this , have had another commercial crash such as desolated the country in 1837-8 ; for it is indisputably true that the balance of trade for the last year has been so much against us that it has required the shipment of over sixty millions of the precious metal , as well as large amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deficit . General Combs was the last man to leave this great battle-field ; for , on the very day of the election in New-York , he passed from Albany to New-York city , and at every landing of the steamer stimulated the crowd , who were anxiously expecting the election news from Ohio , urging them to poll every vote in their power for Henry Clay , for that every thing depended on the Empire State . Such afterwards proved to be the case ; and , but for the gross frauds in the city of New-York , Polk would have been defeated , and the great cause of American labor gloriously triumphant . The Empire Club did the dark deed , which has since produced such wide-spread ruin and distress in some of our manufacturing districts , especially in Pennsylvania . A man of kss sanguine temperament , or one more calculating in his friendship , and less truly devoted to Henry Clay in all his fortunes thai General Combs , might have been led away by the loud shouting and deep enthusiasm naturally excited by the brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful hearts of millions of true Whigs in America throbbed with joy at the suggestion of his name in connection with the Presidential office . Even in Kentucky , multitudes of Mr. Clay 's constant supporters and some of his oldest friends avowed themselves in favor of General Taylor , as the most available candidate ; and some men denounced Mr. Clay as selfish and ambitious ; but General Combs never hesitated , nev'er faltered . " Faithful found among the faithless ; Faithful only he amid innumerable false . " " Unmoved , unshaken , unseduced , unterrified . " And so he continued till the last moment in Philadelphia , when the National Whig Convention decided in favor of General Taylor . Fatigue , loss of rest , anxiety of mind , had by this time prostrated General Combs on a sick-bed ; yet , when Independence Square was in the evening filled by tens of thousands of anxious Whigs , mainly the devoted friends of Henry Clay , it was deemed most - important to have an address made by General Combs , the long-tried and Ever-faithful friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to encounter ; yet , when lifted to the stand , he pronounced that brief and most thrilling address , which was at the time listened to in breathless silence , and given on the lightning 's winds to the utmost corners of the United States . But no report of it could do justice to the impressive manner and evidently deep emotions of the speaker , while he seemed to feel that he was giving up for ever the hope of his whole life to see Henry Clay President of the United States . Considering the success of the Whig cause as above all other considerations , he pursued the same course in 1848 that he had done in 1840 . From Maine to Indiana his voice was every where heard in private circles and in public assemblages of the people , urging all to unite in the support of General Taylor ; and hundreds of thousands yet live to testify to the power and effect of his speeches . Neither General Harrison nor General Taylor ever forgot ( we will not say forgave ) his unalterable attachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more for each after his nomination than any other one man in America did , they acted towards him as if they only remembered his opposition to their nomination by the Whig party . They never evinced the slightest gratitude for his efficient and disinterested advocacy of their claim before the people . But that may be allowed to pass . Mr. Combs had his own self-approbation , and the high confidence of the great Whig party , and they were infinitely more valuable than court favor and official patronage . We come now to Mr. Combs ' last political campaign ; and shall treat it briefly . His competitor was allied by blood and marriage to several numerous wealthy and influential Whig families in the district ; had been himself a Whig in early life ; was the present pride and hope of the Democracy ; and // thus concentrated all their support . General Combs had no such extra aid or sympathy in the canvass . The mass of the Whigs believed he was invincible , and that therefore they need make no effort . In a long professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who took this occasion to gratify personal vengeance at the sacrifice of political principle . Some hundreds of the first class did not go to the polls . A few of the latter were active and violent against him , and he was defeated . But he died on the plateau of the battlefield , in the front rank of the Whig army , with the Whig banner around him as his winding-sheet . He sustained the Union , the compromise , the cause of American labor and internal improvements , as presented by Millard Fillmore ; and he would rather thus have fallen than have achieved victory by any sacrifice of principle or personal independence . Those who fly from the battle-field , and those who hide in the ravines and ditches while the balls are flying thickest , are disgraced by defeat , and not the leader who bravely fights and falls in the combat . Among the many high and honorable names recorded in his support are those of Henry Clay and J *J . Crittenden . Mr. Combs has no complaints to make against those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still obvious ; to hold on to Whig principles only the more firmly because the timid and treacherous abandon them . He has ever preached and endeavored to practise the philosophy that the world was intended by its Creator to be governed , not by force and violence , but by love and truthlove , embracing all benevolence of thought and act , and truth in deed as well as in word . To his rigid observance of these two great moral landmarks may be attributed the remarkable effect of his public speeches . He never berated or denounced bitterly his opponents . He lectured them , criticized them , and endeavored to refute their arguments in good temper ; and he never uttered a word on the stump which he did not believe to be true , nor expressed a sentiment which he did not most sincerely entertain . When he commenced life , he set himself to work first to attain pecuniary independence by his own labor , and , second , to do all the good he could to all around him . His first production , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was an argument and appeal in favor of a lunatic asylum in Kentucky . There was not one then west of the mountains , and only three or four in America . A few humane men in Lexington took up the subject , and the result was the commencement of the present magnificent establishment , which has ever since been dispensing its blessings in the State . At a later date , he aided the public library by a large donation , considering his limited means ; stimulated the establishment of public free-schools , and a female orphan asylum ; all of which are now conferring inestimable benefits upon the community . Not a church has been erected in Lexington , Protestant or Catholic , for whites or blacks , to which he did not contribute his mite . In 1833 , he passed through the severest ordeal of his life . When the Asiatic cholera first made its appearance on this continent , ( in Canada , we believe , ) scattering death in its path and all around , an almost universal panic seized upon the public mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the scene of its first desolation , and pervaded to . a great extent the community of General Combs ' residence as well as others , although the medical faculty there assured the people that they were in no danger ; that their position was so elevated and healthful , that if it should even " rain pestilence upon them , it would run off . " The consternation of the community may be easily imagined , when , in June , 1833 , that mysterious disease burst forth in all its fury in their midst , sparing neither age nor sex ; old men and children , master and slave , seeming alike subject to its sudden and fatal visitation . Its first known demonstration was in General Combs ' own family , upon the person of a favorite servant , who died in a few hours ; thence it spread amone ' 1 immediate neighbors . Thousands fled to the mountains , leaving their houses deserted or in care of their slaves , who , being thus abandoned , became more alarmed , and consequently more liable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not even visit their relatives and dearest friends . A high duty seemed to devolve upon Mr. Combs . With a calm and determined front he met it , and went to work to study the disease , endeavor to arrest its progress , and relieve its subjects . He never stopped , except for brief periods of rest , day or night , for more than thirty days , // 155 devoting himself wholly to the sick and suffering ; rich and poor , black and white , bond and free , friend and foe , alike received his services , sometimes in the most menial and disgustful offices at their bedsides . It may be justly claimed for him that he was the instrument of hope , of relief , of prolonged life to many . He had a full sweep of vengeance upon his enemies-he had a few such-and upon his political persecutors , by helping them when they could not help themselves , and felt as if they were abandoned by every friend on earth . " It was a glorious triumph , " is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange it for a victory on the battle-field , or the highest political promotion-so help me God ! " The entire population of Lexington was almost decimated in a month . Mr. Combs had met the British and the Indians in hostile array ; had been wounded , and a prisoner , subjected to every savage barbarity ; but he had never before found such a foe as the cholera of 1833 , 50 horrid , relentless and terrific , in act and aspect . His escape from it , exposed as he was , seemed almost miraculous ; for he was not touched till near the close of the season of the epidemic , and then not very violently . His health is still perfect , and he retains all the vigor and elasticity of early manhood . In all the relations of life , General Combs has discharged the obligations growing out of those relations with scrupulous fidelity . Enterprising and public-spirited , he has ever been among*he foremost in promoting any scheme having for its object the public good , and has liberally used his means in contributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a member of the Legislature of Kentucky , and chairman of the Committee of Internal Improvements *n 1833 , he strenuously advocated a system uf internal improvements , which , by his influence , was partially adopted , and which has done much towards placing the State in its present high position . As a private citizen , within the last few years he has devoted himself to the work of arousing the publi* mind to the importance of railroad communication ; and by his addresses , and through the press , has done more , perhaps , than any other man , in awakening the people of Kentucky to the necessity of prompt and vigorous action in this behalf . The result is seen in the various lines of road projected and now under progress , and by which the entire State will , in the course- of a few years , be traversed . Such indeed has been his characteristic energy and zeal in matters of this sort , that when any thing was to be done , he was looked to , to take the lead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's friend ; and never was an appeal made to him in vain in behalf of suffering humanity . During one of his tours in the Presidential campaign of 1844 , he chanced to stop at a country church in Virginia , and heard the pastor deliver his farewell sermon , in the course of which some remarks were made in reference to the pecuniary embarrassment which forced the separation of this old shepherd from his flock . Upon the return of General Combs home , he immediately enclosed a sum of money to this old minister , whom for the first and last time he saw but for a few minutes on that Sabbath , and to whom he was an entire stranger . Accident made the writer of this acquainted with this circumstance , a knowledge of which has hitherto been confined to the parties to it and himself . A favorite plan of benevolence with General Combs has been to assist in bringing forward poor young men of talent , assisting them in their studies , recommending them to public favor , and aiding them in getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reason to thank the good fortune that threw them in his way . In 1833 , while the cholera was raging with extreme violence in Lexington , one of its first victims was a bitter personal enemy ; and yet , while fear drove others from his bedside , General Combs nursed him with all the care and tenderness of a devoted friend . The annual election for members of the General Assembly came on a short time after the pestilence had subsided , and the citizens of Lexington and Fayette county testified their gratitude for his humane exertions by bestowing upon him their unsolicited suffrages , and electing him to the Legislature . The writer of this has had opportunities which few have enjoyed of studying thoroughly the character of the subject of this sketch , and it affords him the highest gratification to bear testimony to his unbending integrity , his firmness of purpose in maintaining the right at every hazard , his manly independence , his benevolence of disposition , and , in short , all those high qualities which make up the true man  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
