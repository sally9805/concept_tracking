UNITED STATES REVIEW . JUNE , 1853 . THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STATE OF EUROPE . Fn*xiwE-which has long aspired to be the leader of the civilized world , inliterature , civilization , refinement , manners and fashions ; whose language is almost universal , and whose milliners prescribe laws to the ladies-may be almost said to have murdered liberty in its cradle . By the example she presented in the first revolution , and by the excesses then committed , she caused humanity to shudder at its very name ; by the propagation of a farrago of disorganizing principles calculated to uproot the entire system of social organization , and associating them with the hallowed name of freedom , she rallied against it all who had rights or property to lose ; and now , by having again voluntarily prostituted herself to the embraces of despotism , she has exhibited an example to Europe and the world , more discouraging to nations , more fatal to their hopes of freedom , than that of her first revolution . Even the people of the United States , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring her nearer to that shrine at which she had offered up such bloody sacrifices , now view her as a wayward , capricious child , that either knows not what it wants , or is too flighty and unpurposed to pursue it steadily , or to grasp it when within reach . But who shall claim the right to do as they please in things which concern themselves alone , if not nations ? As citizens of the United States , holding that every people has a right to choose its own form of government , we can not deny this right to France ; and if we believed that Napoleon the Third had really been chosen by the free voice of the French people , // however we might be mortified and amazed , we woi4d say at once they had a right to become slaves if they wished to be slaves . But we consider the election of Louis Napoleon a farce . At the very moment that election took place , nearly one third of the departments of France were in such a state of disaffection that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes of the Imperial candidate ; and can it be supposed that an election could be free under such circumstances , or that , if it were , the departments thus in a state of siege would have voted almost unanimouslyfor the man to whom they were so disaffected , that it was necessary to coerce them imito submission by a military force ? The idea is monstrous , incredible ; and the conclusion must be , that these people , if they voted at all , were coerced or overawed in the exercise of the right of suffrage . There was but one candidate permitted , and even if they had freely exercised that right , it was " Hopson 's choice , " that or none . It is , however , assumed that the nation is satisfied ; and if so , we would not , if we could , disturb itsrepose . But here , too , we are incredulous . We do not believe the nation is satisfied . But this we can never know except by an open outbreak of the people . The Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the voice of the people smothered . The free expression of opinion on the part of one is followed by sequestration , fine , and imprisonment , and the outburst of popular feeling is sedition and treason . In this state of things the Emuperor of France will , without doubt , be the most adored of sovereigns , and the people the most loyal and devoted of slaves . They can no longer complain , and in future must give expression to their feelings in that mode which is said to speak louder than words . We shall probably see no more clouds in the sky until the scorching lightning flashes forth , and the blast of the whirlwind comes . Those who believe they have as yet seen any more than what Talleyraud aptly called " the beginning of the end , " may live to see many other acts of that drama , the first of which opened in the New World in 1776 ; and those who calmly and dispassionately contemplate the present social and political state of Europe can not , we think , fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fermenting in her bosom . The principles asserted in the American Declaration of Independence were not merely limited to states , but extended to individuals ; and while vindicating the independence of one , they established the rights of the other . They were social as well as political , and involved within them a radical chang&amp; // in that system of social organization which ha*separated men of the same race and color from each other , giving to one class rights which were to be inalienable , and placing the other under disqualifications equally perpetual . These principles are daily spreading throughout Enrope , and acquiring new force from the spectacle exhibited of the consequences of their practical application in the United States . They may be trodden under foot , but can not be crushed to death ; they may be subdued , but can not be annihilated . They are innate in the heart of man , and constitute a part of his very nature . The materials on which they act , so far from being exhausted , are every day accumulating , and must inevitably produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arrayed against the artificial vigor of hireling soldiers and standing armies . What the result will be , depends not on people or armies , but the Lord of Hosts . We ourselves earnestly hope , though humbly , that the great and final contest will yet result in the triumph of the young and vigorous spirit of freedom born and nursed in the Kew World , over the portentous phantom of despotic power which has so long stalked rough-shod over the Old . That the spirit of freedom is still abroad in Europe is quite certain . The people can no longer live quietly under a despotism , though they may not yet be qualified for the enjoyment of liberty . But this , though a strong , is not , we think , a decisive argument in favor of keeping them in a condition which forever precludes them from becoming so . This would render all improvement impossible* and as well might we attempt to educate children by preventing them from going to school , as to prepare men for the enjoyment of liberty by keeping them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they learn everything else , by example , experience , reflection , and , we may add , by suffering . But however this may be , a multitude of pregnant indications , continually manifesting themselves , serve to show that the blood offered up at the shrine of liberty during the French Revolution has not been shed in vain . Liberty , like religion , must have its martyrs . The Reformation of the Church cost its millions , and the reformation of States can not be accomplished without great sacrifices . Such seems to be the dispensation of Providence . For every good we enjoy we pay the price ; and saving the gift of life , there is nothing beneficial bestowed on us without equivalent . To enjoy the bleesings of the future , we must , in some measure , sacrifice the // present ; and a happy old age can only be attained by*a youth of self-denial . Unless the sovereigns of Europe voluntarily acquiesce in the demands of the people for constitutional government , they will , assuredly , entail on themselves and their successors-if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anxieties , for which an imperial diadem is no recompense , and , finally , become victims in exiles , or , at best , only reign over serfs . Thus the Emperor of Austria , by encroaching on the ancient national rights of Hungary , has converted eight or ten millions of once loyal subjects into so many discontented slaves . The triumph , not of hireling soldiers , but of the peasantry of Austria , Prussia , and the minor states of Germany , over these invaders , their armies could not withstand , gave them , for the first time , an insight into their irresistible might , when armed , and acting in concert , under the powerful impulse of patriotism . They fought for their country , not for their kings ; not in gratitude for past , but in anticipation of future benefits . They were promised constitutional governments , one branch of which was to be based on representation , which promises have either been superciliously evaded or treacherously denied . They asked for a share in the power of the states which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered by the bayonet . In a few instances , indeed , they were deluded with the shadow of freedom , and permitted to send representatives to legislative bodies , without the power of legislation , since they could not even debate a law which had not been first proposed by the Sovereign . In short , they found themselves grossly deceived , and from the period in which the Congress of Vienna , as was boasted , restored peace to Europe , by robbing Peter to pay Paul , and without taking any effectual measures to cancel the obligation which the sovereigns owed to the people who saved their thrones , a deep feeling of just indignation has pervaded the masses of Germany , Prussia , and Italy . That attachment to their rulers , which had been awakened by promised benefits , has been replaced by hatred of their oppressors , and contenipt for their want of faith . At the same time , the accumulation of national debts , and national burdens , even in time of profound peace , every day adds to their sufferings and discontent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crisis . Despotism , undisguised and uncontrolled , has been proclaimed in Germany ; that great confederation of *states has been dissolved by imperial edicts ; the Emperor of Austria has become Emperor of Germany , and the ancient rights // of the minor states have been , in a great measure , absorbed by imperial usurpation . The abuses of European governments , which have been accumulating for ages , have at length extinguished the sentiment of loyalty , except in the breasts of those who fatten on the spoils of the people , and weakened , if not destroyed , all attachment to that native soil which no longer affords bread to their mouths or security to their rights . They are flocking to the United States by hundreds of thousands , allured by an attraction as irresistible as that of the needle to the pole . Germany especially is losing the most valuable portion of her people , who leave behind only those who want the means ofemigrating , or who are destitute of the energy and vigor of mind for such an enterprise . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ridicule and contempt wherever the Public Press retains the slightest vestige of freedom . They are cciricatured , laughed at , and despised , as well as hated . Their power may still exist under protection of the bayonet , but their authority is daily undermined by the absence of all that personal respect , that habitual deference , which is one of the great pillars of royalty that would otherwise depend alone on corruption and force . Not even despotism can survive contempt . Nero himself might have continued to reign , had he not turned fiddler , and excited the laughter of Rome . It is becoming every day more evident , that kings can no longer riot in that freedom of will , that capricious wilfulness , which they have for ages indulged in governing their subjects , even with the aid of standing armies . The nations of Europe will not forever submit to be robbed of the necessaries of life to pay soldiers for oppressing them , unless they have become too degraded to be desperate . We hold it to be impossible for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain itself in opposition to the opinions and feelings of its subjects . If these are arrayed against it , its foundations are laid in the sand . It has no substantial basis , and will either gradually moulder away , or perish by a sudden crash that will scatter its fragments to the winds . The monarchs of Europe never committed a greater error than in adopting the opinion that their interests and those of the people were not only separate but antagonistical . By doing so , they converted their diadems into crowns of thorns , and laid the foundation for their certain overthrow . At this moment loyalty is no part of the popular creed . It is , in a great measure , confined to the aristocracies , whose very being is insepa* // rably intertwined with the existence of the monarch ; High Church dignitaries equally dependent , or those who aspire to succeed them ; pensioners , and civil officers ; soldiers who fight for pay ; and to a small class of upstart money-mongers , who aspire to aristocracy , or who think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approaching dissolution , not only of the political but social system of Europe , is seen in the rapid increase of that coolness , if not dislike , which is supposed by many to be the natural and inevitable result of the relative position of what are called the higher and lower orders . We ourselves are rather inclined to trace it on t the latter , to that assumption of superiority , ' he part of power which wealth and station confer , and that abuse of the and which is too often exhibited in the deportment and conduct of the rich towards the poor . There is no stronger tie among men than that of mutual benefits ; and if the wealthy landlord or employer were to govern his conduct by the recollection of what is undoubtedly the fact , that he depends solely , for all the enjoyments his riches confer , on the labors of the very men whom he affects to despise , we are very apt to believe the two classes , instead of forming opposite interests in the state , would live together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have enlisted in the cause of aristocracy often reproach the laboring classes for cherishing this feeling of dislike towards their superiors , considering the vast sums contributed to the poor-rates , the liberal subscriptions of the wealthy patricians , and the unwearied efforts of philanthropists to ameliorate their moral condition . But there is a mode of relieving poor people that will make them hate you . A gift unaccompanied by kindness is an insult ; and charity , in order to awaken gratitnde , should be clothed in smiles or tears . Besides , a people not altogether debased require something better than alms . They are ambitious of becoming independent of these by their own honest exertions , and to occupy a position among their fellow-creatures where it will not be necessary to become paupers to escape starvation . Even the people of England , degraded and demoralized as they are by generations of pauperism , are not yet quite so base as to prefer a poor-house to a cottage , however humble , or extorted charity to liberal wages . This is not the way to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling slaves to the power that gives them bread ; and hence all observant travellers in England have noticed the abject deference , the cringing servility of the lower // orders towards the higher , most especially the titled nobility . The southern slave approaches his master without fear , and looks him full in the face ; but the freeborn Englishman crouches before his lord , and , like the slave , is more proud of the wealth and dignity of his superior than sensible of his own inferiority . We ourselves have occasionally had English servants who brought recommendations from noblemen they had served , and it was amusing to see the airs of superiority they assumed over the plebeians of the kitchen , and to hear them dilating on the splendors of his lordship , without being conscious that they only increased their own insignificance . The English poor fawn on the rich , and hate them . Independently of the causes just referred to , the contrast of unbounded luxury and dazzling splendor with squalid poverty is painfully humiliating to that latent feeling of pride which often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or alleviate it but kindness and condescension on the part of wealth and station , since Providence hath decreed that , as the social virtues are the great bonds of society , they should be invariably rewarded by the good-will of all those on whom they are exercised . This is not , however , the policy or practice of the rich towards the poor of England . They have , by their influence , procured the passage of gamelaws , by which they are subjected to grievous penalties for knocking down a hare or a partridge , though it should be in the extremity of hunger , or to relieve a starving family . They have enclosed vast tracts of common lands , in many ways beneficial to the people , and appropriated them to their purposes ; and they have , by their influence , restricted the little indulgences , amusements , and recreations of the people , such as they had been accustomed to for ages past , by laws which , while bearing hard on the poor , left the rich their full swing of indulgence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more so on the continent of Europe , where , with the exception of France , some of the worst features of the old feudal system are still preserved , and every foot of land , and everyproductof the earth , may be said to be monopolized by the privileged orders . In some *countries , the people are not allowed to bake their own bread ; in others , they must buy their meat from a special butcher at . a specified price ; and in others , even acorns are a monopoly . In short , they are crimped and cribbed in everything . The veriest slave of the most rigid master of the South would revolt at the petty tyrannical restrictions imposed on the subjects of those monarchs , and the serfs of those nobles , // who pretend to commiserate his fate . The condition of these oppressed people may be judged of from the fact that they envy even those of England , and believe them to be free by comparison . This unfriendly , if not hostile feeling of the lower orders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a groundless , unprovoked antipathy . The result is natural and inevitable , and indicates no depravity . It may be called instinctive ; for even children and animals recoil from those who treat them with unkindness . It originates in causes which everywhere , and at all times , produce the same consequences ; and it will be greatly aggravated when the lower orders begin to comprehend that this impassable chasm , which yawns between them and their oppressors , is the work of man , not of his Maker . When , on one hand , is seen a small , an exceeding small portion of a community or nation , generation after generation , revelling in superfluous wealth , and enjoying all the luxuries of boundless prodigality , accompanied by a hereditary pre-eminenc9 over the mighty million , independently of all moral , physical , or intellectual qualities , and which caminot be forfeited by any of the follies , faults , or weaknesses that reduce other men to poverty , insignificance , and contempt ; and when they see , on the other hand , masses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color , condemned , without any fault of their own , to hereditary , hard , unremitting labor , remunerated only by ceaseless privation ,  --  when they see and feel all this , the contrast can not but become more painful , and the feeling it awakens more bitterly humiliating These poor people will not be satisfied by being told that such inequalities are the price of national glory , and inseparable from a state of extreme civilization and refinement . They will not inquire whether they are , or are not , essential to eminence in science , arts , and literature ; to the erection of splendid palaces and churches ; to the construction of canals and rail-roads , or the perfection ' of steam-engines and spinning-jennies . Nor will they question themselves as to the comparative happiness of those who have food without appetite , and those who have appetite without food . Whil&amp; they see the rich clinging to their wealth as the source of all their *njoyments , and recoiling from sharing even a small portion with them , it is useless to attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equality with that of the wealthy , as respects the general diffusion of happiness . They will not believe it . They will envy the rich , and envy is but another name for hatred . They are very poor , and , if you pleaser // very ignorant and debased . Yet , with all the ignorance , they can tell where the shoe pinches , though they may not be expert cobblers . It can not be denied that they are a sort of rational beings , and as such , it is difficult to convince them that the happiness of one man , though he be a king or a bishop , is of more weight in the scale of justice and humanity , than that of thousands , nay , millions , of their fellow-creatures . In the United States , there is as yet no hereditary dislike or hostility between the rich and the poor , because neither poverty nor riches are entailed from generation to generation . Neither are there any artificial obstacles placed in the way of industry and economy . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results , and the consequence is that there is no such thing as hereditary poverty in this country , except among the free Negroes . By far the larger portion of our rich men began the world poor ; and not a small portion of our poor are the descendants of the rich . One goes in at the small end of the horn , and comes out at the big one , the other vice versa . There is , therefore , no permanent rivalry or antipathy between the rich and the poor of the United States , because they know not how soon they may change places with each other . At the worst , it is only the rivalry of a single generation . The poor man does not desire to deprive his rich neighbor of the advantages he may possess , because he looks forward to one day becoming rich himself . To change the property of this country does not require a violent revolution . It is going on imperceptibly , without any internal convulsion , and it is not necessary to overthrow the state in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share of the spoils .. We , therefore , consider this government as at this moment based on a more sure and permanent foundation than any other in the world . Nothing but fanaticism , in the shape of abolition , can bring about its overthrow . But to return to our subject . Nor is there any love lost between the two antagonist interests into which Europe is divided so unequally . The privileged orders are not more cordially disposed towards the base vulgar , as they consider those who gain a livelihood by honest labor . Where polished manners are considered a substitute for correct morals , and the mode of doing a thing of more consequence than the thing itself , the former becomes the great standard by which men are estimated ; and he who makes an awkward bow , enters a room ungracefully , eats with a knife instead of a silver fork , carries dirt on his boots , or is deficient in the manoeuvres of a dinner-table or evening // party , is very apt to be considered an inferior bQing , by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , like manners , makes the man , who , according to the sage philosopher , Martinus Scriblerus , is the mere appendage ; and the poor are very apt to be out of fashion . Last , comes the aristocratic foot , hand , and ear , which , like the long nails of the Chinese , are indisputable marks of high blood and breeding . In all these , the laboring class is sadly deficient . Thus , though the rich and noble in England are sometimes charitable to the poor , especially when a subscription-list is headed by the Queen , it is by no means certain that the giver is actuated by kindly feelings , or that the receiver will be grateful . The best bond of amity is mutual good offices , and the best of all charity is that of rewarding labor with the full value of its exertions . Charity may ennoble the giver , but not the receiver ; and in the whole course of our reading and experience , we have never met with a nation of beggars and ptiupers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To screw men down to what is delicately called the minimum-in other words , the wages of starvation by inches , and then make up a portion of the deficiency by charity , is one of the most certain modes of debasing a people ; and so far from awakening grateful feelings , renders the poor victims of this ambide*ter system , for the most part , incapable of gratitude or any other virtue . On the contrary , he who receives the proper equivalent for his labor-by which we mean what will suffice for the decent support of his family-feels himself under no obligation , because he has earned his reward . He has given the full equivalent , and so far the parties are equal . This is the only . sure , and at the same time salutary influence that produces a harmonious cooperation of the different orders of society , by giving to every man what is justly his duelabor to one , reward to the other . This constitutes the strongest ligament of society , the great principle of attraction which regulates the moral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of mankind from crushing each other . Even savages recognize the obligation of mutual benefits . It is related , that , in the early stage of the partial subjugation of New Mexico by the Spaniards , one of them was taken prisoner by the Comanches , who were about to put him to death in their usual barbarous manner , when he managed by signs to make them understand that lie could teach them something very useful . Acc6rdingly they releas6d him from his bonds , when he showed them how to manage the horses which they had now captured for the first time . The savages were 50 // delighted with this new acquisition , that they ad*pted him , and he , in process of time , became the head chief of the tribe . That the privileged orders of England , and the continent of Europe , have little if any of what is familiarly called fellowfeeling with the laboring classes , is sufficiently evident from the horror with which they recoil from all connection of blood , as well as all social intercourse on equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States for declining to amalgamate with slaves of a different race , color and physical organization . Nothing but money , that universal leveller in modern times , can bring them into alliance or intercourse with the vulgar millionaire . This dispensation-not of the Pope , but Plutus-has however been extremely fortunate for the nobility of England , many of whom would probably be now on the parish , had not they or their ancestors condescended to wed a city heiress , and thus recruit their finances with the spoils of some eminent tallow-chandler , porkbutcher , or shaver of bonds , bills , and notes of hand . In addition to these causes of alienation , there is another , acting most powerfully on that distaste to the people , which is an invariable characteristic of aristocracy . The people are becoming too formidable to be any longer despised . They are beginni*ig to be feared . The many are gradually acquiring a perception of their power , and the sense of individual weakness has been superseded by the consciousness of combined strength . That scorn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , and which had become one of the heir-looms of aristocracy , is rapidly giving place to an increasing apprehension of their power , and a jealousy of their will . The privileged orders anticipate an approaching struggle between the past and the present , which is to decide the aspect of the future , and settle the question , whether the living or the dead are to govern . Thus the relative position of the few and the many is changing , and that fe&amp;ling of hereditary inferiority , which heretofore cowed the latter into submission , is now transferred to the former , since , however its individual members may challenge a superiority , they can not but be sensible of aggregate weakness . They begin to cower under the potency of the popular feeling , and are seeking protection behind the bayonets of hireling soldiers , and the bludgeons of a hireling police . Thus the aristocracy and the people ,  --  those who inherit all , and those who inherit nothing ,  --  so far from being mutual elements of strength to European nations , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends , become a bloody struggle , which is // only postponed by the interposition of standing% armies , now the only peace officers . All these great states are now virtually nothing more than military despotisms . They are not based on love , but fear , and their only cement is force . It is sufficiently evident , that a long series of oppression has alienated a great portion of the people of Europe , and destroyed all attachment to their governments . It is true that the people have not as yet risen in mass , for there is always a large class of every nation , not absolutely crushed by an Oriental despotism , averse to war and violence , and who are content to remain quiet under every privation except that of food . These can only be stimulated to action by starvation , and require merely to be fed . But there is a smaller class of daring and adventurous spirits , that always takes the lead , and often makes that easy which was before deemed impossible . Europe abounds in these , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This fact is fully recognized in the fears of IRussia and Austria , with regard to the Hungarian exiles , and in their earnest requisitions on Turkey , England , Switzerland and Belgium , for the expulsion of all exiles from their territories . Still more palpably is it evinced in their jealousy of the press , and the efforts to suppress all freedom of qpinion . They seem to be aware of the precarious state of Europe , and that a newspaper can overthrow their empires . Such an apprehension can only originate in a conviction that they contain a mass of combustibles which only requires a spark to set it in flames . The necessity of great standing armies to enforce obedience is sufficient evidence that a large portion of the people of Europe are disaffected to their governments , and , if they had the power , would either change or overthrow them . To this , however , strange as it may appear , Russia , though an almost eastern despotism , is an exception . The Russians are unquestionably loyal to the present Emperor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his person , or a feeling of patriotism , as from religious bigotry . The people identify their government with their religion , and have been taught to believe them inseparable . They are excessively ignorant , and excessively bigoted , * and are fully assured that a change in one would inevitably bring about the downfall of the other . Thus bigotry supplies the place of patriotism , and all desire of liberty is superseded by apprehensions for the safety of the church . So long as this state of things continues , we look upon the government of Russia as the most stable in Europe . // With this exception , the vast standing armies , i*aintained at the expense of the people , are rather for the purpose of preserving internal tranquillity and order , * than for defence against external enemies . At a time when Europe is staggering under a debt of more than sixteen hundred millions of pounds sterling , and not yet recovered from the exhaustion of the wars growing out of the French revolution , nearly two millions of soldiers are quartered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , which no longer exists , but in reality to awe the people into quiet , enforce their submission , or suppress every effort for reform . ilnudreds of millions of dollars are annually wrested from the people or raised by loans , for which they are responsible , and the interest of which they must pay , for the purpose of hiring soldiers , whose bayonets are oftener pointed against themselves than their enemies , and thus the same instrument is employed to rob them of their rights and their bread . Previous to the last revolution that exiled James the Second , which gave a terrible blow to legitimacy , and which is hailed by English writers as the era of their freedomstanding armies in time of peace were unknown in England , and we recollect no instance in the history of that country , where Parli*unent could be induced to make appropriations for their support , except in cases of actual or anticipated war . A general peace was always the signal for paying off and disbanding the army . But the era of British freedom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all born at the same time , and of the same brood . The bank purchased a charter by bribing the government with a loan , which was the commencement of a system of borrowing , that has ever since enabled it to keep up a great military establishment at all times .

The good people of England were not so enlightened at the * " The old jealousies of which it " ( a standing army ) " was the object , no longer exist , and there can be no doubt that the establishment of a properly trained military force is not only indispensable to guaranty the national independence from hostile attack , but that it is the best force that can be employed to maintain internal tranquillity and order .

They would never have stooped to carry on their shoulders a burden of forty additional millions , to keep np a great body of soldiers , whose principal business was to enforce laws they themselves deemed oppressive and unjust , disperse their meetings , called for the purpose of petitioning for a redress of grievances , and shoot them down like dogs , at the command of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magistrate . However this may be , since the system of drawing drafts on posterity has become the settled policy of European governments , a fund can almost always be raised by placing the public credit in the market , for sale to the highest bidder , for the support of standing armies , and direct taxes are only required to pay the interest . It is the business of posterity , the great pack-horse of the world , to pay the principal , if it is ever paid . , The great maxim of modern despotism is , that , in order to govern nations , it is necessary to make them slaves . The bayonet is found much more effectual than the defunct feeling of loyalty , in preserving " internal tranquillity and order , " and that which , in ages of ignorance , was considered an instrument of national defence or aggrandizement , has become one of national oppression . It can not be denied that the bayonet is a most potent agent in repressing popular discontent ; but inasmuch as all governments are supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their dependence for support on force alone seems somewhat of a paradox , which can only be solved in two ways : either the people must be too ignorant , turbulent , and vicious , to be governed by laws , or their government so oppressive as not to deserve a voluntary obedience . But history teaches us by innumerable examples , that nothing is more common than for despotism to be pulled down through the same instrument by which it is sustained , and that thrones supported by hirelings are erected on a foundation of sand . Without resorting to the hackneyed example of the Pramtorian Guards , the instances are so numerous that they constitute a general rule . There is scarcely anything more certain , than that he , who depends on force alone , // will one day be its victim . There is another view*of the subject equally important . When the people see and feel themselves governed by force alone , they very naturally conclude they have a right to resist by force , and that what is sauce for goose is sauce for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of the civil power , why should the people pay any respect to an imbecile nonentity ? They will be prone to follow the example , and , when strong enough , repel force by force . There is no more certain mode of destroying all respect for the laws , than that of employing a military force in their execution ; and , in our opinion , when a government can not sustain itself at home , without a habitual resort to military force , the sooner its existence is terminated the better . The two parties to the compact ca n't keep the peace , and had better sue for a divorce . In addition to this wide-spread discontent and uneasiness of the masses of Europe , and the revolutionary leaven fermenting in its bosom , there are other causes of discontent among people and rulers , arising out of the territorial distributions made by the Congress of Vienna , which have ever since created great dissatisfaction . The old balance of power , which had for ages been a fruitful source of bloodshed , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquests of N*ipoleon , and the hypocritical attempt to restore it ended in each of the " high contracting parties , " helping themselves and their friends to the lion 's share . The secondary and smaller states , which had heretofore been considered as make-weights in the balance of Europe , could offer no effectual resistance to the concentrated power which directed this division of the spoils , and were obliged unwillingly to acquiesce in what they could not approve . Thus a basis was laid for future contention , by taking from one and giving unsatisfactory equivalents , or none at all . Integral portions of states were dismembered , and distant provinces , inhabited by distinct , often hostile races , speaking a different language , professing a diflerent faith , and discordant in habits , manners , and prejudices , were patched together , and materials which , far from having any natural affinity , were little less than antipathies , fused into union with each other . Prussia was dismembered at home to receive indemnity abroad . Bavaria was dissatisfied with the cession she was obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was given to Sweden , as an equivalent for far more valuable possessions ceded to Russia on the I3altic . The Netherlands were united under one sovereign . Holland lost // every vestige of its ancient freedom . Austria wa* reinstated with a population of28,000,000 , of which upwards of 18,000,000 were Italians , Poles , Hungarians , &amp;c. , to whom Austria was an object of hereditary abhorrence . Venice ceased to be an independent state , and Italy was little more than a fief of the imperial crown of Germany . Russia obtained all Finland , dismembered from Sweden , together with a great part of Poland ; and England , with most magnanimous disinterestedness , was content with securing to herself almost all the colonies and commerce of Europe , together with all the maritime positions , enabling her to realize the boast of Sir George Simpson , namely , that of " commanding all the highways and byways of the ocean , and all its inlets . " Thus the old balance of Europe was restored by overthrowing it entirely , and reducing the weaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parcelled out like a conquered country , and placed under the guardianship of the " high contra*ting powers . " Finally , religion itself became the guaranty of those robberies committed under the name of restitution , through the medium of " The holy Alliance , " which announced its creed in the following sublime declara-tion : " Agreea*bly to the words of the Holy Scriptures , which command all men to love each other as brethren , to remain united in the indissoluble bonds of tine brotherly love ; always to assist one another ; to govern their subjects as parents ; to maintain religion , peace , and justice : They consider themselves as members of one Christian family , commissioned by Providence to govern one Christian family . They call on all powers , who acknowledge similar principles , to join this holy alliance , " &amp;c. , &amp;c . This holy alliance , consisting of Russia , Austria , and Prussia , had just finished the partition of Poland , and was reeking with the blood of that unhappy country . Had not religion so often been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapacity , the world might have wondered at this barefaced hypocrisy . As it was , it was only laughed at and despised , at least in the United States , though , in truth , it was no laughing matter . The covert views of this holy alliance are still cherished , and acted upon , *nd are , in almost all respects , similar to those adoptedby England under the guise of universal philanthropy , for precisely the same purpose , that of deceiving and subjugating mankind . Many other causes , which we have not space to enumerate , conspire to menace the tranquillity of Europe , and convert the // diadem of kings into a crown of thorns . Enoug* has , however , been adduced , to show that the thrones of that quarter are not founded on a rock . In the apparent quiet cairn the storm is brewing . Disaffection , instead of being on the wane , is increasing through the very means adopted for its suppression . To stop the months of men , and interdict their thoughts , is neither to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontented masses of Europe will be eventually able to rise to their proper rank in the scale of human nature by a stern and manly resistance to the military despotism prepared for them , or gradually descend to the level of the people of Asia , is a problem to be solved only by time . If they fall much lower , they will be in great danger of never rising again , except through that long series of vicissitudes which sometimes changes refinement into barbarism , and savages into civilized men . Nations , like individuals , rise and fall , flourish and decay . Let no one dream he has seen the end of this mortal struggle in Europe . The rise and fall of nations is a part of the system of Providence , and in strict accordance with the great attribute of Justice , since there is no good reason why a nation should continue to enjoy either glory , power , or happiness , after it has lost the'virtues by which they were acquired . Cowardice , corruption , and effeminacy can never preserve what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness must sovuer or later resign what was gained by physical strength ; and moral degeneracy must never hope to retain what was originally the reward of virtue . These are things which can not be regulated by human laws or human institutions . Governments grown gray in iniquity , and nations , long steeped in the process of debasement , are difficult patients to deal with One can not easily be repaired , or a new edifice constructed from the rubbish of the old ; nor the other become at once capable of a rational enjoyment of the benefits of reform . The sinews of these ancient bodies become too rigid and inflexible to yield to the friction of discontent ; or , what is still more commonly the case , the constitution is so enfeebled by age that the power of renovation is extinguished , and even the cure of the disease can not save the patients from speedy dissolution . The present politic*al and social state of Europe is unnatural and unjust ; capital has become a tyrant and labor its abject slave . Money is now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hence money has become the universal object of pursuit . But its attainment has been placed // 498 The Social and Political State of Europe . beyond the reach of labor and economy , by a series of artiilcial restrictions . The laboring classes have been robbed of all share of what they themselves created . The disease of Europe is abject poverty among the many , rendered more acute by the contrast of superfluous wealth in the few . There must be a new distribution of the gifts of the Creator , or terrible will be the consequences to those who obstinately oppose any peaceable mode of bringing it about . The laboring man of Europe is infinitely worse off than the African slave of the United States . He does not , like him , partake in the prosperity of his employer , for his interests are in direct opposition , because they universally tend to decreasing his wages . He is equally the slave of the capitalist and the government , who divide between them all his surplus earnings , and neither of which , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his children in their infancy or himself in old age . Between theum both , when his energies are exhausted by labor , privation , disease , or old age , he is placed in the poorhouse in Enghtnd , where his allowance of food is far less than that of a murderer confined in jail. * The philanthropic sympathizers in the woes of African bondage , and e specially the benevolent ladies of Stafford House , had better put on their spectacles and look to this . The white people of England have feelings as well as the black slaves of America , and it is not right that the latter should monopolize all their sympathies . We beseech them to make an effort for the relief of the poor seamstresses of London , though they have the misfortune of wearing a white skin-who , as we perceive by late statements , though laboring from daylight to midnight , day after day , are , many of them , obliged to barter their most precious jewel , to escape dying of hunger within sight of Stafford House . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may end , begins at home ; and that , however they may plume themselves on their late brilliant display in behalf of the American slave , the world will give little credit to their sincerity , when it learns that thousands of their own sex , their own race , their own color , and their own country , are suffering , under their very eyes , extremities of hunger and privation , accompanied by every pang that can rend the heart of woman , and every temptation leading to the destruction of both body and soul . Whatever may be the capacity of European governments to sustain the operation of those rough medicines necessary to // 499 resuscitate the system , or of the people to make ' good use of reform , we think the experiment well worth trying . The former most assuredly do not fulfil the first duty of all good governments , that of administering to the happiness of the people , and the latter cannot lose much , for they have nothing to lose . The longer these reforms are delayed , the worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contest is decided the better for the people and their kings . The history of the first French revolution records in letters of blood the terrible consequences of delaying reforms until the people have become incapable of making a good use of reformation , and enforces a lesson equally on those who inflict , and those who suffer long-continned abuses . To one it teaches the danger of waiting till impatience becomes a frenzy ; to the other , the fatal consequences of procrastination . Every sincere friend to the welfare of mankind will earnestly hope that those who preside over the destinies of Europe may not , by an obstinate resistance to those salutary reforms which every long-estal ) lished government indispensably requires to keep pace with those changes which time invariably produces , eventually draw on themselves and their country a long series of sore calamities . Governments , like men , contain wRhin themselves the seeds of corruption and decay . Not one of them can last forever , but all may prolong their existence , and render it a blessing to the people , by adapting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those changes which are the moving springs of the great machinery of the world . Surely it is too much to expect that governments will remain the same while everything around them is changing . Those monarchs who persist in this belief will be in great danger of perishing without the reputation of martyrs . Nothing is more certain than that the errors , excesses , and crimes of rulers , by causing the miseries of their people , in so far weaken the power of the state , and that their offences are sure to be punished by their own inevitable consequences . And , inasmuch as nations always pay the penalty for the faults of those who govern , it seems no more than just that these should at least bear a portion of the sufferings they have brought down on others . The dispensation is in strict accordance with Divine justice . It is the fault of the people if they permit themselves to be ill-governed , and the fault of the ruler to oppress them . They should , therefore , share the consequences between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy for the death or exile of a king , than of a cobbler , provided they both equally deserve the penalty . There is one // 500 like Social and Political State of Euroye. thing , at least , in which all men are equal , namely , physical suffering . It is no greater hardship for a monarch to die than for one of the meanest of his slaves . The conspiracy of kings against the people of Europe may , for the present , succeed by the aid of the bayonet . But the bayonet is no stable foundation for authority , and of all the varieties of government , despotism is the least permanent . It is in its nature a government of force or corruption . It reigns over the body , not the mind , and is equally opposed to the reason and instincts of men . This is exemplified in the history of all despotisms , in the East as in the West . They exhibit only a series of perpetual commotions and revolutions , arising either from the discontent of the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vassals , the intrigues of courtiers , or the conflicts of different pretenders to the crown . From the period in which the Emperors of Rome became despotic , their history is , for the most part , one sickening series of bloody revolutions . Their reigns were almost always brief , and they generally perished by the dagger of the assassin , or the sword of a successful competitor . The people of Italy gradually lost all principle , all feeling of patriotism , in these perpetual struggles , and , finally , the Imperial Eagle was forced to take flight from the West to the East , before the irresistible might of a race of barbarians . The history of the Eastern Empire furnishes , if possible , a still more striking exemplification of the fate of power , when altogether dependent on standing armies . It is one continued succession of despots , whose career presented some of the strangest examples of the vicissitudes of life ever exhibited in the great drama of the freaks of Fortune , and whose deaths almost nniformly sealed with their blood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With here and there an exception , all perished by treachery , conspiracy , or popular indignation . None ever loved or trusted them , all feared them , and they feared all . They lived in perpetual terror and anxiety ; they saw the sword of Damocles forever dangling by a hair over their heads , and while lording it over millions of slaves , were themselves the slaves of fear . Should Europe be governed for a generation or two according to the maxims of Eastern despotism , the people will gradually sink into Oriental degradation . Europe will share the fate of Asia , and as that quarter of the globe yielded to the ascendency of the freer people of the other , so will that other be compelled to yield the sceptre to the still more free race of a new world . The discontents in Europe can only be
