From Dlackwood 's Magazine for June . SPECULATIONS ON THE FUTURE . - OUR ALLIANCES . THE war-clouds have sunk , and John Bull is settling again in his easy-chair . He has done so somewhat reluctantly . With considerable effort he had got roused and into action , - his old pugilistic skill was coming back to him ,  --  heated with the " row , " he was beginning to face about in all directions with wonderful alacrity , and was preparing to deal a good English body-blow at his antagonist , when lo ! his friends caught him by the arm , and declared all was over ! John could not be easily brought to see this . Game to the backbone himself , he was slow to believe that his antagonist would slip down on his knees in mid-combat , to avoid pnishment ; and morever , he is so old-fashioned in his notions that he could not perceive the propriety of letting off , when caught , a disturber of the peace without exacting the smallest compensation for the damage done , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Bull grumbled a good deal , and a momentary sight of his brawny arms as he put on his coat only made him think what little use he had made of his strength , and what a great deal he meant to do in the next round . However , all that is over now . The fireworks and candle-lighting which he regarded with sturdy contempt when announced as rejoicings for the Peace , he accepts with tolerable grace when converted into a tribute of loyalty on the birthday of his Queen . And so , the war ended , and his feelings composed again , John Bull gets into his easy-chair , and threatens to sleep . And sleep he will . Not , perhaps , in the ordinary sense of the word ; for the common herd imagine that when a man sleeps he is doing nothing , - which is a great mistake , seeing that Life is always active ; and psychologists have shown that it is quite possible to carry on two different threads of existence by turns , - the alternation between trance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ideas into another . Therefore , though it be far from us to imagine that the manifold activities of John Bull will relapse into nothingness , even though he do take to his easy-chair and smoke the pipe of peace , yet it is only to be expected that he will soon become oblivious to most things connected with the war and foreign politics , and will slide away into very opposite trains of thought and action . No nation , or ordinary mass of humanity , can carry out two opposite sets of ideas equably and simultaneously ; and John Bull in this respect does not rise above the frailty of his DCXXXVI . LIVING AGE . VOL. xiv . 19 species . If he has to fight , he does so heartily and with all his might- though he take long to get ready ; but when he takes to money-making , to buying and selling and the various pursuits of peace , it must be allowed he becomes peculiarly absorbed in his occupation , and is little disposed to look at anything beyond the limits of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally push him into the right course when critical times come , and he has also a dogged long-winded power of fighting which baffles the calculations of his more astute adversaries . But John Bull is in no sense providus futuri . Like most of his neighbors , he gets too absorbed in the affairs of the hour to keep an out-look on the future ; and unlike most of his neighbors , he has the power of compelling his rulers to look at things through his own spectacles , and act as shortsightedly as himself . The despotic Powers , whom John so cordially hates , beat him hollow iii such matters . Untrammelled by the requirements of party , or the prejudices of popular election , they gather around the throne the ablest men in the country , filling with them the bureaus at home and the embassies abroad ; from the masterly views and information thus laid before the throne , the true objects to be aimed at in the foreign policy of the State are determined ; and the Government , using the people as mere automatons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from year to year , it may be for generations . John Bull was never great in this line , and he has not been mending . He changes his leaders too often to permit of any fixed line of foreign policy being carried out ; and , moreover , he is so fond of keeping his money , and so sceptical of all things future , , that there is no getting him to assent to any changes which are not necessitated by the wants of the hour . In his State-policy at least , the future and the invisible have no influence upon him ; and distant dangers , like ghosts - he does not believe in. them. ! It must be confessed that , for the last thirty years or so , his leaders have been as shortsighted as he could desire . We have never steadily cultivated a friendship , or prepared . for an hostility . Brother , . cousin , or enemy - it was all the same with whom we were negotiating ; we wrangled as fiercely , frequently more so , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have let everything come upon us haphazard . It is no easy matter to cast a political horoscope as a guide to our foreign policy ; and it is needless to expect any British Government nowadays to do so , unless it finds its efforts . sympathized in and*supported by the nation . at large . But the task , though difficult , . is 289 // not impossible , - for the germs of the Future lie before us in the Present ; and we would gladly see our countrymen bestowing more thought on foreign affairs than they are in the habit of doing . Therefore , 0 John Bull ! though the fizz of the fireworks and shouts of reviews - the last echoes of the war - are dying away , and you have betaken yourself to your easy-chair , with the intention of smoking that yard-long pipe of peace , - amidst the ruminations which precede your coming slumber , pray give a thought or two , a parting look , to the state of things abroad , that so you may have some ready-made notions what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your industrial repose . Europe is ever changing . Its Coalitions vary from age to age . And no one was more surprised than John Bull two years ago , to find himself in such new company , and to see all things changed on the Continent from his traditional memories of it in 1815 . Such changes will continue , - Europe slowly passing from one phase into another - the grand current of National Development gradually dislocating and re-arranging the alliances of its States ; until , the polarity of the Continent reversing from what it was in 1790 , a succession of grand alliancess will be formed against Russia and despotism , as they were then against France and revolution . Have we not already entered upon that new epoch ? Entered upon it  --  but that is all . The war just closed was the first brief skirmish , - the first overt sign that the Powers of Europe were becoming sensible of their altered position , and ( some of them ) were ready to accept it . Every parallelism in national affairs has some points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destined to be attacked *t l'outrance by Russia , as they were fifty years ago by France , it would be wrong to expect that the second attack will culminate and pass away as rapidly as the first . France leapt at the sovereignty of the Continent , - Russia is growing up to it . The former does everything by sudden bounds - such is the genius of her people ; the latter moves like the tortoise , - or rather with the mingled slowness , vastness , and force of the glacier . Yes , John Bull will do well to keep an eye on the Continent . While he plods away in his manifold occupations , he should give a sharp look now and then at the sea-channel with which Providence has kindly girt him in from so many misfortunes . If he will take the dust of fifty years out of his eyes , he will see that that Channel has shrunk up considerably from its older proportions , and that , if ever we lose the command of the seas , steam-navigation will greatly increase the exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not do to judge of the future in any respect simply from the past . In this age of telegraphs and railways ( with which latter even Russia is about to equip herself ) , coalitions of states , with all their weight of naval and military strength , can come into , play with unheard-of suddenness and precision ; and the ever-increasing intercommanion of nations - upon which some philan .. thropists build so many millennial dreams - will only suffice , in times of war , to give to belligerent alliances a vaster amplitude and a dreader force . The future of Europe , then , is not exactly a thing to doze over . We do not affect to see farther into political millstones than most people , but we shall be right glad if we can set others a-thinking or watching , - and especially if John Bull , of whose practical good sense we have a high opinion , will open his honest eyes a little , and look and judge for himself . In the years preceding the first French Revolution - on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter-century submerged Europe - men were not only marrying and giving in marriage , but in France itself an effusion of ultra-pacific ideas took place among the literary and courtly classes , as recently in the mercantile among ourselves . Mongolfier 's balloon , which set all Paris a-rhapsodizing about human and scientific perfectibility , did not go up more bravely than did those utopian dreams of peace and everlasting justice , sent forth by men standing on the already smoking crust of the volcano ; and Condorcet , who speculated on the possibility of an indefinite extension of human life , lived to seek a refuge in the poison-cup from the ignominy of the scaffold . A parallel phenomenon , we need hardly say , has of late years been witnessed in our own Islea . Such dreams , indeed , appear to be ever-recurrent in human history , and are generally most rife on the very eve of a fresh outburst of war . Nor is this wonderful : for it is a long continuance of tranquillity that makes men fancy*that it will be eternal ; and so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dread awakening . It is a delusion , and sometimes to nations a fatal one ; and the British nation may congratulate itself that its dream of this kind has been broken so softly , and in time . To any one who really sees Europe as it actually is at this hour , the spectacle is a sad one . To him who forgets that God rules all , from evil still evoking good , it is a hopeless one . Are we really at the close of a war , or only at the beginning of one still greater ? Take up the newspapers - those Arguses , whose eyes travel to and fro on the face of the earth - and what do we read of ? 290 // First come voices of trouble from the East . Troubles in Arabia , - fifty thousand rebels at Mecca swearing that the Sultan has forsworn the Prophet ; troubles in Syria-wild men at Naplouse rising because there is no one to keep them down ; troubles in Bagdad , smouldering ; troubles at Smyrna and other places in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only setting Turk and Christian the faster by the ears ; perfect anarchy in Greece , - neither man nor goods safe beyond three miles from the coast , where French troops patrol - and the people fiercer than ever against the . Ottomans , and more than ever frantic to kiss the feet of the Czar , and subject themselves to an iron despotism which is probably marked out by Providence as the sole effectual cure for ilellenic madness . So much for Turkey - which , our rulers tell us , we have rescued and made strong ! Is there a single whole place in it from head to foot ? But " we have checked the southward progress of Russia . " For the moment . But why those cries for help from the Caucasus-that marshalling of Chruleff 's host - those plans now preparing in the bureaus of St. Petersburg for new forts on the east side of the Black Sea , and a warnavy on the Caspian ? Turkey disintegrating , and Russia adhering to her " hereditary policy , " - this is but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troubles . Were there ever before so many " armies of occupation " in Europe ? Austrians in the Principalities , British and French in Turkey and Greece , French and Austrians in Italy , - all most generously keeping the peace in other people 's territories - the wrong men in the right p lace ! The sight of those various white , blue , and red coated soldiers in alien countries is a significant proof of the disjointed state of affairs . It is like the sight of dragoons in a mob , telling of troubles . Italy is specially the seat of troubles and the object of apprehensions . Geologically the most volcanic of European countries , she is so now also politically . The damp dungeons of Naples teem with victims , and King Bomba overawes his people by means of brigands and lazzaroni . French bayonets around the Vatican alone ward off a ne* Roman Repidcdic and a second flight of the Pope to Gaeta . Austria , overpassing her own frontiers , has corps of occupation alike in Parma and the Legations , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories there prevails only a milder form of the same reign of terror . Radetzky writes to Vienna that either his master must say No at once to the remonstrances of the Western Powers and Sardinia , or he will resign ! Indeed , in the present combustible state of the peninsula , 291 can Austria recede without evoking the flames ! It is a duel between Austria and Sardinia , contesting the supremacy of Italy . Sardinia demands - publicly in the face of Europe demands , that the cords which bind Italy shall be slackened . If Austria yield , the star of Piedmont rises higher on the horizon , and all eyes turn to it . The light of hope will grow stronger all over the peninsula , and the slackening of her cords will only make galled Italy pant moire furiously to be free . l3ut what a spectacle for modern Europe ! Italy and Greece- the heirs of the classic empires , the descendants of the ruling **35;519;TOOLONG miserable - raving and chafing with a fury unintelligible to northern races ! Why , the very soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been shouting and stabbing " for liberty** in a p lace where **39;556;TOOLONG would doubtless throw themselves into the sea to swim for Sicily , if they could carry their arms with them . Is this peace ? Cross the Alps and look northwards . Poland groaning , and at times hoping , but securely manacled , and perhaps about to he offered by her master a politic sop . Hungary , bleeding at the heart , but with no hope on earth , save in the utter crumbling of the Hapsburg throne , which would only bring a Muscovite instead of an Austrian bondage . These we count not at present . They figure largely in the speculations of superficial observers , but it is not by them that the troubled sleep of Europe will first be broken ; indeed it seems to us their day can not come at all until Germany and Italy have first- gone through the fire , and come out greatly changed . But Germany is troubled , and will probably be into the furnace sooner than most people imagine . Destitute of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , the Germans do not give tongue much before they act , but there are symptoms that the tranquillity of Central Europe is anything but secure . The policy of the Governments towards the people has become most reactionary - in many respects there is less freedom now than there was before 1848 - and even in the " free republic " of Hamburg , the most cruel measures of oppression are put in force against the Press . The Germans are a slowmoving race , and if they had even a promise of better things coming , they would wait on , smoking their pipes , and drinking their beer , with true Teutonic phlegm , for another generation . But at present they have not even a promise of better things , - the nobility , worse than the throne , seem only bent upon pushing things backwards towards feudalism ; and the consequence is , that were // revolution to re-commence in serious form either at Paris or in Italy , Germany would speedily catch the flame . In France itself tranquility is only secure so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reins . While he lives , I*rance will not throw its rider . But his death would resolve all into chaos ; and Bourbonists , Republicans , and Socialists would be seen struggling together in the dread mai*lstrom . For such a convulsion there can be but one issue . Order must be re-established ,  --  but around whom is the nation to rally ? Suppose Napoleon III . gone , what Saul is there overtopping all the rest by head and shoulders ? What name is there , but one , that is known beyond the limits of Paris and a few leading towns ? Finally , look at Spain . There , revolution and change have been brooding and e'meutes exploding for the last two years . The whole atmosphere of Spain at present is electric , and portentous of storms . The Queen is unrespected , and her power but a name ; while two puissant dictators , Espartero and O'Donnell - the one a Liberal and the other a Royalist - each ready to trip up the other , rule precariously in her stead . And ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Carlist , now republican in character ,  --  each failing , only that it may grow stronger and re-appear ; while powerful attempts to carry votes of censure against the Government , show that the discontent finds voice ' and sympathy in the Cortes . Thus these two opposite principles are slowly maturing and preparing for a trial of strength ; and , looking at the essentially monarchic spirit of the Spanish nation , it seems to us that Royalism will ultimately carry the day . Liberalism will culminate in a democratic outbreak , and then the nation will re-act into Carlism . Such , it appears to us , is the essential condition of the leading States of the Continent . Troubled they are , all of them . Never was the political state of Europe so full of quicksands . " Distress of nations , and perplexity " - such is the exact aspect of the times . One can not take a bold step any way without plunging into abysses which the future alone can fathom . Not to speak of the evidently transition-state of the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exploding ,  --  even Germany is not safe ; and a crisis in any one of these quarters may set Europe by the ears . Liberalism and Despotism are for the moment strangely interweaved . France threatens the press of Belgium ,  --  Austria similarly threatens Sardinia , and crushes Italy . Sardinia menaces despotic Austria , - England sympathizes with freedom everywhere , but does not act ,  --  France dreads an outbreak in Italy , and stands balancing between Austria and Sardinia , yet at the same time is not disinclined to intervene to check Espartero and democracy in Spain . We believe the designs of Napoleon III . towards Italy are the best possible for that country . If he could get his wish , he would have Austria , Naples , and Rome to relax the severity of their rule , and re-organize their administrative system so as to insure at once more efficiency and more justice ; the French and Austrian troops would then retire into their own territories , and the Italians , molifled by these concessions , would remain quiet for years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of independence at last arrived . We say we believe that such are the desires of the French Emperor , for the belief tallies with his professions , and ( what is of much more consequence ) with his interests . A revolution in Italy would be most embarrassing to Napoleon III . At present he hovers undecided between the despotic regime and that of popular government . We think he would adopt the latter if he could ,  --  we believe he would relax his rule , and take the bit out of the mouth of France , if the dreary turbulence of the factions permitted . He is " the Elect of eight millions " - that is at once his boast and his streAgth ; and he has no desire to cast in his lot with princes to whom despotism is a principle , and the people a nullity . But a revolutionary outbreak in Italy would force him from his intermediate position , and compel him to take an extreme part on the side either of liberty or despotism . French troops garrison Rome ,  --  were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Austrians , Napoleon III . could hardly help playing the game of despotism by joining Austria in putting down the revolution . If , on the other hand , the outbreak were of such a character as to lead France to espouse the side of the Italians , Napoleon III . must identify himself with the cause of freedom and nationality ,  --  in which case all Europe would at once be in a blaze . But an insuperable obstacle to the adoption of such a policy by the French Emperor , is the effect it would have upon his own Government . Could he become the champion of liberty abroad , and yet maintain the shackles of repression at home ? Could he maintain his imperial system in France with democracy in the ascendant in Italy and Spain ? Unquestionably not . But might he not , in such a case , boldly adventure the experiment of popularizing his system of government , and so keep his policy at home in unison with his policy abroad ? Again no ; for a time of war is a bad one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural course in 292 // such seasons is rather to draw tighter the reins , in order to obtain greater unity and centralization , and so impart greater force to the machine of Government . Louis Napoleon is not a despot by nature ,  --  at least not more so than is every man of dominating talents and force of character ; and we doubt not he would give free institutions to France if the nation could use them aright . But for our own part , we see not the least symptom of France being ready for any such change , - nor is the *mperor likely to adopt it . Yet this much we may say by wa* of prognostic ,  - -  Should Napoleon III . unexpectedly begin to popularize his system of government , Austria and the despotic States had better look to their arms ; for it will be a sign that the sagacious ruler of France sees a European struggle impending , and has resolved to espouse the popular side . The Italian question , we repeat , is a trying one for the French Emperor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see can be long kept back . Austria and Sardinia , as the representatives of two opposite principles , stand face to face . Between them there can be no compromise , - one or the other must fall . Both are aware of this . Austria is fortifying her positions , and pushing forward her out-posts , preparatory to the struggle . Through Parma she is sapping up to her enemy 's citadel . Meanwhile Sardinia , with her back to the wall , is playing her last card , before engaging in a contest of life and death . She knows that she has no mercy to expect from Austria , - therefore she does not stand upon ceremony , and boldly appeals to the Western Powers to come to the help of Italy . She calls upon them to intervene in the affairs of the peninsula , and , by timely ameliorations wrung from Austria and her deputy-governments in Naples and Rome , to prevent the outbreak of a contest which can not fail to be of the most embittered character . England will sympathize with the appeal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . If the appeal be not answered - not in fair words , for of these there will be no lack , but in such a way as to accomplish its object , it is all up with Italy and Sardinia - for the present . For such a holding-back on the part of the Western Powers will prove that Napoleon III. , although willing to befriend Italy by means of remonstrances , is ready to crush liberty and anarchy in one common fate rather than break with Austria , or risk the spread of the revolutionary spirit to his own dominions . And Italy , if it attempt an insurrection unsupported by France , must be crushed by the overwhelming , and wellappointed forces of the Austrian monarchy . But will the alliance between France and Austria be lasting ? As long as the French Government is ready to combat Liberalism , and be as useful to Austria as Russia would be , but no longer . Austria is in a delicate and perilous position . Her statesmen have shown consummate ability in piloting her hitherto , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has quarrelled with Russia , and has only half gained France , while neither England nor Prussia will stir a finger on her behalf . Do as she likes , Austria will ultimately be overshadowed by the growing might of Russia . And the Czars may act towards her in two ways . Not a few of the statesmen of Russia have counselled the destruction of the Austrian empire as the best policy for the Czars ; and it is known that the late Cza* 's intervention in Hungary , which saved Austria in 1849 , was done in opposition to the advice of the majority of his council . Suppose this inimical course be pursued towards Austria now , - then , the next time Italy is in revolt , Russia would stir up similar movements amongst the Slavonic population of eastern Austria , and might win the support of the Gallician Poles by promising to incorporate them with the rest of their nation in a revived Archducly of Poland . Were such a scheme successfu Austria would be annihilated - of her heterogeneous empire nothing would be left but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united Germany . Thus Muscovite vengeance would be wreaked to the full . But if gratitude be a thing unknown in diplomacy , so also is revenge . It is selfinterest alone that is looked to ; and , judging by this rule , we should infer that , bitterly as Russia has been incensed by the recent conduct of Austria , she will by-and-by prefer to be reconciled to , and make a tool of Austria , rather than destroy her . Austria is a State that will be despotic to the last hour of her existence ; hence in these times , when every war tends to become a contest of democracy and absolutism , she is a natural ally of Russia , the champion of absolutism . And Russia , it seems to us , has too strong a motive in keeping democracy at a distance from her own frontiers to set about destroying a kindred State , which acts as an efficient barrier . Russia may pat Italian revolution on the back , in order to frighten Austria , but she will not at present hunt Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her next extremity , will seek a reconcilement with her powerful neighbor , and in return for the renewed patronage of the latter , will engage to co-operate implicitly in Russia* s projects of ambition . Despite all the treaties , secret and avowed , by which it is being sealed , we anticipate that the recent aliena 293 // tion between Austria and Russia will prove of a temporary character . It was forced upon Austria by the formidable proportions of the anti-Russian alliance , which threatened to sever from her at one stroke her Italian provinces if she took part with the enemy ; but it will be observed , that while leaning to the side of the Alliance , she has steadily endeavored to present a minimum of opposition to Russia . Napoleon I. predicted that Austria would join Russia in partitioning Turkey ; and though the adroitness of the nephew has temporarily falsified the prediction of the uncle , we have little doubt it will yet come true . From these calculations of the probable moves impending on the chess-board of Europe , it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , does not promise to be such as will well accord with the wishes or interests of our country . It will be seen that the prospects of liberty on the Continent are not satisfactory . England and Russia are the only States that have as yet a definite policy , a clear course to pursue , and these courses are antagonistic . Russia is for Absolutism , England for Freedom and Constitutionalism . The other Powers waver in their course . Austria is despotic enough , but hesitatesbetween France and Russia ; Prussia fancies she leans to liberalism , but fears her people more than she dreads Russia ; France sympathizes with liberty abroad , yet dares not fight for it , because in dread of anarchy at home ; and the same strange combination is seen in her alliances , for she seeks to lean at once upon England and upon Austria . Thus England and Russia form the opposite political poles of Europe . Each mounted high upon a principle , they steadily regard each other across an intermediate mass of wavering States , and watch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no disguising that they are necessary antagonists - antagonists everywhere . Like thunder-clouds , they are slowly approaching each other in the East , where the collision will be terrible , drawing into its vortex the populations of one-half of Asia . And in Europe the collision will be not the less marked because it is one of principles . We do not take a jaundiced view of our great antagonist . The system of absolutism which she champions is as good for Russia in her present state as constitutionalism is for Britain . Indeed , it is this very fact that *ives to the antagonism of these two Powers its greatest vehemence . Neither can part with its characteristic principle , and the principles are so opposite that they can not come together without collision . British Cabinets need not strive to blind Russ* by fair words ; they need not bend the knee or make sacrifices to her in the hope of making her our friend . Russia will not so be blinded . We wish we were certain that our own Cabinets will prove equally proof to cajolery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intermittent volcano , but England an ever-burning foyer of revolutions - or , as Englishmen would phrase it , a steady sun of freedom , whose beams ever tend to develop on the Continent those movements towards liberty which it is the great object of Russian absolutism to repress . The mere existence of England in her present condition , therefore , is obnoxious to Powers which adhere to the despotic system ; and there is too much reason to fear that these Powers will shortly acquire , though probably but for a brief period , an unexampled ascendancy on the Continent . Therefore let John Bull stand on his guard . There may be other Conferences than those lately concluded at Paris ; and the menace made to Belgium against her free press , and now taken up by Austria against Sardinia , may be directed in due time , in the name of all the despotic courts of the Continent , against ourselves . Poor Sardinia ! in the coming troubles we fear things will go hard with her , but how can we help her ? Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she be doomed to obscuration by her too powerful foes , it will only be to shine out again with treble effulgence hereafter . For , if there be one sure prediction as to the future of Europe , it is that Italy will yet be free , and that Sardinia will be its star . " Calculation is everything , " said the elder Napoleon . We do not assume the prophet 's mantle , or affect to say , in arbitrary fashion , simply that such things shall be . But the germ of the future lies in the present ; and from the seeds now germinating under our eyes , we seek to understand what will be the result . Looking into the inside of things is a safer source of augury than inspecting the entrails of birds . We take things as the are , and endeavor to work out the result by ( if we may be allowed the pun ) a process of compound interest . Find out the interests of a government or people , and its power of carrying them out ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and one can tell pretty nearly what the policy of that government or people will be . Judging by this rule , we should prognosticate a speedy disintegration of the Turkish empire , - the outbreak of popular movements in Europe ( especially in Italy and Spain ) , and the repression of those movements , - to be followed by a grand gala-season for the Despotic Powers , duringwhich time the liberties and Mediterranean possessions of this country // will be seriously endangered . If England , by means of an overwhelming fleet , can ride out the first burst of this tempest , she will be safe ; for such a league of despotic governments can not long keep down Europe , and a mighty heave in France and Germany - a wiser and more powerful 1848 - will shiver the fabric of despotism all over western and central Europe , giving birth to a federally united Germany , and other arrangements , as to which it is not needful nor very safe to speak . What immediately concerns us is , that a balancing of contingencics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Continent . In such circumstances , who will be our friends ? What are to be our Alliances ? Let us first say , that a nation 's main trust must ever lie in itself . " Put not your faith in princes , " is as wise a maxim in international politics as in private life ; for there is nothing more unstable than foreign alliances . The main danger to England must come across the seas . The greatest development of military power can not hurt us in Europe ,  --  ( it is different in Asia ) . Or rather we should say , the military power of our enemies is only to be feared in so far as it may tend to place at their disposal naval power also . When Napoleon and Alexander met on the raft at Tilsit to compose their old feud , and cement an alliance by the bonds of a common hatred of England , it was arranged by a secret clause of the treaty to suddenly seize upon the fleet of neutral Denmark , and add it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indomitable Islanders . The British Government of that day was too quick for them ; but , looking at the mingled timidity and blindness become chronic in our statesmen , we question if any British Cabinet would have the energy and moral courage to repeat such a coup-dc-main in similar circumstances now . Yes , the military power of our foes is only to be dreaded as a means of concussing other maritime States into their alliance against us . What we have specially to guard against is , a confederacy which may be able to bring together naval forces superior to our own . Everything remote appears to common minds improbable ; anything that has never yet happened appears to them impossible . John Bull , therefore , is likely to be too incredulous on this point - too confident in his " wooden walls , " without taking pains to see that they are kept equal to the requirements of the times . B ut this only makes us more desirous to bring the matter under the old gentleman 's notice , and to request him to consider what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confederacy to get the upper hand of us at sea . Suppose we have " bold Britons " enough to throw back into the sea the myriad regiments which a Continental Coalition could direct against our shores - suppose even ( for we do n't wish to shock John 's nerves overmuch ) the merchant navies in the Thames and Mersey escape the enemy 's bombs , and that our foes are so remarkably humane or timid as to leave our coast-towns unvisited ( contingencies which , for the life of us , we can not believe in ) - but suppose all this , and that the enemy , with singular forbearance , confined his operations exclusively to the high seas ; still , what condition would we be in at the end of half a year 's blockade ? Ask Mr. Villiers , Mr. Economist Wilson , or any other great authority on the Corn-laws , to tell from the imports how far the grain-produce of this country now falls short of the consumption , and then it will be plain to every one that six months ' blockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-third of our population find work upon the soil , and the other twothirds are engaged in manufactures and shopkeeping , - a stoppage of our commerce consequent upon losing the command of the seas would throw at least a third of our people out of work , and would call the sponge into play against the National Debt . Mind this , 0 ye Fundholders and Capitalists ! who are ever so clamorous for peace and peace-establishments . Remember that England has a great deal more to fight for than mere " honor ; " and that one of the first and most inevitable consequences of letting our enemies get the upper hand of us at sea will be - must be- a suspension of the payment of the interest ( iC2S , OOO , OOO ! ) of the National Debt . It should be an object in the policy of Great Britain ever to aim at keeping down the naval power of the Continental States ; for every increase in the naval forces of our rivals necessitates a corresponding increase in our own , and a corresponding expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war - as we repeatedly pointed out during its continuance - was our missing the fair opportunity it presented of destroying the Baltic fleet of Russia . Had we destroyed that fleet , England would have been sate against every contingency for the next generation ; for then , come what might , we could have had little else to face than the fleets of France and Spain , which we could have dealt with easily , and at little expense to ourselves . Whereas now there exist the elements of a naval Continental Confederacy which at some future time may push us hard . At the opening of the war two years ago , it is a fact too much overlooked , that the fleet of Russia equalled in strength the united navies of England and France . What , then , would ii 295 // have been the position of this country if the French Emperor had accepted the Czar 's secret overture to go halves with him in the spoiling of Turkey ? Clearly , we must have succumbed , and by a timely diplomatic surrender have averted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encounter by sea as by land . We talk of the invulnerability of our island-position ! Why , a union of the French and Russian fleets in 1854 would have swept the British flag from the seas , blocked us up like a beleaguered fortress , and made us feel of what little use are bales of calicoes to a starving people . " Live and learn " is the real maxim of existence ; but what we deplore is , that John Bull wo n't learn - or at least is very slow about it . He wo n't take the trouble to make a single reflection or induction for himself . Hence a danger escaped never attracts his attention ; and he bids fair to plod on in very stupid phlegm until this naval peril hits him much more sharply in the face than we , or any other of his many well-wishers , desire . One good result of the late war is , that it has been the means of equipping England admirably in the very arm which she so especially needs . In the long-run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our naval armaments has been worth the whole cost of the war ; and future historians may have it to note , that the short war now closed came as a special providence to England , to rouse her betimes from her undue security , and prepare her for the infinitely greater dangers of contests yet to come . We see reason to believe that an alliance between France and Russia , at the expense of England , lies in the womb of the future . It may not be while Napoleon III . lives and rules - or if so , it will be a contingency which he himself will deplore ; but , as in the fundamentally unsettled state of dynastic matters in France , even the triumph of the Fusion can not be regarded as impossible , a state of hostility in such circumstances would be almost a matter of course . Popery would then have a brief gala-season on the Continent as well as despotism - and , moreover , England may show such sympathy with insurgents for liberty on the Continent , and her press may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mark her out to them as an object for their common attack . If Spain ( as is on the.cards ) have by that time relapsed under the sway of Carlism , as a reaction from democracy , we need not look for help from her ; on the contrary , we should require to look after Gibraltar , as both Spain and France would like to see us dispossessed of that commanding fortress . Of Italy we need not speak ; she will have enough to do with her own miseries to think of helping others . Prussia , with whom , if report speak true , we are about to form a royal alliance - one , be it said , of the most desirable kind - will probably disappoint the expectation* entertained of her in this country ; for if democratic movements take place in Germany , her present alliance with Russia will only be drawn closer . As a Protestant power she is kindred to us - her people are half-kin - and by-and-by the British and Germans will fraternize better than they do now ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the head of a united Germany , she is powerless ( and perhaps will be little inclined ) to show us favor in the event of any Continental coalitions being formed against our island-empire . Besides , she has no fleets , and it is the cooperation of fleets above all things that in an extremity we should want . In fine , the popular States on the Continent , who court our alliance , are comparatively helpless ; and the general result is , that though we might help them , they can not help us . In the event of troubles and changes , then , such as we have been considering , producing a re-arrangement of the European alliances , nowhere can England look for steady friends among the States which we have passed in review . We shall be happy to remain at peace with them if they let us ; but we suspect the despotic governments will be inclined to make use of their temporary ascendancy - will take advantage of the rare unanimity of sentiment among the crowned heads of the Continent - to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held for other purposes than making peace . The semi-compulsory surrender of our immemorial rights in naval warfare at the late Congress , and the readiness with which proposals for the repression of the press of other countries were entertained , ought to be a warning of what we may expect should the the balance of power on the Continent shift round farther against us . Under pretext of re-adjusting the territorial system of Europe , and insuring the freedom of the European seas , a new Congress may demand of us the surrender of Heligoland as pertaining to Germany - of Gibraltar , as part of Spain - of the Jonian Islands , as pertaining to Greece ; and in the event of our refusal , a naval confederacy may be formed to wrest these places from us . Let the warders on our towers , then , watch . Most urgently , let us venture to say , does it become us to check , as far as possible , the progress of anti-British influence around the shores of the Baltic . At present we have this advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPECULATIONS ON THE FUTURE . would constitute one-half of any naval confederacy against us , is blocked up by ice for halt ' the year - thus permitting us during that time to direct our entire naval strength against the other fleets of the confederacy . But if Russia succeeds in extending her ascendency around the shores of the a tic - if from Finland and the Aland Isles she dominate over Sweden , and , perhaps with the help of Prussia , concuss Denmark , where the Court is already Russianized - then we may expect to see the station of the Russian fleet advanced from Cronstadt to the harbors of Norway and Denmark , beyond the limits of the winter-ice ; and the entrance to the Sound itself may virtually come into her hands . By an Unkiar Skelessi treaty with Denmark , these Dardanelles of the North might become closed against the fleet of her enemies ; and the long-range artillery now introduced would render the passage of the Sound in the teeth of the Danish batteries , as once done by Nelson , quite impracticable . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must frankly say that the effectual guardianship of the British coast would in times of war become impossible . By the so called " neutralization " of the Black Sea , the naval strength of Russia will henceforth be concentrated ( nearer to our shores ! ) in the Baltic ; and a hostile fleet of thirty sailof-the-line lying , unassailable by us , behind the Sound ( within twelve hours ' sail of our coasts ) , and ready to issue out at a moment 's notice - how could we keep it in check ? Manifestly , then , the point above all others which we have to keep in view in our European policy is to draw closer our alliance with Sweden and Denmark . These States are our natural allies - the only ones existing on the Continent . With them we have no conflicting interests - no points of rivalry . Scandinavians and Northmen , they have the same blood in their veins as we ; and the south of Denmark is the primal home of the people that have now given their name to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the love of freedom and a popular form of government characterizes both Scandinavians and ourselves . The same love of the adventurous sea-faring life is to be found , too , amongst them , - thus rendering them to us the most useful of all allies , or , if won to the opposite side , most formidable foes . The present position of Sweden and Denmark - particularly the former - is favorable for drawing closer the alliance which we have with them . The Danish Court , we regret to say , inclines in a marked manner to Russia ; and it is to be regretted that , as the Danish law of succession now stands , the royal family of Russia may yet lay claim to the Danish throne . But the Danish people and Parliament are stoutly opposed to these Russian leanings of the Court ; and ceaseless diplomatic efforts ought to be made by our Government to procure the triumph of these national feelings . No pains would be too great if it won Denmark to the side of Britain . The natural interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future will menace her independence ; and if our Government were to maintain at Copenhagen a diplomatist really worthy of that important mission , the Danish Government might soon be brought to see that their true interest lay in cultivating a British , not a Russian alliance . With Sweden , we rejoice to say , our position is much better . There , too , the people are with us - staunchly so ; and fortunately the Court has of late become sensible of the value of a Western alliance . It will be our own fault if the anti-Russian treaty which Sweden made last year with the Allies ever ceases with Great Britain . Prince Oscar , second son of the king , is at present on a tour-matrimonial to Western Europe ; and though it is now reported that his bride is to be a French , not a British princess , still this marriage-alliance is an anti-Russian one , and will have no effect in binding Sweden to France in the event of a change of dynasty in the latter country . It is plainly the fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Russia , and their Governments can not but perceive this ; but then , here is the difficulty - their gigantic neighbor exercises so great a pressure upon them , that it may seem to them safer to propitiate the good-will of Russia than to brave her enmity . And the plain practical question comes to be , - In the event of Sweden and Denmark being ready to unite their fortunes with ours , are we ready , and have we the power , to defend these States against the attacks of Russia ? We think both these questions ought to be answered in the affirmative . The gain to us in securing the alliance of two such naval powers as Sweden and Denmark - and still more the disaster it would be to us if they were ranged on the side of our foes - would compensate tenfold the expense of co-operating with Danes and Swedes in defence of their country . As to the possibility of a successful defence of these countries with the help of British troops and fleets , any one who remembers Wellington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand made by the Russians at Sebastopol , will not deem the project impracticable . Copenhagen and the Danish islands would be quite unassailable when guarded by a few gun-boats ; while important strategetical positions , fortified by earth- // works *z la Sebastopol , might be taken up on the mainland , open to the sea , and where British troops and materiel might be added to the brave land-forces of Denmark . With Norway and Sweden the case would be much easier . There the attack could only be made round the northern extremity of the Gulf of Bothnia - a dreary march at any time , and ( unless Russia lay down a railway there ) impracticable in winter ; while the British and Swedish navies , having command of the whole Baltic waters , for six months in the year could dreadfully harass the enemy , landing troops on any point of the coast where they could best assail the long-extended communications of the invading army . Besides , no country in the world presents so many obstacles to an invading army , and so many excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus supported by sea , and naturally favored by land , an Anglo-Swedish army , if worthily led , could not fail to repel any amount of force that could be brought against them . The great advantage of turning such things over in one 's mind is , that it prepares us for all contingencies . It is only by looking ahead that a State can prevent itself being surprised by events for which it has made no preparation . Many a time a good plan of policy has to be foregone , and left untried , simply because it has been too late of being commenced ; and another and less effectual policy has had to be adopted , because it could be more readily put in operation . This hand-to-mouth style of statesmanship has become much too prevalent of late among the rulers of England ; yet never was it so likely to produce great disasters as in the coming years , - for the vaster are warlike combinations becoming , and the more rapidly may great blows be struck , so as to make lost opportunities more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blin*ldrifting State to gather its wits , and exeogitate the best means of defending itself . Most sincerely , then , do we trust that our rulers will timeously think out the problems of the future , and not allow England to drift helplessly into new contests for which they have made no preparation , and into new political combinations , of which they have never studied the character or calculated the result . Hitherto we have confined our gaze to Europe . But unlike the Powers of the Continent , and in this possessing an immense advantage over them , the natural alliances of England overleap the seas , and are to be found in every part of the earth . Her children have gone forth conquering and colonizing . Her Indian empire has grown a mighty power , fostering the commerce and adding to the military strength of the mother country . Australia and New Zealand , nursed by the gold-mines of the south , are rapidly advancing in a path of indefinite progress , and towards a goal of majestic power . Canada , with its confederate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , and ever advancing westwards to the shores of the Pacific , throbs in unison with the heart of England , as if they were ( what they are ) brothers . Even the United States , those first seceders from the catholicity of Anglo-Saxondom , - are they not . also to be counted among our natural allies ? We say they are . True , there is at present a quarrel , or complication of quarrels betwixt us , which evenverges towards war ; and there certainly will be frequent bickerings until both sides recognize their true line of policy . But that time will come - must come , - for there is no withstanding the " logic of events . " If it be asked when will the United States become our faithful ally ? the answer is simple , whenever they shall see that it is their interest to be so . We care not for present appearances - we address ourselves to permanent interests , - we endeavor to look down through the ever-fluctuating superficial phenomena to the heart of things ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually approximate into a closer alliance . Nay more , the United States will ere long be forced to abandon their system of neutrality in regard to Old World politics , and in doing so will make common cause with England . They can not act otherwise . As long as danger keeps at a distance from their shores , they will let England fight as she best may , and will only seek to turn the embarrassments of others to their own account . It is in vain to lament the selfishness of this course . Selfishness is the most prevailing law of human nature . Those who are out of danger , ever keep peshing others into the fire , - it is only when the fire comes next to them that they change their tune , and exclaim , " Are we not all brothers ? " So will it be with the United States . At present , England - stout old John Bull , whom slim brother Jonathan abuses so much - stands bolt upright in the face of Europe , and manfully does all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free State in contact with despotic Governments which keep down other free States . England acts as a buffer to America ; and as long as John Bull is able and willing to play this part , brother Jonathan may continue to sneer at the buckler to which , perhaps unknown to himself , he is indebted for his peace an security . At this moment , how he dece*ves hi.mself ! He raves full-cry against 298 // England . Never , we are sorry to say , was jealousy of the mother country more prevalent in the United States than now ; nothing can exceed the bitterness with which they rail at British policy . 0 fo&amp;ls , and blind ! Do you know so little of European politics ? - are you so innocent of all knowledge of cabinet-secrets as not to know that at this moment England is the main obstacle to a European coalition that would seek to arrest the southward progress of the American people , and that would rejoice in humbling the somewhat offensive pride of the " model republic ? " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guarantee Cuba to Spain ? Inquire at the Tuileries , or of your military commisioners lately at Paris , how the French Emperor is disposed , or if he has abandoned his old opinion that , when he became Emperor , the war of all others he should least object to would be one with the United States . Would Spain , whose possessions in the New World you are constantly menacing , like anything better than to form one of a coalition to " draw your teeth ? " Would Denmark , whom you are now likewise threatening , and the States friendly to the assertion of her rights in the Sound question , hesitate to act in a similar fashion ? Not one of them . And besides all this , the despotic governments would have a peculiar desire to damage the American Republic , seeing that they feel that sooner or later they will come into conflict with it . Has Austria forgotten the Kossta affair , or does Russia relish the assertion of such principles ? What stands between ? England - with her vast fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sweep all before it . As long as England sides with America , Europe can not touch her . And it is the last thought in England 's heart to magnify the Continental powers at the expense of America . And yet , blinded by an inordinate estimate of himself , brother Jonathan does not see this , and will go on bullying John Bull to the last . Were John Bull to be smitten hard in the trying times that are coming , America would soon find out her mistake . But as John Bull has no intention of " knocking under , " whatever number of powers may come against him , America is probably destined to be the first enlightened as to her true policy in a milder and less sudden fashion . The Powers of the New World will do well to ponder what is now taking place in the Old . The threats held out against the liberty of the press in other countries , and the alteration of the laws . f maritime warfare to suit the interests of the Continental States , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the future has in store . If these things be done in the *reen tree , what will they not do in the dry . The United States are isolated by that new protocol on naval warfare . England has surrendered her vantage-ground , and now the United States are brought face to face with the opposite principles of the Continental Powers . This is step the first . Naval Confederacies for the assertion of naval rights are as old as the days of the Empress Catherine , - they have often been revived , - and it is plain to demonstration that the increasing intercommunion of nations will develop them still more in our own times . Here , then , is a subject of quarrel already between Europe and the United States . The hostile attitude of the latter , and avowed designs against Central America and the islands of the Mexican Gulf- including possessions of Spain , France , Denmark , England , and Holland  --  and threatening to monopolize that highway of nations , the Isthmus of Panama , constitute still more substantial cause of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steam-navigation advance , the closer are Europe and America brought together , the more irrikating will become the points of difference between them , and the more readily can either assail the other . In other fifty years America and Europe will be as close to one another as England and France were a century ago ; and the long strifes and struggles which England has had and still has to go through with the Continent , will then be extended to America . Then will be seen whether it be true or not , as certain physiologists assert , that the Anglo-Saxon race necessarily degenerates in America ; or whether there will not at last come true as to North America the idea which Canning too confidently expressed of the Spanish republics of the South , when he boasted that he had " called into existence a New World to redress the balance of the Old . " The United States have recently been coquetting with Russia . The community of nations has been startled to see a sudden rapprochement between the representative Powers of absolutism and democracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the sudden friendship between Napoleon and Alexander I. at Tilsis , where the mighty confederates fancied they could live peaceably and divide the world betwixt them . Their sole bond of union was jealousy of England : yet England lives on , and has actually been the means of preventing her two great foes from destroying one another , - first , by helping Russia when attacked by France , and recently France when menaced by Russia ! It will fare no better with this mock-friendship between Russia and the 299 // qwq try . " of troops has been established from Lak. qwq // cross . The Isthmus of the New World is the goal of Transatlantic ambition  --  a destined appanage of the Anglo-Saxons of the West . On the other hand , the Isthmus of the Old World is the cynosure of British policy - the point to which our most watchful attention must be given . There lies our highway to the East- that route on which Gibraltar , Malta , the Lonian Isles , and Aden are our fortified posts ; which has our Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Egypt . Egypt and syria - for commerce will soon flow back into its earliest route , and the steam-car run in the path of the caravans from the Levant to the Persian Gulf . That is a quarter which British statesmen will do well to ponder . A very possible re-arrangement of the European alliances might vitally affect our influence in that important region - France , resuming her old Napoleonic dream , menacing Egypt from Algeria ; and Russia , as Allison has vaticinated , passing down through crumbling Anatolia to the valley of the Euphrates . In such untoward circumstances , however , England would find Allies which can not serve her nearer home ; and , aided by our Indian army and Australian colonies ( who have a direct interest in keeping open the overland communication ) , and combating on a narrow front of land , approa chable on three sides by sea and the British fleets , a much more successful defence could be made than at first sight appears probable . Scandinavia and Syria - such , then , are the quarters which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time seek to draw closer to our side the various scattered fragments of the British race . In truth , the time is coming when England ought amply to reap the benefit of her colonies - of that vast system of enterprise and emigration which will be the most enduring monument of her greatness . She has spread over the earth like a gigantic banyan-tree , dropping in every quarter of the globe roots which in turn become tree : like herself , and forming part of herself , sc that no storms will ever prevail to throw he1 down . If we look merely at the narrow British Isles alongside of the great States of the Continent , expanding in population to a greater extent than is possible with us , and tending to unite themselves in the still greater . aggregations of Race , our heart might fail us for the meteor-flag of England ; but when we lift our eyes beyond the seas , and see new Englands rising , and British blood and language dominating over a third of the inhabited earth , despondency must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Already our colonies are ripe to take upon themselves the burden of their own mainten*nce and defence in ordinary times ; and in seasons of war the aid we have so long extended to them will henceforth , we doubt not , cease to be a one-sided obligation ; - while in the growing commerce subsisting among them , the Anglo-Saxon States will find ample scope for their indi*strial energies , though all the rest of the world were closed against them . Peace will dawn on the world by-and-by , though wars will never entirely cease as long as human nature remains what it is . But whether in peace or in war , no Power yet formed in the world will lastingly extinguish the glory of Britain* The dominion of the seas will cease to be hers exclusively , but only to merge into the grander maritime supremacy of the United Anglo-Saxon family . And whatever may be the Coalitions and Confederacies of the future , through the haze of years is there the coming of one greater than them all , in a Congress of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sufficient in war , will shine forth most conspicuously in the better peaceful times a-coming , helping on that period when a Christianized civilization shall cover the earth " as the waters do the channels of the sea .
