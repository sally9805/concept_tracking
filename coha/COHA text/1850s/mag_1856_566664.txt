txt ART . 11. - INSANITY AND CRIME . Report of the Trial of Willard Clark , indicted for the murder of Richard IF . Wig14t , before the Superior Court of Connecticut , holden at New Haven , Sept. 17 , 1855. pp. 217 . New Haven : T. II . Pease . THERE 1S quite a general dissatisfaction in the community with the verdict in this case . It is unfortunate that it should be so , for the respect which is due to law is impaired whenever its decisions do not meet with the public approval . The certainty that the endsof justice will be attained in our courts is a great security to the good order and morality of the community . It is a terror to evildoers , restraining them from crime ; and it is a source of salutary and comforting confidence to all law-abiding citizens . And just so far as this security is impaired by a conflict between the convictions of the public and the decisions of law , are both the restraint upon evildoers on the one hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lessened . In the present case , although the dissatisfaction is far from being unfounded , it is based for the most part upon wrong grounds . The general feeling is , that the result of this trial furnishes an example of the supposed facility with which criminals can escape the penalties of the law on a false plea of insanity . The community at large are in gross error on this point . Establishing the plea of insanity on false grounds , it is true , is // possible ; but it is by no means an easy achievement . We know not of a single case in which it is clear that this has been done ; and , on the other hand , we know of many cases in which the jury failed to be satisfied of the existence of insanity , where it really did exist , and rendered a verdict of guilty . We will allude to but a single case . It is that of the poor negro Freeman , who killed the Van Ness f*tmily , consisting of four persons . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , who came near making him a victim of Lynch law before the trial , were eager to have the sentence executed , because they considered him so bloodthirsty a niurderer . Mr. Seward , who defended him , succeeded in obtaining a grant for a new trial . But this trial never took place . The judge , before whom Freeman was to be tried , visited him in his cell , and , becoming satisfied of his insanity , refused to try him . In a few months the prisoner died , and the evidence of his insanity was satisfactory to every one that was acquainted with the case . There have been so many cases in which there have been convictions of persons actually insane , that there is some danger that experts , having their sympathies awakened , may be too ready to find insanity , and may therefore fail to sift the evidence with sufficient thoroughness in doubtful cases . This is the only ground of danger that we see , and there is reason for the utterance of a caution on this point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies are to render difficult , rather than easy , the proof of insanity to a jury . For the community generally are disposed to rest their belief of the existence of insanity only upon the most palpable evidence-that which is furnished by overt acts . And a jury will commonly have the views that prevail in the community on this subject . We have known some cases of even incurable insanity , in which its existence was doubted for a long time by the community at large . We call to mind one case in which this mistake on the part of nonprofessional observers was very striking . The patient was a member of a family in which insanity was manifestly hereditary . The disease had come on in her case very gradually . To most casual observers there did not appear to be anything more than a strange earnestness , with some peculiarity of views on certain topics . She was supposed to have lost her balance of mind , as it was expressed ; and some very sensible persons would not allow that even this was true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confinement in an Insane Hospital , had she not just previous to our doing so // manifested her insanity by a palpable overt act . And yet no medical man could fail to see evidence of insanity in her conversation ; and we were persuaded at the first that it was an incurable case , as it proved to be . The dissatisfaction of the community with the verdict in the case before us , does not arise simply from their lack of appreciation of the evidence of insanity . If it were so , the dissatisfaction would be easily removed by the influence of physicians , and others , who have some acquaintance with the subject . Their opinions and explanations would gradually set the public mind right . But the general dissatisfaction , in this case depends in part upon the fact , that discerning men , acquainted with the subject of insanity and with the habits of the insane , fail to see , in the testimony adduced , clear evidence that the homicide was an insane act . Not that they claim that Clark was proved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not definitely settle the question of insanity . There are deficiencies and discrepancies in the testimony that forbid a satisfactory conclusion on this point . The mode of investigating it was not such as should satisfy a truly scientific inquirer . In saying this we mean no disrespect to the experts , IDrs . IRay , Butler and Earle , who testified so decidedly to the insanity of the prisoner , as will be seen in our statement of the case . Much blame has been cast upon the jury , but we think without reason . They did the best that they could do under the circumstances . We should have been better satisfied if they had not agreed upon a verdict , for then a more thorough examination of the great question in the case might have been had . But they undoubtedly thought it incumbent upon them to come to a definite decision , and render a verdict either of guilty or not guilty ; and we certainly would be far from demanding of them a verdict of guilty , for sanity was quite as far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is to be remembered that the law is such at present , that the jury were allowed but little latitude in regard to the form of their verdict . The manifest deficiency of the law to which we allude , we shall remark upon in another part of this article . The report of the trial of Clark is very full , covering over two hundred pages . We propose to examine it for certain purposes which will appear as we proceed . The main facts of the history of this homicide are these : Willard Clark , the prisoner , became engaged to Miss Bogart ( now Mrs. Wight , the widow of Wight , who was killed by Clark ) in the summer of 18*2 , and remained so till January // 1 , 1854 . She then dismissed him , and at once Wight began his particular attentions to her . Exactly at what time he became engaged to her does not appear . His attentions were omitted from March to October , for what reason we are not informed . He was married to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family occasionally during all this time , and even after the marriage . On the day of the homicide , April 18 , he called twice . His first visit was in the afternoon . He did not find Mrs. Wight at home , but had some conversation with Mrs. Bogart , her mother . He seemed to be much troubled because Mrs. Wight was to leave her father 's house that evening to go to another place of residence with her husband , whom Clark seems to have believed to be so vile that her connection with him was her certain ruin . Just at dusk of the same day he called again , and in the presence of the family shot Wight through the head , with a pistol which he had borrowed that afternoon with the avowed purpose of killing a cat . After the commission of the deed he walked deliberately out of the house , returned the pistol , saying that he had shot a two-legged cat , went to his shop , and when the officer came for him , he accompanied him without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great suffering , but without sufficient consciousness to have any communication with those that watched over him . There are two entirely opposite explanations given of this homicide by the attorney for the state , and the counsel for the prisoner . The attorney for the state claims that the deed was committed by a sane man from mere revenge towards a man that had taken his place in the affections of Miss Boo'art and that he was impelled to the deed by his vices and his infidel principles , the former corrupting him and inflaming his passions and propensities , and the latter making him reckless of all consequences . The counsel for the prisoner , on the other hand , claim that Clark was not actuated by a wicked revenge , but that the deed was committed in obedience to certain insane delusions , viz , that Mrs. Wight loved him and not her husband ; that Wight was a villain , and was working the ruin of his wife ; and that his mission was to kill Wight , and thus deliver her from ruin . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that they had no special connection with the act , and also that there was nothing in his habits of life that led him to it . Much ground is covered by the defense in the attempt to prove the insanity of Clark . We may classify the testimony on this point thus:1 . Testimony claimed to show atClarks // father was insane . 2 . Testimony claimed to show that Clark was insane , or in a state at least bordering upon insanity , in Chicopee , Mass. , in 1847 , eight years before the commission of the homicide . 3 . Testimony claimed to show that he was insane in 1850 , for a very short period . 4 . Testimony claimed to show that he was insane for about six months previous to the homicide . 5 . Testimony claimed to show his insanity in the most satisfactory manner a little over three months after the homicide . The testimony introduced in regard to Clark 's father was intended to show that Clark inherited a disposition to insanity . It was , however , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hands . The testimony in relation to Clark 's conduct in the Chicopee love affair of 1847 , is all in the form of depositions in answer to certain interrogatories . As we know nothing of the character of the witnesses , and as they were not subjected to the ordeal of a cross-examination , we should distrust , to some extent at least , any inferences that may be drawn from their testimony . As to the testimony in regard to a single strange transaction in 1850 , standing as it does so entirely by itself ; with no evidence pointing in any way to insanity for years after or years before it , we think it of little account . The evidence on the remaining two points , the fourth and fifth , is the only portion of the testimony addnced to prove insanity , upon which any real reliance should be placed . It is this testimony alone , of all that was offered by the defense , that can have any clear bearing upon the state of Clark 's mind at the time of the homicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with some rebutting testimony offered on the part of the state . It is claimed by the defense that this testimony shows distinctly that Clark began to be decidedly insane about November , 1854 , nearly six months before the homicide , and that the insanity was recognized clearly three months after this act , in the two interviews which IDrs . Earle and Butler each had with Clark at that time . It may be stated here that IDrs . Earle and Butler were present during all the trial , and that they testified that the testimony which they heard corroborated the opinion which they formed at these interviews . Dr. Ray also was present throughout the trial up to the time of the rendering of his own testimony , which consisted simply of opinions on the evidence which he had heard , and of which he took notes . His opinion coincided with that of Drs . Butler and Earle. // Let us first look at the testimony in regard to Clark 's appearance and conduct for some time before the homicide . Certain evidences of insanity are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this testimony . These are , inattention to business ; absence of mind ; depression of spirits ; sleeplessness ; and an occasional silly angh , which was insisted upon as a very decisive sign . The testimony in regard to these points is very contradictory . Some testified that they saw these evidences of insanity in Clark , while others testified that they did not . It is true that positive evidence is of more value than mere negative evidence on such points . But the positive evidence is not in itself satisfactory . Besides , there were some witnesses strangely absent , whose testimony on these points would have probably been of greater value than that of any others , viz , Clark 's clerk , and his most intimate friend , Walter Barnet . The testimony of the latter would also have been of value on some other points , as appears from the reference made to him by some other witnesses . The testimony of some of the witnesses in relation to Clark 's appearance and conduct , is evidently very highly colored . We refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although they were unimpeachable witnesses , it was manifest that from very natural causes they drew too strong pictures . They make Clark cry altogether too much . Their testimony is exaggerated in other respects also . As an example of this exaggeration , coming from intense sympathy and an excited imagination , we cite the following passage from the testimony of his sister . " One evening he came up and lay down on the sofa , and seemed to feel very wild . He shifted his head from one place to another , and rolled up his eyes . Mrs. Collinswas there . She said , are you sick , or are yon crazy ? He did n't answer for some time , and then said , they are trying to roast me . He then jumped up and ran down stairs . " Such an account is not at all consistent with the indefinite insanity claimed to exist in Clark 's case . None but a man palpably and strongly insane , or one afflicted with delirium tremens , wonid say tti at they were roasting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . We are informed that this expression is a sla*ng phrase ; and probably the use of it by Clark , as such , took hold of the imagination of his sister , when she called it up to her recollection . Other parts of the testimony have the same inconsistency , as compared with Clark 's general appearance and conduct as seen by others . In the testimony in regard to Clark before the homicide , there appear certain notions that are claimed by the defense to be insane delusions . It will be proper to comment upon these // in connection with the testimony of IDrs . Butler and Earle , for here they are brought out in full with some additions . They visited Clark for a personal examination of his ease about three months after the homicide . They visited him separately , twice each , Dr. Earle on July 26 and 27 , in all five hours , and IDr . Butler August 4 and 21 , three hours and a half at the first visit , and how long at the second he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who they were , or for what purpose they visited him . All that he knew , as they supposed , was that one of his counsel , Mr. Harrison , brought them there to talk with him and hear his story . The testimony of both as to his delusions is very much the same . These delusions were three in number-his notion , in opposition to decided evidence to the contrary , that Mrs. Wight loved him and did not love Wighthis idea that Wight was a villain , having a strange power over Mrs. Wight , intending to ruin her , and that for this purpose he had seduced her before he married her  --  and then , springing from all this , his idea that he had a mission to perform , which was to deliver this woman from ruin by killing her destroyer . Taking these ideas with the views and arguments , many of them absurd , which he adduced in their support , the case looks like an undoubted case of insanity . These notions appear , to some extent , in some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is true especially of his notions in regard to the affections of Mrs. Wight and the character and acts of her husband . The other idea , that it was right for him to kill Wight in order to deliver Mrs. Wight from ruin , does not appear then , though perhaps it may be claimed that there are some indications of at least a tendency to such an idea . Clark , in his conversation with Dr. Butler three mouths after the homicide , did indeed tell him that he had determined to kill Wight , but that he consulted his friend Barnet about the plan , who dissuaded him from it . But of the truth of this we know nothing , for Barnet , as we have before stated , was strangely absent at the time of the trial . His name was called with those of the other witnesses for the defense , but he did not appear . The attorney for the state , observing this , at once instituted a search for this witness , but he could not be found , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance till after the trial was finished . If he had been present , and had testified that Clark did thus broach to him the plan of killing Wight for the sake of rescuing Mrs. Wight from destruction , here would have been a strong confirmation of the great point of the defense . On the other hand , if he had testified that Clark had never said anything to him // about his intention to kill Wight , it would have weakened materially the argument of the defense on this point . It is much to be regretted that the testimony of this witness could not have been heard in the case , for it would have had an important bearing upon the great point on which all hinges . For the question in the case is , whether Clark committed the homicide from wicked revenge , or from the insane delusion that he would thus save Mrs. Wight from ruin . If the existence of this delusion can not be proved , the defense falls to the ground . The other delusions may be proved to exist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man to be insane , he can not be held guiltless in* the eye of the law , unless it be proved that the delusion in regard to his mission existed also , and prompted the commission of the homicide . This link is absolutely necessary to connect the insanity directly with the act . This point we shall recur to again . If Ofark killed Wight from the insane idea that he would thus rescue his wife from destruction , we should expect that after he had committed the deed he would , if he expressed any feeling at all , express that of joy at the accomplishment of his design . But how was it ? At the first he said nothing by which you could judge what his views and feelings were in committing the act . And when he did speak of them , did this delusion in regard to his mission come out ? Not at all . But , on the contrary , his language was that of gratified revenge . Just after the homicide the Rev. Mr. Garfield had long conversations with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gives in his testimony . In these conversations things were said that were calculated to bring out the delusion in regard to his mission , if it existed in his mind ; but they failed to do it . Mr. Garfield reminded him " that he had committed a great fault , of which he ought to repent . " What was his reply to this ? Was it a defense of himself on the ground that he had saved a lovely woman from being the ruined victim of Wight ? Not at all . One would suppose that the insane chord would have responded to such a touch , but it did not . Clark simply said that he " did n't know as to that . " And then in reply to Mr. Garfield 's remark , that he had sent a fellow-mortal into eternity without preparation , he brought out his infidel sentiments , saying , " I do n't believe in any eternity for him or any other man ; if he dies that will be the end of him . " Mr. Garfield then said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not candid to the man of whom you borrowed the pistol . " To this Clark replied , " I did shoot a two-legged cat . " Mr. Garfield asked , " IDo you intend to compare a fellow-man to a beast ? " Clark said " Yes , // so far as relates to his death it will be all the same . " The conversation , let it be observed , was a very free one , and while the small estimate which Clark in his infidelity put upon the value of human life was most fully brought out , there was not a hint of the insane delusion which it is claimed by the defense prompted the homicide . But let us look a little further . The next day after this conversation , when Clark had heard of the death of Wight , he expressed himself to Mr. Garfield as being " fally satisfied . " Satisfied at what ? That his mission was accomplished , and that the woman was now safe from the destroyer 's toils ? Ko . His utterance is simply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a debt , and I have paid it . " He said also to Dr. Hubbard that he " did n't suppose that any one would justify him in what he had done to Wight , but that he had had his revenge , and was satisfied . " And then some two monQis after he said to Martin Gunn , with an oath , that he " was glad Wight was dead and out of the way . " There is one conversation , in which , perhaps , it may be claimed that Clark 's delusion as to his mission appears . It is his conversation with Jacob Gould shortly after the homicide . He said to him that in killing Wight he had no other wish than to promote Mrs. Wight 's happiness , and that he harbored no malice against Wight . All that can be said of this is , that it is consistent with the existence of the delusion in question ; but it is far from being enough to prove that the delusion did exist . If this delusion really did exist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , immediately after the homicide , overtop everything else in his expressions of his views and feelings . We do not mean that it would absolutely shut out all personal feelings of revenge as a matter of course , but that it would , at least , stand out in bold relief , and that other views and feelings would be but occasionally and slightly manifested . For the delusions of the insane man possess him . It is this strong word that fitly expresses their hold upon the mind . They are accordingly ever ready to manifest themselves . They respond to the slightest touch . The mind can indeed be directed to other subjects ; but any , the smallest , circumstance associated with the delusion wakes it up at once . It is this " method in madness " which is strikingly absent in Clark 's case , so far as we can judge from the testimony before us . And the absence of it certainly throws doubt on his pretended insanity . There is another fact which throws doubt upon Clark 's insanity . // Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confinement in prison , have not appeared to any one since . He has slept well since the homicide , which was said not to be the case before . His absent-mindedness has disappeared . There is no deep study in him , requiring that he should be spoken to more than once to get an answer . Much was said , by the experts , of the silly laugh , as being a very strong sign of insanity . No one has seen this since his confinement . Drs . Earle and Butler do not testify that they saw it in their long conversations with Clark . Yet in those conversations there was a full development of the insane delusions . The insanity , it seems , was , according to their view , fully upon him . If so , somebody , during all the period of his confinement to that time , a little over three months , should have seen these signs . Surely there is some lack of the usual " method in madness " here . Perhaps it may be said that , the deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he thought , his satisfaction at the result freed him from his perturbed state of mind , he being nevertheless as insane as ever . If so , then this satisfaction should have been expressed . At least he should not have expressed merely a gratified revenge . We have thus commented on the material points in the testimony . There are some other minor points which it would be interesting to examine , if it would not make this article too long . We will barely notice two of them . One is Clark 's pretended indifference as to his impending trial , which was quite a point in Dr. Butler 's testimony . We simply remark in relation to this , that there is ample evidence in the testimony of Mr. Knevals and others , that he was far from being indifferent on this subject . The other point is the coolness which he exhibited at the time that he committed the deed and afterward . This is as easily accounted for on the supposition that it was an act of wicked revenge , as on the supposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself up to the deliberate commission of a crime , he is apt to be cool and collected , from the continued concentration of thought and feeling upon the act . This is the explanation of Webster 's cool and unruffled state after the murder of Dr. Parkman . He was so calm that no one saw anything in his manner to awaken the least suspicion . Even when his daughter , in the midst of an evening party , playfully said to him , that people would susp ect him of killing Dr. Parkman , he did not in the least lose his self-possession . There are three different suppositions that can be made in re // gard to the case before us. 1 . That insanity , as claimed by the counsel for the prisoner , not only existed , but was the procuring cause of the homicide . 2 . That insanity existed , but if it had any influence at all , it only concurred with other causes to make him commit the deed . 3 . That , as the attorney for the state claimed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sheer wickedness . If we take the testimony of all who testify to Clark 's insanity as being perfectly true without any coloring , and if we exclude the testimony of Mr. Garfield , Dr. Hubbard and others , as to his state of mind immediately after the homicide , there is made out quite a clear case of insanity , and that too as directly and fully the cause of the homicide . Kot that there would be no doubt . Even then we should feel that some expression of gratification at the result of his mission is needed to fill out the chain of evidence ; and we should think it strange that the silly laugh and other signs of insanity , seen before the homicide , were not seen after it . If , on the other hand , we consider the testimony of those witnesses who expressed the belief that Clark was insane from what the saw of him before the homicide to be somewhat exaggerate ; and take into account the undoubted testimony as to Clark 's expression of revenge as his predominant feeling after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time to the delusion of his mission so much dwelt upon by Drs . Butler and Earle , we think that quite as conclusive an argument can be made out for Clark 's sanity , under these conditions , as there could be for his insanity , under the conditions mentioned in the previous paragraph . But it will be asked how , in making out this argument for Clark 's sanity , we can account for the distinctness with which the delusions appeared when he was visited by IDrs . Butler and Earle three months after the homicide . They think that they could not have been deceived-that the simulation of insanity in this case in this form was impossible . But without any disparagement of their skill , we believe that it is among the possible things , though exceedingly difficult . We have seen quite as difficult things accomplished in the practice of deception . We can conceive the manner in which the prisoner might , in the three months which elapsed between the homicide and the visit* of IDrs . Earle and Butler , concoct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill . The mode we will briefly indicate . It will be agreed on all hands that Clark had a strong affection for Miss Bogart . Although a corrupt man , hi* feelings and passions were concentrated upon this object . // He had in her an absorbing subject of thought and feeling . But she discarded him , and another took his place in her affections . I*t is not necessary to suppose insanity to account for Clark 's thinking that she still loved him . We have seen such exhibitions of weakness where there was no insanity . It would be natural for Clark also , in contemplating revenge upon his rival , to entertain some justifying considerations in his mind . He would welcome , therefore , the slightest shadow of evidence that Wight 's character was bad . Imagination would be alive to create such a suspicion , and to change it into real verity . Especially would this be the case here , as Clark himself attempted to take improper liberties with Mrs. Wight when he was engaged to her . Now on the supposition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this which we have mentioned would come in incidentally both before and after the homicide . His counsel would get hold of these points , both from the prisoner and from others who were conversant with him , and by questioning him froni time to time , would bring them out into bolder and bolder relief . If we suppose Clark to be even wholly ignorant of the subject of insanity , we can see the process by which he could gather the requisite material for its simulation . By books on insanity , and perhaps by conversation with experts , his counsel finds out what is necessary as evidence of insanity , and so his questions to the prisoner bear more and more on the points alluded to , and develop them more and more . Clark sees what they mean , and takes hints from them . His counsel thus unwittingly instructs him as to what is wanted ; and by the time that IDrs . Earle and Butler come , he is prepared with his full development of delusions . The revenge , so prominent at the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is uttered . To these experts Clark appears as innocent and truthful as possible . They would not suspect that he could talk of revenge , and that with an oath . His benevolent mission in relation to Mrs. Wight is the all-absorbing subject . Not a word is said now about his materialism . No comparisons , such as he made between the murdered Wight and a dead cat , are uttered now . He is even eloquent in his defense of the course which he pursued in accomplishing the delix'erance of the victim of Wight 's villainy , and quotes glibly from the Bible and from Tupper 's Proverbial Philosophy . There is nothing in the supposition thus made which is at all inconsistent with perfect honesty and good faith on the part of the counsel for the prisoner , Mr. Harrison . His indefatigable zeal in the defense of him who was once his schoolmate , was undoubtedly fired by the conviction , all the while becoming // stronger , that in committing the homicide , Clark was the pitiable victim of an insane impulse which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Clark saw this indicated in the enquiries which his counsel made of him , for he said to Dr. Butler that he supposed the plea was to be insanity . Taking into view all the testimony , and estimating , as well as we can , the relative values of different parts of it , we think that there is a decided preponderance in favor of the second of the three suppositions that we have stated , viz , that Clark was insane when he committed the homicide , but that his insanity only concurred with other causes when he committed the act . It appears clear that two of the three delusions clainied by the defense existed in his mind  --  the idea that Mrs. Wight loved him and not Wight , and the idea that Wight was a villain , working her ruin . But the existence of the third delusion-that of his mission  --  the delusion needed to connect the homicide directly with his insanity-is very far from being proved by the testimony presented in this trial . But it will perhaps be said , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing of Wight from a wicked revenge . We will allow that the delusion in regard to the mission to kill Wight might naturally spring from the other two delusions in the insane mind ; but it is by no means a necessary product of them . Not only so , but they are consistent with the commission of crime from the influence of some wicked passion , as revenge . And their agency in causing the act might be only to add fuel to the flame of passion . low far this incidental and indirect influence of insanity diminishes responsibility , is a question which we will not now discuss . Perhaps , too , it will be said , that the existence of the two delusions alluded to , would forbid the exercise of the cunning requisite to make such a show of the other delusion as would deceive such skillful experts as Drs . Earle and Butler . But cunning , for the purpose of obtaining an object , is a very common thing in the insane . The man who has determined upon running away from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attendants off their guard . That is , he ma* in part conceal his insanity . Sometimes the insane conceal their insanity quite thoroughly , and for a long time , for the purpose of accomplishing some object . So , too , could the insane Clark , for the purpose of escaping the penalty of his crime , practice cunning . He could add to the natural manifestations of his insanity as readily , perhaps , as others could lessen them . He supposed that the plea of insanity was to be set up , as he // told iDr . Butler ; and , so far as we can judge from the testimony , he was not so crazy as to forbid his cunningly furnishing more material for such a plea than really belonged to his case . The opinion that we have given is upon the evidence as it appears in the trial . But there is palpable deficiency in the evidence . This is not by any means as complete as it should have been . The investigation of the question of insanity in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not give an opinion on this question with full confidence . A satisfactory investigation might perhaps have brought us to a different , or even an opposite conclusion . There is a great chasm in the evidence for the defense . It is a chasm that stretches over three months of the history of the case , and that , too , the most important part of its history . The defense , full on every other part , is utterly silent here . It tells us nothing of the state of mind of the prisoner after the homicide till three months have elapsed , and then bursts upon us a full exposition of a tissue of delusions . Under these circumstances there is certainly some ground of suspicion that there is imposture on the part of the prisoner . How do the defense meet this suspicion ? It is said on the authority of the experts who testified , that Clark could not have woven such a tissue of delusions as he presented to IDrs . Butler and Earle at their visits . We have already shown how insanity could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part , or even wholly simulated , and need not again dwell on this point . But it is said , also , that these delusions , so fully developed at these visits , were also developed to some considerable degree before the homicide . The evidence on this point is not wholly satisfactory even in regard to the least important of the delu .. sions , and is entirely deficient in regard to that delusion , on which hangs the question of the connection of the homicide with the insanity , if insanity existed . The mere chasm then which appears in the evidence of the defense , gives rise to the suspicion of simulation . But this suspicion receives confirmation from the positive testimony introduced by the state , and occupying , though by no means filling , this chasm . The testimony referred to is small in amount , but what there is has much significance . And we need not remark again upon its discordance with the evidence as to Clark 's condition , offered in the testimony of Drs . Earle and Butler . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to Clark 's condition after the homicide , up to the time of the trial . Certain signs of // insanity testified to by witnesses who were conversant with him before the homicide , did not appear during all this period of nearly five months . This we have already remarked upon in another connection . Now although the opinion of IDrs . Ray and Earle and Butler , that Clark was insane , was given with great confidence , we think that the testimony leaves some doubt on the question of his insanity , and very great doubt upon the question whether insanity , if it did exist , was the direct cause of the commission of the homicide . And we say again that these questions were not properly investigated . There was no searching investigation , as there should have been , of the condition of Clark 's mind during the most important period of the case . We are left to hap-hazard revelations at the very time when investigation is essential . Investigation after a lapse of three months was for many reasons too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case was not used when it could be had . The golden moments of discovery , when crucial experiments might have ascertained the exact truth , were left to slip by . If the investigation indicated had been made , we know not what would have been the result . How it would have decided the two great questions of the case-viz , whether Clark was insane , and if so , what connection his insanity had with the homicide-is entirely in the dark to us . We never have seen a case in which there was so much testimony , and yet such a lack of that which is absolutely essential . If this essential evidence had been obtained , it would have thrown light upon the doubtful and deficient points of the case , and cleared up its discrepancies . If , for example , under the investigation alluded to , the story told by Clark to IDrs . Butler and Earle had been told by him with all its minutia immediately or soon after the homicide , the proof not only of the existence of insanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been complete . if , on the other hand , such an investigation had shown that revenge was the absorbing feeling , and not merely incidental , and that the notions or delusions , to which allusion has so often been made , were rather faint and indistinct at first , and were only developed by the questions put to him from time to time , the conclusion would have been , that the homicide was the result of wickedness , and that if there was insanity , it had little to do with the commission of the deed . Now where lies the blame of the defective mode of investigating the question of insanity in this case ? No blame is to // be attached to the attorney for the state or the counsel for the prisoner . They were not aware of the importance of the evidence , which might have been obtained by a searching investigation during the three months after the homicide . Neither are we to blame the experts who began their investigation after this time had elapsed . They did the best that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be blamed . The fault is in the mode of investigating such cases , established by custom , we can hardly say by law . It is a very loose and inefficient mode , as is seen in the case before us . The law needs to step in and establish a better mode . Of this we shall speak further on . There is another defect , a minor one it is true , but still a defect in this prevalent mode of investigating the question of insanity in such cases , which deserves a notice . It makes the scientific witnesses in their relation to the case , and therefore to some extent in their feelings , witnesses either for the state or for the prisoner . They are more or less partisans . We say more or less . There is under such circumstances an influence which has more or less effect , according to the character , both mental and moral , of the witness . Some resist it better than others , but all feel it , and in some degree yield to it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case is a clear one . But in a case where there are discrepancies and deficiencies in the testimony , as in the case before us it would manifest itself . IDrs . Ray and Earle and Butler are men of undoubted honesty ; but we think we can see in them some little of this influence , in their overlooking what we consider to be discrepancies and defects in the testii*iony bearing on the question of Clark 's insanity . And if it can be seen in such men , it would be much more operative in men of less stern integrity and less acuteness of discrimination . In England , where the question of insanity is brought before legal tribunals in various ways much more often than it is in this country as yet , the influence referred to is so often witnessed , that it is frequently commented upon in the public journals . It is no unusual thing there to see scientific men arranged against each other , and giving opposite opinions , each one being retained as a witness either on the one side or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical testimony in relation to the question of insanity , was on one side , that of the defense . After two of the medical witnesses had visited Clark , and had come to the conclusion from their examination that he was insane , the attorney for the state requested Drs . Knight and Jewett to visit the prisoner . Dr. Jewett went to the prison for // this purpose , but Clark declined to talk with him , unless his counsel should consent . The result of the matter was that the counsel did not consent , and so D rs . Knight and Jewett did not converse with the prisoner . For ourselves , we do not see why they were thus excluded . If they were persons incapable of discrimination on the subject of insanity , or if they went there from mere idle curiosity , the exclusion would have been certainly proper . But as they are intelligent physicians , and one of them of very large experience in insanity , as well as in disease generally , no " unguarded expression " dropped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This exclusion may be right , for ought we know , according to the rules of legal tactics ; but it certainly shows , that the investigation of the question of insanity in this case was kept , so far as it could be , in the hands of the counsel for the defense . Now we think that every one will allow , that the examination of a purely scientific question should , as much as possible , be taken away from all influences which would bias the investigators , and especially in a case of such importance as the one under consideration . They should not be in any sense or degree retained on either side . They should be wholly untrammeled in their investigations . The considerations that we have thus presented in relation to the defects in the prevakut mode of investigating the question of insanity in such cases as the one before us , bring us to the main object that we have had in writing this article . The enquiry arises in view of these defects , whether there is any p lan by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been Jong in use in France , which is of this character . The practice there is , in any case where insanity is suspected , to place the prisoner under the supervision of what is termed a Commission of Lunacy , composed of men who are practically qualified to decide such a question . They examine all the facts in the case , applying every possible test . They converse with the prisoner , observe him at all hours , instruct the attend - ants how to observe him , confront him with his friends and companions , and go through a most pains-taking investigation , taking notes of the whole of it . Upon the data thus gathered they make their report under oath . And a distino*uished English writer on insanity says of these reports , that they are " remarkable for sound reasoning , extensive pyschopathic knowledge and integrity of purpose . " This Commission , it is to be observed , is appointed by the government , and neither the attorney for the state , nor the counsel for the prisoner , have anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // left to carry out their scientific examination of the case coolly and perseveringly , without any influences that can bias them . It must be obvious to every one , that if Clark had , immediately after the homicide , been subjected to such a prolonged and thorough and unbiassed examination as this method secures , the two great questions in his case would not have been left in doubt as they are now . Such a Commission would have filled up the chasm that now appears in the testimony with evidence of the most decisive character . The most valuable time for investigating the case would not have been left to pass by , without making any discoveries , except what came by mere chance . Simulation of insanity , with such constant and long continued watching and such varied tests , would be sure to be detected . And we may remark in passing , that if the French regard such a pains-taking course as necessary to guard against deception , it certainly implies that deception is possi. ble when the investigation is delayed for months after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during two visits . On the other hand , if such an investigation as this ought to satisfy scientific men , then the French method is useless and even ridiculous pains-taking . This plan , which has been so long in use in France , has been found to work satisfactorily there . All scientific men are satisfied with the conclusions arrived at by the Commissions of Lunacy , and there is no feeling there , as there often is here and in England , that the question of the existence of insanity is not fully and fairly investigated . We hope then that the same plan will be adopted in this country , and that the Legislature of Connecticut will act upon it at its next session , as the defects of the plan in vogue among us have been recently so plainly exemplified . Another object which we have had in reviewing this trial , is to bring out distinctly the important fact , that the relations of insanity to crime are various in degree and form . This fact has not yet been recognized in courts of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bare fact that a man is insane does not furnish a valid excuse for crime . In order to make a verdict of entire acquittal proper , the act must flow wholly , or chiefly at least , from the insanity . There must be a tide from this direction which the man can not resist , to remove responsibility and deliver from punishment . The act for which a man really insane may be arraigned , may be one of sheer wickedness . His insanity may have nothing to do with it . This , however , is seldom the case . More often the insanity either is the sole or at least chief cause of the // act ; or it exerts an incidental influence , operating merely as an auxiliary agency . In this latter case , a very natural question arises-viz , how far this incidental or concurrent influence of insanity should lessen the penalty . In some cases it should do so , more or less , according to the degree of agency exerted by the insanity . This is often a difficult point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be settled can be furnished only by the thorough mode of investigation which we have described as followed by the Commissions of Lunacy in France . The ordinary mode pursued in this country and in England is wholly incompetent to master a point like this . In some cases this insanity may exert an incidental influence , and yet may afford no ground for lessening the penalty . To make this clear we will suppose that Clark was possessed with the one insane delusion , that Mrs. Wight loved him and did not love her husband . This delusion in itself would not prompt him to kill Wight . It might act , however , as an auxiliary agency . It might intensify in him the desire for revenge , and thus have an incidental influence in pushing him on to the fatal act . So might the momentary excitement of passion . So too might his gross infidelity and materialism , making him reckless of life . But , neither his momentary passion , nor his infidelity , acting thus incidentally , would be considered by a jury as palliating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has merely the incidental influence to which we have referred . We would like to go into this subject more extensively , but it would make this article too long . We have thrown out a few of the leading ideas which it suggests , with the hope that they may stimulate those who have the subject of the jurisprudence of insanity in hand , to a full investigation of the principles involved in reference to their practical application . The laws evidently need to be to some extent altered , in order to conform to the principles indicated . Without dwelling on this point we would merely remark , that in the case before us , if the jury had come to the conclusion , that , though Clark was insane , his insanity had only an incidental influence in causing him to commit the homicide , and yet to such an extent as to palliate his guilt , they could not have rendered a verdict in accordance with this opinion . They were shut up to the alternative of a verdict of guilty , or one of not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the conclusion of his charge , used this language : " was he capable of understanding the transaction or was he not ? If he was , you have no alternative but to pronounce him guilty ; if he was not , then he is not guilty . " There are other points than those indicated , // in which the laws need to be altered . These we can not now discuss ; but it will suffice to say in relation to them , that there are cases in which the safety of the community ought to be regarded , irrespective to some extent of the deo'ree of ity and guilt of the prisoner . responsibilThere is still another object that we have had in view in noticing this trial . We wish to call the attention of our readers to the marked influence of irreligion and immorality in producing insanity . If insanity exists in the mind of Clark it is the result , for the most part , of these causes . And therefore in a world of retribution , according to the immutable principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his insanity . There may be , it is true , mitigating circumstances , which will be allowed to lessen the fall penalty ; but they can not wholly remove it . It is well to note the circumstances under which the causes just alluded to are apt to produce insanity . They are not apt to do so when they appear in the unintellectual . The Ifesotted , uneducated votaries of vice are not particularly liable to insanity . Mental activity is commonly a necessary element in the production of this result . It is in those therefore that are elevated intellectually by some degree of education that irreligion and vice are apt to cause insanity . A sentimental immorality , as we may term it , such as is consistent with and is often produced by the reading of the unnatural and immoral fictions so abundant at the present time , has a much greater influence than is commonly supposed in unsettling the mind , and therefore in causing mental disease . And in conjunction with this influence often comes in another agency , a disposition to doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawing the mind from all rational and stable views in regard totli e mysteries around and within us , sets it afloat without chart or compass , only to make shipwreck , we know not where , it may be in insanity . Whether we regard Clark as committing a sane or an insane act in killing Wight , both of the causes to which we have just alluded were the chief agencies that led to the deed , acting more directly if he was sane , but not the less effectually if he was insane . Once he was the quiet and obedient pupil , with one of his counsel , Mr. Harrison , and the assistant of the attorney for the state , Mr. Keese , as schoolmates . Why is it that , while they occupy stations of honor and usefulness , he is now in prison for this homicide ? However much may be made out of the testimony adduced to show that there was in Clark an hereditary taint of insanity , we must look to his vicious habits of thought and feeling and action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies without which he would never have committed this deed . When he was a very young man he left the employment of the venerable Dr. Croswell , who thought much of him , to enter upon an agency for some publisher of trashy and vile publications . ile became an inveterate devourer of novels , soon a skeptic , then an avowed infidel and materialist , and , as the developments of the trial show , a thoroughly vicious man . The downward tendency was constant , and the final sad result should be held up as a warning in regard to those agencies , so extensively at work at this time , corrupting the morals and unsettling the minds of the unwary , the results of which , if not distinctly seen , as in the case before us , in this world , will be most fully developed in another .
