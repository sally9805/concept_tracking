txt ART . IX . - Remarks on the Th odaction of the Precious Metals , and on the Depreciation of Gold . By M. MICHEL CHEVALIER* Member of the Institute of France , &amp;e . Translated by D. FoRBEs CAMPBELL , Esq . London : Smith , Elder , &amp; Co. 18.5.3 . Svo. pp. 117 . M. CHEvALIER stands at the head of the political economlsts of France . He is eminent not only for his thorough knowledge of the theory of the science , but for his familiarity with statistical details , and for the successful manner in which he has applied them to the elucidation and proof of the leading doctrines of political economy . It was , indeed , as a statistical writer that he first became distinguished , and gained the high honor of membership of the French Institute . His work upon the resources of this country , in particular , is an // excellent repertory of carefully observed and well digested facts , which , with the conclusions founded upon them , may yet be studied with interest and profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and action which followed the outbreak of the Revolution of 1848 , his writings did much to calm the public mind , and to refute those heresies of Louis Blanc , Proudhon , and others , in economical and political science , which , under the terrible excitement of that epoch , seemed about to plunge the whole country into anarchy and ruin . his demonstration of the folly and wickedness of the theories of these persons , and of the various schemes of Cornmunistic and Socialist philosophy , preceded the decisive refutation of them which soon followed from actual experiment . His opinions , therefore , upon any subject falling within the range of his peculiar studies , are entitled to be received with much respect . In common with other political economists and statisticians , the attention of M. Chevalier has been specially turned to the great problem which now so deeply interests the whole commercial world , - the probable effect of the immense increase in the annual supply of gold which has proceeded from the discoveries in California and Australia . He is preparing a work upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a translation of a portion of it , which he furnished in manuscript to a friend in London . The translator , himself no mean authority upon such a point , has judiciously added to this fragment two very able and elaborate articles upon the subject , that were published eight or nine months ago in The Times newspaper , and some useful tables in farther illustration of it that appeared in the same journal . It is gratifying to find , that the facts adduced and the opinions expressed by M. Chevalier coincide in the main , with those which were published in this Review six months since . We recur to the subject at present , not for the purpose of exploring the ground anew , but to give a brief abstract of the views of this eminent economist , and such extracts from his work as tend to corroborate the statements made on the former occasion . The general conclusion of M. Chevalier is well stated by his translator , - " namely , that the supplies of gold now pouring // into Europe must , at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all conunodities , " or , what is the same thing , a great decline in the value of money . The change is already visible to some extent , though the enhancement of prices hitherto certainly has not kept pace with the increasing abundance of gold . But as soon as the effect becomes strongly marked in the prices of the necessaries of life , " we may expect to see the public suddenly push the advance in prices as much above the point warranted by the augmented supplies of gold , as these prices are now , in my opinion , below that point . " There will be an excitement , perhaps a panic , such as natarally arises when the people suddenly learn that they are in the midst of a revolution of unparalleled magnitude in a matter that most nearly concerns their commercial undertakings and their fortunes . But the panic will subside , and the world will slowly come to recognize the fact , supported by indubitable evidence , that the revolution will be for good and not for evil , that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that these will be years , on the whole , of increasing industry , enterprise , and prosperity . The opinion that the depreciation will be a benefit to the whole community , is not expressed by M. Chevalier so decidedly as we could wish . Yet he has no gloomy forebodings in relation to it , and he admits enough to prove that he does not regard it as a public calamity . In the first place , he says , " a fall in the value of gold , like that of any other commodity , and tie iced as such , is a decided benefit ; because every commodity that falls in price becomes thereby more accessible , or rather less inaccessible , to the bulk of mankind . " So far , however , as gold performs the functions of a standard of value , the change must be injurious to a portion of the comiuunity , whose income will no longer bear so high a proportion to their wants . XQTliile their income , nominally , will remain the same , it will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life as it does at present . Yet in respect to the whole community , the direct loss and gain xviii be exactly balanced ; whatever one person may lose by the derangement of prices o*ai ) s to the an ( l existing contracts , others must b same extent . In this democratic country , also , we may be permitted to consider // it as an advantage , that the gain will be very widely diffused - will be shared by the great bulk of the community ; while the corresponding loss will fall upon a comparatively small number , and upon those who are best able to bear it . The great inequality in the distribution of wealth is the most frightful social evil that civilized man has to contend with , - an evil which is felt more keenly , because all the remedies which theorists have proposed for it , looKing , as they always do , to some infraction of the right of property , would unquestionably tend to an aggravation of the disease . But when human wisdom is most at fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectually vindicated . Who could have foreseen that a famine of unprecedented severity , and the compulsory expatriation of one half of the people of Ireland , would be thc means , in the long run , of effecting the regeneration of that unhappy country ? Yet who can doubt , after the experience of the last five years , that such will he the ultimate result ? In like manner , the discovery of immense deposits of gold in California and Australia is fast relieving Great Britain of her superfluous population , and raising the price of labor , while the effect of that gold upon the prices of all merchantable articles promises to alleviate the burdens of the indebted classes , to lessen the pressure of taxation , and to counteract the inordinate aggregation of the goods of this life in the hands of a few , to a greater extent than the most sanguine philanthropist , till recently , ever dreamed of . The same cause is also operating , and will long continue to operate , as a most effective stimulus to industry and enterprise throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any corresponding evil . But we return to the question which is first in order , whether the present influx of gold will cause a certain and early decline in the value of money . M. Chevalier considers at some length the arguments of those who still maintain that any important variation in the exchangeable value of gold is beyond the range of probabilities . These persons insist chiefly on the new and vast outlets which are preparing for the increased supply of gold ; on the fact that several nations are now , for the first time , adopting gold as the basis of their currency ; on // the rapid inCrease of population which results from the long continuance of the peace of nations , and on the consequent enlarged demand for coin ; on the new colonies formed in the gold-bearing regions themselves , where , for a time at least , a metallic currency will be exclusively used ; on the rapidly advancing civilization of IRussia and Turkey , and the new demand thus created for coin and for articles of luxury , in the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind , the advancement of wealth , and the illimitable extension of human desires . M. Chevalier admits the presence of all these countervailing causes , and even indicates others , which , he thinks , have escaped notice . Foremost among these is the fact that , as rapidly as the coin is depreciated , more gold is required to be used as coin . It is usually computed , that the metallic currency of Great Britain arid Ireland amounts to 60 millions sterling , or about 300 millions of dollars . If this consisted exclusively of gold , its weight would be about 1,176,470 pounds troy . Now suppose a fall of one third to take place in the value of the metal ; then the quantity required to effect the same number of exchanges as before would be half as much again , or 1,764,703 pounds troy , being an addition of 388,233 pounds for Great Britain alone . The whole world would require at least ten times as much , or some what less than six millions of pounds troy . The whole annual product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed , as yet , 30 millions of pounds sterling , or about the sum necessary for effecting this reduction in Great Britain alone ; so that ten years must elapse before the value of gold can be depreciated to this extent all over the earth , even if the annual product should all be coined into money , - a supposition which is far from being correct . The annual depreciation , therefore , can hardly exceed one thirtieth , or a little more than three per cent . The depreciation must be very gradual , then , but in spite of these counteracting causes , it is inevitable . " Does it follow , in sound logic , from the above and other facts , which are put forward for the purpose of making any serious fall in the value of gold appear highly improbable - does it , we say , really follow , that gold will remain stationary , or nearly so , even as the supposition , ( for , after all , we are dealing with a conjecture , though that // conjecture is every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production will attain , or rather , will maintain , for many years to come , much higher proportions than before the recent discoveries ? I confess that I can discover , in all the arguments advanced , nothing more than grounds for anticipating delay , or slackened progress , in the depreciation . Nay , I am of opinion , that this delay , or slackened progress , must , ere long , cease . Let us examine consecutively the different reasons that have been put forward . " The United States of America , as well as Russia , we are told , are coining , or storing in their vaults , as security for their paper circulation , large quantities of gold coin . Nothing is more true as regards late years ; but for the very reason that this drain has been in operation for a considerable time , it is not destined to he of much longer continuance . If one milliard of francs ( forty millions sterling ) in gold amply suffices for the monetary wants of England , we may conclude that , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , because , in the latter country , the practice of private individuals keeping on hand a supply of specie is even more unusual than it is in England . Bankin* accounts current , which greatly economize the use of coin , are there universally adopted , even in the villages . It must he remarked , too , that , in the United States , hank-notes replace specie , even more extensively than they do in England , inasmuch as the Americans have bank-notes for five dollars in all the States of the Union , and for a still lower denomination , in certain States , and it would he next to impossible to induce them to adopt ten dollars , or fifty-four francs , as the lowest denomination of their notes ; whereas , in the United Kingdom , the lowest Bank of England note is for five pounds , and the circulation of small notes in Scotland rind Ireland is extremely limited . According to this calculation , the United States , to judge from the quantity of gold coined there since the discovery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one half of the stock of that metal which is required , at its present value ; and we exaggerate somewhat in supposing that , to complete their metallic circulation , they may still require 150,000 kilogrammes of gold . That amount of coin would represent 500 millions of francs , or twenty millions sterling . As regards Russia , we may presume that she is still nearer repletion , since , during many years , the Russian Government has coined , and deposited in the vaults of the fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul , at Petersburg , a large portion of the gold produced by their own mines , in order that it may serve as security for time paper money which circulates throughout that empire , and answers all the purposes of trade . We will allow a wide margin , and estimate her additional // wants at 130,000 kilogrammes of gold . As for Turkey , without decrying that country , and while paying a due tribute of respect to some of her statesmen who are striving to regenerate its institutions , we must add , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quantity of gold which that country seems destined to absorb , both for coinage and other wants , appears likely to he very insignificant for a long time to come . " Unquestionably there are countries where civilization , but recently introduced , is rapidly spreading . Striking examples of this are presented by Australia and her dependencies , as well as by California , Oregon , and several regions of Central America . Of these countries , some will coin gold , and perhaps employ gold exclusively ; or , which comes to the same thing , they will receive back from Europe , in the shape of coined money , for the transaction of current business , a fraction of the gold transmitted thence in bars or dust . As regards Australia , * at least , there can be no doubt on the subject . But we shall exceed all the bounds of possibility , if we suppose , for the sake of argument , ( what does appear to me to be a great exaggeration , ) that , during the next ten years , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their metallic circulation , gold to the extent of one milliard of francs , ( forty millions sterling , ) or about 300,000 kilogrammes. " pp. 38-42 . With respect to the consumption of gold in gilding and the arts , NE . Chevalier finds reason to believe that it is trifling indeed , when compared with the anticipated increase in the production of the metal . Gold leaf is so thin that a pound of it will cover a very large surface ; and in the manufacture of lace , as the coating is but one txvelfth part as thick as gold leaf , it is found that a piece of gold which is now worth only sixty-five cents will suffice to gild a wire 2,187 yards long . The trinkets and other articles manufactured of gold are usually very light , and the demand even for these is inconsiderable . Jexvellers and goldsmiths often remelt old trinkets and coins , not more than half of the metal which they consume being new or unworked . The official returns of the bureaux de garantie in France , for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work annually tested and stamped in that country has not exceeded 5,000 kilogrammes , or about * It is estimated that , up to the present time , ( November , 1552 , ) Australia has imported from England four millions sterling , in sovereigns . As much more is now on its way out . // ? 680,000 . Corresponding official returns of the gold plate annually manufactured in England , on which duty was paid , show that the average did not exceed 7,000 ounces troy , or about ? 27,020 . Watch-cases , however , and a number of other articles , are exempt from duty , though they would be subject to it in France ; aud it is probable , also , that a considerable quantity of gold is surreptitiously manufactured and exported to escape the duty . But the quantity on which duty is paid probably maintains about the same proportion to the whole quantity ; and the returns of the former quantity for the last fifty years prove that there has been but very little increase in the demand for such articles , notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In England , luxury is assuming the same features as in France . It is less extravagant . People are becoming more economical . The wealthy even calculate more , and spend less for ostentation . True , as Mr. Porter remarks , we now find in the houses of workmen , artisans , and the other lower classes of society , utensils and articles made of the precious metals , which were not formerly to be seen there . Occasionally we meet with silver cups , and sometimes even with articles of silver gilt , and very generally with silver spoons . In the generality of taverns , silver forks have replaced steel ones . Still , on the whole , the total quantity of silver employed in the manufacture of articles of luxury , is rather diminishing than increasing . As for gold , its consumption has only begun to rise within the last few years . No year subsequent to 1830 has ever reached the figure of 1826 , which was 8,405 ounces . pp. 47-48 . On the whole , in view of the data already given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold is in England and France , and that at least half of the metal is obtained for ibis purpose by melting up old articles , we are rather surprised that M. Chevalier allows so large an amount as 20,000 grammes , ( ? 2,720,000 , ) to " represent the average quantity of new gold which is likely to be annually absorbed by the goldsmiths during the next ten years , on the presumption that gold shall retaiti its present value . " But even this large amount is less than ten per cent . of the present annual product of the metal . Our author makes allowance , with equal liberality , for the other countervailing forces which tend to maintain gold at its present value ; and still finds that a surplus of at least 120 // millions sterling must be accumulated within the next ten years , the whole effect of which will be felt in diminishing the present relative value of gold to other articles . " It may be asked , in what way will the fall in the value of the precious metals manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any commodity which is offered pretty continuously in quantities which exceed the demand , must , from that very circumstance , decline in value , and that its fall must continue , if the cost of production be less than it previously was . We will , however , enter into some details on this point , or , at least , cite some examples of the mode in which the redundant production affects the value of the precious metals , and depresses it . When the Spanish colonists of Mexico and Peru had extracted from the mines a considerable quantity of gold and silver , they sent extensive orders to their mother country for such articles as suited their wants and tastes . These extensive orders enhanced the price of these articles at home , and there was no reaction from that higher range of prices , ( except occasionally from transient fluctuations of the colonial markets ) ; for the quantities of the precious metals shipped homewards by the colonists did not diminish , but , on the contrary , went on increasing . Again , the inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gold passed on very profitable terms , exercised , in their turn , a like vivifying influence on trade in general . By the demand they thus created for articles of consumption , for raw produce destined to be worked up , and for labor , they raised the market price of these articles of consumption , of raw produce , and of money wages of all kinds . Now , to say that the price of a thing has risen , is tantamount to saying that the value of the precious metal which constitutes that price has fallen . At the present hour , as regards the gold imported from California and Australia , the rationale is susceptible of still easier illustration . It is unquestionable that England receives , by the vessels arriving from the above countries , a large portion of that gold , the bulk of which , we know for a fact , finds its way into the vaults of the Bank of England . Accordingly , the stock of bullion of that institution , which used formerly to range from 8 to 9,000,000 sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stock of bullion to account , that Bank has lowered its minimum rate of discount by degrees from three to two and a hali and even two , per cent . The reduction of the rate of discount encourages industrial enterprise , and especially stimulates speculation , which again has a tendency to raise the price of goods . Hence a variety of articles have already experienced a rise which , in process of time , must gradually // spread to all others . Now , in a country where the standard is gold , what else is a general rise of prices but a fall in the value of gold in relation to commodities in general ? " The aim of the Bank of England at present , and of the holders of the precious metals at all times , is to put into circulation the gold or silver in their coffers ; but the coin which circulates in a country has natural limits , provided the metal or metals of which it is composed remain unchanged in value . The metallic circulation , practically , bears a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is redundant , and the current of business throws it back into its natural reservoirs , which , in our days , are the public banks . A fall in the value of the precious metals is the only means by which the augmented mass of them can remain permanently in circulation . And this problem is now about to be solved , before our eyes . Suppose the mass of business transactions to he twenty milliards , and the coin required , therefore , to be only one tenth of that sum ; any greater quantity of coin you may put into circulation will not possess , in relation to the mass of exchangeable commodities , a higher value than that now possessed by the two milliards of coin . In vain will you add one half to the circulation , and increase it from two to three milliards , - that is to say , if the coin be silver , from nine million kilogrammes to thirteen and a half million kilo*rammes ; your thirteen and a half million kilogrammes will only command , in commodities of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine million kilogrammes . Let us imagine , for example , that , some morning , every bousewife , on her way to market , at Paris , were to find in her purse three , instead of the two , five franc pieces with which she had supplied herself for the morning s purchases , and that she proceeded to market resolved to expend the whole ; that all of them acted in this respect alike , and that they found at the market only the usual supply of vegetables and other provisions ; her three pieces would go no farther than the two would have gone ; she would be obliged to pay for every thing one half more than usual ; and , after having laid out the entire fifteen francs , she would return home with precisely the same quantity of provisions as if no addition had been made to her purse . This familiar illustration conveys a tolerably correct idea of the effect produced when fresh and copious supplies of the precious metals augment the quantity of coin in circulation . " We must , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another is elicited by the discovery of rich mines and gold fields . A stimulus is thereby given to enterprise , industry , and trade , as we explained when speaking of the effects produced by the supplics drawn // from the mines of America , after the discovery of that continent , and of the gold now flowing into the Bank of England from California and Australia . Under such circumstances , the metallic currency tend* to expand , without the value of the precious metal being affected by that expansion , because it is the result of enlarged business transactions . The two phenomena present countervailing forces , but the latter , though it may delay , can not neutralize the much stronger and permanent effects of the former phenomenon . The depreciation of the precious metals may be checked , in consequence of the enhanced demand counteracting , to some extent , the augmented supply ; but the final result , supposing the production to prove permanent , is nevertheless certain . The value of the precious metals , as compared with that of other commodities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pp. 57 - 61 . Is it probable that the gold-fields of California and Australia , rich as they are at present , will be exhausted before they have produced any material effect on the value of the precious metals ? It is admitted , on all hands , that " placers , " or golddeposits , are generally of an alluvial character , and are therefore sooner exhausted than silver , lead , or copper mines . The process of collecting gold , from a larger or smaller extent of surface , is altogether unlike that of following a single vein of silver far into the rock and the bowels of the earth ; the latter enterprise , under favorable indications , may be pursued to an unlimited extent and for an unlimited period . Only a given number of workmen , however , depending on the thickness of the vein , can be profitably employed upon it at one time . But as gold exists only in a stratum of no great thickness , either at the surface or near the surface of the earth , any number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other 's operations ; and as soon as a given surface has been dug over , and carefully examined , the product of that spot is exhausted , and nothing remains but to hunt up new localities . It has frequently happened , therefore , that gold-fields of extraordinary promise have been worked to exhaustion without producing any perceptible effect on the bullion market . " Colonel Acosta , in his history of the discovery of New Grenada , adduces several examples of this kind . " Notwith. standing the great amount of gold already collected from them , we can not say positively that the auriferons districts of 44* // Russia , California , and Australia are not of this character . But the evidence all seems to point the other way ; in each case , new localities have been found with little difficulty , after those which were first worked had been exhausted . The absolute gains of each miner may be , even now , less than they were at first ; but from the greater number of hands employed , the total product is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point . " The condition of a vast superficies appears to us to be completely fulfilled by the fields which are now being worked . There are an immense number of square myriametres of auriferous soil in California . There is also a vast tract of similar rich soil in the Mexican province of the Sonora , which adjoins California , and which is still all but virgin . It can no longer he doubted , that , in Australia , the gold-fields are of boundless extent ; there is even ground for believing that they are much vaster than those of California . In Russia , the auriferous zone extends over an immense surface . There , the gold veins are scattered at intervals , in a line which extends from Kamskatka and the Ondskoi mountains , the feet of which are bathed by the waters of the Pacific Ocean , to the latitude of Perm , that is to say , to the western extremity of the Oural Chain , and that immense auriferous zone is 900 kilometres wide . To adopt the words of M. de Ilumboldt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tract is one of the most striking phenomena which can be indicated on the globe . " pp. 63 , 64 . Our author also finds reason to believe , though we do not share his anticipations , that " the process of quartz crushing will yield a large quantity of gold , " in addition to that which is washed and sifted out of the soil . Certainly , the quartz was the original matrix of the gold , which can still be found in it , that which is now scattered over alluvial or diluvial tracts having been rubbed or ground out of the rock by the various disintegrating processes of nature through past ages . But the attempts which have thus far been made to obtain the metal from quartz , crushed by powerful stamping machinery , have been signal failures . The rock is too stubborn , and the quantity of gold in it too uncertain , to allow the operation to be pursued with profit . Time enough has also elapsed since this process was first suggested to allow it a fair trial . // When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold-rock again . M. Chevalier enters into a cursory examination of the question , whether the whole decline in the value of money xviii be indicated by the variation in the relative values of gold and silver . As we expected , he answers this question decidedly in the negative . The annual product of silver is increasing , as well as that of gold , though not so rapidly . Humboldt declared , forty years ago , that the mines of New Spain contained silver enough to deluge the world . A recent observer , M. Dupont , who has lately published an excellent work on the production of the precious metals in Mexico , adopts the views of Humboldt , and adduces a considerable amount of additional testimony in confirmation of them . He describes several formations of rock , in which silver is almost sure to be found , and says , that , although these formations are rare in the neighborhood of the city of Mexico , as we travel farther north they become of frequent occurrence , and , on crossing the principal chain of mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sonora Cordillera is composed of them . Improved methods of mining , also , have produced great results in some of the old localities , where the work had been given up for years , under the belief that it could not be continued with profit . Thus , the Frasnillo mine , which now yields silver to the amount of two millions of dollars annually , was described by Mr. Ward , the traveller , in 1827 , as an abandoned property , on which no hopes could be founded for the future . From another locality in Zacatecas , which was thought to be exhausted towards the close of the last century , " there was extracted , between the years 1827 and 1839 , about 150 million francs ' worth of silver . " If an efficient government and a race of energetic immigrants should ever be introduced into Mexico , a revolution would take place in silver-mining , and a fall in the price of silver would then be inevitable . Meanwhile , the annual product of Mexican silver has been considerably enlarged within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been worked to greater advantage . The depreciation of gold , moreover , has somewhat affected the value of silver , by throwing a large quantity of it out of // use as coin , and thereby glutting the market with it to some extent for manufacturing purposes . Till within a few years , the metallic currency of the United States was composed in great part of silver , the bank reserves of specie being chiefly in that metal . The currency of France , also , which was almost exclusively metallic , consisted mainly of silver coin . The influx of gold has changed all this , the greater part of the silver coin having left these two countries , and gone abroad in search of a better market . Of course , its value abroad was thereby somewhat diminished ; and this effect would have been still more marked , if Holland had not adopted just the opposite policy , and " demonitized " gold , in order to keep the silver at home , Spain and Belgium also partially adopting the same course . It is probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a still greater fall is in prospect , though there will be a great apparent rise in it value , when compared with gold . We must not imagine , however , that the absolute value , or pnrchasing power , of silver will be directly enhanced by the depreciation of gold . Silver will command more gold , but not a larger amount of commodities in general . Mr. Campbell states the principle correctly when he says , that " the working or the abandonment of the silver mines will depend entirely on the cost of extraction , and on the value of the produce extracted , quite irrespective of the supply and value of gold . " The variation in the relative value of the two metals will still afford a measure , though an imperfect one , of the decline in the value of money . If regard be not had to the considerations which we have stated , the variation will lead us to underrate this decline . The fluctuations of the bullion market , especially in the price of silver , during the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at first sight , difficult to account for them by the operation of a single cause tending constan tlyin one direction . But the irregularity may be easily explained with the aid of the facts aud principles just mentioned . TWO years ago , silver suddenly rose to a considerable premium , from the combined effect of the increased supply of gold , and the demand for silver coin in Holland and Belgium , where the // authorities were endeavoring to " demonitize " gold . But the speculators overrated the importance of the former cause , or rather , they did not make allowance enough for the slowness of its operation ; so that the rise was excessive . Then , as the demand for silver coin in the Low Countries was soon satisfied , and , as fast as gold was poured into France and the United States , silver coin was pushed out of them , and had to seek a market in other lands , the price of silver fell again , and many persons began to think that there had been an unfounded panic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not to affect the value of money . They were soon nudeceived . Australia came to the aid of California , gold steadily fell in value , silver rose to a premium again , and to so high a premium that serious inconvenience began to be felt , especially in this country , from the want of small coin for change . Congress tardily came to the rescue , and , after much urging from the very persons who had formerly resisted the measure , passed the bill which , recognizing the depreciation that had taken place in spite of them , diminished the quantity of silver in our small coins nearly seven per cent . This remedy is effectual for the present ; but the operation must soon be repeated . The nominal value of the coin , as established by this law , is not more than three or four per cent . above its present real value ; and the influx of gold will soon reverse this inequality . Vaticination is hazardous , especially in financial matters ; but we will venture to prophesy with great positiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver coin will again be a subject of complaint , and Congress will be again urged to pass a law to diminish still more the amount of silver which now passes for a dollar . When the next reduction is made , we trust it will equal at least ten per cent. , so as to obviate the necessity of again altering the standard for some years . Some persons , who are not much acquainted with the subject , cry out that this is tampering with the currency ; that the law just enacted only reverses the operation , and undoes the work , of the Gold Bill of 1834 ; whence they infer , either that any legislation upon the subject is improper , or that silver should be made the exclusive standard , and , the present weight of the silver dollar remaining fixed , gold should be // used oniy as merchandise , and sold by the ounce at what may happen to be its market value . It is true that the effect of the Act of 1884 was to lower the nominal value of silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law is to raise it ; and other changes also are in prospect , which will render necessary further alterations in the coin . But legislators are not to blame for these frequent modifications , which proceed from causes that are beyond their control . The origin of the difficulty is to be found in the fact that this country has a double standard , - that both gold and silver are used as currency , and that every man consequently enjoys by law , and , in this country , always has enjoyed , the option whether he will pay his debts in coin of one metal or the other . But we can not fix by law the relative value of these two metals , which is constantly changing , and , under anomalous circumstances , as at present , may change very rapidly . We might as well enact a law , that no more rain should fall in May than in April , as that silver should never vary its proportionate value to gold . The rain will fall , and the value will alter , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted , the most that legislation can do is to follow the variations of relative value , and change the quantity of metal in the gold coins or the silver coins , so that the nominal valuation shall always coincide with , or approximate to , the real one . If this is not done , after a change has taken place in the market , the metal which is undervalued in the coinage will be driven out of circulation . Before 1834 , the law required that 24.75 grains of pure gold should be deemed an equivalent for 371.25 grains of pure silver ,  --  either of these , in the shape of coin , being legal tender for a dollar . It was found that the gold was thus undervalued , and this metal , therefore , disappeared from the currency ; whatever gold coins were issued from the mint were melted up or sent out of the country . To remedy this evil , Congress altered the law in 1884 , and ordained that only 23.2 grains of pure gold should be exchanged for 371.25 grains of pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the gold and silver coins circulated side by side , till the influx of California gold disturbed the market . It was then found that the silver coin was undervalued , and it was sent out of the country to so great an // extent that the community were subjected to great inconvenience from the want of small coins for change . Congress has now again steppe ( l forward , and ordered that 2&amp; 2 grams of pure gold shall pass for only 345.6 grains of pure silver ; adding a very proper proviso , however , that , as silver has not yet risen to this point of relative value , silver coin shall not be legal tender for more than five dollars . They have thus legislated not only for the necessities of the present moment , but to some extent for the future . The recent Act , therefore , does not vary in principle from the Act of 1834 ; the object , in both cases , was to make the respective weights of the gold and the silver dollar correspond to the values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same , though the operation of it is now turned the other way . Those who are in favor of making silver the exclusive standard , really insist upon depriving debtors of a privilege now secured to them by law , and which is implied in every contract-namely , of discharging a debt by paying a gold eagle containing 232 grains of pure gold for every ten dollars which they owe ; these persons would force them to pay 250 or 260 , perhaps 300 , grains of such gold , or their equivalent , for every ten dollars - an operation very pleasant to the creditor , no doubt , but to which he can not show the shadow of a claim , either in law or equity . On this point , we are happy to find that M. Chevalier 's opinion fully coincides with our own , as appears from a portion of the following extract . " The depreciation of gold must , in England , where it is the sole standard of value , injuriously affect the recipients of annuities , and of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those who have undertaken to provide for them . Let us suppose , for the sake of illustration , that gold should fall to half its present value , in consequence of the influx of the Californian and Australian supplies . It is a supposition which may probably be realized , crc many years . In that case , the interest of the national debt , which amounts to about twentyeight millions sterling , per annum , would not then press more upon the tax-paying public , than half the amount , or fourteen millions , do at present . The differenee of fourteen millions is nearly equal to the entire annual expenditure of Great Britain for her land and sea forces . Such an alleviation of the burdens of taxation would be an immense boon to the community at large , at the expense , however , of the fundholder. // Yet , the latter could not , with justice , complain that the laws of equity were violated by such treatment of him . The public creditor would merely be incurring the clear and simple application of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscientious deliberation . By law , as in equity , the Government is bound to do nothing more than to provide , every year , twenty-eight millions sterling ; or , in other terms , twenty-eight million times 113 grains Troy , of fine gold , which is equal to 549,314 pounds Troy ; to be divided , pro rata , among the holders of stock . had the value of gold risen to such an extent , that the quarter of wheat , which is usually worth fifty shillings , could command , on an average of fifteen or twenty years , only twenty-five shillings , or that a laboring man could only earn , on an average , two shillings a day , instead of four shillings , the Chancellor of the Exchequer would nevertheless have been bound to provide annually the stipulated 549,314 pounds Troy , of fine gold , for pro rata distribution among the public creditors . The two contracting parties , it is plain , ran converse risks ; the State , that of an enhancement of the value of gold , the fund-holders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized , the wheel of fortune will have favored the British treasury . The other party must submit , and will have no right to complain . " pp. 73-75 . Wc have already borrowed so liberally from M. Chevalier 's instructive pages , that we can find room but for one extract more , - the following brief sketch of the manner in which different kinds of property will be affected by the depreciation of gold . " As a general rule , whenever the value of the metal which forms the standard coin is falling , he who lays out money for a long term of years ought to avoid what are termed cash , and select real , investments . rihe public funds are of the former category ; so , also , are mortgage bonds , bank stock , and the loans raised by railways , canals , arid other public companies . True , ? 100 , invested in consols , will still be worth that amount , provided the political and other causes , which influence the price of the funds , have produced no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 will command a smaller quantity of land , real property , and commodities in general ; for precisely in proportion as that metal declines , other articles advance in price . The rise of the latter is correlative with the fall of the former , or rather they are two features of the same fact . " The shares * in railways , canals , bridges , docks , and other similar *5 Railway debentures bonds , on the contrary , being cash securities , must deteriorate as goLf becomes depreciated. // public undertakings , rank in the category of real property ; were the currency to fall fifty per cent. , the market price of railway shares would double itself on the supposition that no change for better or worse occurred to the lines , that the traffic remained the same , and the Uoinpanies had the power of proportionalig raising ( viz. , doubling ) thew tariffs . " In every case , where a railway or other public company already exacts the maximum rate of charge authorized by Act of Parliament , ( unless Parliament should raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline ; inasmuch as the traffic receipts will remain stationary , while the working expenses will be doubled . It may even come to pass , on certain lines , that the receipts will not cover the cost of working . Without fresh powers from Parliament , the shares would become worthless , and the lines would either be abandoned or ceded to the state . " pp. 83 - 85.
