txt ART . VJI. - A Course of Lectures on the Constitutional Jurisprudence of the United States ; delivered annually in *olumbia College , New York . By WILLIAM ALEXANDER DUER , LL . ID. , late President of that Institution . The Second Edition , revised , enlarged , and adapted to Professional as well as General Use . Boston : Little , Brown , &amp; Co. 1856. l2mo. pp. xxii , 545 . THE author of this book , and his brother , Hon. John Duer , LL . ID. , to whom it is dedicated , are sons of the late Colonel William Duer , an influential delegate to the Continental Congress from the State of New York during the Revolution , and afterwards Secretary to the Board of Treasury of the United States , which office he filled until the Confederation was superseded by the present Federal Constitution . About that period there was much rash speculation in the public securities of the several States , in anticipation of their being assumed by the general government ; and when this took place , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System , " it led to the realization of fortunes by many , and to the ruin of a still larger number . Among the latter was Colonel Duer , whose ardent spirit and sanguine temperament had involved him beyond the hope of extrication . He survived this catastrophe but a few years , and at his death left his widow and a large family of children wholly unprovided for . The mother , who was a daughter of the Revolutionary general , Lord Stirling , opened a boardingschool for young ladies . The sons , though the oldest of the family , were both of them several years under age , and were still at school ; but now left it , one to enter the navy , the other the army , in which respectively they served during the quasi war with the French Republic . Upon the reduction of these establishments they commenced the study of the law , and in due course were admitted to the bar . They continued to practise in different parts of their native State for many years , until both attained judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice-Chancellor , the younger as a Judge of the Superior // Court of the City of New York , of which he is now the Chief Justice . While at the bar , he had found time to engage , under an appointment from the State , in the revision of its statutes , and took the leading part in digesting and arranging them in a systematic code , and simplifying their language , with the design of rendering them intelligible to common readers , as well as to lawyers . He is also the author of a Treatise on Marine Insurance , which has become a standard work upon the subject ; and since his elevation to the bench , he has published several volumes of Reports of Cases decided in his Court , of which the series is to be continued . In the interval between his career at the bar and his service upon the bench , the elder brother was for several consecutive years a member of the Legislature of New York . As chairman of a committee he was the first to take ground against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters of that State to Messrs . Livingston and Fulton . He also reported a bill , which became a law , rendering the tax for the support of the common school system compulsory , it having previously depended upon voluntary contributions . At a subsequent session he introduced , with the same success , a bill prohibiting lotteries , the provisions of which are incorporated in the present Constitution of the State . While he was upon the bench he was elected to the Presidency of Columbia College , * and on entering upon its duties he induced the trustees to add the study of our constitutional jurisprudence to the sub-graduate epurse , and to charge him with its instruction . For this purpose he prepared and delivered the " Course of Lectures** of which the present publication is the ultimate issue . Engaged in this duty , and the discharge of those more general functions appertaining to his office , he continued upwards of twelve years , when his health became so materially affected by its labors and anxm * It will doubtless seem strange to some of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collegiate education should have been selected to preside over a literary institution of the character of Columbia College ; but although our author and his brother were taken from their books at an early age , their classical education was interrupted only while they continued in the public service . It was renewed when they left it , and pursued contemporaneously with their professional studies , without any other than their mutual assistance . // eties as to compel him , under the advice of his physicians , to resign it and seek for restor&amp;ion in the hill-country of New Jersey . His removal was attended by the desired result , and he was soon enabled to revise and enlarge his Lectures , and prepare them for the press . The first edition being exhausted , he has reproduced the work in its present form , in which , among many other additions and improvements , it includes the decisions of the supreme federal tribunal , do wuto the time of its republication . This book , of which unavoidable hinderances prevented our taking an earlier notice , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Questions and Appendix . The Questions are added in order to make the work more useful as a text-book for schools and colleges . The Appendix , comprising nearly a hundred pages , contains a variety of important and interesting documents ; such as the Declaration of Independence , Articles of Confederation , Constitution of the United States , President Jackson 's Proclamation against Nullification , the Ordinance of 1787 , &amp;c . The main body of the work , as the author himself tells us , " consists substantially of the Course of Lectures on the Constitutional Jurisprudence of the United States , delivered annually to the Senior Class in Columbia College , while the author had the honor of presiding in that venerable and noble institution . " It was his intention , not only to make the book useful to the classes of students to whom the lectures were originally delivered , but also to the general reader , and " especially to foreigners . For it will hardly be denied , that more accurate information in regard to the organization and powers both of Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isters , and lawyers , while their want of it is not only mortifying to our national pride , but prejudicial to our national interests . " The style is simple and dignified , eminently suited to the subject . The propositions are plainly stated , the arguments clear and convincing , and the doctrines for the most part unquestionably orthodox , although perhaps inclining too much towards Federalism to please , in all cases , an ultra Democrat . Yet the author is not too much of a Federalist to make the admission contained in the following quotation , // which seems sufficient to satisfy the demands of any modern advocate of State rights : - " Besides a general delegation of the Legislative , Executive , and Judicial powers to distinct departments , so far as was necessary to effect the purposes of National Union , the Constitution specially defines the powers and duties of each of those branches of the government . This was essential to peace and safety in a Government invested with specific powers for national objects , and formed from the union of several independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; each of the former yielding for that purpose the requisite portion of its sovereignty , while it retained the exclusive control of its local concerns . " - pp. 43 , 44 . In the course of his work the author cites freely the opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States , on questions which have been adjudicated , and strengthens his various positions by frequent reference to authoritative writers , such as the authors of the Federalist , Chief Justice Marshall , Chancellor Kent , Mr. Justice Story , and Mr. Rawle . The book contains twelve Lectures . The first is introductory , and presents an historical sketch of the various associations and confederacies of the different Colonies , beginning with the league offensive and defensive entered into by the New England Colonies in 1643 , its causes , duration , and results , and noticing in turn the assembly at Albany in 1722 , the more general convention of the Colonies at the same place in 1754 , with a synopsis of Dr. Franklin 's plan of union , adopted by the convention , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mother country ; the congress of deputies from the Colonial Assemblies called together by the Stamp Act , which met in New York in 1763 ; the meeting of the first Continental Congress at Philadelphia , on the 10th of September , 1774 , with the manner of electing its members , the powers with which they were clothed , and the measures they adopted ; the immortal Congress which met at Philadelphia in May , 1775 , enunciated the Declaration of Independence , and drew up the Articles of Confederation ; the difficulties experienced in obtaining the assent of all the Colonies to these Articles , and their inherent defects , as practically evinced both during and after the war // of the Revolution ; the considerations that urged , and the circumstances that favored , the organization of the Federal Convention at Philadelphia , May 14 , 1787 , which formed and gave to the States the Federal Constitution ; and the arguments which were arrayed for and against the adoption of that instrument . Thus is passed in review by far the most important and interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with the more particular examination of the fnndamental principles of our political institutions in the second Lecture , prepares the student intelligently , and with increased profit and interest , to engage in the study of the Constitution itself . He approaches our American Acropolis no longer like a barbarian , to gaze in simple wonder at its gigantic proportions and splendid exterior . He has traced the process by which the rubbish of ages was cleared away , and a basis of eternal truth laid bare ; upon this basis he has seen the foundations laid and cemented by the self-sacrificing patriotism of a community of States , and the edifice growing under the hands of the most adroit architects ; he recognizes the wisdom , integrity , and skill of the builders , the soundness , durability , and value of the materials , the sublime beauty , boundless capacity , and impregnable strength of the perfect structure ; and , filled with admiration , reverence , and trust , he reposes in security beneath its protecting arches . Passing from the examination of the fundamental principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and succeeding Lectures , to the consideration of the various topics embraced in that instrument . It is impossible for us to notice all the discussions upon these different topics in a manner commensurate with their importance , or adapte*I to do justice to the merits of the work . We must , there fore , content ourselves by selecting those portions likely to prove most interesting at the present time . It is not long since the whole country was stirred by a debate in Congress , in which the exclusive right of the lower house to originate all money bills , and the importance of strictly observing the boundary lines placed by the Constitution between the several departments of the government , were // extensively discussed . The more conservative branch of the national legislature was charged with wishing to encroach upon the rights of the more popular body ; the public attention was aroused , and the subject assumed an extraordinary interest . QVe do not wish to renew or review that discussion , but merely to present some short extracts upon the subject of the proper separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a matter of vital importance in organizing a republic . " In the wise distribution of these powers , and the application of proper aids and cheeks to each , consists the o/3t*rna COflSt ? ; tuta ? espublica , contemplated by the Roman orator as an object of desire and admiration , rather than of hope . Should these powers be injudiciously blended , - for instance , should the Legislative and Executive , or the Legislative and Judicial branches be united in the same hands , the combination would be dangerous to public liberty , *nd the evils to be apprehended would be the same , whether the powers in question were devolved on a single magistrate , or vested in a numerous body . " - p. 29 . " The great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers of government in the same hands , consists in giving to the persons who administer them in one department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments from the others . A dependence on the people is , no doubt , the primary control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framers of our Constitution the necessity of auxiliary precautions ; and the remedy they adopted for the natural predominance of the Legislative authority was the division of the Legislative body into two branches , and rendering them , by different modes of election and principles of action , as little connected with each other as the nature of their common functians and their dependence on the people would admit . " - p. 49 . The views here briefly expressed are enforced at some length , with much cogency of argument . In connection with this admirable exposition of our policy in this particular , we may be pardoned for introducing short extracts from a book written by Colonel John Taylor of Caroline County , Virginia , and published in 1814 . This work , entitled " An Inquiry into the Principles and Policy of the Government of the United States , " comes to us with Mr. Jefferson 's indorsement , as " the most logical retraction of our govern // ments to the original and true principles of the Constitution creating them , which has appeared since the adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages for writing such a book . Actively engaged during the Revolutionary struggle , he found at its close that military expenses and a depreciated currency had ruined his fortune . He engaged in the practice of law to repair his losses , and for some time was a member of the Virginia Legislature . His maturer years were given to literary pursuits and the promotion of educational interests . The work from which we quote was written in the ease and quiet of private life , after partisan aims and prejudices had faded from his mind . The quotations shall speak for themselves . " The United States have arrived at a policy professing a capacity for regulating public as well as private duties ; considering that government as weak , which can only regulate the latter ; and that as strong , which is able to regulate both . For this purpose they are cautious to bestow on each officer and department of government only that portion of power necessary to fulfil the annexed functions ; to make the officers and departments all dependent upon the nation , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enforce the law upon individuals of the society . A policy by which the nation is considered as the executive of political law , and the avenger of violations of public duties ; and the government as the executive of municipal law , and the avenger of violations of private duties . " - p. 161 . " It has been our policy so to divide power and diminish the excitements of avarice and ambition as to wring out of its soul the poison arising from the evil qualities of monopoly . " - p. 311 . The importance of rigidly confining each department of the government to its original boundaries would seem too obvious to be enforced by argument , were it not for the instances which from time to time evince a disregard of this principle . V/hen a river once passes its bounds , accidental circumstances or obstacles alone check the overflow and limit the devastation . Recent discussions and events have made the relation of the Territories to the federal government a subject of unusual interest . The question is naturally examined in treating of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said by President IDuer , while speaking of these courts , will indicate his views . // " These Territories - as they are politically as well as geographically termed - are not , in either case , considered distinct political societies known to the Constitution as States ; but Congress has always assumed to exercise over them supreme powers of sovereignty , and has generally adopted for that purpose the principle of the Ordinance established under the Confederation in 1787 , for governing the territory Northwest of the River Ohio , which now contains the States of Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , Wisconsin , and Iowa , and the Minnesota and Northwest Territories . This Ordinance was formed upon sound and enlightened principles of civil jurisprudence , and the Judges appointed in that original Territory held their offices during good behavior. " - p. 176 . " The Superior Courts ' in these Territories have exclusive cognizance of all capital offences , and the trial by Jury is secured , together with many other great fundamental principles of civil liberty . They have , within their limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution and laws of the United States , which is vested in the District Courts of the United States in those Districts in which the latter have the powers of a Circuit Court ; and writs of error and appeals from their decisions may be taken to the Supreme Court of the United States , in the same cases and under the same regulations as from the Circuit Courts of the Union . " - p. 177 . " From these various regulations it appears that Congress possesses supreme power in regard to all these Territories , - depending solely on the exercise of its sound discretion . A Territory , no more than the District of Columbia , is a State within the meaning of the Constitution , or entitled to claim the privileges secured to the members of the Union . Nor will a writ of error or an appeal lie from a Territorial Court to the Supreme *Court of the United States , unless there be a special statutory provision for the purpose . " - p. 178 . Again , while discussing the power vested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States , " the author says - " It is under this power that Congress claims authority to legislate for the Territories , erected in provinces , acquired , like Louisiana and the Floridas , since the adoption of the Federal Constitution . But if the Federal Government possessed authority to purchase them , there seems no necessity for resting the right of legislation in regard to them on such narrow and insufficient grounds , for the power of governing a territory is the inevitable consequence of the right to acquire and hold it . " - p. 339. // One would think the doctrine of the last quotation too plain to be controverted . Yet eminent statesmen , occupying posts of high honor and influence , have advocated a contrary opinion , and marshalled all their forces day after day and night after night to seenre the adoption of their views , and to make them the basis of most important legislation . The discussions of the question , whether Congress has plenary power to legislate for the Territories , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political considerations with constitutional principles . Men have clung tenacionsly to a given interpretation of the Constitution , as if it were identical with their policy , so that both must necessarily stand or fall together . This we deem an unfortunate error . There is but one sound construction of the Constitution , while the means of bringing into operation a desirable policy are various . The policy of every government not administered by fools or madmen , is what that government , upon mature deliberation , has decided to be expedient . Whether a proposed measure be expedient , is one question ; whether the proposed means of enforcing that measure be lawfnl or constitutional , is another ; - the first is purely political , the second purely legal . A man 's politics are his opinions as to national policy . Two persons may abree that the wishes of the people in the Territories should prevail in determining the character of the Territorial laws , but may disagree as to the right of the inhabitants of the Territory to legislate for themselves independently of Congress . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may agree in thinking any proposed result desirable , but disagree as to the manner of bringing about that result . If Congress possesses the exclusive power of legislation for the Territories , it is none the less at liberty to consult the*wishes of the people of a Territory in the enactment of their municipal laws . We shall confine ourselves to the question of constitutional law , and leave that of Territorial policy to be discussed and decided by others . It may fairly be assumed , without fear of contradiction at this time , that the government of the United States may acquire territory either by conquest or by purchase . By this acqnisition the general government becomes possessed of all the // rights , of whatever nature , which are vested in a sovereign power on receiving a cession of territory . If the soil of the ceded territory be unoccupied , the subject-matter of the transfer may be divided into two parts ; the title to the soil , which is the only property in land capable of passing to a private persol , and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but which are exclusively the attributes of sovereignty , such as the right of eminent domain , the right to exact revenue for the support of government , to command the services of the inhabitants for its own preservation , and to control and govern the territory by its own laws . Land can not be granted to a private person exonerated from the burden of these rights . Neither can these rights be granted to , or transferred by , a private person . When invested with them , the person is no longer a private citizen or subject . These rights , when belonging to an individual , are sovereignty , and constitute the difference between Cincinnatus Arator and Cmcinnatus Dictator . These rights are mutually dependent ; the right of eminent domain , and the right to exact revenue , are valueless without the right to make laws for their enforcement . These attributes of sovereignty are the only estate or property in territory that can be transferred by one government to another , if the title to the soil , or the whole estate which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabitants . If anything more is ceded , it must be the title to the soil , of which no free government can arbitrarily divest the owners ; and if this were ceded with the sovereign rights over the territory , the cession would necessarily involve the repurchase of the lands , or their abandonment by the former possessors . The rights of government , and not the fee simple in the soil , must be the chief material of a cession by one government to another ; else the transfer by treaty of a large city or a populous country , in which the soil was all held by the inhabitants , would be sheer mockery . The fee simple in the soil , when unoccupied , would pass as an incident to the cession . It seems needless to multiply arguments or illnstrations . From what has been said , it must sufficiently appear that , when territory is acquired by a sovereign power , the only acquisition of real importance is the right to govern the 40* // inhabitants of such territory , and that this right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory without severing the relations between them and the government , and creating them an independent and sovereign nation . The government of the United States must come within the application of this principle , unless it be excepted by its peculiar character . It is said that , in this country , the sovereignty resides in the people ; that they can not he divested of their sovereign rights by passing from a State to a Territory ; and , consequently , that in a Territory they have an unquestionable title to exercise all the rights of self-government independently of the general government , at least so far as appertains to the regulation of their domestic institutions . It is said further , that Congress has no authority to legislate for the rferritories , because no *uch authority is conferred by the Constitution ; and consequently the inhabitants must legislate for themselves , as it is evi ( lent that no State could claim to make laws for them . These statements rest on the assumption that the sovereignty of the people belongs to them in their individual capacity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a community , possess the right , entirely or in part , to legislate for the whole Territory ; but only the right as individuals to be independent sovereigns upon their several estates . If the sovereign rights which were vested in the general government by the acquisition of the territory do not remain thus vested after the sale of the lands , they must have been transferred with the lands to the land-owners ; and the people do not own the lands as a community . The absurdities to which this assumption must lead are too manifest to he enumerated . The sovereignty of the people in this country can not be qfiestioned . But they are sovereign in their collective capacity as a nation . Individuals are not sovereign at home , much less abroad , when separated from the body of the nation and out of its jurisdiction . Colonel Taylor , in the book from which we have already quoted , says - " The people , by our policy , are considered as possessing two capacities , political and civil . Under one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; such as those of forming , reforming , and supervising governments . Under the other , they are susceptible , mdi // 1858 . DUER ' s CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE. vidually , of such right ' and duties as an individual may hold or owe . As an individual can not hold or exercise the first class of rights , a nation must he considered in the light of aa essociated , political , and moral heing , or these rights can neither exist nor be exercised . " - pp. 497 , 498 . Wherever the nation remains , there must remain the sovereign power . No one man or body of men going out from the national domain can carry that national sovereignty with him or them . It can not be divided between the nation , considered as one political being , and any man or number of men forming a component part of the nation . The nation is the only sovereign within its jurisdiction , and there can be but one . True , this national sovereignty is exercised through individuals . But they can exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit to prescribe , namely , according to the regulation of the Federal and State Constitutions . At least this is the case while they reside within the several States ; and surely there is nothing in this fact from which to infer an implied permission to enjoy these rights in territory belonging to the nation in its collective capacity , with none of the regulations and restrictions established in the States . Were it true that the people of a Territory enjoyed these rights , as they would be free from local restrictions , they would possess greater freedom , and more political power and privilege , than the inhabitants of the States ; and admission into the Union , instead of increasing their privileges , would be a surrender of a portion of their " inalienable rights . " Territory belongs to the people of the States in their collective capacity as a nation , and not to them as individuals . The nation holds the jurisdiction and all that appertains to sovereign rights . As in all other acts of sovereignty , the majority of the nation may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone out from their State organizations , which were purposely constituted and recognized in order to give the inhabitants the power of enjoying in common with others the privileges of republican citizens , into a Territory where no such regulations exist , does not , at any rate , give them the power to overrule the national majorities in regard to the exercise of any sovereign right in such Territory . // If , as is said , the inhabitants of a Territory carry their sovereigrl rights with them , they can carry no greater rights than are retained by those who remain behind ; and at best they should exercise concurrent power in regard to the government and interests of the Territories , instead of claiming the exclusive right to legislate for them , independently of the rest of the nation . If their claim to legislate for themselves rests upon the fact that they carry with them the rights which they had enjoyed as citizens of the States , only those who have been citizens of States , with the full rights of citizenship , can have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Territory should be entirely peopled by persons who , for want of property qualifications , or any other cause , had never possessed a share in the government , or by foreigners never naturalized , the Territory must be absolutely without government , unless the general government possess the right , which is denied , or unless the inhabitants , instantly , by the simple act of immigration , obtain all the privileges of American citizens . It is said that the fundamental principle of universal equality and the spirit of our institutions will not permit a person to subject himself to political disabilities by removing from a State to a Territory . But this equality is rather theoretical than actual . Many native-born persons are deprived of an active participation in the government ; and the disabilities of citizens going abroad or residing in the District of Columbia , are sufficient proof that disabilities in certain respects may result from a removal into the Territories of the United States consistently with the practical operation of our institutions . We have proceeded thus far with our reasoning upon the hypothesis that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people exercise all governmental power immediately , according to the most approved definition of a democracy , - " a nation legislating , judging , and sometimes exeenting in person , " - " a government administered by the people . " Our argument must apply with greater force to a representative government . The principle of representation is fundamental in our political theory , and pervades every part . This fact often seems to be ignored . Many appear to confine their notion of representation solely to the law-making power , and // do not Consider that the people are equally represented in the judicial and executive departments . To its representatives is committed the sovereign power of the nation ; and to the nation they are responsible for the manner in which it is administered . Consequently , they are to exercise for the people all the rights of sovereignty which are vested in a government by the fact of ownership . In them , as the supreme power , and not in the people immediately , is lodged , in its largest sense , the jurisdiction over territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have they the right , but they are bound to govern the Territories . The purpose for which territory is acquired is that the numerical strength of the nation may be increased , its revenues enlarged , its wealth and power augmented . To accomplish this purpose , the new territory must be under good laws well administered , so that life , liberty , and property may be secure , and that immigrants may indulge a reasonable hope of enjoying the protection and support of a vigorous government . The very essence of the governmental contract is , that for what is surrendered by the people they shall receive the protection of law . Bearing distinctly in mind the fact that , in the legislative , judicial , and executive departments alike , the sovereignty of the people is exercised through representatives , let us glance at the nature of the admissions made by those who deny that Congress has plenary power to legislate for the Territories . The general government appoints the executive and judicial officers of a Territory . Its right to do so is unquestioned . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation in the executive and judicial , than in the legislative department ? There is nothing either in our organic laws or in the spirit of our institutions which implies a greater inherent right in the people of a Territory to choose repres ntatives for their local legislature than for their executive department . There is nothing which permits the general government to exercise the executive and judicial powers , but which forbids it to exercise the legislative . There is nothing in reason , the spirit of our institutions , or the Federal Constitution , to show that , if Congress may legally perform one act of government in // a Territory , it has not plenary power to legislate for that Territory , checked only by the general restrictions of the Constitution in favor of personal liberty and security . As the result of our reasoning , we must conclude that the general government of the United States may legally make and administer laws for any territory which it may lawfully acquire , until such territory shall be admitted a a State into the Union or declared independent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sovereignty incident to the possession of territory by a sovereign power , and therefore to be exercised as a matter of course , independently of any express authority in the Constitution . Purposely avoiding the political questions intimately connected with this discussion of governmental rights , we desire to express no opinion as to Territorial policy . The Constitution provides that Congress shall have power " to establish a uniform rule of naturalization , " and also that " the citizeus of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States . " These two provisions necessarily give Congress the exclusive right to determine the conditions upon which foreigners may become citizens . By the very nature of the grant , the power is prohibited to the States ; otherwise the rules of naturalization might be as various as the States , and no stringency of legislation in any one State would suffice to prevent persons who could not be naturalized under its laws , but who had acquired the rights of citizenship in a neighboring State under more lax regulations , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens . President IDner is disposed to admit that the present laws on this subject are defective , and concedes the difficulty of making any very essential changes ; but suggests that " There are two improvements , however , that seem equally practicable and desirable , and would go far to remedy the existing evils of the system ; the one is to render , by an amendment of the Constitution , the naturalized citizen incapable of holding any office of trust or profit ; the second , to vest , by an amendment of the statutes , the jurisdiction in cases of naturalization to speak of citizenship in the United States . " No definition of the character of a citizen is contained in the Constitution of the United States . The term is used with a plain indication that its meaning must have been generally understood , by reference to that system of national jurisprudence which , as I had occasion to observe in a former Lecture , is justly regarded as the means or instrument of exercising the jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution . At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted the citizens of the United States . They were either native citizens , or those horn within the States , or naturalized citizens , or persons born elsewhere , but who , upon assuming the allegiance , became entitled to the privileges of native citizens . All who were resident citizens at the time of the Declaration of Independence , or deliberately yielded to that measure an express or implied assent , became parties to it , and are considered as natives , their social tie being coeval with the nation itself . " - p. 297 . " It seems , moreover , that no person can be deemed a citizen of a State , under the Article of the Federal Constitution , who is not entitled , on the terms prescribed by the institutions of the State , to all the rights and privileges conferred by those institutions upon the highest classes of society . Thus free negroes and mulattoes are held not to be such citizens as were contemplated by the Article in question , inasmuch as , before the adoption of the Constitution of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such persons as it pleased , but ns the Constitution does not authorize any but WHITE persons to become citizens of the United States , it creates a presumption that no State had made c tizens of persons of any other color ; and this presumption will stand until repelled by positive testimony . " - p. 298 . If the language of the last quotation be understood according to its most obvious meaning , it conveys the notioii that there is an express provision in the Constitution to the effect that none but white persons can become citizens of the United States . If this notion be correct , the question whether persons of any other color are citizens or not , can never arise . The very act which creates citizens for ever separates all persons of color from their number . However numerous this unfortunate class might have been in the States , even if no distinction were known between them and the whites , and they had enjoyed in their utmost fulness the rights and priv // ileges of State citizenship up to the time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its adoption , and by virtue of that act , they would have forfeited all claims to the rights of citizenship of the United States . But is the obvious meaning of the passage consonant with the fact ? Is such a provision to be found in the Constitution ? Our author could not but be aware that the only regulation which the Constitution establishes , in regard to citizenship of the United States , is contained in the words which authorize Congress " to establish a uniform rule of naturalization , " and in those which provide that " the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States . " Nor could it have escaped his notice , that neither " white , " nor " black , " nor any designation of color , is to be found from the beginning to the end of that instrument . There is evidently a want of care in regard to the language used in this passage and the impression likely to be conveyed . We miss that clearness and accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can understand the author 's meaning only by supposing him to have confounded the laws passed in regard to naturalization by Congress , under the authority of the Constitution , with the Constitution itself . If the whole passage quoted above be taken together , there is an evident confosion of ideas , not to say contradiction , which can not be explained by any other hypothesis . As early as 1790 Congress passed a naturalization law which provided that " any alien , being a free white person , " might become a citizen of the United States , upon complying with certain specified conditions . The same formula , limiting the privilege of naturalization to those aliens who are " free white persons , " has , we believe , without exception , been introduced into all the laws in regard to this subject which have since been enacted . Evidently , then , no colored person can become a citizen of the United States unless it be by birth . The author admits that , if such persons were citizens of a State at the time the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he says that , at that time , " the citizens of the several States collectively constituted // the citizens of the United States . " But he thinks there is a presumption , requiring positive testimony to repel it , that none but whites were citizens of the States , because , as he says , " the Constitution does not authorize any but *WHITE* persons to become citizens of the United States . " We have seen that there is no language in the Constitution which can be made to bear this meaning . The " presumption " must consequently vanish . But if the Constitution contained such a regulation in express words , it would seem that , instead of creating a presumption that there were no colored citizens in the States , it would create one of a directly opposite character . The laws regulating naturalization assume additional importance every year . Immigration flows no longer from Christianized Europe alone . Thousands of Pagan Asiatics are already on our Western border , and the golden gates of our paradise are flung wide open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Consistent policy would seem to dictate that time should be allowed for foreigners to be Christianized before they are naturalized , if , as is confidently believed and asserted , Christianity is the foundation and support of free governments . The Constitution says that " no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States " ; and the first amendment declares that " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . " If unlimited licentiousness or cold-blooded assassination be the outward manifestation of a religion , and necessary to its free exercise , and the protection of the Constitution be claimed by its advocates , competent authority must decide what is meant by religion in the Constitution , and what is its free exercise . Evidently the spirit of these provisions demands that no constraint be put upon a man 's religious sentiments . He may believe or disbelieve what he pleases ; and he may practise according to his belief , so long as his practice involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same thing , injurious to the rights of others . But a dividing line must be drawn between what is and what is not lawful , as an act of religion , // under the Constitution . No act contrary to the common law of the land can be admitted as necessary to the free exercise of such a religion as is recognized in the Constitution , and thus be put beyond the reach of legal punishment ; for by this common law the Constitution itself is interpreted . This rule may seem very general ; but it is tenable , and is a safe point of departure . The principle and application of the prohibition which forbids the States to pass any " law impairing the obligation of contracts , " is discussed by President Duer in a very able and interesting argument . Commencing with the first appearance of this clause of the Constitution before a judicial tribunal in the year 1795 , the author reviews , briefly , the principal cases in Vhich it has been examined . The first case arose in Georgia , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under an act of the previous year , " to be null and void on the ground of fraud and corruption in obtaining it . " Since that time various cases have arisen , none of which has excited more interest , elicited a greater display of forensic eloquence and judicial knowledge and ability , or become more famous , than the Dartmouth College Case , decided in the Supreme Court of the United States in the year 1819 . After the decision of that case there seemed to be a tendency in the courts to apply the doctrine of contracts to every act of a legislatnre which might bear any resemblance to a bargain . This tendency to press a sound doctrine to an extreme , was first arrested by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire , in a case decided in 1839 . In the decision of this case a distinction is taken between those acts of a legislature which are in the nature of a stipulation , or covenant , and those which are laws . The laws may be repealed by any snbsequent legislature ; the stipulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important distinction is laid down between the power of a legislature to resume a previous grant by a repeal of the act creating the grant , and the power to resume the same grant by an exercise of the right of eminent domain . The legislative body has no power to rescind the contract by a repeal of the law making the grant ; but it may resume the grant by virtue of the right of eminent domain , rendering therefor // a fair compensation . Another distinction equally important is made between the proper subject-matter of a contract , and that which it is not in the power of a legislature to grant , without express authority from the people , in whom all sovereign rights are vested . Thus , a right pertaining exclusively to sovereignty can not be the subject-matter of a contract , and consequently can not be sold or granted away , except by authority from the people expressly given , either in the State Constitution or in some other competent manner . The legitimate result of this doctrine , which at once commends itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature may forbear to exercise any sovereign right , or by law render it inoperative , at its discretion ; that any subsequent legislature may at any time repeal such law , and thus bring the right again into full exercise ; and that no legislature can , of itself , sell , give , lend , or in any way , for ever so short a time , part with , any attribute of sovereignty . A further result would appear to be , that , if such sovereign right were granted by covenant , without express authority from the people , the contract thus made would be void from the beginning . In this case there could be no violation of the contract by a repeal of the act , because no contract was created , and no rights could be vested , by an unauthorized act . In delivering the opinion of the court in the case above mentioned , Chief Justice Parker says - " The power of taxation is essentially a power of sovereignty , or eminent domain , and it may well deserve consideration whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a republican government , and so far inalienable that no legislature can make a contract by which it shall be surrendered , without express authority for that purpose in the Constitution , or in some other way directly from the people themselves . " After admitting as a settled doctrine , " that legislatures may make grants of some kinds which come properly within the denomination of contracts , and such contracts , when made , are as inviolable as the contracts of an individual , " and that such contracts can not be abrogated or impaired , he says : - " But there is a material difference between the right of a legislature // to grant lands , or corporate powers , or money , and the right to grant away the essential attributes of sovereignty , or rights of eminent domain . These do not seem to furnish the subject-matter of a contract . " This same subject came up for discussion in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in June of the last year . The decision was made in accordance with the principles above stated . Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uses the following language - " But has the Constitution conferred upon the Legislature the authority to extinguish for ever , by bargain and sale , the power to raise revenue for the support of the government ? All free governments are established by the people for their benefit , and the powers delegated are to be exercised for their common good , and not , under any circumstances , to be sold or destroyed , so long as the nations establishing them have physical power to maintain their independence . " His Honor goes on to argue that government can not exist without means ; that it has no right to commit political suicide by depriving itself of the means of subsistence ; and that , " if the power to raise revenue may be sold to-day , the power to punish crimes may be sold to-morrow , and the power to pass laws for the redress of civil rights may be sold the next day . If the legislative power may be sold , the executive and judicial powers may be put in the market with equal propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important cases , beginning with that of New Jersey against Wilson , which arose from a grant of lands , by the colonial government , to a tribe of Indians , free from taxation ; and concluding with the case from the New Hampshire Reports to which reference has been made , quoting and adopting the doctrines of Chief Justice Parker . The court also say - " There is no constitutional objection to the repeal of the tonnage tax , or any other tax , whenever the Legislature , in the exercise of their discretion , shall think proper to pass such a law . The objection is to the sale of the taxing power in such * way as to put the resources of the State out of the reach of future Legislatures , should the public necessities require a resort to them . " It may be said that the power to impose taxes is only suspended , and not surrendered , and that it is suspended only // as to a few specified subjects . But if we apply the obviously correct reasoning of the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects exempted by contract from taxation may be indefinitely increased , until no source of revenue remains . A similar course of reasoning would be manifestly applicable to the case of a surrender of any right of sovereignty by covenant , and must lead to similar conclusions . The decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States as to this question have been maintained on the ground of the validity of the grant , as held by the State courts . If the validity of the grant be admitted , it must follow that to rescind that grant subsequently by a legislative act xvould be to " impair the obligation of contracts . " We heartily wish our space would allow us to quote the admirable argument of our author on the application of this constitutional restriction to the insolvency laws . Especially would we like to quote his argument from the Constitution against nullification and secession . But we must bring these remarks to a close ; and we can not better do this than by transcribing the concluding paragraphs of the book , which we have read with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed the proposed examination of the powers vested in the General Government , as well as of its fundamental principles and organization . And I trust it has abundantly and satisfactorily appeared , -1 . That all the powers requisite to secure the objects of National Union are vested in the Federal Government , while those only which are not essential to that object are reserved to the States or to the People . 2 . That this National Government , though limited in its powers to national objects , is supreme in the exercise of those powers , whether exclusive or concurrent , express or implied ; and that , whenever any of these powers come into collision with the Concurrent or independent powers of the States , the State authority , which is subordinate , must yield to that of the nation , which is supreme . 3 . That this Constitution , the laws made in pursuance of it , and treaties made under the authority of the United States , whether before or after the adoption of the Federal Constitution , are the supreme law of tke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case and the provisions of the Constitution , the National Legislature must judge of and interpret , the supreme law , as often as it exercises its Legislative functions ; that the Chief Executive Magistrate of the Union , in like manner , possesses 41 * // the right of judgin* , of the nature and extent of his political authority ; and that , in all cases assuming the character of ' a suit in law or equity , the supreme Judicial tribunal of the Union is the final interpreter of the Constitution . 4 . That no State authority has power to dissolve the relations between the Government of the United States and the People of the several States , and that , consequently , no State has a right to secede from the Union , except under such circumstances as would justify a revolution ; and that an attempt by any State to abrogate or annul an Act of the National Legislature is a direct usurpation of the powers of the General Government , an infringement of the rights of all the other States , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obey the Federal Constitution . " In this exposition , it has , I trust , been rendered also manifest , that , unless such were the nature and principles of ' that Constitution , it would never have accomplished , as it has most effectually and happily , the great ends for which it was ordained , nor delivered the People of this country from the evils they had experienced under the Confederation . I trust , too , that , in reviewing this system of Government in its practical operation and results , you will have perceived that we have abundant cause of gratitude to Heaven , not only for defending us from those former evils which must necessarily have increased under a mere alliance between the States , but for bestowing on us , in their stead , those blessings of liberty , law , order , peace , and prosperity , which , under Providence , the present Constitution has secured to the present generation , and promises to posterity . " And finally , I trust most confidently that you will not hesitate to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruler of the Universe , that our National Government , as established by this Constitution , and the happiness hitherto enjoyed under it , may stand fast , and endure as long as the vast continent over which it seems destined to extend its influence or its sway .
