txt TIGER-HUNTING ON FOOT IN IN7DIA . THE Royal Bengal tiger ! His very name has a ferocious sound , and creates expectation , interest , curiosity . To penetrate the jungles of India , and track the magnificent brute to his lair , is a most exciting , because it is a most perilous , under taking . The natives seldom attempt it , and the Government reward of ten rupees for every tiger slain can not overcome the fear in which they stand of their hereditary enemy . It is generally supposed that an elephant is absolutely necessary to take the field against tigers ; but Lieutenant Rice , of the Bombay Army , who was engaged for several years in the chase of these " large game , " gives practical evidence to the contrary . his " Hunting Experiences on Foot in Rajpootana , " one of the northeast provinces of India , are filled with incident , and his information regarding the habits of the tiger is often new , and always entertaining . It is only during the hot season - from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tiger-hunting can be carried on with any hopes of success . The heavy rains that commence early in July , and last for four months , completely swamp the land ; and the dense foliage and grass that afterward spring up prevent all progress through the forests and jungles . In the hot season the great scarcity of water , the comparatively open appearance of the country , // and the intense heat , which drives the beasts , * during the daytime , to the shadiest and most secluded retreats , are all so many chances in favor of the sportsman . Ia 1850 the native regiment to which Lieutenant Rice belonged was stationed at Camp Neemnch , iRajpootana , within reach of a hunting-ground abounding in large game . Our adventnrer 's first expedition nearly cost him his life at the ontset . He arrived at the hills , properly eqnipped , and accompanied by some twenty native attendants , known as Bheels ; but after a week 's work , though snudry bears were " bagged , " no tiger had been found . One day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the disappointed hunters were revived by the reports of two travelers , who stated , in tones of genuine alarm , that they had just seen a tiger lying near the road-side . Lieutenant Rice quickly dismounted , and gave chase . As he was approaching a large bush , about sixty yards oW the tiger , to his surprise , jumped out from the opposite side , and , in a few bounds , crossed the dry bed of the river which was close by . Directly the Lieutenant 's dog , " Wull , " saw the tiger , which he probably mistook for some new species of deer ; he set off after him , barking all the while , and keeping within two or three yards only of the brute 's heels . Onward the two animals rushed through the reeds and bushes , and were soon lost to sight . Presently one of the Bheels called out that the tiger was coming back . His brother Eheels did not require to be informed twice of the fact , but vanished on the instant . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that , was making directly for the spot where Lieutenant Rice stood . There was no chance to escape ; so when the beast had nearly recrossed the river , and was within thirty yards of the hunter , Rice pitched up his rifle , and , in the excitement of the moment , fired without any particular aim . Then flinging down his gun , he dived among the dense thorn-bushes , convinced that the wounded tiger was after him . His fancy , on this occasion , was more terrible than reality ; for finding , after a while , that he was not really pursued , he crept cautiously back to recover his rifle that had been thrown down , and saw , to his astonishment and delight , on reaching the spot , that the tiger was quite dead . It had been killed by the merest accident ; the bullet , TIGER RILLED nv A cHANcE SHOT SIEASI HAmASI. // without entering his skull , had grazed the surface , leaving a long wound , more like a cut from an axe than a ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very stout . Upon heating the jungles where large game are found , hares , partridges , and peacocks are started in swarms . The peacock is the most valuable guide to the hunter , from the peculiar note of alarm it invariably utters if there is a tiger or panther moving in the vicinity . Perhaps , when the noise of the beaters commences , a single warning sort of call of " h-a-u-kh-a-u-k ' ( like a note from a trumpet ) is heard , at intervals , from one or more peacocks , answering each other from different parts of the cover . At this sound the heart of the sportsman beats high , for he has then good reason to expect that he will soon sight his game . If the call is followed by the rapid rising of peacocks in succession , each uttering its loud cry of " tok-tok , tok-tok 1 " as it flies off , evidently in the greatest fright , the hunter 's hopes amount to a certainty-sometimes , however , to be dashed by the appearance of a sneaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if merely a bear , or any number of hogs or deer , VOL . XYI. - No. 96. -3 B should be rushing through the bushes . This is easily accounted for by the fact that they are chiefly preyed upon by the cat tribe . Peacocks , during the day , are in the habit of hiding themselves under cool , shady bushes and rocks , where they are often caught by wild-cats and very young tigers . The hunter has also a valuable friend in the common monkey . Troops of these creatures abound in every forest or jungle in the country . Being considered sacred by the natives of India . they are never molested . A crowd of monkeys are frequently seen perched upon trees above a cover . When this occurs , the tiger , if there be one in the jungle , is probably asleep under some shady bush-resting after the fatigue of the previous night 's foraging . The monkeys then are silent enough ; but directly the beast stirs they commence making a peculiarly harsh kind of noise , very different from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as the tiger is in sight . Monkeys will only give their preparatory warning at the approach of a tiger or a panther . Soon after his first successful adventure . Lieutenant Rice , while passing through the PANTIJFE CHARGINO. // small village of Rajghur , was told that a tiger lived in a cover of korinda bushes , on the bor ( lers of a large tank , or lake , in the vicinity . The korinda is a very thick evergreen hush , which attains a great size , and offers a cool , shady retreat to the tiger . After collecting about twenty men from the village-all of whom seemed eager enough for the sport-Lientenant Rice , upon arriving at the ground , ascended a tree that overlooked the path down which the tiger would probably pass . The men then went round to the other side of the cover , and began making as much noise as possible - beating drums and firing pistols ; for with these implements of the tiger-hunt a good sportsman will always be provided . Presently the tiger came bounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rice quickly discharged two barrels , and both balls entered the animal 's side . Nevertheless the brute sprang into the bushes , and was out of sight before the hunter could exchange his empty for a loaded gun . The tiger had now to be followed up , and the task was commenced and carried on with spirit , but without success . At nightfall it was , of course , impossible to track the wounded animal , and the search was reluctantly abandoned . Several days afterward some one , passing that way , discovered the corpse of this tiger by the putrid smell . It had fallen down a deep hole , half filled with dead leaves , and was thus overlooked . A singular incident is recorded by Lieutenant Rice as having occurred during this campaign . While passing by an old , ruined fort , near the village of Paughur , he heard a tiger roar , and , advancing with his men to the spot , he soon discovered whence the roars proceeded . The tiger lay in some thick patches of high grass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scouts tried hard to turn him out , so that the Lieutenant might get a clear shot at him , but nothing would move the beast . He only roared the louder as each volley of stones was flung into the thicket by the Bheels . Lieutenant Rice at length crept cautiously round , and climbed up a tree overlooking the patch of jungle in which the tiger was lying . From this eminence he saw the animal crouching under a thorn-bush . A shot , rapidly fired , struck him somewhere in the face , upon which he bolted off , with loud roars . An atKILLING TIGR SB AND B AK. // tempt was at once made to follow him up . The Bheels tracked him to a deep ravine , and then made a circuit , with the view of driving him toward the Lieutenant . But as soon as they reached the opposite bank they saw the tiger stretched out at full length , and seemingly dead , on the bank they had just left . Upon a small tree , immediately overhead , were perched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This certainly was convincing evidence that the tiger was dead ; and the spectators , therefore , were not a little astonished when the beast suddenly jumped up , and , roaring hideously , made off . He was still within rifle-shot of Lieutenant Rice when that enthusiastic sportsman fired , but surprise at the incident unsteadied his aim ; both balls missed , and the tiger escaped . This gathering of vultures over a merely wounded animal was a very extraordinary fact . Next morning the same tiger was again started from the cover , but did not again escape . The marks of the previous day 's bullets were found on his body . During this his first campaign in tiger-shooting , Lieutenant Rice " bugged " a fair quantity of game . Much time , however , was occupied in searching out the particular districts where wild animals most abounded . Lieutenant Rice was only absent from his regiment about ten weeks ; yet his " bag " consisted of four tigers killed , and one wounded ; six bears killed , and one wounded  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again as soon as the proper season reappeared . During his campaign of the following year Lieutenant Rice made Jaat his head-quarters . Upon his arrival there he learned that an unfortunate woman had just been carried off by a celebrated tiger known as the " Jaat man-eater . " The woman , at the time , was cutting grass , in company with several other people , close to the town . The whole place was very much excited by the intelligence , and a large crowd volunteered to accompany Lieutenant Rice in pursuit of the tiger . It was no difficult work to follow the course the brute had taken with his victim , for bits of clothing and hair and stains of blood were plentiful enough on the bushes through which he had dragged his prey . Every one was nervous with expectation , hoping , and yet dreading , to catch sight of the tiger among the high grass . At length , after following the tracks for nearly two miles , the party came upon the body of the poor woman , which the animal had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rather of one of the abandoned iron-pits that were scattered around . She was quite dead , and must have been killed instantly , as her skull was completely flattened . But the people , now that the woman 's body was found , insisted on returning with it to town , and would not prosecute the search , which had , in consequence , to be given up . It was not till the following season that the " man-eater of Jaat " was killed . Lieutenant Rice organized a company for the express purpose of hunting the murderer ; and one morning they all started from camp at break of day , in order to cut off the tiger from its stronghold among the iron-pits before it returned from the night 's foraging on the adjacent plain . Having arrived at the place , the men spread themselves over a large extent of ground , and commenced beating toward the tiger 's den , the precise position of which had been . tolerably ascertained . It was hoped that the tiger , upon hearing the noise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sequel showed , was well founded . Lieutenant Rice stood at a point which the animal would be compelled to pass ; and scarcely was the first sound of drums and pistol-shots heard , when , at a long distance , he recognized the tiger making directly toward him , lie allowed the brute to come within ten yards , and then , with two well-directed shots , dispatched it . The people were overjoyed at such good fortune . Runners started off with the news that the terrible man-eater was slain , and the whole population of Jaat turned out to meet the hunters on their return . The body was carried in triumph on small trees hastily cut down for the purpose . At their tent the hunters were received by a bevy of females , the youngest and fairest of whom advanced and presented them with bunches of gay flowers , while the rest sung verses in praise of tigerkillers in general and the heroes of the hour in particular , a custorti , by-the-way , that seems to be commonly practiced in Indian villages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people desired that the ceremony might be delayed until a Bheel , who lived at a distance , and whom they had sent for , should arrive . It appeared , upon inquiry , that some months before , while this man was cutting grass in company with his brother , a tiger suddenly appeared , sprang upon the latter , and carried him off-though not before the poor fellow had given the brute a severe cut over the face with his small sickle . The incident was distinctly seen by the surviving brother , who , on his arrival at Jaat , pointed out a scar , now healed up , across the tiger 's forehead . This removed all doubt as to the identity of the noted " maneater ; " and if further confirmation were needed , it might be derived from the fact that , for three years after the death of the " man-eater , " no person was killed in the neighborhood . During the two preceding years forty inhabitants of Jant alone had been murdered by this single tiger . Thus , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are thick as blackberries in India , are very jealous of the Europeans who hunt over their districts , and use their influence to prevent them from obtaining assistance , or even the commonest supplies . This difficulty , however , can be surmounted with money . The chiefs sometimes hunt themselves after they have obtained the most certain information of a tiger 's whereabouts . Their method of tiger - shooting is rather amusing . In the first place , several stands are built high up in the loftiest trees that command a view of // the cover below . Upon these stands the chief and his principal followers , armed with doubleguns and match-locks , perch themselves . The whole party is very conspicuous , being dressed in white or gaudy-colored clothes . Furthermore , they are great talkers , and keep up a continued conversation at the top of their voices . At length the beating commences . For this purpose a number of men-pressed most unwillingly into the service-instead of being kept together , in which alone their safety lies , are spread out in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to beat np a hare or a deer . Thus they continue to advance , beating drums , blowing horns , and firing off match-locks , in order to drive the tiger past the position taken up by the chief and his followers on the high tree . The tiger , of course , is soon roused , and at first , perhaps , allows himself to he driven in the proper direction ; but soon catching sight of his enemies above , he halts , and , perceiving the trap laid for his destruction , turns round and dashes back , with loud roars , through the thin line of beaters in his rear , often knocking down and mangling , if not killing , one or two unfortunate men who have not had time to get out of his way . Should the tiger , however , prefer to run the gauntlet of the fire from his foes in the trees , he generally escapes , though he is always pronounced to have been riddled with balls . To ascertain the fact , however , no steps are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a wounded tiger is a proceeding utterly unknown among the native princes . Occasionally they manage to kill their game , but he rarely dies unavenged . According to the accounts of the natives , at least " one man killed and several wounded " is the rule , and not the exception , at each day 's sport . Such " accidents " are so common that no one expresses surprise at them . The native grandees have a horror of a blank day ; and to insure sport , at short distances from their palaces , the tigers are , in many places , actually preserved , as game are in England , no one but " princes " being allowed to kill them . It is not often that a tiger is caught napping . While at a small village called Koree , wher* he had made a brief halt , Lieutenant Rice persuaded two Bheels to accompany him on a tour TIGER WOUNnED. // of inspection in the immediate neighborhood . He had scarcely gone four hundred yards from the village , when , walking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclining in the hade of a palm-tree not a dozen paces off . She , appeared to be dozing during the great heat of the day , and lazily turned her head to look at the hunter . This gave him an opportunity to take good aim , and a couple of shots through the skull quickly finished her . The heels , who had also seen the tigress , had prung into the nearest trees in their terror ; nor could they be persuaded to descend until thoroughly satisfied that the animal was dead . The tenacity of life which a tiger will sometimes possess is extraordinary . An illustration is given in the following narrative : Having arrived at the village of Deypoora , Lieutenant Rice was there told that a tiger had lately killed very many bullocks in the vicinity . lie immediately started with several men to hunt him up . The animal was discovered in a ravine on the lains . As the hunters , who had cautiously dvanced , were looking over the steep bank in search of their game , they caught sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three yards below . The brute turned np his eyes and grinned horribly , and on receiving a couple of bullets sprang into the cover with a fierce roar . Upon deccending the bank the hunters discovered drops of blood and tracked them a long distance down the ravine , when all at once they were no longer visible . The ground was formed of bare sheet rock or slabs of flat stones , so no foot-prints could be discerned . After a prolonged examination , attention was directed to a cave formed by a large ledge of rock that had fallen from above . One of the men declared that the animal was concealed there . Lieutenant Rice and a frend who was with him knelt down at an unpleasantly close distance , and having placed their spare guns before them in readiness for a second shot , if necessary , prepared to fire . After steadily gazing into the cave for a few moments , they at last saw the tiger 's two eyes shining in the dark , and were able to make out an indistinct outline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the smoke cleared away they were delighted to see their foe stretched out stiff on his back  --  the white of his belly being uppermost and very visible . The hunters now ap WATCHICO A TICER. // qwq the best and steadiest men carrying the spare loaded guns . Then comes the band , consisting of fouror five kettle-drums and one big drum , a man ringing a tremendous bell , with perhaps others , either blowing horns , beating cymbals , firing pistols , or doing any thing else to make the most horrible din that they can . On either side of the band are men with halberds , or formidable looking spears ; their duty is to keep the beaters well together while passing through grass that is often high over head . Last of all come a number of men who are constantly engaged in throwing large stones , which fall just in front and on all sides of the party , and which will start a wounded tiger when he would not otherwise move from his place of concealment . Generally , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole procession is a man in a tree , which he climbs from time to time in the progress of the march , and keeps a good look-out on all sides for any large game . The whole party move at a snail 's pace and yell with all their might . No tiger will face such a mass of men and noise . Sometimes one *ill charge to within a few yards of the procession , but he then invariably turns off and is wounded or shot dead before he can escape . Under this system of tiger-shooting there is perfect safety to every one . Not so , however , to stragglers who lag behind , or who are imprudent enough on any pretense to separate themselves from their comrades . Thus , during one of these marches , a Bheel , whose bullocks had been destroyed by a particular tiger , vowed he would alone turn him out of the jungle where he lay concealed , and with this object he rushed into the dense bushes sword in hand . The poor fellow was immediately seized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions from death , he was , nevertheless , severely mauled . Two tigers in the same bush are sometimes dangerous customers even to such a strong party as the one we have just described . One day a report was brought to Lieutenant Rice , then in camp near Doraee , that the prints of two large game had been seen in the bed of a river where there were dense covers of corinda bushes , willow-trees , and reeds . He tried , and for a long time without success , to discover these beasts . At length one of the men suggested that the tigers might be in a dark , suspicious-looking mass of corindas which it was found impossible to penetrate , and so , to test the matter , a volley was fired into the bush . A dead silence followed ; presently a slight movement was observed among the trees ; the firing was continued , and the tiger finding his retreat becoming uncomfortably hot , made his appearance and was easily secured . The men , thinking that the sport was over , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of a sudden an appalling roar was heard , proceeding , as it were , from the very midst of the party . The effect was ludicrous in the extreme-with one accord they precipitated themselves into the river , and gained the opposite bank in the utmost terror . Lieutenant Rice , who had taken off his clothes in order to dry them , made a dash for the nearest tree , and , in his hurried ascent , got tolerably well scratched . When the excitement had somewhat subsided , a man was reported killed , but , on examination , it was found that he was only severely clawed . This man , after the first tiger had been slain , had gone to examine the bush in which , as he little expected then , another brute still lay concealed . On seeing him approach alone , the beast rushed upon him with loud roars , knocked him down , and actually ran off with his turban , which , fortunately , was a very large one , and no doubt saved his head from the tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing pace and was not again seen . Bull buffaloes are rarely killed by tigers . These animals are almost tiger-proof , unless it be some solitary straggler that is attacked . When a buffalo is seized by a tiger all the others immediately hasten to the rescue , and either drive off the tiger , or trample and gore him with their hoofs and horns . The men and boys who herd buffaloes are well aware of this ; and fearlessly seated on the backs of these enormous creatures , they do not hesitate to drive them for pasture into any swamp or dense cover , though well aware that tigers are lying in the same spot . It is the habit of buffaloes to lie for hours together in the water , during the intense heat of the Indian summer , soaking and chewing the cud-their eyes and noses alone visible , and their bodies perfectly free from the annoyance of flies . They get rabidly excited on smelling the blood or hearing the roar of a tiger , and , with loud bellowings , will rush into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and madly butting with their horns at every thing in their way . Thecows , on the other hand , directly they hear the first roar of a tiger , will scamper off in the greatest alarm with tails in air and heads down ; nor will they stop in their precipitate flight until they are far from the scene of their panic . Unlike the bulls , they will not assist any member of their herd that has been seized . The tiger , who watches closely , and well knows where the cattle are daily driven out to graze , will secrete himself in some patch of grass hard by , and wait until a herd passes his hidingplace . Then , . with a roar , he springs out , strikes the unlucky bullock with his fore-paws about the head , neck , or shoulder , and at once fells it to the earth . Next ; tearing open the animal 's throat , he sucks the blood that flows fast from the wound . This finished , he retires to some shady bush and waits until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dine on the beef . Hair , skin , bones , entrails , and meat are all swallowed in turn . He only stops eating to visit some piece of water near at hand , and then returns to his meal . While dining he indulges // in low grumblings , and after he has finished his repast he will probably lie np in some secluded spot for the next three days without stirring abroad except to drink water . At the end of that time , having thoroughly digested the food , his appetite returns , and he is on the look-out for another meal . The cow-herds have an iugeuious method of revenging themselves upon the tiger . Directly he leaves his victim , the herdsman , who perhaps has been watching the proceeding from some tree close by , quietly descends , and with his knife cuts several long gashes in the dead bullock 's hind-quarters . In these wounds he rnbs a quantity of powdered arsenic , and when the tiger returns at dusk to dine he swallows the poison . This creates such excessive thirst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he seldom leaves , and drinks till he dies . Lieutenant Rice relates an anecdote of an extraordinary leap made by a tigress . He happened to be near the city Bhampoora , and was preparing to examine a large ravine in the vicinity , when word was brought that a tigress had been seen creeping out of a thick patch of cover that had been already beaten . The beast had cunningly remained hidden in spite of the noise made by the men ; and , thinking the danger over , was attempting to sneak off unobserved to some distant jungle , when she was espied by a man who had been stationed near the spot as a look-out . Lieutenant Rice and his companion took np their position on the slope of a hill , and sent the beaters round to the opposite side for the purpose of driving out the game . Presently the animal came hounding along at a tearing pace . At a distance of seventy yards she received a couple of shots , but , seemingly uninjured , continued her rapid course for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous spring in the air , clearing a small tree in her path seven feet high , and fell dead on the other side . The leap , according t#measurement , was over eight yards , and blood was found on the topmost boughs of the tree . She seemed to drop dead in the air . She was very old , and had one tusk broken . When her skin was removed some small pieces of lead were discovered beneath it . The experience of these old wounds had taught her to behave so cunningly . According to Lieutenant Rice 's observations the proportion of sexes in these animals ls about two tigresses to every tiger . The Bheels account for the scarcity of males by asserting that an old one will always kill a young one of his own sex whenever he can catch him unawares . There is no doubt of the fact that these animals often have most desperate encounters . One night the whole population of Nundwass were kept awake by the roaring of two tigers who were fighting over the body of a bullock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and witness the combat ; but the next morning a tiger was found dead at the bullock 's side , and a little farther off another one , also dead . Their bodies were covered with marks from each other 's claws and teeth . The only method of ascertaining the age of tigers is by their size , discolored appearance of their teeth , or faintness of their stripes ; and these by no means give accurate information . The tusks are not much of a criterion . They are sometimes solid ivory and sometimes quite hollow , without any regard to the size of the animal . Twenty years appear to be the greatest age that a tiger reaches . The cubs live with their mother till quite half-grown . They are first seen by the hunter who happens to be beating a jungle ; and it would seem as though the mother sent them out to draw the fire of her foes , and then make her own escape . But this unnatural conduct of the parent may be explained on the supposition that the cubs rush out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the tigress , more cunning , waits to see whether the coast is clear before leaving her strong-hold . Lieutenant Rice 's third campaign in tigershooting was commenced under unfavorable auspices . A serious and well-nigh fatal accident happened to Mr. Elliott , one of his party . They were beating at the time a ravine in the vicinity of Dowlutpoora , and to overlook the high grass around , both Elliott and Rice had mounted a small thorn-tree . Presently a fine tiger appeared , walking straight toward them . As ill luck would have it , a man who had climbed another tree called out at the moment , and the noise alarmed the tiger , who at once stopped , and then , like lightning , bounded off in another direction . Rice and Elliott both fired , and wounded the brute before he escaped , but not very severely , as the distance was too great for an effective shot . They immediately began to follow him up . After making their way through a dense patch of thorn bushes and high grass they arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly ceased . The two hunters had advanced a few steps in front of the men to examine the ground more minutely , and while thus engaged they were startled by a loud roar , which proceeded from a small ditch some two or three yards to their right . The roar was instantly followed by the tiger , who came charging down upon the party . Rice had barely time to discharge the contents of both barrels of his rifle into the animal 's chest ; these shots made him swerve from his course and spring upon Elliott , who had no opportunity to get his weapon ready , and who was irresistibly borne back by the shock . The shikarees quickly handed Lieutenant Rice his spare guns , and he as quickly fired two shots into the beast 's shoulder as he stood over Elliott , but the wounds had little effect . The tiger commenced dragging its prey backward by the upper part of his left arm , which it had seized in its jaws . The ground was uneven , and covered with broken pieces of rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should hit his // friend , whose face was touching the brute 's head . Elliott , in the mean time , had fainted . At last , after aiming two or three times in vain , Lieutenant Rice took advantage of a favorable chance that was luckily presented ; his hail struck the tiger on the top of the skull , whereupon it dropped its victim and rolled over dead . Another shot was fired to make certain , and El . liott was then pulled out from under the tiger . He was quite sensible , and asked for water , which was at once given him . His arm was frightfully bitten , but beyond this he had suffered no serious injury . When first seized , he had narrowly escaped a blow which the tiger had aimed at him with its paw , but which he had fortunately warded off with his uplifted rifle . The stock of the weapon was marked with the animal 's claws , and the triggers and guard were completely flattened . The tiger-hunter on foot should under no circumstances advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though he has every reason to believe that it has been killed . Appearances are often very deceptive . In one *f his explorations , near Janodeep , Lieutenant Rice discovered a beautiful cover , with plenty of fresh tiger-prints in its neighborhood . From this spot a tiger was started , but , being wounded in the chest , the animal , instead of making for the open country , retreated to the densest part of the jungle . Every effort to discover him proved ineffectual , and , as a last resort , the long dry grass of which the cover was composed was set on fire at both ends . The flames raged violently , and had almost met , when Lieutenant Rice , thinking the tiger must be dead , or he would never have lain so close , walked forward in the hope of being able to save his skin . He had only advanced a few paces when the brute . with an awful roar , sprang from his concealment , dashed through the flames , and made off . Our hunter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the smoke soon concealed the tiger from his view . Nevertheless , the fright gave him a sufficient warning never to advance alone into a jungle under an impression , however well founded , that his game was dead . In these districts of India panthers of great boldness , ferocity , and strength are frequently V ELaIOTT A*D TuE TIGER . // encountered . Lieutenant Rice states that one night a panther visited his camp while all the amates were asleep , and after killing a goat in the very midst of the tents and servants , carried off two large greyhounds that lay coupled together by the side of the cot in which he himself was sleeping . The panther dragged both these dogs for about three hundred yards , through some very dense jungle of high thornbushes . Guided by their loud cries and barking , the men hastily followed in pursuit , and soon arri ud at the spot where the panther had dropped his prey . One of the dogs , whose skull had been smashed by a blow of the pa ther 's paw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4ve some idea of this panther 's strength , it is stated that these greyhounds had , on more than one occasion , successfully encountered full-grown wolves . Panthers are in the habit of preying pon the unfortunate dogs that are to be seen in swarms a every village of India . The panther manges to catch these curs by making an unusual noise at night near the walls of the village . On hearing the noise the dogs run out , a d the foremost is sure to fall a victim to the lurking foe . The panther is both hold and cunning . Being able to see in the dark , it will venture even among sleeping men , and creeps so stealthily and so noiselessly that his movements could not be heard by persons awake and on the watch . Lieutenant Rice records a curious illustration of the number of bullets which a tiger will carry about his body before he finally succumbs . The hunters were beating a small , rocky ravine close to the village of Oomurchee , when they started the tiger in question from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rice fired twice , and both shots took effect . His two companions also discharged their weapons , though at a greater distance from the game . The tiger made ofi and , after a while , was again started . Two more shots were now fired , and one of them rolled the beast over , but still he got up and ran away apparently uninjured . An hour afterward , as our hunters were standing upon the edge of a ravine , looking into the cover below , and waiting the approach of the beaters , out jumped the self-same tiger from the high grass at their very feet , and made for the opposite bank . Several unavailing shots were fired , and the pursuit was hotly continued . THE TIOT AT oouu dEE . // Again the animal was seen , and again he received the contents of a formidable battery ; but this time , instead of flying , he wheeled round and charged his enemies .

Luckily he was too much hurt to make a spring , and , thinking prudence the better part of valor , he walked slowly back to the jungle . Efforts were once more made to rouse him ; but it was getting dark , and the chase had to be postponed . The hunt was , however , resumed on the next day , and upon the first start the tiger received a well-directed volley which completely finished him . No less than twelve of the bullets fired on the day previous were lodged in his body . They were known by the marks the animal had made in licking them with his tongue ; he had thoroughly cleared away the hair round each shot-hole . A tiger 's tongue is remarkably rough ; it is covered with innumerable short , stout points of hard flesh , resembling thorns , and closely packed together . With these he easily scrapes off every atom of flesh adhering to the bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rajpootana ; and during that period he killed sixty-eight tigers , three panthers , and twentyfive bears , besides wounding thirty tigers and twenty-six bears .
