txt ART . X. - Writings of PROF . B. B. EDWARDS ; with a iLkmoir , by EDWARDS A. PARK . Boston : John P. Jewett &amp; Co. 1853. 2 vols. l2mo . WE give a hearty but sad welcome to these literary remains of a thorough and modest scholar , and one of the purest and best of men , whose decease , somewhat more than a year since , deeply afflicted not only a large circle of private friends , but the lovers of sacred and liberal learning throughout the country . The sermons , essays , and reviews containe ( l in these two volumes are but a small part of the numerous productions of a pen which , for twenty-five years , was hardly a moment idle . They have been collected in obedience to the wishes of numerous friends , and contain a fair , though of course not a complete , nor in some respects an adequate , exhibition of that mind whose activity produced them . The life of a student , a teacher , a man of letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He performs no brilliant exploits , achieves no startling victories , makes no display , attracts from the crowd no notice . Yet for the little that is said of his outward life , there may be ample compen // sation in the larger sweep and power of thought to which he may have attained , and the intimacy with which he may come home , by his works , to the " business and bosom " of every intelligent man . And yet , far within those outer limits of intellectual authority which are reserved for the favored few , are there lesser circles , distinguished as by " light within light , " where move and shine those whom the world could ill afford to spare . By the ordering of Providence , a great genius appears but rarely ; otherwise , it would not be a genius , since that which constitutes it such is just that in which it differs from and excels all other men . Yet every age is fortunately favored with its men of finer mould , of more delicate sensibility , of ample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and faith , without whom how dull , and cold , and motionless , and retrograde it would be . Jn our country , and perhaps in every free country , the tendency towards politics is so strong , and the temporary honors of office so engrossing , that we are all the more glad to see placed before us , in its full attractiveness , the record of the unobtrusive but honorable life of a quiet and retirin.g scholar . He may not stand among the commanding thinkers , any more than among the restless actors of his time ; but it is none the less true that his mind may be fresh and original in its action , and his services to his generation and his race amply deserving a permanent record . Bela Bates Edwards was born in Southampton , Massachusetts , on the 4th of July , 1802 ; and it in some degree indicates the character of his mind , to say that he ever shrnnk from the publicity which seemed to he implied in the coincidence of his birthday with that of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no striking incident , yet by its quiet discipline , its familiarity with rural scenes , and its intellectual privileges , it was a fit preparation for the responsibilities and labors to which he was afterwards called . At the age of eighteen , he entered Williams College , and having spent one year there , followed President Moore to Amherst , where he was graduated in 1824 . His college life was marked by the same diligence and scrupulous fidelity which characterized his after years . A classmate and roommate // speaks of him as a " model student , - quiet , assiduous , modest , and eminently successful . " It was during his residence at Amherst that his intellectual conviction of religious truth gave place to a deep sense of its personal necessity , and he was led to a thorough and serious purpose of holy living . Yet no one was more averse than he to any thing which might seem like a parade of religious feeling . He shrank with instinctive delicacy from making his innermost and profoundest emotions the subject of familiar conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully respected in another ; and he always approached a human spirit , in the hours of its solicitude , with a gentleness and tenderness as beautiful as they are unusual . In less than a year after receiving his first degree , he entered the Theological Seminary at Andover . His course there , however , was interrupted at the close of a year , by an invitation to a tutorship at Amherst , the duties of which sometimes unwelcome office he discharged for two years with singular fidelity and success . During the latter part of his residence at the college , he was elected Assistant Secretary to the American Education Society , which devolved upon him the duty of editing its quarterly journal ; and about the same time , he was solicited to become an Assistant Secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions . Nor was this all ; for while his mind was divided upon these questions , there came another request , to add to his perplexity , in the form of a proposition to prepare himself for a Professorship at Amherst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of the above-mentioned offers , do not appear in the Memoir ; but we find him , in the autumn of 1828 , residing at Andover , performing the duties of Secretary to the Education Society , and at the same time pursuing his theological studies . It was an effort which demanded of him unremitting and severe labor , and imposed duties which he himself afterwards thought incompatible with each other . Yet it was a mistake which many an ardent student in each of the learned professions has made , in the attempt to gather up , within the shortest time , the advantages of many studies , or to unite with the labors of acquisition the satisfaction of 19 // conferring a practical good . In his own case , the effect was to diminish the healthy tone of both body and mind , and to produce for a time gloomy and despondent feelings . After leaving Andover , in 1830 , he spent nearly six years in Boston . These were among the most laborious , yet happy and hopeful , years of his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like his own . The way was thus open to that profound domestic tranquillity and enjoyment , from which he derived so much strength and hope . The years spent in Boston were marked by literary plans and labors . The American Quarterly Register , established at first as the journal of a benevolent society , assumed , under his guidance , an entirely new character , and became the depository of a vast amount of information on all topics connected with education , literature , and the progress of society . Besides a large amount of statistics , every number contained biographical sketches and essays of permanent value . It is easy to see , in glancing over the volumes , each one becoming more ample than its predecessor , what an unusual amount of editorial labor must have been required in the preparation of them . He says , in one of his letters , " My wrist gets worn out with my continual use of the pen ; " and in another , " I have written eight hours to-day - four sheets of literary notices ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immense labor to prepare the statistical tables of the Register . This devolves on me chiefly . I have spent six hours to-day in correcting one page of a proofsheet . " For a time , the space devoted to statistics in this Quarterly left a wrong impression on the minds of most who read it , concerning the character of its editor , as if he were a mere antiquarian , a collector of facts to whom one fact was about as valuable as another . Nothing could be farther from the truth . The fine poetic element , the love of all noble and in* spiring truth , was not even held in abeyance , much less smothered , during this period of drudging toil . But he had a distinct idea , which he wished to carry out in the Register , and which involved large labor with small reward and much self-denial. // made what no work in the English language has ever been , and that it may be more valuable for posterity than for the present age . I am ready to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed in making this publication what it ought to be , the best in Christendom , unless I become very parsimonious in regard to my time . All the men who have been very useful in the world , have taken sacred care of their minutes . Indeed , I now feel very unhappy if I am long away from my nppropriate employment . Idleness , or simple visiting , even with those whom I love most , has very few charms for me . I have had vacations for ten years , and they are now closed . The sources of my pleasure must be deep , or I shall enjoy very little . Visiting disqualifies me for prayer and meditation . Therefore I must renounce it , where it has no useful purpose , and find my pleasure in my duty . " Again he wrote : " The Register will give an opportunity to speak to an audience of twenty-five hundred ministers and scholars , who will carry an influence to two millions of other minds . " Vol. i. pp. 78 , 79 . Mr. Edwards had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stored his mind with an everaceumniating mass of facts , but only that he might use this knowledge in the furtherance of his literary and benevolent projects . While engaged laboriously upon a publication demanding such constant and careful oversight , he attempted , also , to establish another periodical , of a different and higher character . The first number of the American Quarterly Observer appeared in July , 1833 . Its object was to occupy ground common to various religious denominations , and to discuss the subjects of politics , philosophy , literature , and morals , on the most enlarged basis , as connected with the development of Providence , and the well-being of the whole human race . He meant , by bringing the great truths of Christianity to bear directly upon the various topics proper for such a work , to elevate and purify literature , while , at the same time , he might do something to enlarge the scope of thought , to refine and elevate the taste of those by whom the work would be most largely supported . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spirit , promising enough of the popular in the subject and mode of discussion , and as much of the profound and exhaustive as could be obtained from a wide circle of able contributors , could not // have been more amply sustained . Some of Mr. Dana 's choicest essays first appeared here , and not a few delicate and beautiful criticisms by the editor himself . We doubt still whether any better plan could be devised of a Review neither merely learned and professional , nor limited by denominational sympathies , and yet imbued more entirely with a religions element , than vould be expected in a strictly literary or scientific work . TWO Reviews , with much of a common spirit , though with different purpose , could not be sustained by the class of patrons on which both would mainly rely ; and , iii 1833 , the Quarterly Observer became united with the Biblical Repository , of which work Mr. Edwards remained editor , until its place of publication was removed to the city of New York . While speaking of his editorial labors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacra was established at Andover , in 1844 , he assumed the charge of it in connection with Professor Park ; a charge which he did not relinquish until he left Andover for the last time . The labor which he performed in connection with all these periodicals was large , incessant , anxious , and distracting . Hardly a single number of these Reviews was issued , without bearing ample marks of his diligence , fidelity , and sound judgment , in elaborate essays , or in minor criticism , and in the full account of the current literature and science of the world , often amassed with a labor and care quite unsuspected by those who glanced hastily at the result . Had he concentrated more energy upon fewer articles , had he diffused his strength with less liberality , he would doubtless have left productions more finished and of yet greater fulness and vigor . Perhaps he himself began at last to feel , that he had been too benevolent and careless . He had for several years , indeed , been concentrating his energies upon studies most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would have shown with what richness and beauty he could bring the rich materials of knowledge and wisdom to bear in illustration of his chosen pursuit . His connection with the press , although so constant , was always subservient to the claims of some other duty which served as the main employment of his life . When it was too late , we think he felt that he had spared himself too little . We can not forget the mingled // satisfaction and sadness with which he remarked , a few days before starting on his last journey southward , that " he had done Vith the Bibliotheca Sacra , except as an occasional contributor . " He seemed to feel at last , what others had long felt , that he had overworked himself , and to be glad of a prospect of rest . We need not speak more fully of the learning , the comprehensiveness , the variety of discussion , the delicate taste , and sound judgment , exhibited in the Review which he edited for so many years . His object was to concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate , to admit nothing which his own labor could supply , to fulfil the expectations of others , or satisfy his own still more severe taste . In the autumn of 1887 , Mr. Edwards was appointed Professor of the Hebrew Language in the Theological Seminary at Andover , and on the resignation of Professor Stuart , in 1848 , was transferred to the chair of Biblical Literature . This was a situation peculiarly fitted to his tastes . It led him to studies of which he was fond , and to that intercourse with young men , through which he hoped to make his influence most widely and beneficially felt . So strongly was he attached to his position here , that he declined a solicitation to the Presidency of Amherst College , mainly , as we suppose , because he thought it would be attended with a sacrifice of his favorite pursuit , at a time vhen he hoped to be able to bring them to a result honorable to the Biblical learning of his country . He felt that the broadest and most liberal course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Classical literature and modern science , history , and poetry , philosophy and art , antiquarian researches and modern travels , came in as a part of a regularly ordered system of investigation , the results of which he intended to lay , as a filial contribution , at the feet of David or Paul . The Bible he did not indeed regard as intended to teach scientific truth , least of all did he consider its chief interest to lie in its poetry or mere morality . Sooner than have been suspected of that , he would have almost abjured his cherished learning , - but neither did he fear that the Scriptures and true science would be found contradictory . On the contrary , he felt that all learning and all art would but illustrate them the more fully , // and in proportion as philosophy carried its investigations wider and deeper , with a truer method and a purer spirit , would the harmony be more marked . Hence he had a plan and purpose in all his pursuits ; his recreations were studies . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time avid opportunities , and made his enjoyments and labors to coincide . A love of poetry of the highest order was one of his strongest characteristics ; and his ideas of the honor due to it , and of its necessity for the full and harmonious cultivation of the mind , were worthy of Sir Philip Sidney , or Milton , or Wordsworth . He thus writes of the influence of the study of the Hebrew Scriptures on the imagination and taste : " The poetry of the Hebrews is sometimes represented as Oriental , an Eastern fashion , local , factitious , artificial , adapted to men living a migratory life , under an ardent sky , and not adapted to a severe European taste . But the Hebrew poetry is no such thing . It is European ; it is Occidental , for all ages and generations ; it is universal in its character ; it is everlasting as the affections of man . It furnishes food for that imagination , whose birth was not for time , hut for all eternity . Peasants can feel its force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament of its poetry , and it is not the Old Testament ; it contains truth , but not the truth that God revealed . Take out of it the element of imagination , that which makes it poetry , and the residue is neither poetry nor prose . It may be truth , but it is not the truth which we need . No error can be greater than to call the Hebrew poetry mere costume . There are some truths which are poetry in their very nature . Men , the world over , have imagination , and love poetic truths , and these truths were necessary for them , and therefore part of the Bible is poetry . " Vol. ii . pp. 223 , 224 . " Amid all the drudgery and perplexities of his editorial life , " says his biographer , " his rule was never to let a day pass by , without refreshing his taste with the perusal of some lines from a favorite poet , such as Virgil or Spenser . " These he often read aloud of an evening to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight of all who heard him . The taste thus cultivated , he brought to bear in the lectureroom , where the fulness of his mind was ever overtloxving , watering and refreshing all the banks of the channel through which his instruction appropriately flowed . // " The best illustration of unity in discourse , " writes one of his former pupils , " which I had then heard , was casually thrown out by him in his nice analysis of the train of thought in a Psalm . In a similar connection , a passing hint would gather up the legitimate characteristics of lyric poetry . His comparison of the Hebrew , the homeric , and the Virgilian descriptions of a storm , gave us exemplifications of the highest order of criticism . These hints of his , and the like , were unobtrusively dropped , and easily overlooked ; but there were not a few who remembered them with interest , and who felt greatly indebted to him for the broad and elevated scholarship to which he pointed the way . In this manner he did much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and liberalize their mode of thinking ; and all this was accomplished , not by digression , but in the pursuit of his appropriate work . " Vol. i. pp. 169 , 170 . He was , indeed , a model of a Christian scholar , with the noblest spirit , with purposes broad , comprehensive , and elevated , with sympathies wide and various , of thorough learning , a diligence that never was weary , a modesty that allowed too little to himself , and a charity and candor which often gave to others even more than their due . It would not be easy to find a mind in closer affinity with whatever is noblest in life . The higher objects seemed invariably to control the lower . There was no room in his soul for the lodgment of an unworthy thought , even for a moment . This was one source of the power of his influence . Every student felt that he uttered no sentiment , stated no opinion , and would defend no doctrine , which he did not entertain with the utmost sincerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare union of exactness and delicacy of mind , an entire absence of a harsh and polemical spirit , and a thorough devotion to truth . His learning commanded the respect of his pupils , his sincerity and rectitude and carefulness obtained their fullest confidence , his gentleness won their love . Yet his gentleness and delicacy never lapsed into weakness and indecision , and on points of speculative belief or practical conduct , where many , apparently bolder than himself , might waver , he walked with the most unhesitating and invigorating manliness and freedom . He never turned away an inquirer with a coarse joke , or concealed // a difficulty under an attempted witticism , or solved a doubt by denying all ability or credit to the skeptic . He never adopted an unseholarlike method , one that would not stand the test of a fair and houest mind . Hence the authority of his opinions weut far with those who were making up their own . The editor* of the recent American edition of Coleridge 's works says of him , speaking of the confidence which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil ,  --  " In reference , for instance , to some of the more able objections of a sceptical criticism to the inspiration of the Scriptures , my own mind , I distinctly remember , relieved itself by falling back upon the character and authority of my instructor . I could not have done this in reference to an ordinary mind , or to a common instructor . But I knew that the mind of my teacher , in this case , was one of singular candor and fairness , and would give opposing views all the weight they were entitled to ; that it was a learned mind , fully conversant with the subtlest and ablest objections of Rationalism ; and still a mind most v*ta1lll convinced of the truth of the doctrine of plenary inspiration . This fact had great weight with me , and although ultimately every mind must be rationally convinced of the truth for itself , and by the truth itseTh still I can not but think that this authority of a wise , learned , and honest teacher over the mind of a pupil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest worth in preserving it from final scepticism . It braces and steadies the mind in a moment of weakness and irresolution , and enables it to take breath for a stronger and more successful effort of its own . Vol. i , pp. 168 , 169 . Nearly allied to this trait , is what another correspondent f calls " his conscientious exactness as a teacher . " " I say conscientious , for it was a moral , as well as an intellectual trait . The habit of his mind led him to be exact , and he thought it wrong not to be . He labored to verify all his statements and all parts of them . Hence , we not only relied on their substance , but loved to preserve them in the precise form in which he gave them , being sure that every word had its place , for a good and indispensable reason . I would not for the world have changed the language nor the order of his translations , so faithful , so express an image of the original , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem , as you traced them word by word . " // We should be glad to dwell much longer on his character and methods in this sphere of his life , because we are persuaded it is so worthy of commendation to those engaged in what is too often a thankless office , and so encouraging too , since there is in these volumes abundant indication of the strength and value of the friendships then formed , and of the thorough appreciation of the value of his quiet and unobtrusive services by more than a few . Wc have spoken of his candor . It was a remarkable trait of character , and quite unfitted him for being a polemic , or a sharp and bitter critic . The polemic may have a great , sometimes an essential , work to perform , yet he does it often at great expense to himself . For such duties Mr. Edwards was by nature unfit . He was ever more inclined to discern the favorable aspect of another 's character or of a literary work , than its weak points . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sympathy in those far beneath him , or whose sentiments , in many respects , were quite diverse from his . For the same reason , discourses or books , in which fault-finding , or a bitter satirical spirit was prevalent , were most distasteful to him . We remember hearing him say of Forsyth 's Italy , a book of great talent , but the most of it written in a harsh tone , that he could not read it without destroying his enjoyment of works of art , and even the power of appreciating many of those beauties which the critic highly praised . " The longer I live , ' he wrote in 1839 , the more I think religion to consist in candor , kindness , forbearance , hoping for the best . The way of the world is to be sometimes extremely lenient , but at other times cruel as the grave , and overbearing as a torrent . ' " And again he wrote , in 1846 , " Pure religion , I am more and more convinced , so far as it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and courtesy , and honorable feeling , refined and perfected for Christ 's sake . Better than all the creeds in the world without this humane temper , is the heart of him who weeps with those who weep , and is prompt to show those little delicate Christian kindnesses which are a cordial to a broken spirit . " Vol. i. p. 114. // The same love of truth , and nothing but the truth , led him to judge , with great fairness , foreign nations and religious sects with which he had little sympathy . He was intolerant of nothing but evil . A malignant temper , under whatever show of wit or splendor it was exhibited , got no favor from him ; but the good that was in another , though it magnified his own deficiencies , or those of his party or sect , was still his delight . Strict Protestant as he was , and of the New England stamp , few could set forth with more fairness and fulness the really strong points of the iRoman Catholic Church in Italy . The neology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his most thorough convictions of truth ; yet he duly honored - and we may say , no more than duly - the speculative tastes and unflagging scholarship , for which Germany has become distinguished . For several years before his death , Professor Edwards had premonitory symptoms of that pulmonary difficulty to which he was finally compelled to yield . The winter of 1845 - 46 he spent at the South , finding in the climate of St. Augustine something to reconcile him to the interruption of his pursuits , the absence of libraries , and of that free and ample literary felloxvship which , from long use , had become a necessity of his nature . Those who saw Mr. Edwards but seldom , and were familiar only with his graver appearance , would be surprised at the quickness of his observation , and the keen relish with which he enjoyed every timely exhibition of humor and wit . He vatched , as we might suppose he would have done , with intensest interest , the operation of slavery at home ; and , though apparently seeing none of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned with a deeper conviction of the inherent and iiiseparable evils of the system . It was the more natural that he should have regarded the condition of the negro race at the South with interest , from his own intimate connection with societies formed for the amelioration of the condition of the free blacks throughout the United States . He had been prominent in forming the Massachusetts Colonization Society , and to the last , his convictions of the soundness of its principles , and those of the Parent Society , were unshaken . He was // THE WRITINGS OF B. B. EDWARDS . active in the formation of the " American Union for the IRelief and Improvement of the Colored Race , " in 1834 , and labored diligently to carry out its plans . Although his health was benefited by his southern residence , it was seen that a longer relaxation from labor was necessary , and therefore , without returning to Andover , he sailed from New York for England , April 22 , 1846 . The next autumn and vinter were spent in Germany and Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enthusiastic delight . Never did pilgrim visit the shrines of saints with more joy than did this lover of every excellence the home of the poets , or the scenes of historic renown . He thus writes of his visit to Wordsworth and to Abbotsford . " September 8 , 1846. - Our visit with Wordsworth at Ambleside was in every respect such as we could wish . He received us with the utmost good feeling , and entertained us between one and two hours . He is a tall and venerable man , with white hairs , erect person ; as seen in front , not resembling his portraits . His eyes have a wild expression . I asked him if his health was good . Very good , thank God , for a man who is seventy-six , though I can not walk eighteen hours out of twenty-four , as I formerly sometimes did . ' He conversed about the scenery in his neighborhood , Dr. Arnold , O'Connell , the Alps , Italy , etc . He said that the two most interesting cities he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Emmeline of the poems , has in manuscript two journals , one of a tour in Scotland , which he thought to be a model of that kind of writing , and which would be published after her death . She is now very old and infirm in body . She sat in front of the house , and recited to us some exquisite lines of her own recent composition , expressive of her gratitude to God and her brother . He introduced us to Mrs. Arnold , who lives in a perfect paradise . She received us most kindly , and gave us a fragment of a letter of her husband . It was touching to hear the people in the vicinity speak of Wordsworth , one of them not without tears . They said he never passed them without a kind word . About Abbotsford , what shall I say ? We were almost in a delirium . One of our party actually shed tears on seein* Sir Walter Scott 's hat and cane . Is not that dwelling a phenomenon ? rihe interest at Waterloo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mecca of all civilized lands , - hallowed and immortal . In the course of a week we read a large part of his Life anew , and his Lady of the Lake four times over . his publisher Mr. Cadell told us that the sale of his works is as great as ever . // Mr. Black , another publisher , informed me that Cadell had made out of them , in ten years , an independent fortune of more than a hundred thousand pounds . Sir Walter 's autograph is sold now for several pounds sterling . The great benefit of visiting England and Scotland is the fresh and deep interest which it throws over what you have been blindly reading about all your days . It seems as if a mist had dropped from my eyes . You can hear the shrieks of Mary as the conspirators broke in . You can see the bodies of the Covenanters as they were dragged from the Grass-market to the pit in the old Gray Friars buryingground . Did not Dr. Chalmers remind you of Dr. Beecher ? What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you hear Mr. Guthrie preach ? - altogether the most eloquent man I have beard abroad . I sat as one among four-and-twenty elders ' under his pulpit , and I could have remained there till the next day ; he discoursed most ravishingly . I am told , however , that he is quite unequal . " Vol. i. pp. 188-190 . His nature was formed for enjoyment , and England afforded to him as abundant materials of delight as it could to any man , fain iliar as he was with her history , literature , religion , and philanthropy . In the scenery , the antiquities , the men , then for the first time made familiar , he found abundant scope for the delighted activity of every faculty . On the Continent , there awaited him still other sources of enjoyment . The whole world of art burst upon him at once as a new creation , and he , whom some had mistaken for a dry lover of antiquarian lore , or a laborious gatherer of statistics , was found glowing with the rapt enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whose power and beauty he had never before formed a conception . Nothing , on the whole , " he writes , shortly after entering Belgium , " has made so deep an impression on me as the paintings by Rubens at Antwerp . They have given me , I may say with a little vanity , a new sense . I have never known before , I am sure , what a work of art in this department really is , - such individuality , such consummate groupings and contrasts , such perfect life and nature , such coloring , such an instantaneous conviction that it is the work of genius , while a second or third visit only deepens the impression , and discloses new wonders . These paintings have spoiled every thing else in that line that I have ever seen . I would give the whole of Texas , Oregon , and California this was written when the possession of the first two by our // government was still a question , and that of the last hardly thought of for one portrait by Rubens in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His residence in Switzerland and Germany was very refreshing to him . He sought out , with the interest of a pilgrim , every spot marked with a peculiar fame , and his letters and diary are filled with pleasant , and sometimes playful memorials of his impressions . Zurich , " he says , " is one of the most pleasant and thriving cities I have ever seen . I visited every known object connected with the name of Zwingle , saw his house , pulpit , manuscript sermons , and bought some fac-sirniles of his correspondence with Lady Jane Grey . At Constance , I saw the very spot , in a meadow , about twenty rods outside of the walls , where Huss met his fiery and glorious end . " " At Augsburg , I stopped at the Drei Mobren , ' where Charles V. , Bonaparte , Lord Castlereagh , the Duke of Wellington , and Mr. had put up before me . The blanks here indicate an American , thought to be somewhat fond of connecting his name with those of famous people . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I spent a Sabbath there in the two cathedrals , both , for a wonder , Protestant , and crowded with hearers both parts of the day . The music , in which every German and one American joined , would have lifted George Herbert 's soul to heaven . " He crossed the Simplon in November , to spend the winter in studying the riches of art and nature in that still wonderful Italy , to read the Latin classics on the spot where they were written , and to rejoice , in spite of much unpropitious weather , in exuberant spirits and uncommonly good health . Of the paintings at Bologna , he writes : - " Nowhere in the world are so many masterly pictures so near toget*4er . They are not of the earth , but of ' heaven . It does really seem as if these great men had a special inspiration ; all might be termed divine as ivehl as Raphael . In these Bologna pictures there is scarcely any thing which goes counter to true theology or Christian feeling . o that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How rich we should be ! And yet we met an opulent Philadelphia lady in Venice , who was not pleased with the old masters ! Raphael 's Transfiguration in the Vatican has clothed the passages in the Gospel relat-20* // ing to the subject with a fresh and inconceivable interest . " Vol. i. p. 214 . " I do not think it strange that the Italians attribute a special inspiration to Raphael ; such perfection , such heavenly beauty , such nature , such an impression of spotless innocence , pervade his great works , and these works are so numerous , and nearly all are so finished , as to lead one to feel that he was endowed by the Almighty with gifts in this department such as never fell to the lot of any other man . But I must not fill my letters with this rhapsody . " Ibid. p. 215 . " Well , we are now in the Eternal City , in pleasant chambers , No. 44 Via Gregoriana , on the Pincian Hill , very near the top of that long flight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a city this is ! I had no conception of its exhaustless riches in art and antiquities . I thought that I had seen some fine objects in Dresden , in Munich , in Venice , in Florence . But here they are accumulated in amazing variety and richness . NXThen I walked up to St. Peter 's , and under its vast dome , I felt that I had never seen any thing before . Why did you not tell me of those colonnades in front ? What a fitting introduction to the majesty of that temple ! I had formed some idea of the church itself but I was ignorant of the foreground and fore-court , worthy of the metropolis of the Christian world , as I hope it will one day become . " Ibid. p. 21G . Though somewhat of an invalid , and enjoying so much , as these extracts sufficiently testify , Mr. Edwards did not give himself up to pleasure . He amassed large materials for accurate descriptions of universities , libraries , and the means of education generally , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elements of a more thorough work on some of the countries of Europe , which his subsequent precarious health never alloxved him to arrange . Nor in the midst of his extreme enjoyment , and all the exciteruent of foreign travel , did he forget his home , or his duties to his country . His " heart untravelled ever turned " westward . " Ofelicern diem ! ( as Cicero would exclaim , ) when I shall revisit my country , - now dearer to me than ever , and superior in many important respects to all which I have seen in Europe , - and when I shall again see Boston , Newton , and Cambridge , and that circle of towns so highly favored of heaven , - vastly more so than one is apt to feel , unless one have been like myself banished far away , - and when I shall resume my duties at the Seminary , where , although I am absent in body , yet my heart remains ever . " Ibid. p. 177. // THE WRITINGS OF B. B.

Be her faults what they may , and he was keenly sensitive to them all , the laurels gained at her expense , whether at home or abroad , would have turned to ashes on his brow . He would have despised himself as much as he would have monrne ( l over her . His brief foreign residence only fitted him to come back with a wiser heart to the quiet duties of his professorship , and to form wider and still more liberal plans for the prosecution of his own studies , and for directing those of others . After returning from Europe , refreshed and reinvigorated , he had before him several years of carefnl , but thorough and effective labor . Some of his best productions are referable to this period . I-Ic was gradually drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life 's labor , seen from far and anticipated long , auxiously , but with hope and joy . One of his favorite schemes was the formation in Boston of a Puritan Library , which should include all the Puritau literature of this country and of England ; the general and ecclesiastical histories of the times ; the " Apologies , " " Defences , " " ilejoinders , " " Appeals , " " Statements , " &amp;c. , of the various sects of Dissenters ; manuscripts of distinguished men ; portraits , prints , and miscellaneous memorials of those whose fame New Eugland should specially cherish , and which could nowhere else find an appropriate depository . Such a library and museum , he thought , would be valuable as a centre of patriotic and religious reminiscence for New England , while it would serve as a memorial of the theolooical and literary labors of the Puritans . It would be of great service to future historians , would promote brotherly feelings among the descendants of that stern race , and would insure the preservatiou of valuable documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more cherished purpose of his life was formed in connection with the studies of his own professorship . For years he had been gathering large and abundant materials for // an Introduction to the Old and New Testaments . He bad nearly prepared for the press commentaries upon Habakkuk , Job , the Psalms , and the First Epistle to the Corinthians . Had he been permitted to finish these works , we believe that we should have seen volumes , to say the least , as choice as any which the press , prolific in Biblical literature , has ever produced , and how much more rich than the majority in Christian wisdom ! He was aiming to give to these the ripest fruits of his studies , his reflections , and experience ; and little remained for him to do , by way of preparation , except the fulfilment of one almost passionate desire , namely , that he , with his own eyes , might look upon the hills and plains of Judea , and might himself reverently wander " in those holy fields Over whose aeres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were nailed For our advantage , on the bitter cross . " To be compelled to give up this last purpose was one of the bitterest disappointments of his life . Even after he knew that the relentless grasp of a disease , which never loosens its hold , was upon him , did he hope that his days might be prolonged by a voyage and journey eastward . A second visit to the South had no attractions , and he concluded to go only in obedience to the urgent advice of his physicians . To his friend , II . H. Dana , Esq. , he wrote - " Some parts of our Southern States have an excellent climate , but that is all . It is a wearisome life to he among slaves , without any old things about you except the sandy plains and the almost motionless rivers . One county in England , or one small city in Italy , has more points of interest to me than forty of our new States . Perhaps it ought not to he so . There is noble scenery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it adds to scenery , if there is also an historical interest , or some relic of the past . Some of my friends seem to think that climate is all that is needed for a person like me , forgetting that the mind has much to do in the restoration of the health . " Ibid. p. 352 . Still , in accordance with the opinions of his friends , in the autumn of 1831 he turned his face again southward , and , accompanied by his family , rested at last in Athens , Georgia . // The winter proved one of uncommon severity . Exercise in the open air , for the sake of which , mainly , he had consented to the journey , was forbidden him for much of the time . One study and occupation after another had to be given up , yet he was reluctant to believe that his wasted strength would never return . He uttered no complaint , and walked along the last sorrowful and suffering path with deep humility , but yet with the confidence of faith . His biographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lowliness of spirit . So long as our friend could hold a book , he continued to read his Hebrew Bible . One morning , after he had perused at family prayer the one hundred and fiftieth Psalm in the original , he rose to lead the devotions of the circle around him ; he poured out the affluence of his imagination and his heart , in the seraphic spirit of that Psalm , calling on every thing that hath breath to praise the Lord ; - praise him with the sound of the trumpet , with the psaltery and harp ; - but when he came to the individual petitions for himself and household , his voice broke down at once , his whole style sunk from that of an angel to that of the publican , and all his words and tones were those of a stricken , bruised , crushed penitent . No other man can repeat the thoughts which he uttered , more than the sentiments of Plato can be transferred into our ruder speech . Words could not express them . They overflowed the appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eni ved frame , the tremulous , broken , whispering voice . While thinking of himseW he never cried out with the Apostle , I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course , I have kept the faith ' ; but when he heard the words quoted , Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom , ' he seized at them ; those were just the words . Yes , ' he said , I can put myself in the place of the thief . ' " Ibid. pp. 355 , 356 . When ordinary books were laid aside , he retained still his old poetic tastes , and , together with his Bible , the authors which had long been his delight ministered still to his comfort . " On one of his last days he called for the readino ' of Bryant 's hymn to the Evening Wind . On several of his last Sabbaths he exclaimed , 1kw I should love to hear Thine earthly Sabbaths ' sung by the great congregation V On the very Lord 's day preceding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be thrown wide open , so that // he might see the fields glistening in the sunlight , and might inhale the fresh breeze of spring . He was enchanted with the vernal scene , with the boughs putting forth their tender leaves . His soul was alive with happy thoughts , all the happier because it was the Sabbath morning . He recited the words : As when to them who sail Beyond the cape of Hope , and now are past Mozambic , off at sea northeast winds blow Sabean odors from the spicy shore Of Arabic the blest Take out Milton , ' he added , and read that figure . ' It was read . It is one of the grandest in the language , ' he remarked ; and another like it is in those lines : Sweet fields , beyond the swelling flood , Stand dressed in living green . ' At one season of the year , the hills of Judea may he distinctly noticed , clothed in green , beyond the river . ' And then he meditated on the scenes beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hoped to be in Palestine ; hut he was hastening onward to a holier land than Canaan of old , - fields greener than those which line the Jordan . His eyes were holden , however , that he should not know it . He did not suppose that he was soon to die . He rarely alluded to the subject of his demise . He expected ,  --  his malady and his natural hopefulness made him tenacious of his expectation , - he deemed it his sacred duty to cherish the belief , which , in the influence of the mind over the body , so often makes the believed event come to pass , - and some of his medical advisers encouraged him to hold fast the hope , - that he might live to complete the volumes , with the plan of which his soul had been charmed . He expressed his thankfulness to his Heavenly Father for the slightest symptom of returning strength . Although the past week has been unfavorable , ' he wrote on the 14th of February , yet I hope , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from week to week . Even if my gain is but little , I ought to be encournged . ' But a sudden alteration came over him , on the morning of the 19th of April . At the break of the next day , about five hours before he died , it was announced to him that his end was near . The thought was new to him . But he believed it . Neither then , nor ever before in his sickness , did he utter one word of murmuring. lie felt no terror . When asked if all was peace , he answered with his wonted caution : So far as I cam think , it is . ' One of his last expressions was like the dying words of Neander , to whom he had a marked resemblance : I am weary ; I am very weary . ' With a clear // mind , he sent his love , his ardent love , to his old friends , expressed his unmeasured confidence in the Bible , - the first and last book of his life 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as an infant falls asleep . He died as he had lived , and as all who knew him expected that he would die , - humble , self-distrustful , considerate , loving . He walked thoughtful along the banks of Jordan ; he stepped his feet in the waters , curefully and silently ; he reserved his triumphs until he had pressed the solid ground of the other shore . " Ibid. pp. 356 - 359 . He died at Athens , Georgia , Tuesday , April 20 , 1852 . The body was immediately taken to Charleston , and thence to New York and Andover , where he was , the next week , buried beside his little son , in the quiet and beautiful cemetery on the hill . A more precious burden was never borne along that grass-grown pathway ; richer dust was never gathered to its kindred dust within that secluded inclosure . The form Vhich many delighted to watch in its thoughtful movements , along the well known thoroughfares , will sleep there undisturbed till the morning of the resurrection ; but his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he consecrated it to the highest objects , and his memory Vill be fragrant for many generations . It was during the vacation at the Theological Seminary , that the funeral took place . On the reassembling of the students , a funeral discourse was delivered by Professor Park , from the text , The Disciple that fesus loved . Mr. Edwards would have shrunk , almost as if wounded , from even so remote a comparison of himself with the least of the sacred company ; yet never was text more fitly chosen . Seldom or never has a human life more beautifully corresponded to the example here referred to . We find that we have left ourselves little room for gathering up the scattered threads to interweave them into a fuller and more complete estimate of his life , and of the value of his labors . But this , with many of our readers , will by no means be necessary . We might compare him with IDr . Arnold for fidelity , and enthusiasm , and devotion to the noblest purposes , and with Neander for learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , with many more of the finer // and more generous scholars and men of our times and of other times . For , in the breadth and catholicity of his sympathies , he seemed to resemble those who differed widely from each other . But we must refer our readers to the memoir itself for a more full delineation of his character , to many elements of which we have not so much as alluded , feeling confident that the more thoroughly it is studied , the more worthy will it seem of admiration . Of the writings of Professor Edwards , we have reserved to ourselves too little space to speak as they deserve . He never uttered a sentence for the mere sake of saying it , nor ventured a criticism for the purpose of exhibiting his own skill . In his own department of Biblical interpretati9n , he never disguised a difficulty , or satisfied himself with a partial explanation , nor did he state an obnoxious truth in terms less ample than it seemed to require . A hearty lover and worshipper of truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " idols of the market , the theatre , or the cave . " It is possible that the simplicity and directness of his writings may , at first , prevent some from fairly estimating their substantial excellence . But we value them as indicating the methods by which he was always educating himself for some higher unattained good , as well as for the truths they establish . His style is instinct with life ; not a cold , though beautiful form , but a soft , pliant , breathing , living creation . One feels that he is in contact with a living mind ; that a vital energy , ever active , yet not over stimulated , is causing this abundant production ; the fields seem to grow more verdant as we wander through them , the trees are bowing to the earth with their load of ripe and ripening fruit , and the birds are singing among the branches . Among the more interesting of these writings , as showing the spirit with which he came to his work , is the Inaugnral Address , delivered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked by his usual fullness of thought and refined taste . He delivered it at a time when all the consolations of the Book , in connection with which his instructions were to be given , were needed by him . Few who were present that day , can forget the subdued and touching tone in which he uttered the sentence near the close , " yet the experience of almost // every day warns us that the fairest earthly hopes bloom only for the grave . " It was a fit caution against too sanguine expectations to any one just entering upon a new enterprise : but to his heart it had a deep significance , for he had lately been called to part with a little son , to whom he h d given a name which he always loved to speak , George Herbert , and who , although not four years old , had become the almost constant companion of his father in his walks . The depth of anguish occasioned by this affliction was in accordance with the profoundness of his love , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a long time , his heart refused to be comforted , and there is one who will always remember how an allusion , months afterward , to West 's painting of " Death on the Pale Horse , " seemed to strike him almost like a blow . " Our little George , " he writes after his death , " the delight of our existence , left us on Saturday morning last , at eight o'clock . " - " We shall see his face no more . The dispensation is doubtless ordered in infinite justice and mercy , but now clouds and darkness seem to rest upon it . Our habitation is desolate and our hearts are sick with grief . It appears to me to be impossible to live without him . He had so identifieci himself with every thing which I did , that it seems like tearing away a part of my own life . I have sometimes said , with the disciples . Let me go and die with him . ' " Vol. i. p. 348 . To those who knew Professor Edwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to with so much delight as a preacher , and was called so often to address pub . lie assemblies on occasions where the *races and freedom of oratory are usually expected . *nt those who heard him felt the charm , though they might not be able to detect its causes . It lay not only in the richness or beauty of thought , of thought saturated with affection , but also in an indescribable heartiness and sincerity ; in a high moral earnestness with which he seemed inspired , and which impelled every utterance , - that sweet informing spirit which would imperceptibly melt into the heart of the hearer , and , before he was aware , allure every gentle and pious affection to meet it . His manner would perhaps , at first , be uninteresting to a stranger ; and yet it was so honest and unaffected , - that countenance , with // its noble expanse of forehead , would so light up as he rose to the climax of the thought which moved him , that it must have been a hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an outward infelicity , and not rather be deeply touched by the beauty and strength of the soul . How distinctly we can see him , now stooping over the pulpit , ( his eyes , from some slight defect of vision , requiring him to bend close to the manuscript , ) and then , as the sentence drew to its close , rising to the full erect posture , and standing for a moment , still and firm , as if planting himself anexv on the truth he had just developed , his countenance beaming with a suppressed radiance , and his eye moving gently for an instant over his hearers , as if looking to recognize some sign of sympathy . The address , in these volumes , which will give the best idea of iJr . Edward 's method on such occasions is , perhaps , that on The Roman Catholic Religion in Italy . We would gladly stop to give an analysis of it , and a few extracts , to show the candor and excellence of the discussion . But we pass to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wordsworth , written in 1886 , which show both his own spirit , and the love with which he regarded the poet whose works he was so familiar with . He is enumerating some of the causes of the unpopularity of the poet . **Te fear , however , that the causes of this general dislike to Wordsworth lie deeper . We apprehend that there are certain things connected with the intellectual and aetive habits of the people of this country not wholly favorable to a proper estimate of a great poet . This tendency in the general mind is developed in various ways . There is a resolute repugnance to the authority of distinguished names . In past ages , concurrence in judgment on the part of a few leading minds was considered to be probable evidence of the soundness of that judgment . But such concurrence now is regarded as a suspicious circumstance . The illustrious dead are dragged forth to meet the ordeal of a keen and unsanctified criticism . We can not comfort ourselves with the memory of Socrates , but we must be confronted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exalt the human mind by recalling the names of Lord Bacon and of Robert Hall , but at the risk of hearing bribery laid at the door of the one , and opiumeating at that of the other . Every point in the moral character of a great man must be vindicated , before we can touch the productions which he has left as a precious legacy for all time . // 1868 TED wm*m*s or * . B. EDWARDS . " This habit of eagle-eyed and unhallowed criticism prevails in this country . A great name must have acme opprobrious mark attached to it , because the man who wears that name is not absolutely perfect , or because the ardor of true genius has not been , in every instance , united to a most scrupulous accuracy . Now when we open the pages of an author of any repute , we need to cherish reverence and humility . We must have some faith in his power to enlighten and instruct us . We must not carry a hard heart in our bosoms , nor a tomahawk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready to weigh , inwardly digest , love , and treasure up . Wordsworth has spent a long life in the study of his noble art . He is educated in the mysteries of his calling . In addition to a large measure of natural sensibility , he has qualified himself by a patient study of nature and of the human faculties . Is he then not entitled to our confidence ? May we not challenge for him , as a passport to his writings , what multitudes in our days are so willing to abjure , - a worthy name , a high authority ? " There is , moreover , in this country , too much of sectarian judgment . An author must be of our political or religious creed , or we can not tolerate him . He must entertain precisely the same notions with ourselves on the questions of liberty , church and state , the authority of bishops , etc . If one of another communion furnishes a book of poetry , our first questions are : Does he believe in the divine right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some political or religious heresy couched under his hexameters ? Such extreme suspiciousness shows that we are in some doubt about the foundations of our own faith . It also indicates a state of heart totally unfit to come into the presence ofa master-spirit of ourrace . It maybe important , in some respects , to how that Lord Bacon was a churchman , and a chancello ; and not wholly free from the sin of believing in alchemy . But what have these things to do with the general estimate of his writings ? So of Wordsworth . His views on church government , and on republicanism , may not coincide with those generally entertained in this country . But can we not rise superior to such considerations ? Ishenotamanandapoet ? **31;763;TOOLONG ? Does he not speak a univetsal language ?

In perusing his works , we feel a new interest , not alone in our English descent ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech . The poet has enlarged the sphere of human knowledge ; he has quickened the sympathies of our common humanity . " Vol. ii . pp. 186-188. // " In what sense Wordsworth is a religious poet , will be apparent from subsequent extracts . He is an earnest supporter and a devout member of the Church of England . The government , the rites and ceremonies , the doctrines , and all the glorious recollections of that communion , are cherished themes , and porvade much of his poetry . flether he might not have more distinctly recognized the great truth of the Christian system , we shall not now attempt to decide . The spiritual being of man , his dependence and moral weakness , his ianmortal4 the glories of the Divine Existence , are illustrated frequently and with great force . With some expressions of the early moral innocence of children , the efficacy of the initiatory Christian rite , and the tenderness with which some errors are mentioned , we can not sympathize . The language at least is liable to misconstruction , and it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be read in the better days of the Christian Church . His pure strains will be a feast to regenerate spirits . Beside Spenser and 1111-ton and Cowper , he maytake his seat onthe hillof Zion . Forthe world 's benefit , we are anxious that he should be fully identified with the elect  |p6*  . Long has he contended for this high distinction . Sweet and immortal his reward 1 " Ibid. pp. 197 , 198 . We here take our leave of these volumes , exprcssing our thanks to Professor Park for his labor in preparing them , and only regretting , that it was not thought best to give more copious extracts from that correspondence which we more than conjecture must exist , and which even in the glimpses that we have of it , affords the best picture of an inward life so beautiful and true . We may seem to havc spoken in the language of eulogy rather than of criticism ; but on a deliberate reviewal , we think we have kept within the limits of strict justice and truth . It is almost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the attention of the student , as affording a rare example of the true spirit of a scholar , and especially to the younger members of that profession with which Professor Edwards was connected , and for which he spent the best energies of his life .
