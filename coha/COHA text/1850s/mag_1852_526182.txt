WHIG PRINCIPLE AND ITS DEVELOPMENT . " ABOVE all things , " said the honest Johnson , " clear your mind from cant . " We recommend this advice to the attention of the opposition party ; for never has a body of sensible men been more miserably deceived than they , by the unceasing cant of their leaders . They have been led to believe and to call themselves " Democrats , " while their policy has always been directly opposed to the true interests of the masses . They have been persuaded that low tariffs , war , Mexican invasions , the destruction of credit , and the neglect of internal improvements were to advance , in a remarkable degree , the prosperity of the nation . They have been hurried into dangerous action upon the subject of slavery , by the sectional cant of their Rhetts and Van Burens , their Rantouls and their Bentons . In all parts of the Union the great mass of the opposition have , in fact , been swayed by the personal feelings and prejudices of their leaders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expedients for principles . But we are confident that the majority of the American people can no longer be deluded by unmeaning pretense . They have discovered already what are the real interests of the nation . They see that agriculture , manufactures , and trade , are the true sources of national progress , and that no policy which is hostile to these can be advantageous to themselves or to their country . We think we have observed already an inclination among the opposite party to revolt at the lengths to which their leaders are carrying them , and a wish to review more closely the great questions of policy which are now stirring the intellect of the nation . We shall endeavor in the following pages to consider certain first principles which lie at the base of just legislation , aid which , if rightly attended to , will serve to clear even the feeblest mind of all tendency to cant . These principles are carefully avoided by our opponents . You will look in vain for any thing that even resembles a principle in the whole course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be equally barren and unsubstantial . They are skilful in arousing the prejudices of an honest and confiding people ; they can excite the farmer against the manufacturer , the workman against the employer ; they can paint in alluring colors the desirableness and the weakness of a foreign territory which they wish to invade ; they can shake the Union itself , by the exhibition of a Buffalo or a South Carolina platform ; but they can never hide the fact that all these measures proceed , not from any one fixed principle , but from an utter want of it . If there be any thing in the nature of a principle which governs the opposition in its impulsive and inconsistent movements , it must resemble the doctrine of Rousseau , that all men are happiest in a state of nature ; and they must intend , by the destruction of national wealth and progress , to render their country the wilderness which the French philosopher so greatly admired . We should be glad to know if we are right in our conjectures . For we have sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Benton , for any principle which could explain their conduct as members of their peculiar party . Their actions , measures , and inculcations have been as opposite as were their characters , and they have agreed but in the single point of having each aimed a fatal blow at some vital interest of their common country . The Whig party , on the other hand , has ever been guided by the principle of popular elevation . It seeks to create an equality of property , intelligence , and character among the people , not by destroying national progress , but by hastening and establishing it . This end it endeavors to accomplish by a series of measures which are adapted to the wants and peculiarities of the country , and which it has steadily advocated from the formation of the government and the days of Washington , who was the first Whig , and whose example and teachings have had a large influence upon the policy of his party . The elevation of the people , we repeat , is the growing principle of the Whigs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now propose to examine with what faithfulness they have developed this principle in their leading measures . We should , perhaps , first remark that the Whig party claims neither to be the Conservative nor the Progressive party , because it is founded upon a principle deeper than that of either conservatism or reform . It looks upon the cry of the Conservative or the Reformer as equally unmeaning , so far as it does not fall in with the real wants of the people . It adopts no new opinion , merely because it is new , nor an old one , because it is old . It has sometimes been Conservative , and sometimes the party of Reform ; but it has never for a moment sacrificed its policy at the mere cry of Conservatism or Reform . Its measures have ever been steadily directed to the development of the principle upon which it is founded . The first of these measures which we shall consider , is the improvement of the natural resources of the country by the action of government . The Whig party has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the judicious internal improvements of the individual States . From the organization of the government , it has pursued this policy with unchanging prudence and zeal . It found the nation placed by Providence in a magnificent territory , penetrated by rivers , enclosing mighty lakes , bounded by a long line of sea-coast , and possessing a soil capable of sustaining an unlimited population . It saw that these gifts of nature-4f infinite value if properly usedwould prove in a great degree useless , unless skilfully aided and developed . It saw that these vast rivers must be cleared and made navigable , that these broad lakes must be connected with the coasts by railroads and canals , that the mountainchains must be pierced and the harbors of the sea-coast be improved , before all the advantages which they offered could be felt by the whole people . It urged therefore , upon the general government , as well as upon each State , that it was their duty to aid nature in her evident purpose of nurturing a great nation . In each State whete the Whig party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; canals arid railroads have multiplied ; the means of internal communication have been proportioned to the wants of the community , and the wealth and prosperity of the State has rapidly advanced . VOL . IX . NO . II . NEW SERIES . But , although thus successful in individual States , the Whigs have never been able to enforce their policy by the aid of the general government . Opposition outcry has effectually stopped the good work there . Our great Western rivers are left unimproved , to the serious injury of the Western farmer ; the harbors of the two oceans are neglected , and commerce greatly impeded ; the great lakes are covered with wrecks that might have been avoided by a small expense for proper retreats from the autumnal storms ; and thus are both agriculture and commerce greatly injured by a party which , under the name of Democracy , is directly hostile to the two main supports of the people . Next to the improvement of the natural resources of the country , the Whigs advocate protection for native industry as a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses . The necessity for this protection is apparent in the history of our manufactures . In the early existence of our country , we were content to depend upon foreign nations for almost all our manufactured articles , and the first impulse to home industry was given by the last war with England . The close of that war was followed by a vast importation , a sudden failure of native industry , and a period of general bankruptcy spreading over the whole country . A protective tariff was , in consequence , adopted to remedy these evils , and the home manufacturer has , since that period , felt to some extent the fostering care of government . But it should be remembered that the hostility of the opposition to protective measures has always been bitter and open . They have , from the first , declared themselves unwilling to lend any aid to the growth of this great national interest ; and it is only the unceasing exertions of Whig statesmen that have given us any manufactures at all . The opposition notion , that manufactures will grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition , has been contradicted by all experience , since they have never been able by all their hostility to leave this interest unprotected , and since it has ever declined with the fall of the tariff . The doctrine of the opposition upon this subject is so peculiar , that we pause for a moment to notice it . They assert that all native industry which has been nurtured into existence by a protective tariff , is in fact 9 // February , qwq and which has the same object with both , the destruction of the American manufacturer . In order to discover the true effect of their policy upon the coi*try , let us suppose that Birmingham had triumphed over Pittsburg , and the opposition over the administration . Let us imagine the present imperfect protection taken away , and observe the necessary result . We can not mistake this result , because it is already in part produced by the low rate of the existing tariff . Take iron as an example . Suppose all protection removed from manufactured iron , and where stands Pennsylvania ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undersold , and capital must be withdrawn or sunk in the furnaces . In six months , not a furnace would be left in operation in the State . But it is to the later consequences that we would direct attention . The closing of the furnaces must drive capital away from the iron-mines , and thus at the outset two interests are destroyed . The miner as well as the laborer at the furnace is deprived of his employment , and thousands of ablebodied men left helpless and without hope , who are now sustained in this way , with their wives and children , by the present tariff . But the laborer who is out of employment ceases at once to become a purchaser of the corn or wheat of the farmer , and is perhaps driven himself to seek a support fro*i agriculture . The effect of these circumstances upon the farmer must be equally unpropitious . He loses a purchaser and obtains a rival by the failure of the furnace . The price of his crop is materially lowered , and his position depressed . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon feel the consequences of the change in the loss of educational advantages , and many of the usual comforts of life . We trust it will be remembered by every farmer that protection to home industry means especially the protection of his industry , and the insuring of a ready sale for his crops . We would desire any farmer who has not yet adopted the Whig doctrine upon this subject , to observe the practical influence of even the present inefficient tariff ; and notice how completely its results refute the theories of the free-traders . Enter one of the flourishing manufacturing towns or villages which have sprung up from Maine to Texas , and see what is hourly and daily doing for the farmer . In Massachusetts you will find that the whole prosperity of the State has been fostered into existence by this policy . You will find cities and villages rising almost instantaneously under the skill and enterprise of manufacturing communities . You will see thousands of wellinformed , well-dressed , moral people , pursuing a regular course of prosperous industry , who , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , or crowding into the cities in search of precarious employment . These manufacturing communities consume at present about six hundred thousand bales of cotton , besides wool , leather , and various other materials . They require also large quantities of flour , beef , pork , and other provisions , all of which are the productions of the neighborhood , or are obtained from the Western States ; and thus is it that every manufacturing town becomes a direct benefit to the farmer , by keeping up the price of his grain . We ask the attention of the farmer to this point , because it has always been a part of the opposition policy to arouse the jealousy of the agriculturist against the manufacturer , and to sacrifice the feebler class to the larger and more influential . But the farmer must soon become convinced by the progress of events , that the manufacturer is his best friend . In England he may be undersold by the serf-labor of Russia or Poland , but in his own manufacturing villages he is sure of a constant market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market is one that , even under the present tariff , is constantly growing , but which , with proper protection , would soon reach an extent capable of consuming all the grain that we could produce . A proper increase of protective duties would cause a rapid growth of manufactures , not only in their old haunts upon the seaboard , but in all the interior States . And this is just what the farmers of the interior want . It is idle to tell the farmers of Indiana or Illinois that there is a market for their Indian corn or their wheat in Great Britain , while the distance and expense of transportation , even without serf-competition , shut them out from the hope of ever reaching the market . It is mockery to talk // February , of England 's purchasing our productions , when every year we see millions of dollars ' worth wasted upon the prairies , and the farmer , who , if he had a market at home , would be a rich man , impoverished , because no one comes to buy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns and a vast number of busy villages in the midst of the great West , and fill them with an active population , producing articles that meet the wants of the country , and consuming its productions , you do exactly what any wise man would wish done , who sought to elevate the condition of the people . You would give the very stimulus to the country which it requires . At present , the Western States are weighed down by an excess of production . The rich prairie land pours forth its copious harvests , and often they are left to rot upon its bosom . Wheat , corn , beef , poultry , are almost given away , so small is the price which they realize . And the condition of the Western farmer is just what these circumstances indicate , He has abundance of food , but is impoverished in every thing else . His family is ill clothed , ill educated , and deprived of all the refinements of life . The land is carelessly tilled , because the farmer has no motive for raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus lives on an indolent existence , hardly allowing himself a hope of ever attaining the comforts of Eastern civilization . The only hope of Western agriculturists is the *hig measure of protection , which would soon cover the country with manufacturing towns , fill the farmer with energy , consume all his productions , and place him in the pathway to competence or wealth . But so long as the present low tariff exists , the great West must be content to see its farms unimproved , and its people depressed . The present tariff has been tried , and has proved fatal to agriculture . As to manufactures , factories and furnaces in all parts of the land have sunk under its influence , and their capitals , often the united mites of the widow and the orphr*i , have been for ever lost . Thousands have been thrown out of employment , and the prices of produce materially lowered . A vast importation of foreign goods has followed , bankruptcy and ruin have spread over the land , and , but for the fortunate productiveness of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting . The whole country has received a check in its onward progress , which even the great yield of the gold mines has been unable to repair ; and we sincerely believe that the chief burden of this evil must finally fall upon the farmer . The free-traders promised him a steady market in England , some five or six thousand miles away from his farm , building their calculations upon the year of famine . But has he found it ? No . It was a cruel mockery . It is too far off ; and the serfs of the continent , who are contented to live upon black bread and in a hovel , can readily produce cheaper than he , and are nearer to the market . And yet , upon the deceptive assurance that England is able to buy and consume all our surplus provisions , do the opposition base their whole free-trade policy . No . The farmer wants his market , not upon the banks of the distant Thames , but upon the watercourses of his native State , upon the Illinois , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get only by an alteration of the present tarifl and by securing the American laborer from the rivalry of men who work for eighteen pence a day , and think themselves well paid . Will not our farmers take this plain view of an important subject into attentive consideration , and let the effect of their reflection be seen in the coming elections ? For we have little fear of the result . We believe that the common sense of the agricultural class must speedily free them from the influence of opposition artifices , whenever they begin to reflect . As we are simply desirous , in these remarks , to trace out the development of the Whig principle in their measures , we must pass rather hastily over the measures themselves , and , had we space , would delight to enlarge upon the humane and elevating tendency of the policy of our party . We might particularize many other striking benefits which would flow from the encouragement of native industry . We might notice the effect upon morals , education , refinement , and similar topics ; but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The subject of protection has been widely discussed : it is the favorite measure of the Whig party , because they are well assured that it tends to elevate the whole people to an equality of property and position ; and it has been a favorite subject // of abuse with the opposition , because they can not or will not understand it . The Whigs assert , in language plain to all , that protection will make the nation rich , by making it industrious ; that it will provide employment for thousands , and will especially encourage agriculture , by consuming our own cotton , wool , corn , and produce of every kind , and particularly the provisions of the far West . They assert that protection will pay a dollar a bushel for every bushel of wheat that can be raised upon the rich and teeming prairies ; and that the market will be found at the farmer 's door , instead of five thousand miles off among the pauper labor of England . These assertions facts have already proved , and the outline of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we notice is the credit system ; and we are sure that it has already proved itself a powerful agent in elevating the whole people . This measure is so peculiar to the Whigs , that though the opposition have often sustained it in their practice , they have violently resisted it in theory . The Whigs cherish it because it has proved itself the essence of commerce , manufactures , and agriculture . Our cities have all been built upon this system ; our internal improvements could not have existed without it ; our very government must long ago have sunk without its aid . Yet our opponents have ever cried out for the destruction of the credit system , and the substitution of gold for paper , immediate p*yments instead of reasonable credits , and sometimes direct taxes instead of import duties . Such a policy , had it been adopted in the early existence of the country , would have checked all national progress , and left us at this moment at the rear instead of the front of civilization . We should have had no canals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national existence . Ve might still have traveled in a sloop to Albany , or crossed the ocean in British packets . But our opponents are not consistent* in their outcry against this measure . They oppose , indeed , a canal debt , or a harbor and river debt , but they have never shown any reluctance to a war debt . When they had succeeded in exciting a war with Mexico , they became eager advocates of long credit , and ran into mad expenditures , that are yet a burden upon the nation . In Mississippi and Arkansas we have still more glaring examples of their utter inconsistency . The opposition , after hurrying those States into unbounded extravagance , have covered themselves with infamy by inventing and supporting the doctrine of repudiation with all their political influence . Now , although we should be rejoiced to make converts of the whole opposition to the Whig doctrine of moderate credit , yet we must except to any such interpretation as they have seen fit to put upon it in those two cases . The most zealous Whig will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abhors extravagance , because it leads directly to repudiation . The Whig view of this subject has practically met with the approbation of the whole people ; they have gone on building their canals and railroads on credit , making daily use of a paper currency , because it is convenient ; sustaining banks when banks were necessary , and maintaining national progress by a proper use of the credit system . The opposition policy has been proved to be wholly inexpedient and impracticable . The farmer , the merchant , the mechanic and the manufacturer have each found that the outcry of the opposition against the use of reasonable credit is only an unmeaning cant upon a question which they do not understand , and that a full development of their avowed policy could only end in destruction to the prosperity of individuals and of the nation . We trust , therefore , that in the coming election they will set at rest this destructive assault of the opposition upon agriculture , manufactures , and trade . The next development of Whig principle which we notice is their uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foremost colors ; and they have adopted this policy because they feel that all the natural and political advantages of our country would be of little avail without peace . Setting aside the necessary moral evils of war , they believe that every national interest suffers from its effects ; and they maintain that it especially tends , in its final influences , to depress the condition of the masses . The laboring classes are always the chief sufferers in time of war . Th* speculator may make a profit out of the miseries of his nation , the manufacturer may find a readier market for his goods , but the poor find // their taxes increased , their means of subsistence scantier , and their children torn from them to fill up the fated ranks of the army . The Whigs believe , too , that a military spirit is fatal to true liberty . They believe that the army is a bad school for learning the doctrine of equality ; and that a long war would very probably destroy our institutions and our freedom . The opposition has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences , they have always advocated extreme measures in their policy towards foreign nations , and have seriously injured the country by keeping up a constant dread of war . They very nearly produced hostilities with England upon the Maine boundary question , which was settled by Mr. Webster ; and they would have succeeded in the instance of Oregon , had they not been checked by the good sense of the Whigs . They gratified their passion , finally , in a less fatal manner , by plunging into a war with Mexico , and have wrested from that unhappy country a territory which we could have bought for a small sum , at the expense of a great debt , and a profuse loss of life and bloodshed . The opposition leaders have sated their thirst for blood and plunder in the dismemberment of helpless Mexico ; but the effect of their policy has been felt too in their own country . They have spread mourning over the land ; they have embarrassed many merchants , farmers , mechanics ; but , above all , they have implanted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This spirit has manifested itself in the late expedition against Cuba , and the new revolution in northern Mexico . The volunteer , who has once tasted the fierce excitement of real war , can seldom settle down into the industrious citizen . And this passion has become so deeply fixed in the minds of many of our countrymen , that we fear that years of a better policy will not serve to eradicate it . The idea of conquest is abhorrent to the Whigs . They wish to obtain nothing by violence . If the country is to c'xpand over the surrounding territories , they wish it to do so by peaceful measures , by purchase , by the consent of the native population , by negotiation . They believe that the destiny of the Union can be fulfilled better by a dignified and generous conciliation of its neighbors , than by a threatening attitude and a hostile spirit . . They believe that , the more powerful our country becomes , the more generous should be its conduct towards the feeble and distracted republics around us . It should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unambitious and peaceful as it is free and great . And they believe that the result of such conduct will be a gradual absorption into our Union of the whole of North America . The Whigs look upon their native country as the great but only home of true liberty . Every where else upon the face of the world is oppression , suffering , bloodshed , and the intimations of a fearful storm . This country is , in fact , the only refuge for the exile who would be really free . This country alone , in the midst of a general discontent , is happy , peaceful , and respected . Then why adopt any new policy , which could only be attended with danger to ourselves , and which , besides necessarily injuring our great national interests , our commerce and agriculture , might break up our political institutions , and destroy for ever the home of freedom in the new world . The Whig party urges us to guard our* institutions from the least shadow of danger , not only for the sake of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe . Let us not endanger by a war policy the example which we give , or the home which we offer . The question of slavery , again , has brought into strong contrast the firm principle of the Whigs , and the utter want of any on the part of their opponents . The Whigs have ever asserted that union is the grand source of popular elevation . Without it , we should have been a collection of powerless communities , ever conflicting and mutually retarding each other 's growth . Under its influence our interests become one , and commerce , agriculture , and manufactures are its natural fruits . The masses are peculiarly indebted to union for the wages which sustain them , and the farmer owes to it the market which he finds for his produce . The merchant sends his wares into barbarous seas , secure , because he is beneath the flag of the Union . Emigrant throngs cross the ocean and plunge into the wild forest or prairie , unharmed by the savage , because they are within the Union . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because they know the power of the Union . The // gold-seeker enters in safety the wildest regions of California , because he feels the power of the Union present with him wherever he goes . All classes of citizens are , in fact , dependent for their security upon this great bond . of peace , which spreads like a beneficent heaven over all , and rains down blessings equally upon those who rejoice in its smile , and those who look up only to defy it . It knows no distinction of party , section , or interest , but has in itself a perpetual unity of beneficence . The greatest of the Whigs have ever been the defenders of the Union . The compromise measures of the last Congress sprang from the patriotic genius of the Whigs . The eloquence of eminent Whigs first aroused the country to a consciousness of its danger , administered an appropriate remedy , and quieted the sectional excitement ; and this is but one more convincing example of the firmness of the Whig principle . In the slavery agitation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their measures , and inquired what policy would best advance the interests of the whole people . They had many strong prejudices and native convictions upon this subject , which would have led them to different action , but all these they gave up for the sake of the general good . Had they not been a party of principle , they must have been hurried away by their impulses into dangerous courses , and might easily have gratified their private feelings at the expense of the great mass of the people . But had they done this , they would have ceased to be Whigs , in refusing obedience to Whig principle . In consequence , but few leading members of our party were found in the extreme ranks upon that occasion , while the opposition leaders were at the front of every movement openly hostile or dangerous to the Union . In every section , the latter were the first to take advantage of the excitement , and to build up for themselves a sectional and personal importance , at the hazard of the great interests of their country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved to destroy the Union , or administer it upon narrow expedience and sectional policy ; and the opposition party of the whole South , though with many noble exceptions , ranged itself under their banner . In the West , their great leader , Benton , was the prominent champion of a desperate and unrefiecting free-soil movement ; while in New-York , from the very focus of the opposition cause , came forth the two Van Burens , to afford a double instance of how readily misnamed Democracy runs into dangerous fanaticism . Then again , we have ex-Vice-President Dallas , and ex-Secretary Paulding , lending the aid of their personal influence and equally potent argument to the side of Southern nullification , and at a late hour giving a feeble blow to the peace and safety of the Union . These movements of the opposition u*ider the influence of sudden excitement are very suggestive . They are the necessary result of a want of unity in principle , or rather , in fact , of the absence of any principle in the government of their actions as a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good of the whole people , take their places calmly and of necessity on the side of the Union , we see the opposition every where misled by its ancient guides into the wildest excesses of sectional and party feeling . Now , on what one principle of policy can these men have acted , to have rushed so far away from each other , and from the limits of their party organization ? We ask for some rational explanation of this phenomenon consistent with their patriotism and their common sense ? For we profess ourselves full of regret to see men of great intellect , of long experience , of-as we have ever believed-sincere , though ill-directed honesty , thus animated by a violent hostility , not only to each other , but even to the Constitution and the prosperity of their nation . We see them abandon their party unity with regret and alarm , because we believ* even a false Democracy to be less hurtful to the country than the policy of Benton or the disunion movement of Calhoun . And we seek to know if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have forgotten , but which will serve to recall them from their wanderings to their less dangerous hostility to internal improvements and home industry . We ask leading Democrats to point out to us this principle ; otherwise we must consider this so-called Democracy to be but a hot-bed for the wildest fanaticism ; or why should it produce nullification at the South , a Buffalo platform in the Centre , a free-soil Benton in the West ? // And yet , tossed about as they have ever been by sectional and personal feelings , devoid of any great principle of action , the opposition leaders do not hesitate to claim for themselves the directing of the government of this great people . With all the marks of unfitness glowing upon them , they seek the highest offices , and assert their right to power I But we trust that our people have seen in their past conduct a proof that no party of expedients should be suffered to control the welfare of the nation . For what would have been the result of Democratic preponderance during the slavery agitation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the Union ? Had Benton or Van Buren gained the control of affairs , where would have been our internal peace ? Had such men triumphed , the American people would to-day have bowed their heads in shame , disunited and broken . Disunion with all its evils would be upon us , and the chief evils of disunion would fall upon our laboring classes . The masses would to-day have languished for want of employment ; the great commercial ports would have wanted their usual activity ; we should have been * declining instead of a prosperous people , seIf*bandoned and self-destroyed . The spirit of liberty would have fled from our shores in the sight of despotic Europe , because we were incapabel of affording her a shelter from ourselves . But no ; so long as we possess aWhig administration and Whig leaders , the presence of liberty is assured , because liberty loves to buird upon principle , and to dwell beneath the shelter of principle ; and the very principle of liberty itself is the elevation of the people to an equality with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whigs . We should be glad , had we space , to pause for a moment , to compare the conduct of the great Whig statesmen with that of the opposition leaders , in that moment of great agitation , when the people first began to move in sectional masses all over the land , and when the storm first broke in all its fury against the defenses of the Cc*istitution . We look back with pride upon the firm conduct of our two greatest statesmen , Clay and Webster , and with something of sympathy upon the fate of the opposition leaders , who suddenly and without a guiding principle were borne off by the first blast into violent extremes , and who now lie , wrecked in po pularity and in hope , upon an ignoble strand . In that dangei*ous hour , we watched the movements of the two parties with something of scientific curiosity . We knew the want of unity existing in the formation of the opposition party , and we had full confidence in the firmness of our own . The result was what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what we had feared , but we turned with hope to our own leaders , and found our hopes fulfilled . We saw the venerable Clay prepare himself from the first to meet the popular agitation , and to assert the claims of the whole nation in opposition to the calls of sectional prejudices , or of personal interest ; and we felt alarmed for a moment , lest that grand and good man might struggle in vain , and the great principle of which he was the exponent be lost in the triumph of sectional passions . But when we saw another great Whig , equally dear to his party , Daniel Webster , lend his powerful aid to his elder brother in the cause of union , we felt reassured . We watched these eminent men in their first appeal to the nation against sectionalism , and we watched them to their final triumph . But this triumph they obtained solely through the aid of a Whig administration . Taylor and Fillmore were from the first devoted Unionists , simply because they were Whigs ; and we feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble an Opportunity of displaying their devotion to principle , and of deserving the name of saviours to their country . But we have not time to dwell as we should delight to do upon those memorable scenes and actors . We should have been glad to have recalled the patriotic efforts of many of the opposition in the same cause , of Foote and Cass , of Cobb , and many others , eminent Unionists , and who have deserved the gratitude of their country . But we must pass on . The Whig party , after the passage of the compromise measures , had a still harder task to perform ,  --  they were to execute them . We believe that this part of their duty has been faithfully and fully performed . The full provisions of every article have been carried out to the very letter of the law . In Massachusetts , where slavery is hated with inborn hatred , and where every man in the community is opposed to the Fugitive Slave Law , except as a means of preserving the Union , // the firmness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law as perfect as that of the mere technicalities of the statutebook . The slave no longer flies to Massachusetts , because he finds that the sympathy of the people can not save him from the constitutional claim of his master . But the administration have done this at the loss of the State to their party . The opposition , taking advantage of the disaffection of a few Whigs and the outcries of the Abolitionists , have joined with the latter , and formed a coalition which has driven the Whigs from office and power . Had the Whigs chosen to unite with the Abolitionists or to abandon their Union principles , they might have retained their power , and avoided the shame of defeat . But they preferred to lose the State where they had so long ruled undisputed , rather than abandon the administration , and join in the abuse of its enemies . The opposition success in Massachusetts , however , is a further proof of what we think requires none-that that party is governed solely by its interests or its prejudices . For the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not hesitate to rush into the violent policy of the free-soilers , to aid in sending two free-soilers to the Senate , and to oppose as far as was in its power the patriotic efforts of the friends of the Union . On the other hand , we have never regretted the defeat of the Massachusetts Whigs , because we believe that such a sacrifice as they have made to a sound principle can not be without a good result . U They triumphed in their defeat , and have shown to the country their devotion to its interest rather than to that of their section . The Whigs have sustained the Union with the loss of their all . The opposition have arrayed themselves against the Union with great gain and self-gratulation . We trust that the people of the Union will not overlook this striking exhibition of the true nature of each party , but will carefully study the meaning of this ready coalition between the opposition and the abolitionists . The administration have been equally efficient in enforcing the law in every State where its protection has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of popularity and influence . In every instance save one , the slave , when identified , has been sent back to his owner ; and we have never heard a charge brought from any source against the administration of neglecting this unpleasant duty ; but . we have heard much violent abuse thrown upon them for the strictness with which they have executed the law . On this subject we may say , that we believe they have acted in opposition to their own feelings , interests , and early prepossessions , and have been enabled to do so only by taking a wide and liberal view of the slavery question . They have been sustained by a firm confidence in the justice of the great principle of their party , and a consciousness that the fate of the people would be decided by their conduct . Had they yielded to sectional impulses , or had they done their part negligently and ungraciously , they could not now stand up before the nation and assert that they have meted out justice to all sections and interests . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having sacrificed every thing to principle . The conduct of the administration in executing the compromise act deserves particular admiration , and we are glad to find that the different sections of the country are beginning to appreciate the impartiality of the President and his Cabinet . We have heard many intelligent Southerners , who at first doubted their intentions , express themselves convinced of the perfect integrity of the administration ; and we have met violent free-soilers who have at last confessed that they were firm in their principles . This is the reward of consistency , and one which time will constantly increase . The Fugitive Slave Law has in it many features upon which no man can look with satisfaction . But when a necessity is upon us , the wise man submits without complaint . Could any power remove the cause of this law with safety to the Union , we should be the first to blot it from the statute-book ; but so long as a great need of it exists , recognized by the Constitution , we are willing to do all for our Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we in their place . We submit to the slave law because the safety of the Union is involved in our submission , and because the Union is the source of the happiness of the nation . In obeying this law , then , we perform a high duty toward our own people , our fellowmen , and all future ages , and we feel cheered by this consciousness in the midst of much self-sacrifice . This law is also a pledge of // good feeling toward our brethren of the South , and they have recognized it as such , and rewarded the self-denial of its originators by supporting the administration in their late elections . As a pledge of goodwill , and as a need of the country , we cheerfully receive and sustain this constitutional law . One other Whig measure remains , which will close the list ; and this is popular education . We do not claim that this measure belongs exclusively to the Whigs , but we contend that they have been far more earnest and successful than their opponents in carrying it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have a better system of common schools than those where the opposition are usually in power . Massachusetts ; Connecticut , Rhode Island , and New-York , have admirable systems of instruction , while Virginia , Pennsylvania , and every Democratic State , leaves large masses of its people wholly uninstructed . We should not have alluded to this subject as a party question , had not a devotion to the interests of the people been the constant boast of the opposition . Yet here is an instance of unpardonable neglect by that party of one of the chief wants of the people . Why have they suffered States over which they have so long possessed a control , to remain so far behind their fellows in the education of the masses ? Is this indifference , or is it design ? Do they dread a thinking constituency ? T*e Whigs look upon education as the firmest support of their party , because without it no popular advancement can take place . The masses of the people must be taught to think for themselves before they can help themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians and politics until they have learned to think . The Whigs desire to elevate the people to a perfect equality of education , as well as of comfort and station . There are several other Whig measures , all growing out of this one principle , which we could dwell upon , but we believ. we have said enough to bring out clearly the great fact which we have in view , and have enabled our readers to form a definite idea of what the policy of our party has ever been , and ever will be . We have seen that the Whigs consider the general government an instrument placed in the hands of the people , for the purpose of securing their own elevation ; that they believe that the people are entitled to demand from the general government its aid in advancing the great popular interests , commerce , manufactures , agriculture . This aid is to be rendered by the adoption of certain measures , which have been proved by experience to be fully capable of attaining the desired end . The Whigs , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , by a liberal appropriation for the improvement of our rivers and harbors . They ask , in the name of the people , a just protection for home industry , because they see clearly that this measure will give employment to the masses , by consuming the grain of the West , the cotton of the South , and the surplus labor of all parts of the country . They require that the peace of the country be preserved , because the burden of war must fall heavily upon the masses . They demand a Union policy , because the welfare of every class depends upon union . They advocate a sound currency , and a just system of credit , because these are the foundations of national progress ; and , lastly , they are zealous friends of popular education , because they feel that an enlightened people will , necessarily , elevate itself to an equality of physical comfort and refinement . A general election is drawing near , when parties will be arrayed against each other , and their measures discussed and decided . This election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . It may decide for ever the destiny of our people , and will certainly affect their greatest interests . The Union is just reposing after violent internal agitation ; the fires yet glow beneath the ashes that may burst forth into a fatal conflagration . The country is still weighed down by the imperfect protection afforded to its industry ; and the farmer has discovered too late that the markets of Europe are too far off and too uncertain to take off his surplus crops . A dangerous crisis , too , seems to be approaching in the affairs of Europe , in which a false and hasty policy will destroy a great portion of our commerce , and blast the hopes of the farmer . To which party will the people commit their interests , in a moment so full of im-portance ? // Will they commit the safety of the country to the opposition , a party which has ever been governed by sectional impulses or personal interest , and whose principle , if they have one , is to reduce all classes to a wretched equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Union to a party which has leagued with the disunionists of the North , the South , and the West ; which has sustained Calhoun in South Carolina , Van Buren in New-York , Abolition in Massachusetts , and Benton in Missouri ? Is this a party which can save the Union ? Will the people endanger their greatest interests by placing in power the opposition war party , at a moment when the danger of war is imminent , and can only be avoided by prudent and dignified self-restraint ? Will they confide in a party which has ever showed itself eager to rush into hostilities , without reflection , and without a thought of the injury they would inflict upon the laboring masses ? Will peaceful laboring men , whose employment depends upon the continuance of peace , sustain by their votes a war party ? Will the people place in power men whose policy has already deprived the farmer of a market fox his produ*e , and destroyed the hopes of the manufacturer ; and who promise , if elected , a still bolder assault upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are sure they will not . The opposition , party is simply a destructive party . It would destroy credit . It would lower wages . It would disturb the Union . It would excite war . It would depress the condition of the masses , and would reduce them to want and idleness . And all this it would do , simply because it has no guiding principle , but is for ever carried away by local or personal impulses . But the Whig party seeks to elevate , instead of depressing the whole people-the true principle of liberty . It would elevate the people to an equality of physical and intellectual advancement ; and all its measures , as we have seen , tend directly to this end . We commend its principle and its measures to the careful attention of all who live by labor , and who are consequently dependent for their prosperity upon a strict adherence on the part of government to the great Whig principle of popular elevation .                @ @ @ @ @
