Report of the Secretary of the Treasury on the Trade and Commerce of the British North American Colonies since 1829 . Feb. 6 , 1851 . Prepared by J. D. ANDREW5* United States Consul at St. John , New Brunswick . WE can not agree with a recent ingenious writer in denying to Political Economy the name of a science . Yet it needs to be rigidly guarded against some of the errors involved in the popular use of that name . Exactness and universality of application are commonly understood to belong to scientific principles , in contradistinction to the results of a partial observation or a limited experience . What is scientitlcally true is supposed to be true always and everywhere . But in strict fact , there are no exact sciences . Even mathematical formuke are literally true only in the abstract , and on paper . In their practical applications , they are subject to perpetual abatements and modifications , on account of the variable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pulley raises less weight in practice than in theory , and different pulleys of the same theoretical power raise different weights ; for the formula of the pulley excludes the elements of varying friction and flexibility of ropes . The mere mathematician , therefore , can not be a successful mechanic . In order to construct machines that will do their work , he must have a competent amount of that experimental knowledge and judgment , which can not be written out or reduced to exact expresslons . In the moral and social sciences , there is the same distinction between theoretical and practical truth . Circumstances modify principles . The form of government , on which society ought to be organized if its elements were // unformed and plastic , would create injustice , misrule , and misery in any actually existing community . Inveterate wrong acquires a certain measure of prescriptive right , - at least , the right of gradual extinction in lieu of violent abrogation . An abnormal past reappears as a factor in every formula for the present . Universal propositions embrace not men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as without history , environments , or idiosyncracies . Hence the maxims of practical wisdom vary widely in terms from the principles of abstract science , though identical with them in the last analysis . Therefore is it that the mere philosopher never succeeds in legislative or administrative details . Yet his theories are of essential service in the affairs of society and government , as points of departure , standards of verification , limits to be approached as the body politic approaches its normal condition . The fallacy of the ultra free trade doctrines consists not in the doctrines themselves , but in existing circumstances which essentially modify and limit them . Were capital equally diffused among the nations , were industry everywhere equally well compensated , and were the expenses of governments so reduced that they could be supplied by direct taxation , ( as can be the case only when , by the establishment of universal peace , the naval and military departments shall be superseded , ) it would be safe and'practicable , judicious and politic , that the ports of all nations should be open without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and navies are to be sustained , port duties are the only form in which the necessary public revenues can be collected , without being oppressively felt , and keeping the citizens in the very attitude of rebellion . So long as manufacturers in any one country are in the condition of paupers , the free introduction of their commodities into the ports of any other nation must reduce manufacturers of the same class in that nation to the same level of penury . So long as , in one country , low rates of - interest conspire with a glut of the labor market to stimulate production , the unrestricted inflow of its commodities must paralyze the industry of another country , where smaller accu inulations of capital and a less ample supply of industrial ope ratives enhance the cost of production . There are but three cases in which the free trade principle , sound as it is in theory , // is safe in practice . The first is , with reference to commodities which enter into general consumption in countries where it is impossible that they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , tea , coffee , and spices have become necessaries of life throughout the civilized world ; and charges on their importation only enhance the cost of subsistence , and either increase the wa0es of labor , or straiten the resources of the laboring classes , without any countervailing benefit . The second case is that of commodities , which , from the very nature of the case , must be produced by different communities at nearly the same cost . Under this head we might class breadstuffs , and such agricultural products as demand an extended surface of soil ; for the advantage of cheap land and new soils is balanced by the scarcity of labor and the cost of transportation , while the very state of things which renders agricultural labor abundant and transportation unexpensive , enhances in the same proportion the cost of land and the remuneration of the capitalist . The third case is , that of nations similarly circumstanced as to the supply of capital and labor . Were there two countries occupying this relative position , protection against each other need have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exacted of each other might be adjusted with sole reference to the needs of government . Yet even in this last case , it is conceivable that free trade might lead to injurious and wasteful results . To designate two nations occupying this mutual position by the letters A and B , A may now produce or manufacture commodities , which B might produce or manufacture at the same cost , and vice versd . But priority of habit has s*onfined the industry of A within a certain range , and that of B within a different range . The vis inertke operates upon the enterprise of each of the two nations . Each is contented with a prompt and constant supply of the commodities produced ' exclusively by the other . A thousand leagues of ocean lie between A and B. Several thousand seamen and a large amount of maritime capital are constantly occupied in interchanging their commodities . Did each produce or manufacture the commodities which it now derives from the other , their passage from the producer to the consumer would demand but one tenth of the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry are then wasted , and nine tenths of that capital are unproductively employed . Let A produce the commodities which B supplies , and vice vers2 , and those commodities will be supplied to each nation in greater abundance and at less cost ; and by the concentration upon productive industry of the labor and capital now withdrawn from it , ( for needless transportation is the same as if so much labor was paralyzed and so much money thrown into the ocean , ) the wealth of each nation is proportionally enhanced . Therefore , free trade between any two nations demands one of two conditions . They should , either , in the first place , be similarly circumstanced , not only as to the capacity , but as to the actual state of productive industry ; or , in the second place , they should lie in such proximity to each other that the mutual interchange of commodities should involve no waste of labor and capital . This last condition suggests the inquiry , whether there are not cases , in which commercial intercourse should be adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are geographically units , with strongly marked boundaries of mountain , sea , or river , and with distinguishing peculiarities of climate , soil , industrial habits , and social economy . Thus , England , France , and Spain are as unlike in all the elements of national character , internal organization , and material prosperity , as if they were in different zones or hemispheres . Other independent states are united in groups by a community of character , habits , productions , and mercantile relations with the rest of the world . This is manifestly the case with the kingdoms and principalities of Italy , and with most of the members of the Germanic Confederation . There is often no intrinsic reasen why a certain territory should he under several distinct governments , rather than under one . Hence the strong yearning in such instances among patriotic citizens for centralization - the national party in perpetual antagonism with local authorities . The true ground of complaint in these cases is not the separate government over a portion of the territory . This , of itself , is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small state is the more likely to be paternal in its administration , is the more amenable to the good-will of its subjects , and l ) resents a larger proportion of stimulants and rewards to individual // ambition . The great evil is the bristling of the frontier of every petty state with custom-houses , the surveillance of an omnipresent army of impertinent revenue officers , the multiplication of annoying restrictions on intercourse and trade upon routes which nature indicates as unembarrassed highways of travel and commerce . These hinderances are rendered the more harassing and grievous by the extension of railroads and of steam navigation , by the habits of despatch which have grown so rapidly upon the whole business world , and by the increased proportional sacrifice of time and money involved in arresting any operation of trade between its outset and its terminus . Then , too , as regards foreign commerce , different regulations among contiguous and closely allied states must needs give some the advantage over others , and must therefore foster growing discontent among the less favored . The Zoll-Verein , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the evils of a political union , and must , in the same proportion , weaken the party of nationality , and strengthen the several local administrations . This principle was held in view in the formation of our national union . Each of the sovereign States had , prior to the Confederation , the right to make and enforce its own commercial regulations ; and there is no political reason why a cordon of custom-houses might not extend along all our State lines . There might have been a central legislature , judiciary , and executive , without the cession to the General Government of jurisdiction over commerce . This undoubtedly would have been the case , had our States been separated by strongly-defined geographical boundaries , by tangible differences of race and character , or by dissimilar material interests . This latter ground of separation does indeed exist between the extreme northern and southern members of the Confederation ; but in passing from State to State , the transition is hardly appreciable . There are no two contiguous States , between which commercial restrictions and differences would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between adjacent counties in the same State . And among the safeguards of our Union , we doubt whether more confident reliance is to be placed on any , than on the difficulty of so drawing a line of separation that there should not be injurious restrictions on a commerce naturally free . On the other 15* // hand , were our territory divided between two or more separate confederations , free trade alone could prevent their fusion into one . In what we have said , we have had in view the now mooted question of commercial reciprocity between the United States and the British North American Colonies . That those Colonies are not members of our Confederation seems a mere accident of political history . Had they been earlier under the supremacy of Great Britain , they would not have been in her possession now . But at the period of the American Revolution , the French , who are the most contented of subjects under any government not their own , were still , in Canada at least , the predominant race . They have been gradually declining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whatever race is placed in close proximity with scions from the Anglo-Saxon stock . In that same proportion have the inhabitants of the Provinces become assimilated with the people of the States in industry , enterprise , intelligence , and the love of liberty , while personal intercourse and political sympathy have established numerous grounds of common sentiment and interest . Nova Scotia presents the chief exception to this remark , and that mainly on the score of the numerous Loyalists from the revolted Colonies , who occupied high places of trust and honor in that Province , and have diffused and transmitted the antipathies engendered by their forced exile and the confiscation of their estates . Between Canada and the United States , the quasi national union is every day becoming closer and stronger . Among our most frequented routes of summer travel are those which cross the Niagara at the Falls , traverse Lake Ontario , descend the St. Lawrence , or reach Montreal by Lake Champlain and the intervening railroad . The pleasure excursions , which for the last two or three years have been organized on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Toronto , Montreal , and Quebec . On the other hand , Boston and New York have been becoming the chief emporia of Canadian travel and business ; nor are there any of our watering places , in which Canadian guests are not found in growing numbers . These bonds of mutual intercourse have favored joint enterprises for more easy intercommunication , such as could never have been projected , had not a strong // feeling of international union given the first impulse . These various railroad lines , which are to connect Portland , Boston , and New York , and , through them , numerous other cities , with Montreal and Quebec , are constantly bringing our citizens and the citizens of the Provinces into the closest financial relations . At the festivals , which mark the successive stages of these works , equal zeal is manifested on both sides the frontier ; and the language of the Provincials indicates , on their part , a sense of property in whatever commercial advantages our markets and harbors may afford , - a growing disposition to take our ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old World . The European and North American railroad , when constructed , must produce a reciprocal posture of affairs as regards our steam navigation to and from the British islands , making the easternmost port of Nova Scotia the entrepot of our speediest communication with England . This same railroad , in its facilities for way travel and traffic , will extend a cordon of fraternal intercourse from our Atlantic cities through New Brunswick and Nova Scotia , making the inhabitants of those Provinces our near neighbors , and obliterating the remnants of hostile feeling , which are already concentrating themselves in the eastern peninsula , on their way to oblivion . The community of interests and pursuits between our Northern States and the Provinces is so entire , as scarcely to admit a line of demarcation . The agricultural products of the Provinces are identical with our own . Canada furnishes wheat-soils , only less fertile than the newly reclaimed terri* tory of our western States . The lumber trade in its various branches identifies Maine with her British . neighbors , and imprints the same intensely defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fisheries not only afford employment for a large amount of industry and enterprise both in the Provinces and in the northern States , but the preferred fishing grounds are , in part , the same for English and American citizens . There are also strong bonds of political sympathy between the colonists and ourselves , - stronger , in fact , than unite them with the mother country . They have the AngloSaxon love of freedom and impatience of a foreign yoke , however legitimate and however light . They have taken many // of the first steps which we took toward political emancipation , - probably the only steps that we should have taken , had ours been met like theirs hy concessions on the part of the English government . Great Britain has found it impossible to keep them in leading-strings , and has purchased , we sincerely trust , the permanence of her nominal sovereignty by making it little more than nominal . The extended jurisdiction and important functions of their local parliaments render them virtually their own rulers ; for the veto power , though vested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of such enactments as were feebly seconded by the popular voice . They are , therefore , for all practical purposes , our brother republicans , and , as such , they look to us for their examples in legislation and administration . All these circumstances create a strong fellow-feeling , strongest of course on the frontier , but thence propagated with increasing rapidity with the growing facilities of intercommunication* And it is this fellow-feeling that renders commercial restrictions not only oppressive and vexatious , but easy of evasion , and inoperative in proportion to their rigidness and minuteness . In such a posture of affairs , the revenue laws sit lightly upon the general conscience . Smuggling becomes an act of self-defence , or even of heroic patriotism . Contraband trade multiplies its subterfuges faster than they can be ferreted out and suppressed , and thus deranges the course , and puts at hazard the profits , of legitimate business . Especially must this be the case , when the two states lie open to each other , not alone through the few ports of a rock-bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The amount of commodities annually smuggled across our northern and northeastern boundary defies estimate , and is accounted largest by those nearest to the scene of operation ; nor could it be essentially checked without a standing army , or an imported company of Austrian revenue officers . Indeed , there are forms of contraband commerce , which are daily conducted under the very eyes , and with the tacit consent , of the officers of the customs , and the attempt to suppress which would lead to open rebellion . While these considerations have great weight in favor of reciprocity , there is no branch of industry in the United States which needs protection against the British Provinces . // Were importation thence entirely free , it would consist , almost solely , either of such commodities as are furnished from our own resources in a rapidly decreasing quantity , or of such as , on account of the large proportion of their freight to their value , will not bear a distant transportation . The products of the forest in ' this country are fast dwindling to the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon be dependent on those vast northern regions , where the axe may be plied for a century to come without overtaking the reproductive energies of nature , and where , for reasons inherent in the climate , the encroachments of population upon the countless leagues of forest must always be slow . The sterility of the soil in the insular and peninsular portions of the Provinces must ever render the fisheries an essential department of their industry . On the other hand , the steady progress of the smaller manufactures and the growing needs of our merchant service , have , for the last thirty years , been constantly diverting New England capital from the fisheries , and rendering it more and more difficult to furnish crews for the vessels that still remain in that business . And when we consider how much greater are the exposures and privations incurred in the Bay of Fundy and on the Bank of Newfoundland by our fishermen than by those whose homes are almost within hailing distance of the fishing-grounds , - for how small a portion of the year our vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettled habits of life their crews are liable during the residue of their time , - it could hardly be a subject of regret , if , in this department , the competition of the Provinces in our markets should be as successful as they could desire . Bituminous coal is found in the United States , east of the Alleghanies , in quantities too small to bear any appreciable relation to the demand ; while the transportation from the great Western basin is too costly , and the demand within that basin too large and too rapidly increasing , to render that a source of supply for the Atlantic States . Under whatever restrictions , we must depend on the inexhaustible mines of Nova Scotia ; and the free importation from them would essentially diminish the cost both of subsistence and of manufacture . The Nova Scotia coal is especially fitted for use in puddling furnaces ; and its free introduction would therefore tend in one department to relieve the depressed condition of // the iron interest . Gypsum is another commodity which distant transportation renders too costly for use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England , the most efficient of all fertilizing agents ; while it must be procured chiefly from the Provinces . Its free introduction , then , can he only a source of gain and a stimulus to agricultural enterprise , without establishing a competition that can be injuriously felt in any quarter . As regards the lighter , more elaborate , and more valuable kinds of manufactured articles , there are ample reasons why the British colonists can not , for a long time to come , compete with us in their own markets , and can never undersell us or depreciate our goods in our ports . It has till recently been the policy of Great Britain , to keep her colonies in entire dependence on herself as to commodities of these descriptions ; and under the present more liberal regime , established industrial habits retain almost the force of laws , so that the children prefer the investments of labor , skill , and capital under which their fathers prospered . But to whatever extent the Provincials may become manufacturers , it is impossible that the wages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard . Wages are determined , first , by the intelligence and self-respect of the laborer , which fix the kind and degree of subsistence which he is in a position to need and claim ; secondly , by the relation of demand and supply in the labor market ; and , thirdly , by the greater or less ease with which the operative can become an independent proprietor . In the first particular , while the standard of intelligence and refinement among our native population is perhaps higher than among our neighbors under the British crown , they are rapidly following our steps as to popular education , and they receive much smaller proportional accessions than we do of a degraded foreign population , whose brutish habits of living have a direct tendency to reduce the price of labor to what will furnish the discomfort , smoke , and rags of a shanty . As to the relation of demand and supply , this same influx of foreigners tends to glut our labor-market in comparison with theirs . Then , too , their vast tracts of unimproved , but improvable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long after the eligible portions of our public lands shall have been purchased and occupied . The probability therefore is , that , even for centuries to come , our manu // factures , so far from being affected by Provincial competition , may be the readiest and cheapest sources of supply for the British citizens of North America . Let us now examine in detail the actual and potential relations of the several British possessions to the United States . Canada exports to the United States lumber , grain , and wool . The value of the lumber received through the Lakes is not less than a million of dollars annually . The markets on the Hudson derive from this source from one third to one half of their supply . Even in Michigan , the chief lumber State west of the Alleghanies , the demand outstrips the capacities of the remaining forests , and is largely fed from Canada . The Canadian trade in grain and wool is confined chiefly to localities near the frontier ; and , while it is the basis of a mutually convenient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or price , produce any appreciable effect upon the traffic in those commodities as furnished from our own soil . Our exports to Canada consist chiefly of tobacco , sugar , molasses , maize , pork , salt , manufactures of cotton , wool , and wood , and such foreign commodities as tea , coffee , wines , hides , and dried fruits ; most of them articles derived in much larger quantities from Great Britain , or by means , of British vessels , but which , under favorable regulations , might be furnished almost wholly from our ports . The total exports of Canada to the United States exceed six millions of dollars annually , and are wholly paid for by our productions , manufactures , and imports . The surplus products of Canada already find their most convenient outlet to the ocean through the ports of the United States . At certain seasons , and for many localities , the Erie and Champlain canals offer the best means of transportation , both as to safety and cheapness . The Ogdensburg and Erie railroads , and the railways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce from the Lakes , and without transshipment , deliver it at the emporia of our commerce . To these routes , the Montreal and Portland railroad will soon be added . New Brunswick and Nova Scotia export chiefly lumber , gypsum , coal , grindstones , and the produce of the fisheries . In return , they must import not only manufactured and foreign commodities , but by far the greatest portion of their breadstuffs . In the article of flour , they have been among the // best customers of the United States , next only to Brazil . But the course of trade is now changed . The natural productions of Canada are admitted free into these provinces , while flour from the United States is subject to a duty of from twenty-five to seventy-five cents per barrel . Consequently Canada flour obtains the preference , and the Canada vessels , which carry breadstuffs to Halifax or St. John , are loaded with return cargoes of sugar , molasses , and other foreign commodities , which were formerly purchased , and , but for commercial restrictions , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prince Edward 's island , though chiefly an agricultural colony , and raising a surplus of some descriptions of farm produce , is dependent in great part on commerce for its breadstuffs , and may , by suitable commercial regulations , be made mainly dependent for them on the United States . Newfoundland furnishes no articles of export except the produce of her fisheries , - seal skins and furs , obtained principally from Labrador . For breadstuffs , manufactured goods , and foreign commodities , she is even now a customer of the United States to the annual amount of a million of dollars , though her exports to the United States are hardly worth a tenth part of that sum , or a fortieth part of her entire exports . Whether this trade shall be doubled on the one side and increased ten or twenty-fold on the other , or whether it shall dwindle and disappear , depends on the removal or the continuance of the present restrictions . The population of the British North American Colonies now exceeds two millions , and is steadily increasing , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than that of the Middle and Western States of our Union . Their industrial capacities are unlimited . They furnish the best localities in the world for the cod and herring fisheries . Their deposits of bituminous coal and gypsum are inexhaustible . Their forests abound in the finest timber , and will hardly seem less rich a century hence than now . A very large portion of their soil is of the highest order of productiveness . In facilities for ocean , lake , and river navigation , they are second to no other region of similar extent . if they shall ever support a manufacturing population , their affluence of fuel and their unlimited amount of water power may // place them , in this regard , on a level with the most favored nation on either continent . Climate , habit , and the growing ascendency of the hardy Anglo-Saxon stock , render their inhabitants industrious and enterprising to an almost unprecedented degree . At the same time , the limited range of their products must always keep them dependent on importation for a very large proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every class , and for numerous descriptions of raw material whenever they shall become manufacturers to any considerable extent . So long as they are under the British crown , their commercial intercourse with Great Britain will take place on the freest and most favorable terms . But if they are admitted to our own ports on similar terms , their commerce will be spared the risks of ocean navigation , and the greatly enhanced outlay of capital and labor involved in the transportation of merchandise from continent to continent . A coasting trade involves but a small fraction of the expenditure necessitated by European traffic . Other things being equal , commerce left free will gravitate towards the nearest markets . By a recent act of the Imperial Parliament* the crown duties previously levied are abolished in those colonies which , through their local legislatures , exercise the power of enacting their own tariff of duties . The franchise thus granted has been exercised by all the North American colonies . They have abolished , for the present , all discriminating duties to the disadvantage of American manufactures , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain . Under the former regime , the carrying trade between our southern ports and Great Britain was reduced to the most beggarly standard of profit by the crowding competition of English ships . A ship might be laden at Liverpool with manufactured goods for a British Not'th American port , and thence take a cargo of lumber to the West Indies , or even to one of our own southern ports . These two operations furnished a sufficient profit for the voyage , and the ship could afford to return in ballast . Under such circumstances , a cotton freight for a halfpenny a pound was not to be despised ; since , with but little delay , it would defray the expenses of the . homeward voyage , and might leave a balance Gf a hundred or two of pounds of clear profit* Our ships , dependent almost // wholly on the freight of cotton for the income of their voyages , were thus cut down to one third or one fourth of their former prices ; and during some years , it required the closest calculation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyages ; while a very low interest on the capital invested was procured only by those vessels that could take advantage of the most unhealthy season , or of some fluctuation in the price of cotton , which led to unusually hurried shipments . The advantage of the threefold voyage , together with free entry to all colonial ports , ( whereas , until the recent change in policy , only a few ports , and those not the best entrepots for the carrying trade , were open to our vessels , ) is now enjoyed by our shipping ; and , not only so , but during periods of stagnation in the shipment of cotton , some of our largest and most costly ships have made remunerating freights by the transportation of lumber from the colonies to Great Britain . Should not our government respond to the earnest wish of the now dominant party in Canada for relations of commercial reciprocity , it is more than probable that the former duties and restrictions will be reimposed by the Canadian and other Provincial legislatures . Such a measure is urgently sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and holds a foremost place in the budget of the leaders of the opposition in the Canadian Parliament . In connection with a return to the restrictive policy , the expediency of closing all the Canadian canals to vessels of the United States is agitated by the opposition , and regarded with no small measure of favor . It is contended , that the present commercial arrangements on the part of Canada throw most of her trade into the hands of our citizens without any countervailing benefit to her interests ; while , by the exclusive use of her own canals , she might force through the St. Lawrence , in British bottoms , even a large portion of our western produce , which now finds its way through Oswego and Ogdensburg to Boston and New York . In this case , an incalculable injury would be inflicted equally on our lake ports and our railroad interests . We have spoken of the effect produced 6n our carrying trade by the partial removal of restrictions through the action of the Provincial legislatures . The commerce between the United States and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The value of goods exported from Boston alone to the Provinces , during the present year , will exceed a million of dollars , ( about one fourth consisting of foreign goods purchased of course by the earnings of home industry , and the residue of domestic produce and manufactures , ) all which has been paid for , with immaterial exceptions , by commodities for which we are necessarily , or may be advantageously , dependent upon our British neighbors . For instance , during the first three quarters of the present year , not a bushel of wheat or barrel of flour has been entered at Boston from either of the Provinces ; while the return cargoes furnish an exhibit of ship-bread manufactured from our home-grown flour to the value of nearly thirty thousand dollars . Two thousand dollars will cover the amount of wool received during the same period , - a quantity which is wholly unworthy of account , as affecting in any degree our domestic wool market . On the other hand , there has been imported from the Provinces into Boston pine wood , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own forests , ) to the value of thirty thousand dollars , which will be doubled during the remaining quarter , coal to the value of more than ninety thousand dollars , and plaster to the amount of ten thousand dollars . During the same period , the entries , as also the clearances , of Provincial vessels have averaged between four and five per diem , representing a very large proportion of the revenue of labor , truckage , wharfage , and storage earned by the commerce of the city . We have not before us the returns for the years preceding 1843 , when the differential duties were first removed in Canada ; but it must be obvious , to any one acquainted with the business of Boston , that in this department the increase has been proportionally greater than in any other description of foreign commerce . In the Lake ports , the change is even more obvious and striking . The duties received at Toronto have risen from thirty thousand to four hundred thousand dollars within the last eight years ; similar results would be derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the line . And all this has taken place , notwithstanding a heavy duty on our side , averaging twentythree and a half per cent . on the principal articles of importation , and a counter duty on our exports averaging twelveand // a half per cent . in Canada , and not materially differing , though somewhat lower , in the other Provinces . When we consider that Great Britain still enjoys by far the larger part of the Provincial commerce , it hardly needs to be said that more equally reciprocal duties would add largely to the amount of mercantile intercourse in this direction , while reciprocally free trade in the commodities mutually needed could scarcely fail to reverse , in this regard , the relations of Great Britain and the United States . On the other hand , the restoration of differential duties on our manufactures would be seriously felt to the detriment of our great commercial cities , while it would be absolutely disastrous to the lake and river ports , both the Canadian and our own . The first movement towards a reciprocally free trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , and was occasioned by the withdrawal of all protection by the home government for colonial produce , in 1846 . Colonial tiniber and wheat were thus brought in British markets into a losing competition with timber from the Baltic , and wheat from the Black Sea and the Danube ; whereas , previously , the enhanced wages of labor and cost of transportation had been more than balanced by discriminating duties in favor of the colonies . The effect was to impart added speed and strength to the current of commercial intercourse , which the legislation of 1843 had already directed towards our own shores . Shortly al'ter this , a delegation was sent from Canada to arrange terms of reciprocity between that government and ours . The scheme was regarded with great favor by the administration , and a bill , abolishing duties on the chief staples of Canadian produce , on condition of a similarly free admission of the agricultural products of the United States , passed the House of Representatives , and , with but little opposition in the Senate , was lost there , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions of Congress , delegates have been sent to Washington for this same purpose from all the Provinces , except Newfoundland . This last named Province depends for its revenue to a great degree on the duty upon breadstuffs , and has therefore been reluctant to enter into the arrangement . But its revenue at present considerably exceeds the expenses of its government ; and should the products of the fisheries be admitted into the // arrangement for reciprocity , it would forfeit much greater advantages by the free admission of these products from the other Provinces into our ports , and the continuance of a twenty per cent . duty on these same products when imported from Newfoundland , than it could gain by retaining its present tariff . This consideration , it is believed , has already changed the disposition of the government of that island , and public opinion among its enlightened citizens , to such a degree that there will no longer be a dissentient voice among the Provincial legislatures . In the history of these negotiations and efforts thus far , it s worthy of remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was introduced by an eminent and farsighted merchant , and that the policy which it advocated has been constantly gaining favor with the mercantile community . But it is of at least equal , if not superior , importance to our manufacturing interests . Whatever may be the weight of argument by which higlt.protective duties on foreign manufactures might be recommended , it is morally certain that they can never be reimposed in this country . Nor , if they could be , would their restoration be desirable ; for experience has shown us , that protection under our governrient , while it may last long enough to put a vast amount of **apital at hazard , is sure to be abrogated before the manu*ctures , which it has nursed into being , have reached selfsustaining maturity . A fluctuating tariff is more to be clLeaded than one which defies every law of political econ**y , and every rule of right ; for the energy of a growing p&amp;ple can sustain and surmount any obstacles that can be criculated and provided against , but may be crippled and prostrated by perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all hands , that our present tariff is i:iadequate . In order to render it protective in its working&amp;* where it is so ostensibly , the substitution of specific for ad valorem duties is essential ; and of this , notwithstanding th' repeated recommendation of the Executive , the prospect is too remote to he relied upon . It therefore concerns our pianufacturers to seek such protection as they can procure , rather than to pursue the shadow of a brief past , which may never again become substance . Now , the two modes most readily open to them through national legislation are the cheapening of materials and the multiplying of outlets for their goods . 16* // There is one important particular , in which the first of these ends may be attained by the measures which we are now advocating . A person , who has not had his attention expressly directed to the subject , can hardly be aware of the bearing of a free lumber trade on almost every description of manufacture , and especially on that of cheap goods . To say nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , which , in New En0land alone , would demand the annual felling of a forest of no mean dimensions , an irnmense amount of deal and other lumber is consumed in rollers for cotton goods , spools for thread , cotton and yarns , boxes for packing , and the like . There are manufactures , in which a saving in this article alone would have created an appreciable profit during the recent period of stagnation and revulsion . But of immeasurably greater importance is the opening of new markets , or the more complete occupancy of markets already opened for our manufactures . And we can become sellers only in the proportion in which we become purchasers . We can command other markets only in the proportion in wh*h we render our own attractive . Our best customers will *e those who can make the best bargain with us for their own v*ares . It was this policy , that induced the British government to withdraw their protection from the wheat and lumber ofthe North American colonies . This alone , and no merely Pilanthropic agitation , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph of the free trade party . By these measures , Great Britain has indeed lost her certain hold on ti* trade of these few Provinces ; but in return has acquired the almost unrivalled control of the whole world besides . Her 1-or*s are the best markets for European and for ocean commen*e of almost every description . But so unexpensive is the coa*ting trade as compared with transatlantic navigation , that w* can , if we will , make our own ports the best markets for 4hcse colonies . They manufacture almost nothing ; and yet are consumers of manufactured goods to as large an amount as any *wo millions of people in the world . Our manufacturing indus*y is still increasing , though with diminished outlets for its products , and with a powerful British rivalry in our own markets . Factories are springing up , not only in the elder of our young sisterhood of western States , but in the South , where it was until recently deemed // impracticable to employ slave labor in the finer processes of manufacture . The discovery of the equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water power was deemed essential , is peopling many of our maritime cities and towns with a manufacturing population . It is surely , then , for our highest interest to accede to the terms of those , who will become our constant buyers , if we will only be theirs . The entire surplus products of the British Provinces might be absorbed in our commerce , without lowering the prices or slackening the sale of any staple of our own production . That entire surplus may be poured in upon us , almost without reservation , if we will admit it free of duty . The stimulus thus given to their industry will increase their population , - will , in even a greater ratio , enhance their ability to become purchasers , and thus furnish a vent for our manufactures , which may grow with their growth , and may do much towards preventing in future that accumulation of unsalable commodities which has , time and again , paralyzed the productive energy of our people , and which now is keeping thousands of potential producers in beggarly idleness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the products of the soil between the British Provinces and the United States is reciprocity only in name . Our purchases of them will consist almost entirely of natural products , while their purchases of us will comprise but a small proportion of such products , and will consist chiefly of manufactured goods . Will not , then , the free admission of our manufactures , at least of the cheaper and more needed , be essential to reciprocity on a fair basis ? We reply , that it is immaterial to our interests whether our manufactures are admitted into the Provinces free , or only on the same terms with those of Great Britain . In the latter case , our goods are relatively free ; for our nearness to the colonial markets gives us a double advantage over the mother country . In the first place , it essentially diminishes the cost of transportation ; and , secondly , it enables merchants to adapt their exports in kind and amount to the condition and needs of markets with which they can hold instantaneous communication , arid thus pr&amp;* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incident to all distant commerce , and of which the recent history of the California trade has multiplied examples . By // making it for the interest of our colonial neighbors to frequent our markets as sellers , we insure the disposal of our manufactures in exchange for their produce , whatever may be the provisions of their several tariffs . But their governments are sustained chiefly by import duties ; and if we sell them all that we can , they must either retain their duties on a portion of our commodities , or must take the lead , ( which it would be absurd to expect of dependent administrations , ) in meeting the expense of their civil and military list by direct taxation . But while it is a matter of comparative indifference whether our manufactured goods , which need encounter no competition , are duty free or not , there are at least two of our staples of native growth , which enter largely into the colonial trade , and which need the freedom from duty proposed in the contemplated arrangement , in order that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same article in the Provinces themselves . To one of these , wheat , we have already alluded , and have shown that the introduction of Canada wheat duty free into the eastern Provinces is injuriously affecting the commerce of the United States . The other of these articles is pork , which is the principal food of the lumbering population , and can he produced in the western States at less cost than anywhere else in the world . The duty now paid on pork in Canada and New Brunswick swells the price of the lumber which we import thence ; so that we actually reimburse the greater portion of the revenue collected on this article , besides encouraging to a certain extent its production in those Provinces , which , in this regard , can not compete with our western valley , except under the protection of a heavy duty . It may be objected to the proposed measures of reciprocity , that they will occasion a loss of revenue to the United States . The President 's recent message furnishes a direct answer to this objection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by twenty millions of dollars , all the estimated expenditures , and by thirty millions , all the ordinary expenses of government ; while the entire public debt is but little more than seventy millions , the greater part of which is redeemable only after a term of years . The evil to which we are exposed , then , is the accu // mulation , of a surplus revenue , which , on the one hand , invites to profligate and wasteful measures of expenditure or distribution , or , on the other , facilitates the extension of an aggressive military policy , and tends to nourish whatever germs of dissension may grow into future wars . Under this posture of affairs , were the proposed reciprocity to issue in a much greater loss of revenue than can possibly ensue , we would advocate it on that very ground . But a single million would cover the entire deficit that could result from this source ; and even this would be more than balanced by the increased revenue of our manufacturing industry , by the thence augmented consumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree to which we should furnish the provinces with the fruits of our transatlantic commerce . This last item merits a separate consideration . The time was , within the memory of many of our readers , when every maritime town on our sea-board had a direct trade with Great Britain , France , Russia , and the West Indies ; and when several of our second-rate towns were extensively engaged in the East India trade . All this business now centres in our few great commercial emporia . Instead of keeping large capitals at hazard , and incurring the risk of importing unsalable stocks , and of glutting a market of small capacity , the merchants of our lesser towns and cities find it for their advantage to resort to the nearest great mqrket , and to purchase foreign commodities in such quantities as may satisfy existing demands . The Provincial merchants , in their direct intercourse with the mother country , are exposed to the disadvantages which have driven our own foreign commerce from so many of its former marts . They will find it for their interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance which alone is needed for a profitable trade where importation is heavy and sales certain , rather than to incur the large investments , the certainty of slow returns , and the risk of ultimate loss , which are all involved in their becoming or continuing their own importers . The reciprocally free trade , in behalf of which we have entered our earnest plea , may not unaptly be urged as a compromise measure , tending , without sacrifice of sound principle or policy , to mediate between the protectionist and // the free-trade parties . Under the present tariff , iron , though charged with a duty of thirty per cent. , receives less protection than any other commodity whatever . The reason is this . The intrinsic worth of the same raw material varies but little between country and country , or between continent and continent . The same manufactured article , however , must vary in price between country and country , in the compound ratio of the wages of labor and the relative amount of labor expended in its production . Now , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes no less than seventy-five per cent. , so that the existing duty of twentyfive per cent. , ( with the added advantage of lower freightage of our cotton , ) if not evaded by fraudulent invoices , is more than enough for protection , - nay , would yield full protection , did the English manufacturers work gratuitously . On the other hand , iron ore has hardly an appreciable value . In its crude state , it would not sell for enough to pay the cost of a hundred miles ' transportation ; and the most productive mine would be abandoned , were there not fuel close at hand to work it . Thus the cost of iron is almost all labor ; and this is the reason why Great Britain , with her always glutted labor market , can undersell our iron manufacturers , and why , in the general grounds of preference for a low tariff , iron may be fairly deemed to constitute an exceptional case . But Pennsylvania , in claiming protection for this fundamental item of her resources , encounters opposition , not from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protectionists , who are unwilling to extend to a single article measures within which she would embrace all American manufactures . Especially has this feeling been exhibited in New England , whose cotton manufactures are in an equally depressed condition with the iron interest of Pennsylvania . It is pertinent , in this connection , to refer to the fact that New England , ( including the Champlain district of New York , ) has , under the impulse of remunerating prices , 1 ) produced forty thousand tons of pig-iron per annum , an amount lar* , er than that produced by the whole of Great Britain at the time of the American Revolution . But not to insist on this bond of common interest between Pennsylvania and New England , what our coarser cottons need is an outlet rather than protection , - a larger market beyond our own borders , not dimi // nished competition within them . The cotton interest might then deem itself sufficiently provided for hy measures which should throw fully open the Provincial market , and might thus be induced to lend its advocacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , in the one article of iron , the free-trade party may see cause to relax the rigidness of their economical creed , if this concession he enot regarded as an entering wedge for others . Thus may the cotton and the iron interests unite in measures for their joint resuscitation and prosperity ; while , if both insist on the same mode of relief , and that a general tariff on a high scale of protection , they may remain prostrate for half a century in their worse than Mezentian emhrace . We have thus far confined ourselves to mercantile and financial considerations . The subject before us involves political interests of no less weight , and perhaps of more immediately urgent importance . The annexation of the British Provinces to the United States is at present strongly agitating the public mind , especially in Canada . So vast is the British body politic , that the circulation grows faint and cold at its extremities . It is not of extortion , vexatious intermeddling , or any form of step-motherly tyranny that the Provinces complain ; but of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , - of being satellites that can never emerge from the penumbra of their primary planet . Their separate administrations are necessarily feeble , and the Jrnperial government has made their weakness more painfully apparent by the very measures which have rendered them , to so great a degree , virtually independent . Their material interests are in part identical , in part reciprocal , with our own . They belong to our mercantile system . This is believed and felt , almost without dissent , in Canada , and by the greater part of the leading and controlling minds in the other Provinces . The only question is , whether the identity shall be recognized , and the reciprocity effected by political amalgamation , or by terms of close mercantile alliance The latter is , of course , the policy advocated by official persons , as also by the majority of the influential citizens of the Provinces . The annexation party , however , is by no means weak in talent , character , or influence ; and in its ranks may be found some , who are opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground that it will give general contentment and satisfaction , and will postpone , perhaps to a far distant day , the political union which they desire . Now , on this very ground , would we , as friends of the Union of these States , advocate the proposed reciprocity of commerce . We deprecate the growth of the annexation movement . We can contemplate it in no aspect , in which it is not fraught with difficulty and peril . It is hardly conceivable , that a peaceful secession from British rule would be suffered by the home-government ; or , were it so , that the secession could take place without disturbing the pacific and friendly relations now existing between that government and ours . Nor could this subject he seriously discussed within our own borders , except through the rekindlin * , from the scarcely quiet embers , with wilder fierceness than at any former period , of the fires of sectional jealousy and animosity . The South would insist on Mexico and Cuba as a counterpoise to the accession of northern territory ; while the philanthropic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keen , frosty air from beyond the Lakes , would spurn , with more vehement indignation than now , an extension of the domain of slavery . In fine , we can conceive of no farther annexation of territory , northward or southward , as consistent with the integrity of the Union . With any serious disturbance of its present balance of forces , it must either explode into unsphered fragments , or must break in sunder from the mutual strain of those weights so dissilient as already to stretch the elastic cord of the confederation to its utmost tension . We trust , therefore , that questions of this sort may still be pushed into that future , in which Time will , as of yore , devour his own children , and among them , not a few of the problems with which we dare not grapple , and the perplexities through which we can find no clew ; - or rather , that they may be committed to that Providence , supreme over the affairs of nations as of individual man , which , in marvellous ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brink of fearful rapids , and opens a safe and quiet channel for its flow . If , then , the desired reciprocity will stave off the annexation question , as we believe that it wiU , we feel that , in all that we have written , we have alleged no stronger argument than this in its behalf . // For all these reasons , we rejoice that the President , in his Message , has commended this subject to the action of the present Congress , as a subject for legislation rather than for treaty ; and are gratified to learn , through the same and other sources , that the British minister at Washington has expressed the more than acquiescence , the strong desire , of his government , that reciprocally free trade may be established between the States and the Provinces . There are other measures , closely connected with commercial reciprocity , in the minds of both parties , and in the interests of one or both , on which a cortcurrent action of Congress may be anticipated . One of these is the free navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brunswick , which have their head waters partly in Maine , but reach the ocean through British territory ; and especially of the St. Lawrence , as the natural outlet of the Lake navigation . The immense trade of the northwestern States and Territories has been forced through the Erie Canal , making the procession of boats through its whole extent as continuous as that of carriages through the heart of a great city ; while , crowded to the uttermost degree , it still leaves large accumulations of goods at every principal landing , and is never closed by ice without arresting a great amount of merchandise midway between its termini . There is now , on the great Lakes , not far from eight million dollars ' worth of shipping in the employ of citizens of the United States , and running to and from different points of a coast three thousand miles in extent . The Lakes are navigable for only seven months in the year . A full fourth part of this shipping is well adapted for ocean navigation , and might be profitably employed during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the Atlantic , thus virtually adding three thousand miles to our sea-coast . Our western wheat , could it be directly transported , might compete , in the British market , with that from the Danube and the Black Sea . Cleveland is a thousand miles nearer than Odessa to Liverpool . During the last two sessions , Congress was flooded with memorials from the legislatures , and with petitions from numerous bodies of citizens of the northwest , praying that measures be taken to procure the free navigation of the St. Lawrence . Many writers on the law of nations maintain , that a navigable river flowing in part through the VOL . LXXIV. - NO. *4t. 17 // territory of two nations , though disemboguing under the sole jurisdiction of one of the two , is of right a common highway for both . Many of our own most accomplished statesmen , among whom it is enough to cite John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay , have maintained the same principle , admitting , indeed , the right of the nation having sovereignty over the river 's mouth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the navigation of its lower waters . But it is more to our present purpose to state , that the British minister has already intimated the willingness of his government to concede the free navigation of the St. Lawrence , as one of a system of measures for the mutual advantage of the United States and the Colonies . Another measure , which appertains to the same system , concerns the lumber cut on lands belonging to Maine and Massachusetts on the head waters of the St. John , which now pays an export duty at its mouth . By the terms of the treaty of Washington , American lumber , floated to the ocean through waters under British jurisdiction , was to be treated as British lumber . The intent of the treaty on both sides was , that such lumber should he exported duty free , as was all British lumber at that time . But New Brunswick had sold the stumpage of her public lands at too low a rate to meet the charges of their management . To replace this deficit , an act passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but exempting that cut on territory of the United States . The bill was returned by the home government , with a requisition that it should be amended so as literally to conform to the terms of the treaty . This is a grievance demanding redress , and almost sure to receive it , if the wishes of the colonies and the parent government , as regards the pending commercial arrangements , are acceded to by Congress . Another subject , on which we need touch but cursorily , since it has been ably and thoroughly discussed in a former number of this Review , * is the sea and coast fisheries of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick . By the existing construction of treaties , our vessels are prohibited from taking , drying , or curing fish within three marine miles of any of the // colonial coasts , bays , harbors , and creeks , south of Newfoundland . This prohibition is relaxed as regards the Bay of Fundy alone , and that as a matter of courtesy , not of right . Our citizens are thus excluded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as from many of the conveniences and accommodations essential to the successful prosecution of every branch of fishing enterprise . These restrictions have , no doubt , been among the causes of the decline of our fisheries ; though , as we have intimated , we regard the superior attractiveness of less precarious and more continuous modes of industry as a more influential cause . But however this may be , the fisheries still are , and will be for many years to come , an important , even if a diminishing , department of New England enterprise , - a valuable nursery of seamen for our naval and mercantile service , and a fit object for legislative and executive protection on the part of our national government . Dried fish has , indeed , ceased to be a prominent staple of our foreign commerce ; nor can our own fisheries yield a sufficient supply even for our domestic consumption . The free introduction of the produce of the colonial fisheries can not glut our markets , or depreciate the value of the same articles as furnished by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , so earnestly desired for the products of the soil of the colonists , be extended to their maritime harvests , our fishermen must needs be admitted to equal rights with their own in their coasts and harbors , as an essential part of the policy which shall secure to their fishermen equal immunities with our own in our markets . In our discussion , we have labored chiefly to show the advantages which would accrue to the United States from the proposed measures of reciprocity , without entering at large on the grounds of benefit to the British Provinces from the same arrangement . This last work we are spared by the fact , that the initiative measures towards this result have been adopted by them with an urgency and perseverance , sufficiently indicating the magnitude of the interests which they have at stake in the issue . We do not believe in the possibility of one-sided mercantile advantages . The policy , which gives a temporary vantage-ground to one , exhausts and neutralizes itself by impoverishing and crippling the other party . In // the infancy of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trade , according to which the one of two nations which exported to the other more than it imported from it , and received the balance in specie , was the gainer , and the other the loser ; nor was it imagined that both parties could be benefited hy any commercial arrangement or treaty . The sole effort of diplomatists was , therefore , to outwit one another , and to throw dust into one another 's eyes . Thus , even in the peaceful transactions of traffic , nations occupied the position of mutual antagonists , were bristling with jeabusies , were on the watch for retaliatory movements , and expected gain only by a corresponding loss on the other side . The utter explosion of this doctrine marks one of the greatest advances in the science of political economy . It is now urnversally admitted by sound economists and statesmen , that no commercial arrangement can he permanently advantageous to one party without being so to both ; that the basis of virtual , when not of literal , reciprocity is the only solid groundwork of international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family of nations only offers an enlarged market for the industry , and an expanded field for the commerce , of every other . The recognition of these principles is fast girdling the earth with the zone of common interest , mutual good will , and reciprocal helpfulness . It is with no meaner view that we have filled these pages . We believe that we can not accede to the well-considered desires , and minister to the well-earned prosperity , of our neighbors under an allied sovereignty , ivithout exercising a charity which " blesses him that gives and him that takes . " The recent Railroad Jubilee in Boston was an occasion of intense importance , as regards both the past and the future . It marked the close of the era of divided interests , and of national self-consciousness in its exclusive and repulsive forms . It celebrated , as we trust , the birth of a quasi North American nationality , of which our country and British America will be equally proud to hear the name , to vindicate the honor , and enhance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under different pilotage , but with the same cynosure . The two parties to this alliance are already so closely wedded together by conmmnity of interest and intimacy of intercourse , nay , by the simultaneous flash of intelligence and sentiment through // the whole vast territory , that their relations must henceforth be only pacific , and more and more fraternal . A war which should involve them in mutual hostility would be fraught with all the atrocity of a civil conflict , and can hardly be deemed within the range of possible events . And the cob .. flies , as the pulsations of a common , social , and mercantile vitality beat through the veins of their and our joint body politic , are a hostage to insure our permanent peace with Great Britain , and , through her , with the whole European world . There are , at the present moment , urgent reasons why our republic should discharge her high mission , not by political propagandism or intermeddling , not by proffering or countenancing among other nations the infraction of that loyalty which she claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful and helpful intercourse whencesoever they may come , wherever they may reach . There is wisdom , both profound and timely , in the reiteration of Jefferson 's maxim by the President , in the Message just delivered : - " Friendly relations with all , but entangling alliances with none , has long been a maxim with us . Our true mission is not to propagate our opinions , or to impose upon other countries our form of government by artifice or force ; but to teach by example , and show by our success , moderation and justice , the blessings of self-government , and the advantages of free institutions . "
