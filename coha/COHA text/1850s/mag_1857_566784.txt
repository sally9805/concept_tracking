ART . V.-THE INDIAN QUESTION . Address delivered before the Alinnesotet historical Society ; at its sixth anniversary , February 1st , 1856 , by the ion . H. H. SIBLEY . Published in the Annals of the Society . The following article comes to us from an enlightened and experienced Missionary , who has spent many years in self-sacrificing labor among the Dakota Indians . He speaks of that which he has seen , and testifies that which he knows . We prefer that he should speak for himself in the singular number , instead of speaking for us , because on this subject his personal opinions , as well as his personal testimony , ought o he regarded as authority . Almost twenty years ago , when Minnesota had not received a name , the writer of this article went forth , far beyond the limits of civilization , to a region hardly more known than the interior of Africa is to-day . But the wave of emigration has overtaken him , and now the STATE OF MINNESOTA , with a free , intelligent , hardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country , and from all the hardiest and freest races of Europe , is forming its constitution and preparing to take its pii-aee among the sovereignties of the Union . Already Minnesotahas its great commercial metropolis , its nascent university , and , strange to say , its " Historical Society , " with published transactions . HAvE we reasons to expect that any efforts on our part will save our aboriginal tribes ? Or must they be given up as lost ? Will the wave of white population pass over them , and the places which now know them , know them no more forever ? Or can influences be brought so to bear upon them , that if as a race they become extinct , it will be by absorption rather than annihilation ? And what means are likely to produce desirable results in regard to them ? These are important questions , upon which we propose to throw some light , by examining the nature and tendencies of certain classes of influences which are already acting upon them . My remarks shall have especial reference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to look at // the influence of causes which have long been in operation , as well as those of more recent origin . First and foremost of those influences , external from themselves , which have been long operating upon the Dakotas , both for weal and for woe , is TIlE run TRAI ) E. In our inquiries in regard to the influence of the trade , we must , in justice , make a distinction in favor of the trader . An occupation may be pursued for years , or even generations , without those engaged in it ever realizing its full influence , either upon themselves or others . Take , for - example , the manufacture and sale of ardent spirits . Within the memory of most of us , that occupation was not considered dishonorable , nor even inconsistent with a credible profession of the religion of Jesus . And years of discussion were required to throw so much light on the question in regard to its resultant effects , as to place it even where it now is ; viz : that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his species at heart , can engage . The fur trader , as he comes before us now chiefly as an historical character , I am persuaded has been misunderstood and greatly misrepresented . Proverbially bold , daring , hardy , generous and hospitable , he has , like men in other conditions of life , been the child of circumstances . He has generally been what his surroundings have made him . The life he had to lead , the difficulties he had to encounter , the privations he had to endure , made him enduring and adventurous . The necessities of humanity often appealing , and not in vain , to his generosity , and Dakota customs lying in the same direction , educated his generous feelings . Other motives , with more of self in them , may have aided in producing the same result . Hospitality is a virtue of natural growth in frontier life . Let any man who values the society of his fellow men , be separated from them , and he will cordially welcome to his abode the stranger guests , and gladly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one think that in taking this view of the subject we detract from the character of these men . It is something that a man is not worse than his circumstances . Very few men rise // above them . Being personally acquainted with most of the men who have for the past twenty years been engaged in the trade with the Dakotas , on the Minnesota and Mississippi , and with some on the Missouri , I can say that in these respects their character is not different from the representation made of them by Hon. H. H. Sibley , in his annual address before the Minnesota Historical Society . Mr. Sibley 's opportunities for knowing and judging of this class of men , have hardly been surpassed by any one . To one acquainted with the circumstances and interests of an Indian trader , it seems strange that he should be suspected of encouraging wars between different tribes . The whole interests of his trade lead him to desire peace . When a party of young men go out to war , except it be in mid-summer or midwinter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain . Oftentimes have I known traders give presents to a considerable amount , and credits to a much greater extent than otherwise they would have been disposed to do , for the purpose of inducing young men to go on a hunt rather than on a war tramp . If then we look no higher than self-interest , we find the fur traders as a class most certainly engaged to exert their influence for peace in all their borders. * In this respect their influence , with the exception , it may be , of a very few cases , has been always salutary upon the Indians . It is to be regretted that in regard to moral purity it has not been alike salutary . But it can not be concealed that too much licentiousness has prevailed among traders as a class , and some of the employees have been worse in this respect than the Dakotas themselves . With these remarks in regard to the persons engaged in it , we pass to consider the influence for good and evil , of the trade itself . We now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to exist without having their wants supplied by white people . Without guns and ammunition , * A friend of mine remarks , that although what is here said is strictly true of the traders in this part of the country , " yet history shows tha* Indian traders have often been the instigators of war . " We are glad to be able to testify to a better state of things . // without knives , axes , and hoes , without kettles and blankets , and all the appliances of life which are now considered indispensable , we must regard them as laboring under far greater disadvantages than at present . These necessities and comforts have been supplied by the trade . The introduction of these things must be regarded as enabling them to take one step , at least , towards civilization , and they who bring them such articles , should be regarded as benefactors . The question of motive need not come into the account . Many of the blessings and beuefits conferred by one class of the human family upon another , have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the giver and gaiu to the receiver . It has been none the less a good done to the Dakotas because the individuals by whom they have been furnished with these comforts of life , have in the exchange " gotten gain . " Nor are the traders to be blamed for taking advantage of the Indians by selling at a very high profit . This also has in past times been a necessity of the trade . When cash payments are the rule , and quick returns can be made , small profits may be the motto . But in years gone by , the Indian trade in this part of the country has not made returns oftener than once a year , sometimes even a longer period has been required ; and it has becA burdened with the carriage on goods and furs , and the expense of keeping up posts far in the Indian country , of which one having lit tie experience can have very little idea . In these circumstances one hundred per cent . has been actually a lower profit than twenty-five in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil , both to the trader and the Indian , of the credit system , and the great probability that a part of his credits would not be paid , and another item comes into the count of high prices , which alone could be safe in the Indian trade as formerly conducted . The credit system was a bad one , and if anything , worse for the Indian than the white man . It is said to have been a necessity in the first instance . The Indian had to be clothed before he could hunt . And it continued to be a necessity as long as practiced . It gave rascally Indians an opportunity to be rascals ; and it made the more honest ones pay for their // rascality . In the address before referred to , Mr. Sibley says , " The contact of the Indian with the whites has so far demoralized him as to render it unsafe longer to trust his honesty . " This demoralizing process , we are told , commenced with the Dakotas from 1837 , the time of their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hone*t enough to be trusted safely . When there was but one store of goods to which the Indian could have access , there was a necessity laid upon him to pay his debts , in part at least , if he would obtain credit another time . Now the case is different . His opportunities for avoiding the payment of his just debts are greater . These opportunities he has doubtless improved , and thus in many instances become not so safe a debtor as formerly . But there were dishonest Dakotas before 1837 . Else what means the amount of claims brought against them at the treaty made in that year ? What means the more than three hundred thousand dollars allowed for the liquidation of such claims by the treaties of 1851 ? And what meant those claims which were rejected at the time of the Traverse des Sioux treaty , because they were of too antiquated a date , and had no connecting link with the then present ? In an article entitled " Border life in Minnesota , " which is introduced in the fifteenth chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer says of Eagle-head , who is a man well known among these same Mdwakantouwan Dakotas , " We knew him well-he once cheated us out of a considerable amount of merchandise . " This must have been at least ten years previous to the making of the first treaty . No , I am glad that in this respect our experience does not accord with that of the Hon. Mr. Sibley . The Indians with whom we have had to do , have been becoming more honest . Fifteen years ago we lost more by theft in a month than we now do in a year . I have had several thermometers stolen , but with only one exception , they were taken by Northern Indians who have had but little intercourse with white people . In regard to pecuniary dealings with the Indians , I have always meant to go on the principle of no credit . " Owe no man anything , but love , " is the Bible rule , and certainly it is the best one . A man who owes you and ca n't pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets to avoid you , and after a while to hate you . Looking at it then from all points , it seems to me that the credit system , as an appendage of the fur trade , was an unfortunate necessity which should have been overcome . It has been remarked that by clothing the Indians in wool and cotton rather than in skins-by furnishing them with firearms in the place of bows-by giving them iron axes instead of stone ; * and by introducing many other appliances of civilized life , the fur trade advanced them an important step in civilization . But there it left them . It took no second step . Nay , it in itself opposed to their takino ' another step . It was b educated them in the taking of peltries , but it sought for them no higher education . It was not incompatible with the raising of a little patch of corn in the Sunimer season , which helped to supply their wants in Winter , when furs could not be taken . Nay , in some parts of the Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians could not live on muskrats alone . The corn helped them to be better hunters . But to any greater extent the fur trade desired not to make them agriculturalists . It made labor of any other kind besides hunting , degrading . This it did in two ways . First , by encouraging only that kind of employment in the Dakota men ; and secondly , by the employment of an uneducated class of men to do its drudgery . The trader worked not , as a general thing , with his own hands ; he employed IYa8hechoon-holc8hedan , literally French-lwy8 . And the Indian was thus led to regard labor as servile , and as properly belonging to this class of persons . These false views in regard to the honorableness of labor , fostered in the Indian mind by the habits of the fur trade , we have found it very hard to counteract . It was for the purpose of making labor honorable in the estimation of the Indians , that the missionaries among the Dakotas have felt it necessary to work much more with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper club-head Indian axe of the trade , was a marvel in itself ; and as it is fast disappearing from this part of the country , a specimen should be placed in the rooms of the Historical Society . // do , or than they would otherwise have felt it a duty ; albeit in doing so they exposed themselves to be regarded as having forfeited the title of gentlemen and entered the rank and file of the Washechoon-hokshedan . But we may take another step in regard to the influence of the trade on education . Not only was it not t*4e fo8terer of labor , but the whole principles and interests of the trade were opposed to any change in this respect . It was patent to the perception of every one , that if Indians became educated in books , in stock-raising , in farming , they would consequently cease to supply the trade with peltries . It can not be supposed for a moment that it was not perceived by the men engaged in this business , that progress in civilization would take away " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonic individuals , unless they have been grossly slandered , have given shape to this perception in words , and on this ground , opposed education and civilization in the Indian . That all who have been engaged in this traffic , have not openly opposed schools among the Dakotas , has doubtless been owing to the fact , that they were sensible that education , in the broadest sense of the term , could not fail to be a boon to the Indian as well as the white man ; and they permitted their better judgment to prevail over their own private interests . In this respect they have acted a more honorable part than the genius of the trade would permit . There was still another reason why the trade was in itself opposed to education . An educated man becomes more particular about the principles on which his exchanges are made . But at the same time one who understands things as they are , will always be satisfied to have the merchant make a living profit . Not so with an Indian , but half educated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still sees " men as trees walking . " He has learned enough to awaken his fears and suspicions , but not enough to allay them . He has learned to count a littl&amp; , but it is only a little , and therefore he is the most difficult man to satisfy in regard to the correctness of a trade . I-fe is unwilling to trust to the learning of another , and he has not yet enough of his own to trust to comfortably . It is not at all // strange , then , that the fur trade should prefer to have Indians remain Indians still , and should be opposed to the introduction of any change in this respect . Thus I think it must be manifest that the fur trade is antagonistic to the education and civilization of Indians ; and if some other influences had not been brought to bear upon them , they must have remained in that state . The fur trade had long since done all for them it could do . It desired to do nothing more . It was not willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a higher stand among the nations of the earth . It was high time it should be superseded . It had become old , and was ready to vanish away . It has vanished away . The fur trade as it existed even ten years ago , is , in this part of the country , no more . Some of our Indians are learning a better way . They are learning that a more coinfortable living may be made by planting potatoes than by hunting muskrats . And the traders now in the country , I trust , will find that the change of the system will not really diminish , but rather increase the profits of their merchandise . If the question is asked why the Southern Indians have made more progress in civilization-more readily adopted the habits and customs of white people , than the tribes farther north ; the answer will be found in two facts : first , the amalgamation at the south has partaken more largely of the Anglo-Saxon and Protestant , and less of the Celtic and Roman Catholic element ; and secondly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less value than those of the north . Consequently the Indians inhabiting that part of the country have not been prevented by their occupation as hunters from making progress in agriculture and the mechanic arts . In like manner it was much less of an object , on the part of their traders , to keep them in the ignorance and degradation of the hunter state . It would be rather a sad theme for meditation , for one clothed in furs , and hurrying along Broadway , in a cold morning , to recollect that the taking of those furs had kept some of his species from making progress upward and onward . The habits of a migratory people , such as the Dakotas on the Minnesota have been , forbid their increasing much . For more // than half the year they were moving from place to place , gathering up the muskrats , the otters and the minks , and such a state of living was inconsistent with the raising of a large family of children . Nay , as such removals were demanded in the latter part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter part of the winter and spring , children were peculiarly exposed ; and , as a matter of fact , more die in infancy among such a people than in a civilized land , if we except , perhaps , some of the large cities . To this may be added the testimony of a physician of large experience among the Dakotas : that , " In order that the family may be able to move , it has been customary to destroy children before their birth . " I know it will be said that the trade furnished clothing to make them comfortable . With that admitted , it will still remain true , that hardly any amount of blankets will save that baby which is perched on its mother 's back , and crossing the prairie in a December storm . Over against this , however , may big placed to the credit of the fur trade , the greatest part of the mixed Indian blood . The Dakota half-breeds of the Mississippi and Minnesota are between live and six hundred , or about one-twelfth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident among white people as to have lost their place and nnmbering among their Dakota relations . They have gone to swell the numbers of our white race , which is receiving accessions from every kindred and nation and tongue . But it results in the diminution of the numbers of Dakotas . In this way , by and by , half the nation may slide away and become merged with ourselves . We notice it not . We only say , " The - Dakotas are diminishing , and will soon vanish away . " The second class of influences exerted upon the Dakotas , for weal and woe , which we shall consider , are those that arise from their connection with the GOvERNMENT . It may be remarked in the outset , that primarily all the arrangements of our government which have reference to Indians , chiefly looked towards the welfare of the whites , and could have little or no tendency towards their civilization . The establishment of forts and their occupation by military companies only looked to home // protection . And as nothing beyond this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained . But the evil influences of a garrison upon Indians is always apparent . One or two hundred licentious , profane , gambling , drftnken men , such as most of the soldiers are , could not exist in the midst of any people , be they ever so degraded , without imparting an additional degradation . But in the past and present state of things , it is said that the presence of soldiers is necessary . Their influence has been exerted to keep the peace , to protect the lives and property of white persons residing among and near the Indian tribes , and in some instances in preventing , or at least lessening the amount of bloodshed between various hostile tribes . But this good , with the accompanying evil , has been accomplished at a vast expense to government . So that it has been thought by many persons , who have long observed the operation of the past and present influences , that a greater amount of good with less evil to the Indian might have been accomplished , in some other way , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in regard to the establishment of Indian agencies . Primarily they appear to have had reference chiefly , if not solely , to the pacification of the Indians , and to keeping them on good terms with the United States . The few hundred dollars annually placed in the hands of an agent to be used in presents of tobacco , etc. , could have looked to no higher or greater good . It is true that an Indian agent could exert some influence in the encouragement of agriculture , by furnishing hoes , ploughs , etc. , and we believe that such influence was exerte*1 upon the Dakotas to a small extent previous to the making of these treaties by which they ceded land to the United States . But in the making of the treaties of 1837 and 1851 , the government proposed to carry out certain provisions having reference to their progress in the arts and habits of civilized life . And as it is from the time of this first treaty of 1837 , that Mr. Sibley says the decay of those Indians is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences brought thereby into operation . Precisely how much meaning Mr. Sibley intended to convey by the term decay , is not very // manifest . At the first reading it struck me as having reference only to the diminution of numbers ; which is a question we will consider more particularly by and by . But on thinking more of the language used , it appears probable that the honorable lecturer before the ilistorical Society meant to refer to a retrogression in morals and habits , as well as to a numerical diminution . By the treaty of 1837 , provision was made to give the seven villages of the Mdewakautouwans or Spirit-lake bands , farmers blacksmiths , etc . It was doubtless intended to furnish them with such implements of husbandry as were most needful , and to give such assistance as would enable them to make progress in civilization . In the practical operation of these arrangements it is more than doubtful whether the ulterior design was to any extent whatsoever accomplished . Their farmers , instead of being teachers , became their servants-fenced and ploughed the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-cut the hay and kept the cattle ,  --  the Indians , when they wanted fresh meat , holding the right of demanding an animal , or of taking it without leave . In short , as the farmer got the pay , his duty was to perform the labor : and thus the Dakota men were relieved from what little work they formerly did in this direction ; and The dandies of the nation , with parasol or umbrella , could now visit the fields where in a warm day the maidens were at work hoeing the corn . The assistance thus rendered , although meant for good on the part of the government , became a very serious evil . The system of operations under that treaty seems , in a good degree at least , to have ignored the radical principle on which improvement may reasonably be expected , viz : individual industry . It is so natural for Indians to expect that all who are among them as teachers of any kind , and especially such as are paid with their money , are under obligations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to do a thing for an Indian than to teach him how to do the same , that it is not strange if many difficulties are found attending the introduction of the true principles of improvement . In carrying out the treaties of 1851 , some progress has been // made in this direction . The means and appliances of civilization have been multiplied . In the course of a long time , two saw and grist mills have gone into operation on their reservation . These , if properly managed , will prove of great practical utility to the IDakotas . A change , too , for the better has been made in the mode of government farming . Motives are , to some extent , held ont to individual industry . Fields have been ploughed for individuals , both at the agency and among their upper bands . They have been encouraged to build houses , and to some extent assisted . This is the great practical problem to be solved-how much help can be rendered to an Indian , and not interfere with , but rather encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still conducted on the old plan . In various ways the community system is still encouraged . At the various villages large common fields are provided , which are planted by the families in the neighborhood . In these fields , although all may be interested , no one is so much interested as to see that the fence is kept up ; and some are so little interested or so careless , as to have the fence down , and so much interested in obtaining fresh meat , as to tempt cattle or even to drive them into the corn , that they may have an excuse for shooting them . In this way the public fields have become public nuisances , and should be indicted by the grand jury , if there were any . It is to be hoped that this common property system will be no longer encouraged by the acts and arrangements of government . It has been often remarked that our Indians suffer from the frequent changes of administration in our home government . As a natural consequence of this continual change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most unaccountable ignorance of the condition of things in the Indian country . It is not surprising then that the provisions of treaties should fail of being carried out in the best manner . Indeed , perhaps , the wonder is that things are done as well as they are . The men , too , who are sent into the country as Indian agents and superintendents , being selected usually from that class of // office-seekers who have claims on the party in power , have too frequently , on ' coming into office , manifested an amazing ignorance of Indian character and Indian surroundings . Nor is this strange . Any one acquainted with the men who are always seeking office under government , would not expect that many of them would turn out to be both honest and capable . In regard to ourselves , I think we have been somewhat fortunate in this respect . The agents who have been among the Dakotas for the last twenty years , notwithstanding they have generally been much spoken against , have , I think , meant well . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at most with but one exception , ) have come out defaulters with the government . In executive capacity , they have not been all that was desirable ; but in this respect , they would often have done more for the benefit of the Dakotas , if they had been less trammeled . The position of Indian agents is one certainly not to be coveted by any man who wishes to live quietly and with a fair reputation for honesty . The opportunity of speculating , in various ways , by means of Indian funds and the position which he occupies , is thought by many persons to be so good , that a man must have more than an ordinary reputation for hoi*iesty , if he escapes the imputation of having there by sought to increase his own property . Moreover , the Indians are to be pleased and the white people are to be pleased ; and it will be exceeding good fortune if an agent succceds in doing both . The existence of a school fund , one would suppose , would augur well for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more reason to deplore its existence than otherwise . By the treaty of 183* , it was arranged that five thousand dollars annually should be placed at the disposal of the President to be used for the benefit of these Dakotas . This was nuderstood in two ways . The Indian agent , Maj. Taliaffero , who took the chiefs to Washington to make the treaty , and the government , understood it to be a provision for education . The traders said that was not the meaning . Of the chiefs , who were parties to the treaty , at least two , after their return home , affirmed it to be as the agent and government understood it . The agent received and paid out some of this // fund for education . The government persisted , year after year , in refusing to appropriate it for any other purpose . It was the interest of the fur trade to have this hundred thousand dollars paid to the Indians in cash . A few years passed by and they had obtained credits on the strength of it to large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for education . They had rather receive the money . The trade told them not to favor education and they should have it . Schools were deserted-broken up . Missionary operations were paralyzed . The fur trade triumphed . And 50 far as book education is concerned , those lower bands are in a far less hopeful case now , to all appearance , than they were nineteen years ago . Indeed they may never be in so hopeful a condition for receiving instruction as some of those villages were eighteen years since . In their educational interests they have been thrown back a generation . Who did it I shall not stop to inquire . On the question of the decay of these Indians , so far as civilization is concerned , these transactions have undoubtedly had a paramount influence . To speak of it in the most charitable manner , it was exceedingly unfortunate for the Dakotas of Minnesota , that any such provision was made . We did not care so much for its influence in favor of education ; but we did deprecate its being placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provision is made for education without any ambiguity of language ; but as yet almost none of what now amounts to some sixty thousand dollars , has been brought into use . We ask , why ? *o one knows . Whether the throne is opposed to education among the Dakotas , or whether there is an influence behind the throne stronger than the throne , is not manifest . It is very certain that a prompt and proper application of this education fund would be of incalculable benefit to the Dakotas of the Minnesota , but the failure to so apply it will work immense evil to the nation . The amount of the annuities paid to these Indians has been regarded by some as a mere pittance , and as insufficient to be of any considerable service to them ; while by others it is supposed to be too much , taking away from them motives to industry . // For several years past , among the lower Indians , the pro rata money annnity has been about $20 ; while each one 's share of the and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus a man and woman with a family of seven children , among the Spirit-lake Dakotas , receive an annuity of more than $250 , or about half as much as the writer , with the same number of children , receives for his support . Besides this the Indian has the advantage of the farming and civilization efforts made by the government for their benefit . I would respectfully submit whether this should be regarded as " a mere pittance . " It seems to me rather that the amount is quite as great as is consistent with teaching them habits of industry and self-reliance . The Dakotas who are concerned in the treaty of Traverse des Sioux , * and to whom all our missionary operations are now confined , receive only about half as much as those of the Spirit Lake baud do at present . And yet it seems to us to be amply sufficient to help all such as are industriously disposed to make a comfortable living , and to make progress in civilization . Of course those Indians have suffered some in their outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Reservation . But notwithstanding this many of them have been advancing in the evidences of prosperity . Wagons are being introduced extensively among them , and indeed have become a necessity . And the same is true of many other things about which they knew almost nothing previous to their receiving annuities . Tea and coffee and sugar , with flour and pork , have become necessaries . Probably the use of these things has not tended to prolong their lives , to give them sounder teeth or better constitutions , but the contrary . Indeed it is quite certain that the use of flour and pork in excess , has produced disease and death in many instances . In this way the accompaniments of civilization often operate to the injury and the diminution of those who participate in them . White civilization , as it has come in contact with the Indians , has brought with it still more serious evils . It has initiated them into the mysteries of card-playing and porfane // swearing , in addition to furnishing them with the means of drunkenness . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should remain about the localities where their worst desires can be gratified . They are the offscouring of the nation . And any one who permits himself to judge of the whole people from these miserable specimens , will certainly form very erroneous conclusions . For the course pnrsned by these stragglers , in remaining away from their reservation , government is not so much to be blamed as individuals . Perhaps they are connected with white persons by marriage , and think it easier to get a living by hunting a little and begging , than by honest industry . Of the Dakotas on the IReservation , those immediately aronnd us have advanced much , through the assistance received from various qnarters . The past season has produced for them abundantly . While in other parts of the conntry there has been a comparative failure of crops , here they have enough and to spare . Among those friendly to our mission in this conntry , I have always given Hon. H. H. Sibley , of Mendota , a place . Ever since I came into what is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as my personal friend . Innumerable kindnesses received from him , in the first years of our mission , are by no means forgotten . Mr. Sibley 's opportnnities for personal and correct information in regard to most of the topics embraced in his address before the Historical Society of Minnesota , are beyond a question . And it is the high standing he occupies , and the long acquaintance he has had with affairs in the territory , and especially in regard to the Dakotas , that give prestige and currency to his remarks , the wrong and defective ones as well as those which are right . Nevertheless his connection with the fur trade has been such that it would be more than strange if he could fully appreciate the efforts which have been made to evangelize the Dakotas . Never have I permitted myself to believe that he has placed himself in antagonism to these operations , or that he has intentionally made any misrepresentation of them . What I say is , that the results of these efforts have been of such a character , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully appreciated , or could adequately represent them . In regard to indefatigable industry and , perseverance in this work , Mr. Sibley , as well as many other individuals of high standing in Minnesota , has done ample justice to the missionaries among the Dakotas . But this tribute to our energy and industry seems to be made at the expense of our wisdom . We have been indefatigable in our efforts , but those efforts have been misdirected , and the results have not been proportionate to the expense incurred . It would seem that Mr. Sibley may have been laboring under the impression that the expenses of the Dakota mission were very much greater than they really have been . Dr. Williamson informs me that a close calculation gives the sum of all that we have drawn from the treasury of the Board for twentytwo years , at a little more than forty thousand dollars . About eight thousand have been received from the civilization fund , through the Board . And then our donations , not brought into the cash account , may have amounted to ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty thousand dollars , as the whole expense of the Dakota mission from the beginning . For a number of years after 1837 , when the pressure was on the treasury of the Board , three families at Lacquiparle lived on an annual appropriation of $550 , and perhaps $400 in donations . On looking back to the past , we are inclined to think that the efficiency of the mission would have been much increased , if more means had been placed at its disposal . Many years ago , in a letter which Mr. Sibley addressed to the writer , the idea was conveyed that the reason why our efforts were not more successful , was that we did not approach the Indians in the right way . As that was the very thing we desired to know and do above all others , in reply I invited him to give us his views on that point-he might throw some important light upon it which would prove a lasting blessing to the Dakotas . I am sorry to say that the request was not complied with , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course I *ouid only conjecture that Mr. S 's views coincided with those of a still larger class of respectable persons , - viz : // that civilization should precede christianization : that Indians and other heathen people should first be civilized and then christianized : that they should first be introduced to the arts and appliances of civilized life , and then might the terms of the glorious gospel of the blessed God be proclaimed to them , with the prospect that it would fall like good seed into good ground . This may or may not have been Mr. Sibley 's view . But it is the position taken by many . In reply I would say , First , It appears not to be God 's plan . " Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to ( or evangelize ) every creature , " is his command . It seems to be presumed that civilization in its best form will result from preaching repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus . We would not impeach the wisdom of God 's arrangement . Secondly . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it is understood to be , is the one adopted and carried out by all the missionary societies of protestant evangelical Christianity throughout the world . The Bible is the great civilizer . This position is regarded as so well established that it was really no part of the question under consideration at the late meeting of the American Board at Newark . On that point there was no division of sentiment . The discussion there seems to have had reference only to the place which school education ought to have in connection with the work of introducing Christian civilization among the nations . Here there is room for an honest and healthful difference of opinion . Thirdly . Our experience , in connection with the experience of the vast majority of those engaged personally in the work of evangelical missions , is in favor of the power of the gospel to civilize . We have encouraged education , and spent most of our energies in teaching the Dakotas letters , and giving them a literature , meager though it be . For our efforts in this direction we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanic arts . Day after day have we labored with them at ploughing their cornfields , that we might teach them to plough . In several instances have we personally used the square and scribe-awl in framing houses for them , while they made the mortices and did much towards securing for themselves better habitations . We introdu%d // the first saw-mill into the Dakota country , of which they as well as ourselves have reaped the benefits . We have advocated , and with some gratifying success , the change of leggins for pantaloons . We first introduced , and created a desire among the Dakotas of the upper Minnesota for the white man 's axe , which has now taken the place of the club-handled axe of the trade . We have advocated , and with to us very gratifying success , the recognition of individual rights , and the possession of separate fields and the keeping of stock . We have advised ( and our advice has been acted upon ) the formation of elective republics , founded upon the principle of labor and Christian civilization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool in glorying . " But all this , and whatever else in the good providence of God we may have attempted and partly accomplished , we place behind and beneath the doctrine of " Christ and Him crucified , " as means of elevating the Dakotas . They are properly the results of an acceptance of the gospel plan of salvation . Those who have been educated and not , brought under the influence of the Gospel , have manifested comparatively little desire for progress in civilization . But , so far as I know , in all cases where tendencies towards a hi bher position are manifested , they have been induced either directly or indirectly by " the light that shineth in a dark place . " There is another important fact connected with this part of the subject . The religion of the Dakotas is antagonistic to civilization . Myth or no myth , it must be abandoned and superseded before any considerable progress may reasonably be expected in this direction . Labor , for a Dakota man , is not only degrading  --  the gods are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall . die , " they said . " It is all very well for you white men to work , your gods favor it , but so do not ours . " And at Lacquiparle there was but little opposition manifested to missionary efforts until one of their principal men , having embraced the religion of the Bible , renounced his religious caste too , by putting on pantaloons and going to wom4 . Then arose a storm of persecution . Then soldiers were stationed along the paths , and the blankets of those who had been at church were cut up . And " There goes the man who has made // himself a woman , " they said . Now they do not any longer believe , or at least would hardly be willing to profess the belief that Dakota men who forsake the religion of their fathers and adopt the religion and customs of white men , will die in conseqnence-too many examples of the kind have taken place and death has not followed . But any one who will make the effort , will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal means , he has not laid the axe at the root of the tree . Just here there seems to be a lead to a mine which may prove worth workino ' " The entrance of thy word giveth light ; " and where the word of God is not , there is darkness . If I have not read history in vain , the great truth , that as man has gone away from his God he has plunged into darkness and degradation , is there taught with a power of illustration not to be gainsayed . As the nations of the earth forgot God they descended into the deep darkness of barbarism . Some forgot God mor*e entirely than others . Some reached a place of deeper darkness than others . And some reached it sooner than others . But the law has been nuiversal in its operation , that sinful men have lost their civilization as they lost the true knowledge of the Great Spirit ; and as this true knowledge has been revived , nations have taken an upward movement in all that regards human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of history , then it follows that time revealed will of God is to be regarded and nsed as the lever for elevating the nations . There is another thought which may prove important here . From hill and valley , all over our country , we have been digging up the memorials , as we supposed , of a past race . Why may they not be the memorials of a past civilization only ? The Indian tribes of our continent in common with nations of whom historical accounts have been preserved , have traveled the downward path . When they reached the lowest point in. their degradation , we are unable to say . Possibly it may have been about the time when this country was discovered by Europeans . Whemi traveling on this downward path , would they not leave some evidences of what skill in the muechanic // arts they still possessed ? May not the earthen vessels found in Minnesota , and the copper weapons and implements of labor , have been the products of a past period in Indian history , rather than the memorials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this , as in the discussion of other subjects , that in seeking for the causes of certain effects , we have looked too far off ? The real causes may have been at home and near us , while we have been seeking for them abroad and afar off . I throw out this suggestion hoping that it will be followed up by those who have the time and opportunities . Having considered some of the various questions in regard to the influence of the fur trade , of the government , and of missionary operations upon the Dakotas , we are now prepared to examine the question of decay . The diminution of our aboriginal tribes seems to be not now regarded as a subject of inquiry . It has been so often asserted , and is so generally believed , that it is rather regarded as an ascertained fact which may not be spoken against . The writer of this article thinks there are reasons for believing that this diminution may not be doing on as is commonly supposed-that it is partly only in appearance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real decay or diminution which takes place in certain cases , are but imperfectly understood . 1 . Have the Mdewakautouwans , or Spirit-lake bands , diminished since 1837 ? Mr. Libby says they increased previous to that time . And so far as we can ascertain , they seem to have increased since also . In the year 1838 , they received their first annuity  --  the money payment of which was ten thousand dollars . Mr. A. IRobertson says they received each $7.50 ; which would make the number on the pat-roll that year less than fourteen hundred . In this number it is probable n one of the half-breeds were included , as they had just received a separate portion . It is presumed , too , that there was little cheating by overestimating their own numbers , but it is known there was some . On the whole , however , probably ther3 has never been as correct a roll since that time . It embraced all of the Spirit-lake bands then in that region . In the years that followed , there was an increase from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had scattered to other parts of the country and married into other connections , returned . They came in from the upper Minnesota , and even from the Missouri . The next year the number was so increased that they only received five dollars apiece . In a few years the half-breeds found a place on the list ; so that with these two sources of increase , and the effort made by the different villages to cheat each other by false enrollment , the annuity was diminished to four dollars each . In this false enrollment some villages added one third to what was known to be their real number . A man belonged to one village and his wife to another-the children were enrolled at both . In such a state of things it is impossible to ascertain from the pay rolls whether they were really increasing or diminishing . Even now the pay roll holds out the same uncertain light . After the treaties of 1851 , many who had been enrolled with the Spirit-lake Dakotas , returned to what was regarded as their proper place among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have removed to the reservation , remain with them . All others , and the number is very considerable , including such straggling Indians as remain among the whites , have been dropped off . Still at the last payment , the Spiritlake bands counted about 2000 . This was exclusive of 250 or 300 Leaf-shooters . Mr. Andrew Robertson , whose opportunities for forming a correct opinion in regard to this matter are hardly surpassed by any one , gives it as his candid judgment that these Spirit-lake Dakotas have been on the increase . There have been seasons of sickness in which the deaths have exceeded the births . There have been causes , too , arising from changes in their mode of life , which have sometimes produced excessive mortality . But on the whole , it would seem they are as numerous now as ever they were . 2 . The same is true in regard to these upper Indians . Some seasons the deaths have been more than the births , but taking either of the four lustrums that have passed since we came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no diminution , but rather increase . During one season the small-pox raged . It proved extensively fatal in some small villages . But by the // timely and energetic efforts of the government physicians and Dr. Williamson , in vaccinating large numbers , it was effeciMally stopped in its progress . The whooping-cough also , one season , caused considerable mortality among the children . Dnring the progres* of our missionary operations at Lacquiparle , a register of births and deaths kept for many years by Dr. Williamson , although , owing to many causes , not per fect , showed a preponderance of the former over the latter ; and fully satisfied us that at that time the Dakotas of the upper Minnesota were not decreasing. * And so far as those of the plains , on and beyond the Missouri river , are concerned , the evidence of their increase is believed to be as conclusive as it can be in such circumstances . On the whole we may safely affirm that the Dakotas , as a tribe , were never more nnmerons than they are to-day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher than it is now , it is only because we are approximating the truth . Among the Dakotas , as well as among white people , there are croalcer8 . " The former days were better than these , " say they . " Before government bought our country we were better off than we are now . " They are deluded. 31'hey are now better clothed and better fed , have many more horses and other necessaries and conveniences of life , than they had before . In fine , they have now the means of making themselves more comfortable , and of elevating themselves and their posterity in the scale of being , if they improve them ; which , I and glad to say , some of them are disposed to do . But if these opportunities and means of improvement are misused or rejected , what might work life will work death . This is the unchangeable law of the Divine Government . * In regard to positive increase , Dr. T. S. Williamson makes the following statement : " 1st . The number of Dakotas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " counting by houses or families , is at least twice as great as it was at Lacquiparle twenty years ago ; which increase must be chiefly natu. ral , as about as many have gone from this band as have joined them from others . " 2d . The WahpatouWan , or Leaf-villages , were estimated , in 1805 , at 700 , in 1823 , at 900 , in 1835 , at 1000 ; at present I think they*uumber over 1200. " // I have already indicated a source of apparent diminution in the fact that half-breeds and others , on becoming civilized , frecj*uently pass into the white race . This is taking place , to some extent , among the Dakotas . And I am persuaded it has been the case to a far greater extent in some tribes , which have , to appearances , almost or . quite vanished away . And who will demur at this process ? Shall w* not rather rejoice that they still live absorbed in the gveat American people ? * * Why should not Congress enact a uniform rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not expressly make them incapable of citizenship . Or if , not being foreigners , they need no naturalization by the Federal Government , why should not each State prescribe the conditions on which , and the forms by which a civilized Indian may be invested with the rights and dignity of a citizen I-ED.
