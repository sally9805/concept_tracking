Christianity in relation to its ancient an 'd Modern Antagonists . II . On the supernatural element contained in the Epistles , and its bearing on the argument . Philadelphia : H. Hooker , 1853. l2mo. pp. 232 . THESE two volumes are reprints from recent English works . Their appearance in England indicates that English theologians and pamphleteers are somewhat aroused to the inroads of unbelief upon the better classes of English society . Their republication in this country shows that some of the friends of Christianity believe it is time that the same unbelief with us were boldly confronted and its pretensions earnestly discussed . We have for a long time believed that the so-called leaders in the // Religious World on both sides of the water , have been too little aware of the process of undermining that has gradually weakened the faith of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest preachers have scarcely noticed that those appeals from the pulpit which assume the unquestionable and unquestioned truth of Christianity , must fall powerless upon the ear and the heart of more than of*e strong man in the audience , because the new Infidelity in some of its forms , has wakened strange misgivings in his mind . The multitudes of young men who visit our church but rarely if ever , while they maintain a decent character and live an unblemished life , are affected far more generally than the preacher or colporteur supposes , by the suggestions of unbelief in the historic truth of Christianity and in its supernatural claims , which are poured into their minds up on the flood of modern literature . " The Eclipse of Faith " is an interesting and inviting book . The writer is earnest , ingenious , lively , and attractive . He gives an account of the new Infidelity , by sketching to his readers the mental history and present condition of a young friend , thoughtful , serious , and accomplished , who had fallen into a painful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held between himself and this relative , between his relative and several of his sceptical friends , each of whom personates some one of the various types of modern unbelief . He gives now and then labored arguments of his own , which are prepared to meet some exigency in this lively history . The narrative is by no means faultless and the conversations at times drag rather heavily . The wit is not all the most refined , nor are all the allusions the most happy . The great merit of the book is displayed in the skill with which the author plays off the internal inconsistencies of Messrs . Parker and Newman , from whose works he gives long quotations , through the lips of his fictitious characters . The inconsistencies , not to say the absurdities , into which he plunges these writers by quoting their own arguments and their own words against themselves , are forcibly and humorously set forth . We can not rid ourselves occasionally of the impression that he does not do entire justice to these writers , and that while he quotes their language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or does not faithfully represent it . We do not charge the author with the least intention to misrepresent the assailants of our faith . But he appears to us to fail in what should be esteemed a prime quality in the successful defender of any truth , the ability to look at the question from the point of view taken by his antagonist , and to do justice to the strength as well // as to the weakness of his arguments . In short , with all the ability and skill displayed by the author , we do not believe he understands the origin and genesis of the unbelief of such men as Parker and Newman , and though he fells them to the earth with many a well directed blow-he does not send his weapon into the joints of their harness . ' ' We observe also that he despises and ignores the necessity of idquiring into the sources of this infidelity . He does not ask who are the authors , German or English , on whom they rely , but with the ignorant contempt of German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tolerated among respectabie writers in England , he despatches the German authorities with a pun and a sneer . This will all do well enough for a certain purpose , but for other and higher purposes it accomplishes but little with the men against whom he writes and the men over whom they exert an influence . This style of infidelity is too consistent , too well settled in its philosophy , too well fortified with its own arguments from erudition and history , too determined in its attitude , too deeply rooted in its prejudices and its contempt of its assailants , to be dealt with so lightly or disposed of by " so summary a process . We observe , moreover , that when the author attempts to give positive reasons for his own faith , he fails more strikingly than when he refutes the reasonings of his opponents . He either has not a consistent and matured argument of his own , or he does not think fit to present it . We could wish that in a book like this , something more decisive and unanswerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth and the divine force of her claims . With all these defects , the work will be read with interest and profit by many for whom it was intended , and it will be their own fault if it does not leave impressions which they can not readily shake off . " The Restoration of Belief " is from a mind of another stamp . It is written with a different intent and in a different spirit . It is an argument , serious , learned , intelligible and grave , upon the two points indicated in the title . The author understands the strength of his assailants , while he exposes their weakness . He is a man who has had difficulties of his own to conquer , and who sympathizes with those who are tempted . He has gained the victory over these difficulties by patient thought and learned study , and is thus enabled to give assistance to others . We hope the series which he has commenced will be continued and that the successive portions of it will be given to American readers . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations in regard to the New Infidelity . We are aware that it should not be hastily considered nor handled superficially . We do not profess to have traced all its arguments to their philosophical origin , nor to have mastered the field of critical and historical investigation . But inasmuch as this unbelief is continually asserting its claims and challenging its antagonists , it seems right to offer certain general observations in regard to its character and the secret of its success , reserving for other occasions a formal discussion of its merits . The arguments on which this new unbelief rests its pretensions are philosophical and historical , and its characteristics deserve to be examined from each of these points of view . Its philosophical basis is not easily defined . Indeed it can scarcely be said to be the same , with any two leading opponents of Christianity . The philosophy of Mr. Emerson is not the same with that of Mr. Parker , or Mr. Newman , and these two last gentlemen differ widely from each other . The logical and cold blooded Pantheism of the extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because not only nature but the Deity himself is subjected to the stern bondage of inexorable necessity , is very different from the warm blooded and too human Theism of Theodore Parker , who denies that a miracle is proved by the evidence furnished in the sacred history . The sad confessions of Mr. Newman , as to the moral responsibility of man and the awful moral government of God , much as they are weakened by the weak and vague imaginings , through which he seeks to break their force , are quite unlike the imposing dogmatism of Emerson , who seems to rest his claims to be received , upon the audacity of his paradoxes , and to expect to command the faith , or rather the no-faith , of his admirers just in proportion as he outrages reason and proclaims himself a " chartered libertine " from the ordinary methods of thought . But whatever may be the variety or the inconsistencies of these philosophies , they all agree in being very unlike the principles that are either asserted or assumed in the Scriptures . Whether these writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most obvious , that their contents are very different from the teachings of these new assailants . Their views of the essential nature of God , of his personal or moral being , and of the principles on which he deals with the creatures who are made in his image ; their views of man , also , in respect to his responsibility and his needs , are far removed from those which these ancient writings inculcate . Some of these rejectors of the supernatural in the Scriptures , distinctly array themselves against important principles in this // system . They explode them as antiquated , they abhor them as cruel , they despise them as puerile , they reject them as offensive to their kindly feelings and their moral sense . On grounds like these , they reject considerable portions of the teachings of the Bible as unworthy of God , and confidently declare that the fact so often asserted in these books , that their teachers were inspired or directed by *divine guidance , can not be historically true . Or making another application of the truth of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of the Infinite , or the situation of man as morally perverse and therefore intellectually blind , any occasion for a miraculous and supernatural revelation , and therefore they reject the claims of such a revelation , as wholly irrational . This application of their philosophizings is perfectly legitimate , and the conclusions drawn from these premises are logically and even morally just . If it is true , as they contend or assume , that the Theodicy and the Anthropology of the Scriptures are entirely false , or as is more usually taught , in considerable portions offensive to the intellect and conscience of man when illuminated by science , then the Scriptures can not be received as divine or historically true . If God is only a necessary product of the human intellect , coming into and going out of being as the thought of man creates and uncreates this grandest of all its conceptions , or if he is only the necessary servant both in his being and his actings , of the physical and intellectual forces of nature , or if being allowed to be personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral will , or if being moral , his morality is subjected to his sympathies-then it is true that the Book which gives other representations of God can not be true in fact , and that all the so called history in it , which sets it forth as being from God , is to be rejected as error . So , too , if man is not moral , or being moral , is not responsible , or being moral and responsible , is not blind , and weak , and guilty , then all the arguments for the fact that a revelation to such beings was required , and being required must be miraculous in order to accomplish its objects , must fail . They are all cut off by the decision of the previous question , concerning man 's character , and his wants as founded upon that character . We say , *f these Theologies and Anthropologies , that are so boldly advanced , or so coolly taken for granted , in the manifold productions and under the Protean forms of modern unbelief , are true in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unbelief would lead us , are irresistible . But are these philosophizings concerning God or man , correct philosophizings ? Are they sustained by the consciousness of man , by the experience of // human nature , as it has been tried in history , by the observations of men upon each other in society , or by that common sense which , as it were , sums up the lessons of consciousness , history , and observation , in its pregnant maxims and its self-evident axioms ? We think not . Why , then , is not their deficiency more obvious and transparent ? Partly , we suppose , because of the agreeable nature of the conclusions to which these errors lead ; partly , also , on account of the very vague and indistinct form in which these philosophizings are clothed . They are taught in an indistinct and passionate phraseology . They are draped in a poetic garb . They are illustrated by pictures that please the fancy . They are set off with all the charms which language can command . The real error is half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the stolen livery of truth with which it is invested . Its devout aspirings , its honest aims , its forcible statements , its high moral and religious teachings , add still more to the illusion . The indolent , the unwai4y , and the intellectually luxurious reader takes for truth , arguments that are so grateful , so plausible , so forcibly and beautifully expressed , and in the name of this fancied truth rejects the Truth on which reposed the stalwart faith of his clear-sighted father , and the devout love of his single-hearted mother . These subtle philosophies are diffused most widely . They meet us often in the daily newspaper , the monthly journal , the critical essay , the Lyceum-lecture , the book of travels , the history , as well as in the philosophical and religious review . We had almost said they meet us in Poetry  --  but this is rarely the case except the Poetry be Satire , for Poetry depends so much for its life upon the Truth of the conscience and the Truth of Religion , that it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments against a miraculous and supernatural Revelation profess to stand upon critical grounds alone . The assailants of such a Revelation , profess to prove by historical criteria , that the story of miracles and o.f teachers inspired by God , is so inconsistent with itself and with known history , that though there is a historical basis for the whole , yet upon this foundation has been reared a superstructure more or less unsubstantial , consisting of legends , inventions , and mythical exaggerations from devout but credulous minds . Accordingly they furnish us with corrected histories of the Jews , and expurgated lives of Jesus-which profess to be reconstructed on critical principles only , and to give as historically true , that portion only which abides the test of historical criteria . We do not propose to examine the grounds of objection and of reconstruction , so far as they are historical . To do so , // within the limits of our article or of any article , would prove the critic incompetent to his task , from very ignorance of its nature and its magnitude . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ground against which these historical difficulties are projected , so far as we have examined these new histories , is the Philosophy and Theology of the critic . That which makes the history so improbable , and which causes such portions of it to be set aside , is not its chronology or its contradictions , but because the critic is forced by his allegiance to reason and conscience to tear out from the separate parts the stong bond which holds them together as parts of a consistent and significant story . The critic may persuade himself that he starts without being committed to any theory whatever , and that he searches for truth , upon historic grounds alone , when the fact is , that he starts with a most dogmatic and stubborn opinion that a miracle is impossible in the nature of things , or that there is no occasion that it should be wrought , which can give to any amount of testimony the force of proof . This dogmatic theory is the lens , not achromatic nor clear , through which he looks back upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all wonderful that such a lens should present an incoherent , distorted , and monstrous aggregation of fact and fiction , of truth and error , of the real and the mythical . The secret of this predetermined judgment is continually breaking cut . It can not be concealed with the utmost painstaking , whether consciously or unconsciously applied . Very much of the force of these objections is based on the ignorance of uncritical commentators , or the fancies of mystical interpreters , or the extravagancies of self-opinionated dogmatists . These the inquirer after historical truth should simply set aside as invalid . Too often are they used as a foil by which to set off the improbable explanation of the critic , as a pretext under which to reject every other theory of sustaining the historic truth of the sacred narrative , as weak , violent , and impossible . Besides , the critic is bound to examine the historic truth of the narrative , not only on the supposition that it was written by men who are inspired , but on the supposition that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no greater authority than an ordinary history . He is at liberty only to abate that portion of the supernatural , which historic criteria force him to eliminate . If the sacred history , so far as the canons of criticism are concerned , is as good as Thucydides or Tacitus , the question still returns , by what critical ground do you reject from it the supernatural and miraculous ? If it is replied , on the same grounds by which similar accounts in Thucydides or // Tacitus are rejected , then the critic falls back , whether he knows it or not , upon the philosophical or theological dogma , that a miracle is in its nature impossible , and can be proved by no testimony . This however is not an historical but a philosophical canon . Moreover the critic , as a critic , must account for certain facts , that are notorious in history . These facts are the existence of the Jewish Commonwealth , and the rise and growth of the Christian Church . No man can doubt these facts , or will pretend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth , and their present condition , two theories are presented , and the historian must decide between them . One theory is given in the historical account found in the scriptures as ordinarily interpreted , and this whether it be inspired or uninspired . This theory involves the supernatural and the miraculous . Another theory excludes the supernatural and the miraculous . But does it account for the phenomena ? Will it explain the existence of the Christian Church ? We say another theory-either one , which is yet to be devised , or one among the many which have been devised since the Jewish story that the disciples stole the body of Jesus . No fact is more notorious than that unbelievers in every age have been burdened and oppressed with the necessity of accounting for the existence of Christianity . One theory has succeeded another with wonderful rapidity . Each of the English Deists had his own method of solving the problem . The German Exegetes have labored hard to account for the notorious facts of the case  --  and now the new unbeliever tells us that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morals and religion appeared , who made such a moral and religious impression upon scores and hundreds of men , that it was propagated to thousands and tens of thousands of men for three or four generations . One of the fruits of this moral and religious impulse was , that the admiring devotion of these moral and religious followers , led them to imagine strange and miraculous events connected with his birth , life , death , and resurrection-one man conceiving that they might be true , then telling another that they were likely to be true , who in his turn told another that they were true , and thus the whole scheme of the miraculous was the out-growth of this wonderful religious movement . Thus Christianity took its present form . Thus its records and authorities were hardened by time and took possession of the belief of the race . Now we find a difficulty in believing miracles of any kind . We acknowledge in general an antecedent improbability that miracles should be performed , and that it requires much and very peculiar testimony , to prove them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // as difficult of digestion , as miracles in nature ; and if we are to account for Christianity on some theory or other , then we do not hesitate to accept the miracles which are recorded in the New Testament , rather than to fall hack upon the moral wonders which the New Unbelief propounds for our faith . Especially are we forced to this alternative , when we must take these wonders and make them consistent with certain known historic indicia ; as , for example , the early appearance and the undisputed genuineness of the Pauline Epistles and the gospel of John . We are Constrained to say that every other theory than this which we have seen , seems to us to be a most glaring and scarcely a respectable failure . We acknowledge critical difficulties , or rather critical desiderata , which need to be solved or supplied in order to answer all the questions which we can ask in respect to the rise of Christianity , and the reception of its facts and doctrines , but all these are no greater than we should expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in such times and at such places , if propagated by such men . The question can not but often present itself to a thoughtful man , whence does this new unbelief derive its power to attract and influence so many cultivated minds of the present generation ? How does it happen that principles so irrational , and a scheme of faith , or no faith , so little able to endure the severe scrutiny of a sound judgment , has proved itself so powerful to fascinate and to lead astray men of high cultivation and superior refinement ? It would be scarely courteous to say , in reply , that the moral earnestness and the serious responsibilities which are inseparable from the ordinary views of God 's government and of man 's guilt , must necessarily be most uncomfortable to many men upon whom they exert the pressure of actual Truth . It is obvious that a Personal and Holy God , to whom man is responsible , and against whose will man has offended in character , as well as by single acts , must be an object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre of our actual life , in words of supernatural warning , and by deeds of miraculous power , invests God 's designs and man 's condition with relations that are most serious . Retribution of any kind is most unpleasant to man , but most of all retribution from a Personal God . Everything which is fitted to manifest and to bring out the Personal actings and feelings of his Creator , at once quickens man 's conscience and arouses his fears . The miraculous , whether it is possible or not , whether it is attested by sufficient evidence or not , will be allowed to be a striking expression of Personality . If then we allow that the question as to the possibility and reality // of miracles is to stand or fall by its appropriate evidence , it is still true , that there are strong moral reasons why a so-called Christianity without the miraculous should be grateful to man . It would not be strange , if those whose reason is too enlightened not to admit the high moral claims of many of the truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that terrible earnestness with which these truths are clothed when uttered by the voice of God walking among men , saying , " where art thou ? " So far as a moral solution is sought for the Pantheism which strips the Deity of a personal and moral character , or for the Christianity which is not miraculous , it is given in the facts which have been stated . No candid man will deny The reality of such an influence with many minds . That it applies to all those whose faith has been affected by the new attacks upon the old Christianity , we are not prepared to affirm . Laying out of view the moral reasons , we seek for others which may be considered as the occasions for the strange fascination of the new unbelief . The first which occurs to us is to be found in the aims and the achievements of modern science . Science has learned to reduce the nature and laws of all sorts of being to the fewest possible generalizations . No matter what the subject may be , whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of health , the duration of life , the rise or decay of nations , the history of a race of fishes , of the rocky strata of the earth , or of the present order of the planetary system , everything is reduced to law , strict , inflexible law , as rigorous . as fate itself , as permanent in the judgment of the scientific inquirer as the duration of the Ages . The mind accustomed to the consideration of law as the ultimate solution of all the problems of science , and the first principle of all its constructions , does not ask what is the nature , and what are the dependencies of law itself . For strictly scientific purposes , it has no occasion to do so . Hence we see Humboldt surveying all the laws of the physical universe bya comprehensive glance , viewing them in all their obedient subordinations and musical harmony , as they together form one beautiful Kosmos . But Humboldt has no occasion to see in them all , the glory of the Creator whose word of power has called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the beautiful reflexion of God 's wondrous thoughts . Would that he might now and then rise from the majestic march of his sublime generalizations , into the noble strain of Kepler , as he exclaimed , " 0 God , I think thy thoughts after thee . " The tendency is strong with men like him , and those who can follow // him in the heights of thought to which he attains , to dispense with God altogether , and almost unconsciously to dream because they can follow the laws of the universe in their own thoughts , that therefore they can think them into actual being ; to fancy because they grasp the laws of his universe by their intellect , that therefore they hold the thunderbolts of power in their own hands . Hence Hegel reduces God to a thoughtproduct , defining correctly enough certain relations of man 's notion of God , but preparing the way perhaps for himself , certainly for his followers , to dispense with any God but the thought-God , which man creates and uncreates . Hence Comte excludes from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause , as lying without the proper domain of science . From this the inference , or at least the fact , follows by a natural and certain connection , that the consideration of a God in any relation becomes to the savant a very unscientific proce ( lure . The tendency of these influences is directly to Atheism , or to a specious Pantheism . The consideration of simple law excludes from the thoughts and renders strange to the associations the phenomena of creation and miraculous workings , which can alone be accounted for by an agency higher than law , the free act of a creating God . Hence the mind finds no room for the other phenomenon akin to this , the free and responsible will of lawless man . Hence there is no need for supernatural or saving interpositions , in Christ the miracle worker and the Saviour ; no opportunity for prayer ; no meaning in repentance and love and faith . All these truths are unscientific . They are strange to the thoughts , unwelcome to the associations , and at last the object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies of science are to be developed into a systematic war upon the living God and the works of mercy which he has revealed for men , compared with which , the old stories of the ancients concerning the rebellious Titans are tame and spiritless fables . The influences which are inseparable from a high degree of literary culture and refinement , move in the same direction . Literature as such , that is , when it is considered apart from the truths which it utters and the feelings which it expresses , depends on perfection of language , splendor of imagery , and delicacy of taste . As men advance to a high degree of refinement in intellectual culture , their literary tastes are apt to become luxurious . As such a taste grows upon them , their concern for perfection of form becomes more and more absorbing , and their care for perfection of truth becomes less and less earnest . Then // it is that the apostles of form arise , who by their power of expression bid defiance to the rugged and earnest apostles of truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , who figure as poets , historians , critics , or philosophers . If they are but rich in the spoils of learning , if they are masters of style , if they are daring in speculation , if they are confident and consistent in their principles , it matters little what are the principles or sentiments of the literary idols of the hour . What can be more strange and what more evil than the unheeded sway , in its time , of the Satanic school of Poets in England , or than that of the intellectually voluptuous Atheism of Shelly ? What more apt to illustrate our position , than the abject idolatry of the Germans , for everything connected with Goethe ? What more potent within its circle , than the spells with which Carlyle has befooled the intellect and taken captive the conscience of his devotees ? We scarcely need add a word to prove that the power of literary tastes in a luxurious age may be mightier with many minds than the power of Truth , and that the sway of many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Literary Idol of his time or of his circle is in his way quite as likely to set himself forth in independence of God , as is the scientific oracle . Both are Creators in their way , and both are tempted to imitate the thunder of the Deity , by tricks like those of the would-be Jupiter of olden time . The one creates a universe in thought , after the laws of nature . The other presides over the world of fancy , of imagery , of expression . Both give law to admiring circles . The sway of the literary demi-god is however the most capricious , the least to be counted on , and the most difficult to be resisted . Surely no other instance need be referred to , than is found in the influence of Carlyle over poor Sterling . We have only to study the history of this single heroworshiper , to understand how fatal and blighting may be the breath of genius . We need only read the life of the victim by his destroyer , to ponder upon the envious contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardian angel he had found it so hard to wrest his prey , to mark the scornful sneers with which he speaks of the faith and services of the brightest days of Sterling , and of the truths that gave him all his hope in death , in order to be convinced of the deadly power of literary associations , to blast the faith of the men of these times . We might adduce another instance from the history of American literature , but we forbear . Another occasion for the new unbelief we find in the fact , that so much of the knowledge of literary men is derived at // second-hand from reviews and critical works . The advantages of this method of learning no sane man will deny . It brings to our knowledge many subjects of which otherwise we should be entirely ignorant . It presents in a compact form and at a single view , the most important facts and the most weighty arguments . it opens to us the sources of information , showing what are the authorities to which we may resort for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be , and often is , greatly abused . With many it is the substitute for original reading and independent thought . With many the conclusions of their favorite author are received with implicit deference , as though they were the dogmas of inspiration and the results of unerring sagacity . Expression is everything . Audacity of manner carries the field , and wins the victory . Boldness of assertion , biting sarcasm , contemptuous ridicule , sneering allusion , are the weapons most preferred . The easy victim of the critic triumphs in his own subjection to the caprices of his master , as though both the critic and the reader were not second-hand thinkers , seduced by the superficialness of their own knowledge , into a self-complacent dream of their limitless wisdom . We regret the fact , but we believe it true , that the excessive reading of reviews , and the frequent hearing of confident lecturers at an early period of one 's studies , is doing immense evil among the youthful aspirants after literary eminence , in rendering them conceited , contemptuous , and indocile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant . Now it is upon minds more or less influenced by this kind of training , that the new unbelief can act with the greatest advantage . They may be men of superior native endowments . Their training in many respects may have been thorough and enlarged . They may be quick to appreciate , insatiable in their curiosity , noble in their impulses , and yet , if their principles have been formed by these second-hand processes and their prejudices shaped by the caprices of their favorite authors , they are the easy victims of the new unbelievers . The argument for the Truth of a Supernatural Christianity , is a cumulative argument . Its parts must be taken together , and be weighed in their mutual relations to produce complete conviction . Single facts taken out of their connection , distorted and misrepresented by the confident critic , can not only be deprived of their force in favor of Christianity , but can be turned into the strongest arguments against it . The opportunity furnished to an antagonist dealing with general statements , and with readers ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too tempting not to be often used . // It is a fact , beyond question , that the vehicles of influence on these subjects are reviews , lectures , fugitive pamphlets , or digests of systems , and that these have become with multitudes of active men , the authorities from which their principles are received . It would seem to require some little effrontery , for a reviewer to expect that thinking men would accept with any degree of respect , the attempt to illustrate the history of Christianity by that of Mormonism . And yet this has been done very recently , in a journal of no mean influence , and under circumstances which indicated that the writer was entirely unconscious of the monstrous impudence of the endeavor . Indeed , we can scarcely determine by any standard a priori , how much intellectual acumen and intellectual acquisition is consistent with the least possible intellectual judgment . The New Infidelity has gained no slight advantage from the philanthrophic and reforming movements of the times . The great end of Christianity , it has argued , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , it claims , is the whole of Christianity . The benevolent man is the true Christian , whatever be his faith or his want of faith in Miracles or Theologies . In this mode of reasoning and these confident appeals , it is encouraged by the practical tendencies of the times , and the general excitement concerning plans of reform . It forgets however the fact , that means are as necessary as their ends . Nay , that the dignity and importance of the end , may be used to show that that which is indispensable as a means to this end , must have been actually employed . If to make man benevolent , is the only end of Christianity , and if in order to make men benevolent Christianity had need to be introduced by miracles and sustained by a faith in the record of miracles , then there is a strong probability that Christianity was thus accredited and forced upon the attention and obedience of men . That such a belief has been an element of its force since the post-apostolic age , no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without such a belief , has never been proved by the test of experiment . The so-called Christians of these days , who acknowldge no obligation to this faith , may be more indebted to it than they are willing to confess . They forget also that if the human race could from their present point of attainment dispense with such a faith , this does not at all prove the race would ever have reached such an elevation , without its aid . Granting that it was necessary in bringing men up to their present level of moral and religious faith , to suppose that this necessity was supplied for eighteen centuries , by the agency of a mistaken belief in mira // des , which was propagated by a delusion and a lie , is to dishonor both the resources and the honesty of that wisdom and goodness which presides over the universe . But again , the new unbelief points with confidence to the practical errors of the Scriptures , in regard to certain great moral duties , and it tells us in the light of modern discoveries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illumination is sure to be but darkness ; the authoritative director of the actions of men is proved to be a blind leader of the blind . Its authority is nothing on such points . It was a book for other times , but is no book for these times . It can not therefore be a book for all time . The Ethics of the Old Testament were not only deficient but positively bad ; those of the New , clearly deficient . Such arguments as these are confidently used . They are urged with the fire and bitterness of fierce denunciation . But they are based upon an error . They assume that the Scriptures in most cases teach the rules of duty by particular commands and not by general principles , that certain applications of these principles might be right at one time which are not in another ; that the same external action changes its import and its moral character , as the circumstances alter . They assume moreover that , in respect to Temperance and Slavery a given external act , which was allowed in earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that it must first be proved that any external act allowed by divine teaching is under any possible supposition wrong even in these days of illumination . We regret to be forced to confess that not a few Christian teachers have aided the new unbelievers in these means of attack upon the Scriptures . In their zeal for reform , they defame their own Bible ; they call in question the inspired wisdom of the apostles ; they dishonor the moral truth of the Great Teacher himself . They even out-do the enemies of the church in their vituperations of its preachers and members , dishonor the pulpit by personal scandal , sow broadcast the seeds of unbelief in the minds of the multitudes who delight in satire if it be sanctioned by the pulpit , and are marvelously edified by clerical defamation . The New Infidelity thrives upon the weak defenses of Christianity . If there is any one fervent prayer which Christianity might be supposed to utter , that prayer should be , " de fend me from my defenders . " Many of the friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument in its support is to be received as valid . At all events , its weakness and error must not be exposed , for it may convince // some one who is weak in the faith , and weaker still in his intellect . Others , forasmuch as they have a zeal for the truth , feet impelled to speak in its defense and utter all manner of weak commonplaces and inept argumentations , making themselves and their cause the laughing-stock of the acute unbeliever . Indeed it would seem in many quarters , that the sacredness of the cause is thought not only to justify but to require weakness and folly in its defenders . Arguments which if advanced in the support of any other cause would be treated with contempt , are boldly repeated , as though they would not fall to the ground from their weakness , if they had not already a thousand times been slain . The well founded arguments of assailants are treated with disingenuousness or passed over in silence . Concession is not thought of . Candor is not allowed . The assailant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his reasonings are folly . There is no treatment in which unbelief so much rejoices as in this attitude of the defenders of Christianity . There is no soil so rich to promote the growth of a vigorous and confident Infidelity as that which is enriched by the decay and corruption of weak arguments that have been produced in such profusion , and offend the sacred enclosure in which they grow . The disputes and follies of Theologians have done much to occasion and foster the new unbelief . The earnest inquirer after the historic truth of Christianity , the honest sceptic as to whether its miracles of power are fable or fact , can not but be amazed at the excessive importance which is attached to inferior and even frivolous questions by many of the professed believers in its wonders . The bold assailant of its historic realities points with confidence to the little consideration which its great facts secure , in comparison with the most trivial matters , as a decisive proof , that their belief can not be earnest . And surely we are forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is come in the flesh , to give redemption from sin and the victory over death , to all who receive him , no other question can be of momentous consequence . If the Son of God has indeed trodden this earth , and conquered death , and reigns unseen over the kingdom which he founded when he was present with man , then it is the duty and the dignity of man to trust him for pardon , to be like him in character , to speak out and act out the great truths which he taught and lived . To contend with intemperate zeal about matters of inferior interest , in comparison with which the great fact which can give them any interest , shines out like the sun among the stars , is not only folly in itself , but it does infinite service of evil , to // the cause of unbelief . The looker-on thinks and the bold unbeliever speaks out the fact . What mean these contending Confessions about the philosophical relations of truths , in the substantial import of which all agree . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against altar , of baptism against baptism , of the bishop of two orders against the bishop of three , of the reader of the liturgy against the reader of the psalms , of the reader of the psalms against the reader of the sermon . How is it that the names of Wesley and of Edwards , and of Cranmer and of Fuller , appear at times to excite warmer zeal than the greater name of Jesus ? Can it be possible that hundreds of the whole Christian ministry seem to care more to hunt out the least leaven of a fancied heresy , than to bring in the purifying belief in the great fact that makes the difference between heresy and truth of any value at all ? The annual strifes of the Greek and Latin Church over the fancied tomb of the Saviour , on the very spot where they imagine was wrought the greatest wonder that the earth ever witnessed , are rightly the scorn of the unbelieving Turk . Surely it can not be , he thinks , that these Christians believe that Christ ever triumphed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they belie his name , dishonor his spirit and blaspheme his teachings , by such fanatical hate and fratricidal strife . The same impression is produced upon the mind of the unbeliever of our day , as he ponders oveithe bitterness and bigotry , the superstition and hate , which deform sectarian Christendom , which dishonor the Christian ministry , which desecrate the pulpit , and which fill the religious journals with perpetual backbiting and strife . Surely if Christians pondered the fact that Christ had indeed been among them , that he had washed the feet of his disciples , and had loved them unto death , so that believing in him they should never die ; the grandeur of this surpassing truth , the overpowering energy of the affections which it elicits , would shame away all occasion for this reproach of the unbeliever . But this reproach Christianity is doomed to suffer , and that most justly , until the scorn of the unbel*ver shall bring her to a better mind . In a day like this , the acute intellects of her assailants will see her inconsistencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church is to continue to present the aspect of the " Church termagant , " she may expect to render service to the able and fearless , the acute and acomplished Infidelity with which she has now to contend . So far as this Infidelity seeks to find an argument in these contentions , for the falsehood of the supernatural claims of Christianity , it can always be answered with the ready reply-that if Theologians and Sectarians are made no better by Chris* // tianity , this only proves how much worse they would be without it . We can not but hope that the new Infidelity will render important service to the Christianity which it assails . If it incites her disciples to a more earnest and consistent moral and religious zeal , it will do much for the cause which it seeks to destroy . If it shall arouse the intellect of believers to a more earnest consideration of the grounds of our faith , and to a more simple-hearted reliance on the great facts which lie at the basis of this faith , the grandeur of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing destinies which they involve , will fire her zeal and purify her love , and transform herlife . If her ministry , instead of being confined to a round of commonplaces or the repetitions of outworn exhortations , shall enter more fully into the historic truth of the record , in order to bring therefrom more and more fully the living facts , which the evangelic history records , the intellect of the ministry will be quickened , the circle of their thoughts will be widened , and their views of the grandeur of their own work will be exalted . We hope and believe that this will be the result of the conflict in which the ministry will soon be forced more distinctly to engage-the conflict hand to hand , for the living facts of the record . This new Infidelity will soon penetrate into every hamlet . It will be talked of at the work-bench . It will be mooted in the family . It will be conversed of in the social circle . It will find its noisy advocates among the fearless and the conceited . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by denunciation . It must be reasoned down by the simplicity of apostolic argument , and lived down by the simplicity of an apostolic life . Creeds will not fence it out , nor can stately sanctimony , striding by with lofty disdain , appal it . Neither the Puritan 's vigor , nor the Wesleyan 's zeal ,  --  neither " the Episcopal cravat , " nor the Puseyite 's surplice , will charm it away . Nothing save a strong and well-sustained historic faith , and a whole-souled , enlightened and harmonious character , that gracefully uses the blessings of life , and meekly endures its sorrows-whose tastes andaffections , whose purposes and aims , whose courtesies and manners are all of heaven-nothing but these shall sustain the church upon her foundations , and win for her , new victories . Shall she be true to herself ? Shall she awake to her high destiny ? Shall she understand the signs of the times ? " When the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith upon the earth ? " Alas , there is faith enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man , and in the fact of his first appearing . The Puseyite has faith in wax candles and prayers from a priest with his back // towards the people . The Ecciesiologist has faith in symbolic architecture-in the form of the lectern and the ornaments of the altar . The old fashioned Churchman has faith in the three orders of the ministry , the apostolic succession , and the sovereign efficacy of Baptismal regeneration . Old Presbytery has faith in the longer and shorter Catechisms , and Young Presbytery in the Lords Presbyters , and Congregationalism in the Lords brethren . The Conservative has faith in reaction to the extremest dogmas , that have ever hung as a millstone around the neck of Christianity . The fiery Radical has faith in progress to what , he does not ask , or how , he does not care , if it only be progress . They all in general and particular have faith in fine churches , and fine music , and fine sermons , and fine prayers , and fine anniversaries , but how much faith have they in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first appearing , in the wondrous import of those facts , and in the awful grandeur of his kingdom , " when he shall come to he glorified in his saints , and to be admired in all them that believe .
