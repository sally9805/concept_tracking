The Higher Law . December , THE HIGHER ILAW. * AMONG the extraordinary manifestations of the age is to be ranked the schism which has been introduced by the slavery question , into all religious denominations , in regard to the teachings of the bill upon that question . Feeble-minded persons talk of a dissolution of the Union , because politeal parties have been sundered through the use of the slavery question in the hands of demagogues , mostly half-educated lawyers having affinities only for the knavery of the profession , who attempt a forced construction of the Constitution ; or , failing in that , reject its authority , and repudiate its obligations . So , also , in most religious denominations , ill-taught and ambitious preachers who take counsel only of their own base desires , pervert the meaning of the scriptures , and attempt to make it a stepping-stone to their own earthly advancement , by adapting their expositions of the holy word to the political prejudices of their hearers . Others of this class , unable to wrest the meaning of God 's teachings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it under foot in contempt of its precepts , which do not accord with their superior wisdom . Out of these violent discussions , political and religious , has apparently grown this great good , viz. , that the Constitution in the political world , and the Bible in the religious world , have been more thoroughly examined and discussed , and the truth of both instruments has been more clearly developed and impressed upon the public mind . The time has been when the Roman Catholics professing the universal religion refused to receive the Bible as the perfect rule of faith . The abuses into which that religion necessarily and consequently ran , produced the Reformation . The Bible then became the object of prayerful study by all Protestants , and its revealed truths , proclaimed with fear and trembling , were alone referred to as a rule of action . Of late , many preachers have not sought constantly to refer back to the divine revelation , but rather to adapt it to circumstances as they find them , claiming for it an " expansion of sense . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last fifty years has been such as to change the construction which had been placed upon the geography , astronomy , geology and natural history of the scriptures . These new discoveries , however , have not invalidated , but only served to elucidate the scriptures ; and it is matter of great rejoicing that the progress of science has been from time to time alleged to be in opposition to the teachings of the scriptures , since such allegations have led to deeper and constantly renewed research into the true meaning of the divine word , always resulting in its triumph . In the same manner that religious heresies have only led to more frequent reference to the foundation of the Christian faith , have political heresies led to a constant refreshment of the public mind in relation to the stipulations of our glorious Constitution . It has been matter of extreme surprise to many observant persons on the occurrence of any political agitation involving constitutional principles , to find how many intelligent persons are absolutely ignorant even of such primary distinctions , as that between the Constitutions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few months of occasional * 1st . Speech on the Slavery Resolutions delivered in the General Assembly which met in * troit , May , 1850 . By Joseph C. Stiles . // agitation like that which we have passed , is absolutely necessary to the political education of the people . So , also , in the religious world , indolent and time-serving preachers go on from week to week , and from year to year , dozing over their divine minion , and wresting its interpretation according ready way of reaching and retaining popularity , until some great popular excitement makes a recurrence to the true teachings of God upon the point agitated indispensable . Then it is that the time-serving supremacy of " blind-uuides " becomes manifest , and the cause of religion purges itself of false advocates . The churches of nearly all the Christian denominations are spread throughout the United States , and all the members of each denomination were in communion with each other , acknowledging the same ecclesiastical discipline as applicable to the principles of faith professed . Each of these denomina. tions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they believed were the true expressions of its teachings . They all based their hopes on the merits of the Redeemer , and lived in harmony , at least within the several sects , even if occasionally some want of charity for the belief of others escaped the more zealous . For more than 1800 years the followers of Christ were slave-holders , and they never in all that time doubted the perfect consistency of their conduct , in that respect , with their religious professions , the commands of Christ and the teachings of his Apostles , in regard to that relation with their fellow-men . The federal compact expressly recognizes the servitude of blacks as a political institution , and until within a few years past that institution of the South existed in the undisputed recognition of the Bible , the Constitution , and religious association . In the course of the excitements which attend our popular elections , political partizans set up a sectional cry against the existence of an institution which belongs only to states , and in their treasonable and unholy zeal , threatened to repudiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprived of a portion of their sovereignty which had been reserved to them when the Constitution was formed . The plea was raised , that the admission of new slave states was a violation of the Constitution . To strengthen , prolong , and give effect to these attempts upon the Constitution , a similar heresy was introduced into the several religious denominations , through the influence of partizans over faithless preachers . For we consider a sentinel who admits an enemy through inattention , or want of perception , as faithless as he who does so for a bribe . This heresy was , that the mere holding of slaves is a sin , per Se , and that the discipline of the church must be invoked upon all who do not instantly manumit their slaves . This conduct has caused the separation of many of the denominations into n6rthern and southern churches . What had been considered compatible with Christian conduct for more than eighteen centuries , was suddenly , under political promptings , denounced as so utterly inconsistent with all faith in Christ , that denominations which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other doctrinal points , suddenly disagreed on this one head , and separated with angry feelings . The " Higher Law " which a political demagogue had declared superior to our Constitution , religious demagogues declared superior to Christ 's mandate- " to love thy nei*hbor as thyself . " Whole denominations divided with ill-nature , and went to law about their common property , because one portion were alleged by the other to have violated , through slave-holding , the command " to love one another ! " // The charge made by a class of religionists of all denominations at the North , is , that the holding of slaves , " pure and simple , " is " always a sin , " " a heinous crime in the sight of God , " " a sin of appalling magnitude . " If this be true , that slave-holding , under all circumstances , is sin of itself no matter what may be the conduct of master and servant respectively to each other , what are we to think of that Bible which teaches that a holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this alleged sin to his chosen people , teaching them how , and with what to buy slaves ; forbidding in the decalogue one man to covet another 's slave , * and never intimating , even to his chosen Abraham , a slave-holder , with whom he walked , and of whom he said , " shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do ? " that slave-holding was wrong ; but , also , that when the Mosaic dispensation passed away , at the advent of Christ , the Redeemer himself and his Apostles , although denouncing other practices of the Jews , countenanced by precept and example the holding of slaves , even in that dark age of slavery , when under the Roman rule they were so plenty as to have been of little value , and therefore subject to the unrestrained cruelty of capricious masters , who held their lives in their hands , and who , as history informs us , sometimes slaughtered them to flavor fishes , fed with their flesh . How must the devout reader of the Bible , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as did the Protestants , on their knees , with Bunyan , be struck with horror , when he turns from the holy page , to hear a fierce political zealot , in sacerdotal robes , rudely denouncing , as " a heinous crime , " that which " God sanctioned in the Old Testament , and permitted in the New ! " It has been the case , however , that on such an emergency as we have lately encountered , the most eminent minds of all political parties , Cass and Clay , Dickinson and Webster with numbers of other statesmen worthy of any age or country , have stepped forward and rescued the Constitution from the dangers which it encountered from small ambitious assailants ; so also the Bible , in its truth and purity , has not wanted the clear expositions of learned men , sound scholars , and faithful ministers of God , to bring back the public mind , diverted by false friends , to its letter and spirit . The letters of Dr. Fuller , and the address of the Rev. Joseph C. Stiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the head of this article , are among the most able and unanswerable arguments in favor of divine truth . Dr. Stiles has , by ill health , been compelled to resign the charge of the Mercer-street church of New-York , and to accept the special secretaryship of the American Bible Society . His great talents , eminent philanthropy and conspicuous piety , will thus find a broader field for their exercise , in a manner which will conduce to his health , and we may , en passant , congratulate the society that they have secured the services of one so profoundly versed in Biblical literature , and so deeply imbued with the true spirit of the divine word . Dr. Stiles , in his address , which is very elaborate , takes up in order every argument that has been advanced as a reason why a written treaty should be violated , the rights of others infringed , civil and servile war provoked , the only republican institutions in the world overturned , human progress stayed , and even civilization itself jeopardized ; and he has left these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their position . The address , which was in consequence of a demand for the expulsion of slave-holders from the Presbyterian Church , has two general heads : What is the moral character of slave-holding ? What the duties of the parties concerned ? Under the first head the memorialists affirm that sla ' *e-holding is a sin . Dr. Stiles in reply states , that there are three moral grades , one perfectly virtuous , planned by God , and in harmony with Christianity ; another purely vicious , forbidden by God , and repugnant to Christianity ; and a third of a compound nature , which was neither planned by God nor forbidden by him , and of this nature is slave-holding ; but its existence is perfectly consistent with the most devout piety and the most perfect teachings of both the Old and New Testament . The arguments advanced to sustain the sinfulness of slave-holding are classed thus : - lst , " the liberty argument ; " 2d , " the Scripture argument ; " 3d , " the historical argument ; 4th , " the progress argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These arguments are all , with the greatest clearness and force , shown unanswerably , to operate on the side of slavery , and not against it , under our institutions . Under the second head , viz. : - " the duties of the parties concerned , " the matter is plain : slave-holding being no sin , per se , the duties of master and servant respectively towards each other can only be subjects of special investigation in each case . If the rules laid down for their conduct in the New Testament are violated by individuals , the conduct of those individuals only becomes obnoxious to the discipline of the Church . God , in the New Testament , commands servants or slaves , " that have believing masters : let them not despise them , because they are brethren ; but rather do them service , because they are faithful and 6eloved partakers of the benefit . " Here were believing slaveholders , called by God , " faithful and beloved . " Thus slave-holding was not sin , although , nevertheless , some slave-holders might commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arraigned for their special crimes , the system itself could not be denounced as a sin any more than that because adultery is a crime , therefore the marriage state is sinful because it may lead to adultery . Although all the arguments recounted are ably and unanswerably met , we have in the scope of this article only to do with the " Scripture argument , " and incidentally with the " progress argument . " That the tendency of that cour*e of argument which first assumes what is right , and then endeavors to find warr* nt for it in the Scripture , is the substitution of human deductions for divine declarations , Dr. Stiles shows with much clearness . The Scriptures , from the earliest period within the scope of the Mosaic history to the latest revelation of the New Testament , command , recognize , and regulate slavery . The Almighty recognizes it in the tenth commandment , commands it to the Jews , through whose priests and leaders it is perpetuated to the time of Christ and his Apostles , who apply to its management the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This long connection of the Almighty with slavery , sophists now denounce as an immutable sin , because Christ commanded , " Do unto others as ye would have others do unto you . " This paradox is produced , because the meaning of the latter clause is wrongly understood . The meaning of the phrase is , that we should do unto others , in their circumstances , as we would have them do to us were we in the same . Thus it does not mean that we should treat children // 612 The Higher Law . as we would be treated ourselves , but that we should conduct ourselves towards them as we would be treated were we children . The instructions to servants to obey their masters , and to masters not to oppress slaves , was in this spirit , and perfectly in harmony with the command . The following are some of the leading passages from the Old Testament , showing the commands of the Almighty in relation to slaves : " Abimelech took sheep , and oxen , and men-servants , and maid-servants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 . " Pharaoh , too , enriched him with sheep , and oxen , and he-asses , and men-servants , and maid-servants . ' " " A. sojourner of a priest , or an hired servant , shall not eat of the holy thing . But if the priest buy any soul with his money , he shall eat of it , and he that is born in his house , they shall eat of it . " - Lev. xxii. , 10 , 11 . " Both thy bondmen , and thy boodmaids , which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids . Moreover , of the children of the *trangers that do sojourn among you , of them shall ye buy , and of their families that are with you , which they begat in your land ; and they shall be your possession . " - Lev. xxv . " If a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod , and he die under his hand , he shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two , he shall not be punished ; for he is his money . " - Exod. xxi. , 20 , 21 . " And if a man sell his daughter to he a maid-servant , she shall not go out as the men-servants do . If she please not her master , who hath betrothed her to himself , then shall he let her be redeemed : to sell her to a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her . " " Ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you , to inherit them for a possession . They shall be your bondmen forever . " - Lev. xxv . " If thou buy a Hebrew servant , six years shall he serve : and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing . If he came in by himself , he shall go out by himself : if he were married , then his wife shall go out with him . If his master have given him a wife , and she have borne him sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her master 's , and he shall go out by himself . And if the servant shall plainly say , I love my master , my wife , and my children ; I will not go out free : Then his master shall bring him unto the judges ; he shall also bring him to the door , or unto the door-post ; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl ; and he shall serve him forever . " - Exod. xxi. , 2-6 . These clear and positive commands of the Deity , in relation to the purchase and treatment of slaves , are too direct to be evaded , although Dr. Wayland attempts to do so , by asserting that the word " shalt " is prophetic , and not mandatory . The commandment says that thou " shalt " not covet thy neighbor 's man-servant ; that , probably , is as much " prophetic " as in the other case . The quot*d paragraphs show not only that the Jews could hold strangers for ever as slaves , but by going through certain ceremonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God commanded , and what pretended preachers of God 's word now denounce as a " sin of appalling magnitude . " This condition of slavery continued , in common with other Jewish dispensations , down to the advent of Christ . By his teaching he then set aside many things , such as divorce , which had been permitted by Moses ; but neither Christ nor any of his disciples ever said a word against slavery . They merely applied the general law of love to relations between master and slave , instead of the harsh authority permitted by Moses ; as thus , in the verse quoted from Exodus , there was no punishment for killing a slave , if the slave survived the fatal blow two days ; and the reason given is , that " he is money " - there was time to sell him . The New Testament modifies this by enjoining // masters to be merciful to slaves , remembering " that they also have a Master in heaven . " The following are some of the leading New Testa ment regulations upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ . Not with eye-service , as men-pleasers ; but as the servants of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart ; with good will doing service , as to the Lord , and not to men ; knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth , the same shall he receive of the Lord , whether he be bond or free . " Colossians iii . 22-25 : " Servants , obey in all things your masters according to the flesh ; not with eye-service , as men-pleasers ; but in singleness of heart , fearing God : and whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as to the Lord , and not unto men ; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance : for ye serve the Lord Christ . But he that doeth wrong , shall receive for the wrong which he hath done ; and there is no respect of persons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor , that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed . And they that have believing masters , let them not despise them , because they are brethren ; but rather do them service , because they are faithful and beloved , partakers of the benefit . These things teach and exhort . If any man teach otherwise , and consent not to wholesome words , even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ , and to the doctrine which is according to godliness , he is proud , knowing nothing , but doting about questions and strifes of words , whereof cometh envy , strife , railings , evil surmisings , perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds , and destitute of the truth , supposing that gain is godliness : from such withdraw thyself . " Titus ii . 9 , 10 : " Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters , and to please them well in all things ; not answering again ; not purloining , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine of God our Saviour in all things . " 1 Peter ii . 18-23 : " Servants , be subject to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward . For this is thankworthy , if a man for conscience toward God endure grief , suffering wrongfully . For what glory is it , if , when ye be buffeted for your faults , ye shall take it patiently ? But if , when ye do well , and suffer for it , ye take it patiently , this is acceptable wdh God . For even hereunto were ye called : l ) ecause Christ also suffered for us , leaving us an example , that ye should follow his steps : who did no sin , neither was guile found in his mouth : who when he was reviled , reviled not again ; when he suffered , he thieatened not ; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously . " Ephesians vi . 8 : " And ye masters , do the same things unto them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heaven ; neither is there respect of persons with him . " Colossians iv . 1 : " Masters , render to your servants that which is *ust and equal ; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven . " Here are constant and reiterated injunctions to slaves to observe passive obedience . Why should this subject so much have attracted the attention of the apostles ? - clearly because the general teachings of the gospel , in respect to brotherhood in the Lord , had a tendency to prompt to insubordination in earthly things , especially towards unconverted masters ; hence were necessary the continued admonitions of the apostles . In. all these instructions , no word escaped these teachers that the relation of master and slave was sinful ; but , on the contrary , those slavehoders who obeyed the rules were " faithful and beloved ; " not only so , but the apostle Paul himself at the age of 60 or 70 years , fully recognized the // right of his pious friend Philemon to own the slave Onesimus , but also to punish him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remit this punishment , not because to inflict it would be a sin , but as a personal favor to him , Paul . The case is stated by M'Knight thus " Onesimus , a slave , on some disgust having run away from his master , Philemon , came to Rome , and falling into want , as is supposed , he applied to the apostle , " &amp;c . " After his conversion , Onesimus abode with the apostle , and served him with the greatest assiduity and affection . But being sensible of his fault in running away from his master , he wished to repair that injury by returning to him . At the same time , being afraid that on his return his master would juflict on him the punishment which , by the law or custom of Phrygia , was due to a fugitive slave , and which , as Grotius says , he could inflict without applying to any magistrate , he besought the apostle to write to Philemon , requesting to forgive and receive him again into his family , " &amp;c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed in this affair , we must not , with some , suppose that Philemon was keen and obstinate in his resentments , but rather , that having a number of slaves , on whom the pardoning of Onesimus too easily might have had a bad effect , he might judge some punishment necessary for a warning to the rest , &amp;c . The apostle would by no means detain Onesimus without Philemon 's leave ; because it belonged to him to dispose of his own slave in the way he thought proper . Such was the apostle 's regard to justice , and to the rights of mankind ! " Now , notwithstanding the solicitude of Paul for the fate of the slave , he never once hinted that his brother in Christ was sinning in either holding a slave or punishing him , but urges thus : " If he hath annoyed thee , or oweth thee aught , put that on mine account . " Here is no rampant and furious denunciations of slavery as a sin , like the popularity-hunting Pharisees of the present day ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and susceptible of the same culture and advancement , as the owner . If under such circumstances neither Christ nor his apostles , although they solemnly declared that " they had not shunned to declare the whole counsel of God , " could detect sin , whence have the prophet Munday , Abby Folsom , Mr. Beecher , and the negro Douglas , got their inspiration ? We here arrive at a great distinction between ancient and modern slavery , which none of the writers seem to touch upon with sufficient clearness . It is , that the slaves are of a lower race of men , and that their condition of servitude , although lower than the free condition of the white race , is quite as much a condition of progress . Indeed , when we consider not only the present cannibal condition of the natives of Africa , as coinpared with the Christian slaves of the United States , but also the progress of the latter in the last fifty years , we are constrained to admit , that the blacks make greater progress than even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish servitude , as well as that of other nations ; and the New Testament teachings recognize it among whites . This phase of slavery has passed away , and those Canaanites , or the black race , whom God speciaHy denounced as slaves to the other races for ever , have lived in the lowest state of degradation down to the present day ; and only that portion who have fulfilled the divine mandate in serving the whites , have made any progress . To the Christian , the philanthropist , and the friends of humanity , this progress is matter of the most heartfelt rejoicing . The testimony of Dr. Stiles upon this head is of so interesting a character , that we can not refrain from the following extracts : // " IV. - TssE PRACTICAL ARGUMENT . Brethren contend that experience establishes the essential sinfulness of slaveholding . The gospel reforms society . The Church has effectually tried the doctrine that slaveholding is not essentially sinful , and nothing is done . And nothing will be done until we change the ground , come back to the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be responded If the tardiness of the operation disproves the genuineness of the principle , why not throw up the plan of missionary operations ? Surely our missionary progress has been slow . Why not look up another religion ? Christianity , after six thousand years , has yet most of her work to do . But I answer more particularly : All things considered , if more has been done by the Gospel in many branches of Christian benevolence in this land , during the last thirty years , I know it not . Let us study the work of the Southern Church with an impartial mind , and inquire whether opposing brethren , instead of venting a prejudiced conscience fretted by the imagination of a stationary criminality in the whole business , should not thank God and take courage , in view of the wholesome progress of the cause ; and instead of calling for discipline upon Southern brethren , whether they should not heartily lend a helping hand in the work they do ? I invite my brethren to glance over the field with me , and candidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of anti-slavery sentiment probably ever made by man , has been uttered by the South . I doubt not that pure and strong anti-slavery convictions are entertained at the North , and that our brethren furnish every reasonable evidence of their sincerity and earnestness . But we have no evidence yet of the supreme strength of this conviction . How will you try the purity and the power of a sentiment in the human heart ? Surely not by words only ; not by any process of stubborn and imj ) erious public agitation ; not by any determined political stand against Southern measures ; not by any transient aid and comfort rendered to flying slaves . All these and many similar developments may cost but little . On the contrary , the power of a principle exhibits itself in the labors it can put forth , the 01 ) j ) OSitiOiIs it can resist , the self-denials it can bear-in a word , by the sacrifices it can make . Where shall we find the most commanding expression of that calm , enlightened , benign , high-souled anti-slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England . For freedom in the West Indies , 520,000,000 pounds sterling ! ! This was a noble testimony of her will to give freedom to the slave , the like of which our Northern friends have never approached . Three things , however , should work some abatement of our first impressinos of British devotion to this cause . This sum was furnished by the very richest treasury in the world . Only the interest of ' this sum has been paid ; the principal never will be until the great English debt is cancelled . Nor do I deem it scandal to say , that probably no small portion of this sum was paid to self-interest , and not by benevolent principle . A friend travelling in England at the time of the preparatory public agitation of the subject , informs me that one argument which told powerfully in persuading the English people to adopt this measure was the widely published doctrine , that , since free labor was so far superior to slave labor , by this operation West India sugars would be purchased in England at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that England would receive 100,000,000 pounds in return for her 20,000,000 . It gives me pleasure to remind you , Mr. Moderator , that near 250,000 slaves are computed to have been freed in this country , mainly at the South . Assuming the average value of the slave to be one hundred pounds sterling , you have , sir , upon this principle , more than rivE AND TWENTY MILLION5 or POUNDS STERLING contributed to this cause of putting away slavery from these United States by the 5LAVEIIOLDER5 of the South . Mark the contrast . This immense sum has been actually paid out , not interest only , but principal also ; not by a rich public treasury , but by private families who lived by the slaves they surren // 616 December , dered ; not before the public eye , but in the retirement of private life ; not under the cheering voice of universal praise , but possibly under the chilling looks of many a neighbor who charges the emancipator with the discontent which now springs up in the bosom of his colored family ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but from no other possible motive than conscientious , quiet , kind , anti-slavery sentiment . Let Northern brethren weigh this , and hereafter give to the South the respect due to the very FIRST position of friendship to African freedom by pecunsary sacrzftee . II . The men who dwell south of Mason and Dixon 's line have done more to convert the heathen than the whole world beside . What is the whole number of converted heathen which the American Church presents this day to the eye of God and the world ? - American Board , 26,000 Baptist Missions ,  - -  -  - 15,000 Methodist Missions ,  --  *- - 13,000 Presbyterian Missions , 250 Episcopal Missions , . - - 71 54,321 Observe , Mr. Moderator , one branch of one Christian denomination at the South , viz. , the Methodist Episcopal Church , numbers 134,722 colored members .

Turn your eyes once more to the South .

Simply fix your eye upon one branch respectively of two Christian churches . You will find enrolled upon their list of colored members In the Methodist Chnrch , . - 134,000 Baptist Church 130,000 - 264,000 Thus , sir , a part of the Southern Church holds up this day to the gaze of heaven and earth , scores of thousands MORE of heathen fellow-men hoping in Christ through their labors than all the churches of the Free Soil of the world combined have yet gathered to the Master . Let philanthropists employ all proper methods to FREE the soil of the world . It is a noble cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern brethren weigh one singular fact : these very brethren of the South , upon whom they themselves have been laying on so hard and so long for their cruel oppression of the bondman , and whom , forsooth , from year to year they have been so anxious to persuade Providence to thrust out of the Church , as not worthy of a standing in it-THEsE are the very men whom that very Providence has made the honored instruments , in one sense at least , of doing more for the salva*ion of the heathen world than all the Church militant beside . Yes , let them ponder this . III . The Southern Church has effected a vast amelioration of the social and religious condition of the slave . When landed in this country , the African captive belonged to the most degraded heathen upon the face of the earth . His descendant still needs great improvement , but is far removed from the universal debasement of his progenitor . // 517 Changes for the better have marked the history of slavery , from its introduction to the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in working valuable mod*fications of the laws of the land . An examination of the slave Jaws of successive generations will exhibit a steady advance in the considerate benignity of the legislator . Nor should we overlook the beneficial changes wrought in the spirit and power of ancient statutes , through a constantly improving public sentiment . There are benefits conferred upon the slave by statute , which of old never fully reached him in the administration . From the earliest times there existed a law , forbidding labor on the Sabbath . I well remember , when a boy . the universal custom of taking the servants on the Sabbath day to the corn-house to shell , or to the potato-field to dig , that the weekly plantation allowance of vegetable diet might be distributed . This practice , 1 apprehend , is now universally abolished . That the spirit and principle of the Church did its part in effecting the change , you may learn from this incident . I knew a Church member , who , grieved by the prevalence of this custom , personally persuaded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families , and finding one stout opposer of the innovation , beyond the limits of the Church , he at last calmly apprised him of the law of the land , and of his purpose of becoming public prosecutor if he did not yield to the public sentiment of his neighbors. * * * * * * * * The good influence of the Bible upon the slave , and every man right of direct access to the Word of God is extensively understood . It has long been a common spectacle to see the children of a Southern family at night , or on the Sabbath , employed in teaching the servants to read . It is many years since night-schools , in which colored adults taught colored children to read , were common in all our Southern cities , and I believe well known to city authorities , and generally unmolested by them . It is worthy of observation , that a few years since , when a Southern Legislature , alarmed by abolition interference ,  --  revived this obsolete law , Christian public sentiment at the South felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant , God 's people must move , as best they can , to brincr it back . A consequent impulse was given to oral instruction far and wide , whose results have been singularly happy . One is this : that hundreds of servants learn to read now , where none were taught before . And hundreds of copies of the Scriptures are listmibuted among the slaves at this day , which would never have been receiver if the old law had been permitted to sleep . Thus you perceive , that the steady irnpi'overnent of public sentiment at the South , in part through the fidelity of the Church , has been progressively working a beneficial change in the face of the government toward the slave , not only by procuring the enactment of humane laws , but by breaking down the governing power of unfriendly statutes , and giving force to such benion tion as was a dead letter before . * legisla 2d . The same causes have wrought a corresponding social improvement in all things pertinent to the present comfort and future prospects of the slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to at this Jay , in the physical treatment of Southern servants . Their condition is at least fair in respect to food . raiment , shelter , work , and general discipline . A remarkable revolution has occurred in the habits of Southern society i'especting the discussion of the nature and claims of this relation . Half a century ago , this institution appeared to the mass of Southern population as an impregnable fixture ; and yet it is a singular fact , that , as a topic of deliberate meditation or discourse , it was cl3thed with a forbidding awe , which made it almost as intangible as a plot of treason . Now , he who journeys through the Southern States , in public houses and conveyances may hear as frequent discourse on this subject as on almost any other . And could he compare the sentiments of the present generation with those of the past , he would be delighted to mark the liberal tendency of the times . The steady advance of the spirit of emancipation is another and most interesting feature of the general progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish gratifying testimony on this point . You will not forget , Mr. Moderator , the testimony of one of our brethren on this floor , that in his immediate vicinity one of his neighbors had recently given to this cause $500 ; another , $1,000 ; a third , $2,000 ; a fourth , $3,000-all men in moderate circumstances . Yes , sir , and in the wealthier sections of the South there are those who are this day giving their $50,000 to the freedom of the slave . * * * * * * * * * There are a diversity of established methods in which the master brings the gospel to the servant . In the cities there are large colored churches , sometimes of two or three thousand members . Church edifices they are assisted to erect when necessary . The pulpit is generally supplied by pious , talented , colored preachers ; sometimes by white brethren of the very first talent and highest stations in the Church. * Sabbath-schools , under the tuition of intelligent white teachers , male and female , are in common use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently conduct family prayer , so as to secure sound instruction to the servant . The travelling minister is almost always put in requisition for this service* Instead of the old-fashioned negro " yraise-house , " it is common , in many parts of the country , to build a neat " Plantation Chapel , " and to invite all accessible ministerial aid . I am happy to know , that on this subject of giving judicious religious instruction to the colored population , there is a very commendable fidelity on the part of the stated ministry in all sections of the Southern country . * * * * * * * * But the most important features of this reformation are yet to he noticed . Galechisms , to aid the master in the private instruction of his servant , have been drawn up , if I mistake not , by every prevalent denomination of the South , and distributed amongst the people . the country , too , has been largely districted , ( where this operation was most needed , ) and a missionary employed to devote himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in preaching , teaching , visitation , and Sabbath-school supervision . It is ascertained that the churches built for the worship of the masters , are in many cases injudiciously located for the accommodation of the slaves ; and I am credibly informed that it is quite common to erect a new church in some position selected exclusively for the convenience of the colored population , and devoted entirely to their service . I can think of no religious meetings on this earth more delightful , none that my heart more ardently pants to enjoy , than the worship of the masters and servants of adjacent plantations , under the ministry of their beloved missionary . * * * * * * * * * There has been unceasing agitation of this subject , in the wisest and happiest manner , by Southern men , from the date of the landing of the first slave on American soil . You know , sir , that before the Constitution of the United States was framed , while yet we were colonies of England , the Southern States protested against the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this , I affirm that Southern records , political , religious , literary , and historical , present a constant succession of publications on the subject of slavery , by Southern men of the highest rank and thlent , in church and state , embodying as great a degree of accuracy , kindness , discretion and fidelity of sentiment as characterizes any similar number of publications uttered at the North within the last twenty years . * * * . * * * * Prior to the day when the South felt fretted by abolition interference , now * One such church finds a regular pastor in the President of a College , who receives a salary from the blacks of $600 or $800 . A valued professor in a theological seminary vacated his chair to devote himself exclusively to the instruction of servants . The President of Washington College , Va. , recently resigned his office to conduct a periodical designed to convince his countrymen . of the . evils of the relation of master and servant . // more than twenty years ago , I well remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , rode many miles , called on me at my domicile in the State of Georgia , and soiicited me to become a member of a society which he proposed to form , for the " RELIGIOUS INsTRUcTIoN OF THE COLORED POPULATION . " This devoted and talented minister of Jesus was himself made the General Agent of the Society originated at that time . Through him we put forth the first year an able tract on the " Degradation of the Southern Slave , " and scattered it through the county . this , sir , did its work . We had our anniversary , and reported progress . The second year we drew up , and published , and distributed , an able essay on the " Obligation of the Master . " I noticed the effect of this document in all my itinerations . During the third year we published a " Catechism , " to aid this responsible master in the discharge of his duty to this necessitous member of his family  --  a document , let me say , of such singular value , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a missionary of the American Board , who thought he saw in it the precise desideratum for his own field , and had it printed , and set to the work of reformation among the heathen abroad . Soffer me to say , that this society has been in steady operation from that day to this , not only sending its agent around the district to instruct the slaves at convenient station-houses erected for the jiurpose , but annually reporting , and occasionally publishing , as necessity demanded . To the favorable influence of this movement , first upon the population under its immediate supervision , then upon the counties adjacent , and finally , through its publications , upon the friends of the . cause at a distance , and even in other states , multitudes can bear witness . What had abolition to do with the origin or power of this operation ? It was my privilege , about the period of the formation of this society , to visit an eminent Christian who dwelt in a neighboring state , and where , you will remark , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of religious fidelity to the colored population as distinguishes any section of the South . I learned that he had been in the habit of employing a minister to preach to his large family of servants for many years . He informed me , that though his neighbors far and near were at that time favorable to this species of operation , yet , when he first commenced it , he was told that his movement endangered the peace and lives of the whites , and he must desist . He answered their arguments , and moved forward in his duty . They became more serious in their objections ; lie still persisted . At length their opposition waxed so firm and united , that he was driven to tell them : - " Gentlemen , I am engaged in my duty , and before I give it up , I will plant a cannon in every window of my house , and you shall go over my dead body to take away the Word of God from my family . " I had the pleasure of preaching the gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his early opposers led him to give me this history . Here is an operation that dates back its origin perhaps forty years from this time . What had abolition to do with the waking up of this man 's mind to duty ? We accord to it , with all its ill-workings , somne collateral stimulation of a good cause ; and its friends , in turn , should concede that wherever similar improvements are witnessed in Southern society at this day , they may have had a similar independent origin . " The spirit of progress , it will be observed , is exactly in accordance with the gospel and the constitution ; an adherence to the latter in its letter and spirit , permits the beni6n influence of the former to work out its results without disturbing the progressive welfare of either race . When such immense interests of temporal welfare and eternal salvation are at stake , with what horror and loathing are those babbling miscreants to be regarded , who are willing to betray their country and the cause of humanity , deny their Redeemer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the sake of a personal notoriety .
