Amen ! " Robert Browning 's " Flight of the Duchess . " The Marquis di Sangrido owns the grim old palace that fronts the public square in Rieti . He is not a favorite with the peasants . Even the children of that little Italian town pass the great door or portone of the palace hurriedly , and their prattle sinks into a whisper beneath those gloomy windows . No guests ever come from Rome and pass into the palace with festal welcome to visit the Marquis di Sangrido . Those heavily-framed , gloomy windows never flash with the brilliancy of revels within . They are like deadlights  --  like the staring eyes of a corpse . When the summer-storms burst among the hills , and the gleaming lightning and rattling thunders appal the superstitious peasants , while the church-bell rings solemnly in the storm , and kneeling , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the sign of the cross , the yellow palace of the Marquis di Sangrido stands sullen in the tempest , sardonic with a sickly glare , against the heavy black cloud that rises behind it . On the holy feast-days , when the sun lies lazily in the great square of Rieti all the long Italian morning , and the peasants , in gay costume , dance the Tarantella and the Saltarella , and with music and flowers go into the church to hang votive pictures to the Madonna , one suspending the shoe which he wore when Our Blessed Lady saved him from drowning ; and another , the cap of when he went to the wars , from which he returned safely ; the Marquis di Sangrido does not come , nor look out of those gloomy windows , nor send wine and money . But often in the midst of the festival a fear falls upon the peasants , like a cloudshadow upon a waving , glittering rye-field ; they look furtively at the sullen yellow palace , which watches them in malicious silence ; a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great gates to swing open , creaking upon rusty hinges , and a black procession of death and despair to issue forth and chill the summer day . It is in vain that the servants of the Marquis di Sangrido endeavor to be friendly and sociable with the people of Rieti . They are regarded as parts of that gloom and mystery which envelop the palace and its master . Their most cheerful smile is suspected ; their jokes make the people shudder , for they believe them to be magic spells in grinning masks . They move in a circle of solitude , for every inhabitant of the town instinctively withdraws , until the servants , too , gradually grow sardonic and gloomy ; and when they appear it is as if the yellow old palace were taking a walk , and sullenly cursing the little cowering town of Rieti , that hides upon the plain beyond the Campagna . Twice a year the great gate of the palace opens . Then the people shrink into their houses and peer through the windows and doors ; for the heavy lumbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a flaring chasseur riding before , and a dozen servants on horseback grouped behind and around like a body-guard . The doors are closed ; the blinds are drawn up ; nothing is seen within the carriage ; but the people of Rieti know that the Marquis is sitting there , alone , in the shadow ; and their terrified and bewitched imaginations enter and sit beside him , and try to see the expression of that face , and to conceive the grimness of his smile , and the demoniacal horror of his frown . But not even their imaginations can figure him . The Marquis di Sangrido sits inscrutable , wrapped in a cloud , and the lumbering state-carriage thunders out of the staring , wondering town , and rolls across the Campagna toward Rome , where the Marquis has another palace . Rieti is then very cheerful , for the Marquis di Sangrido has gone to Rome . Once again during the year the grim gates open , and the heavy carriage , and the little group of servants , and the flaring chasseur leading the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little town of Rieti is chilled and trembles because the Marquis di Sangrido has returned from Rome . It was a pleasant summer-day when I came to Rieti , and after eating the frittata and prosciutto crudo at the albergo , I looked id'y out of the window into the great square of the town . The sun blazed upon the open place , and there was perfect silence in the air . My eyes were dazzled , as I gazed , by the yellow wall of the palace ; and I called the landlord and asked the name of the owner . " The Marquis di Sangrido , " replied the padrone , with a shudder . " Is he here ? " I inquired . " Excellency , no , " returned the host as he moved away . " But tell me , can I get into the house ? there may be pictures  --  or into the grounds ? " " Excellency , God forgive us our sins ! I know nothing , " answered the padrone , with such undisguised fear that I pressed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauntered out immediately toward the Sangrido palace . I was sure that I had struck the trail of a romance ; for what are anguish , doubts , despairs , years of life lost in misery , all the acutest forms of human woe , but romances to the traveller who saunters out on warm summer mornings , when they are the tears and the woes of other people and other years ? I paused before the great gate , sheltered from the sun by the shade of the heavily-projecting mouldings , and almost feared to rattle with my stick upon the massive panels . After a few moments the slide was slipped , and a curious restless glance danced over my face and figure , while a sharp low female voice inquired my business . I answered that I was a stranger passing through Rieti , and wished to see the pictures in the palace , and also the garden , if it were possible . After some sharp questioning , which I answered very simply and directly , the gate was opened , and I entered the court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill-side , and I went directly toward it . The custode , who told me she was the only servant left in the house , the Marquis being in Rome , disappeared , and I passed up the broken , crumbling steps of the terrace in entire solitude . The garden was fallen into decay . Weeds grew and glittered in the walks . The long , narrow avenues of cypress and ilex were not smooth and clipped , but untrimmed boughs and shoots leaned out beyond the line and towered in slim , swaying twigs above . In the misshapen niches of this green wall stood broken statues of discolored marble ; fauns holding to their mouths hands whence the pipes had fallen ; and nymphs who held vases and flowers no longer . In carrefours , where the paths crossed , were huge globular vases , broken and stained , but overflowing with the leathery leaves of the aloe , like jagged green flame flaring and falling . The great plants burst out luxuriantly from the crevices of the walls , and lay sprawled over them , lazily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half-loathsome miniatures of crocodiles ; and high over all , the dome-topped stone-pines lay like heavy bars of cloud in the glittering air . In the universal sunshine and ruin , there were only silence , sadness , and decay . I passed along , perplexed with a strange and nameless sorrow , and sat down upon the crumbling stone margin of a fountain , long since dry , and in whose basin lay pebbles and twigs . A reverie in a decayed garden naturally decks the trees again with the splendor of long-vanished summers , trims them as they had once been trimmed , and throngs the paths and the arbors with that host of the young and beautiful which the imagination accords to all gardens , and palaces , and happy haunts . But as I sat and dreamed , I felt myself seized with the spell of mysterious horror which I had perceived in the padrone at the inn , and saying with him , " God forgive us all our sins ! " I arose and strolled along the melancholy avenues , and descending the terraces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old woman , I fancied , sure that I was no thief , did not intend to disturb her siesta to look farther after me . So I walked slowly on , and passing up the grand stone-staircase in the cold hall , I entered the suite of state apartments . They were lofty and spacious . The ceilings were painted in fresco , and there was an unnatural freshness in the color , as if it was not the work of many years before . The windows were heavily and richly draped . The furniture was stately and costly , and the walls were tapestried . There was an oppressive air of cold regal magnificence in each apartment . There was nothing domestic ; no pleasant disorder ; no gentle confusion , as if children had just fled from the rooms ; nothing that indicated a home ; every thing that bespoke a ceremonial palace . Some of the walls were not tapestried , and upon them hung pictures  --  mainly portraits  --  soldiers in uniforms , and noblemen in robes , or dignified Italian ladies in the stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state bed-chamber . In the centre of the room stood the bed , ascended by steps , and muffled in thick clustering draperies , covered with the crest of Sangrido . There was an oratory adjoining , with a massive silver crucifix and a carved priedieu . But my eyes clung with a painful curiosity to the solemnlydraped bed . The curtains were black , and folded over it like a heavy cloud ; and as I gazed , the whole seemed to me to form a funeral catafalque . Through the thick glass of the windows , rimed with the gathered dust of years , and through the plain white muslin curtains that hung over them like shrouds , the light came sickly and thin , and the funeral drapery apparently thickened the air of the room . Instinctively I stepped to the window , but I could not open it , and it was so coated with obscurity that I could not look down into the sunny square . I listened for a sound , but there was nothing to hear . My own respiration was as audible as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber . Almost involuntarily , and as if drawn by an irresistible fascination , I climbed the steps that ascended to the bed , and laying hold of the heavy black curtains , pulled them aside and looked within them . There was nothing to be seen but a bed fairly made ; the linen yellow , as with time . But as I looked up I saw something black hanging from the ring in the ceiling which held the drapery , so that the curtains made a funeral tabernacle for it . It was beyond my reach , but I could see that it was a frame shrouded in a black bag . It was evidently a picture : it must be a portrait . Why shrouded in black ? Why there ? As I stood upon the steps , still holding back the curtains , still staring upward and wondering , I felt my foot forcibly seized , and looking down , saw a shrivelled , bony hand grasping it . It was the hand of the old custode , whose withered face , white and terrified , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pressed over the mouth in sign of silence , while the other grasped my foot . I descended the steps , and the old woman seized both my hands with frenzied earnestness , and glared into my eyes , while her frame trembled , and upon her wan lips quivered the words : " For the love of God , signor ! For the love of God , signor ! " I waited patiently for her to speak , which she did at length , in a low , hurried , and appalled tone , begging me to leave the palace upon the moment , and if I had the slightest regard for the life of a miserable sinner , never to betray that I had penetrated so far as to see the bed and the shrouded portrait . " I fell asleep , signor , and did not hear you when you came in from the garden . O Dio ! O Dio ! " I left the yellow palace , and left Rieti , but not until I had learned the secret of that picture . Ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was then sixty years old , a man of high family , of large fortune , of good person . He ordered the state carriage and drove to Rome . He was known everywhere , and was especially intimate with the Countess Ondella , who was the guardian of her orphan niece , Maddalena . The girl had grown up in a Venetian convent . She had seen no man but Padre Giuseppe , who wore long clothes like the women , and droned all the morning , and dozed all the afternoon , and did not seem to be a man . To him she confessed regularly every week . The old man usually went to sleep before the tale was over , for there were no very startling sins to confess , but occasionally strange thoughts and emotions , which Maddalena did not understand , nor the good Giuseppe either . On the whole , it was pleasant childish tattle , which soothed him to sleep , in which he dreamed of other times and other children , among whom was one child early habited in a solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that dream-child Padre Giuseppe seemed to see his own features , but delicate and youthful , without wrinkles and snuff-stains . And so the placid confessor dreamed until dinner-time , and feared , as he arose and found that he must wipe the moisture from his eyes , that he was getting old and rheumy . Maddalena was taught the duty of all good children  --  to confess and pray , and guard her mind from thoughts of men ; never to tell lies , and always to obey her elders . She listened and learned . In the silent old convent-garden she read and mused , and vague hopes and yearnings fluttered sometimes across her mind as she saw birds floating in the sky , or bright leaves whirling and whirling , and then dropping , dropping , until they were lost upon the ground . Sixteen eventless years thus passed , and Maddalena Ondella was a woman . One day , after having confessed to Padre Giuseppe , she went into the garden at sunset , and sat upon a pedestal whence a statue had long ago fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wind to stir the leaves , and the darkening twilight touched her beauty with more exquisite grace as she sat motionless , gazing at the West , longing and hoping , with all the passionate possibilities of life glimmering in her luscious lips . That moment she was summoned by the superior , and informed that she was to go to Rome immediately . " Thank the Holy Virgin , Maddalena , " said the abbess , " that you are to be married to a noble and worthy man . In all things , my child , remember our instructions , and obey your husband . " Padre Guiseppe 's soft soul was touched . He shed tears as Maddalena bade him farewell . The good Padre did not know how beautiful she was , but the Marquis di Sangrido had accompanied the Countess Ondella to Venice , three years before , and had then seen her niece . Three years being past , he considered that he was sixty , and concluded to marry . He came to Rome in the state-carriage , and proposed to the Countess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day for the nuptials was appointed . The Marquis di Sangrido had returned to his countrypalace at Rieti after his proposals were accepted , and carried with him workmen to decorate his house . Rieti was gay in the prospect of a bride who would bring youth , beauty , and society to cheer its loneliness . No one was permitted to see the work going on in the yellow palace , but it did not lose in splendor by the eager gossip of the town . One morning the workmen did not come . The work was finished . The next morning the old state-carriage , newly burnished , and drawn by the old horses in new and glittering harness , passed out of the gates . The servants wore bridal-favors . The blinds were drawn down , and the hard face of the Marquis di Sangrido returned the gratulations of the town . A few days afterward a courier came dashing into Rieti , and disappeared in the palazzo Sangrido . It was rumored that the bride would arrive before night , and at sunset the bridal cortge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen beamed gratitude upon the peasants , who threw flowers before the bride 's carriage , and the Marchioness Maddalena di Sangrido went into her palace . There were money and wine distributed in the square of Rieti that night , and prayers were uttered for the bride in the church next morning by those she never saw . From an old convent in Venice to an old palace in Rieti the change was not great . But the change was entire in all the habits of life ; and sometimes , when Maddalena stole away to a lonely corner of the garden , which had been trimmed and beautified in her honor , she looked wistfully at the long range of hills undulating into the blue distance ; and , longing for a richer experience , shuddered as she reflected that , while dreaming in the convent-garden , everything was possible ; but that , sitting in the garden of the palace , her future was an endless iteration of the present . She grew sad and silent in the rural splendors of Rieti . The Marquis di Sangrido @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she went alone into the garden he presently appeared , and taking her arm led her back to the house , or paced solemnly and silently at her side , along the stately green avenues . He was of high family , and great fortune , and of good person . The girls at the convent in Venice sauntered in the sunny garden , and talked , by stealth , of the happy Maddalena , and envied her splendid fortune and career . Maddalena , in the sunny garden of Rieti , longed for Venice , for companions , for life , for any thing . She grew pale , like a flower in the dark . The time came to go to Rome . Before ordering the carriage the Marquis di Sangrido warned the Marchioness of the dangers of society , and the duties of wives . Her eyes flashed alternate scorn and longing as he spoke , and with a heart yearning and bursting , she leaped into the carriage , while her brain swam with the sudden and gorgeous hope of a new life . They reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed fte . Everywhere Maddalena was the idol of admiration . The elastic Italian tongue was compelled into new forms of compliment ; and she , like a thirst-stricken victim , plunged into the stream of life and madly revelled . She tasted new and wild experience , and quaffed it fiercely like burning wine . She had scarcely reached Rome when she saw Giulio . Their eyes met , then their hands . A week had not passed before they were ardent lovers . The whole restrained passion of her nature rose at once to flood-tide . The arrears of years were paid in moments . There was imperial splendor in her beauty . At home , at church , at the opera , upon the promenade , she was radiant , and wherever she was , Giulio was by her side and in her heart . She did not try to disguise it . The dames of high society thought her audacious , shook their fans , and recommended prudence . Maddalena scoffed at their suggestions , laughed prudence to scorn , and gloried in the tumult of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the Marquis di Sangrido was sure . His eye grew like a serpent 's eye , and women shuddered as its livid glare fell upon them . His movements became sinuous and stealthy . Like a reptile , he chilled the sunshine as he slipped along the street to the Casino or the Caf . To see him was like being smitten with disease . At the opera , in church , upon the promenade , he watched the young Giulio with his wife . Flowers were not fair enough , nor the sun bright enough , nor the day long enough for them . The Marquis di Sangrido came home quietly one day an hour before the time he had mentioned . He entered softly , and glided through the apartments , with spectral stillness , toward his wife 's room . His hard , cold face had a glacial intensity that froze with horror the valet who saw him pass . Reaching the door of his wife 's room , he entered without knocking . The Marchioness was not at the opera in the evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the next day . The Marquis and Marchioness di Sangrido had returned to Rieti . As the carriage thundered into the town , the blinds were closed ; there was no beaming bridal face at the window ; there were hurry and stern command , and the great gate closed behind the carriage in sullen gloom . In was a solemn and melancholy supper that the Marquis and his wife eat that night . From his cold , hard face the snake had vanished , but its frigid ferocity was more terrible ; and the pale marble rigidity of his wife was sadder to see . She rose from the table and passed alone through the vast , cold , silent apartments toward her chamber . Her heart was stony with the fixed resolve not to be baulked of life , and love , and happiness , but at some time , by some means , to escape the imprisonment of that palace , and dare the worst for Giulio . She reached her room and dismissed her maid , who withdrew , leaving her alone . Through the lofty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful woman who stood with her hands clasped before her , and her head leaning against the window-frame . She was entirely abandoned to the glowing remembrance of the last few weeks . One image , one memory , one hope , one thought , possessed her . She was a child in knowledge and in power , but a woman in passionate emotion . Like a stormy sea ebbing and flowing fiercely in a cavern , her feelings , and wishes , and vows , fluctuated through her mind , and she stood confounded by the greatness and glory of the passion that agitated her whole being . She was its slave , but knew not how to obey it . The night waned , and she stood musing , her hands still clasped , her head leaning , when suddenly she heard a chorus of late revellers , artists returning from a festa : " Ah ! senza amare , Andare sul mare , Col sposo del mare , Non puo consolare ! " The song was very distant and passed slowly out of hearing . Yet it lingered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearning , wailing ; a whole history singing and sighing in its measures ; a whole history , at least , when a heart listened in which all passionate powers thrilled and throbbed in answer . Maddalena turned from her window , and walked slowly up and down the chamber . She paused and loosened her dress . It fell away from her like a cloud , and around her in the dark of the chamber , the dim outline of the furniture was not more still than the statuesque repose of her form . A faint , heavy odor from a vase of flowers filled the room . She moved slowly away , and slowly seated herself upon the edge of the bed , resting her head upon her hand , and murmuring almost inaudibly , as if dreaming : " Ah ! senza amare ! " The Marquis di Sangrido waited until he supposed that his wife had reached her chamber . Then he passed quietly through another door to a farther part of the palace , and entering a room which he unlocked with a key that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully behind him ; then opening the small door of a cupboard in the wall , he took from a shelf a large glass jar , full of a green liquor , which he carefully examined ; then closed and locked the cupboard-door , and left the room . When he reached the dining-hall , he summoned his valet , and ordered him to assemble all the servants , who instantly came thronging in . After looking at them sternly for a few moments , the Marquis said : " I wish you all to return to Rome at an early hour in the morning . I shall follow you two days hence . Vincenzo , " he said to his valet , " you will remain . " As the servants were leaving the room , he said to them with a kind of hiss , " If any man remains behind after to-morrow morning , he will never see Rome again . " And with a shudder of fear the servants withdrew . By dawn the next morning , they had all left the palazzo , and at sunrise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finishing his breakfast , he ordered his valet to tell the maid of the Marchioness that he wished to know when her mistress was awake . As he arose from table , he gave the valet a letter for the Countess Ondella , sealed with black , which he charged him to deliver as soon as possible , and to make no delay in mounting and taking the road to Rome . The valet bowed , took the letter , and in ten minutes was galloping out of the town . A little before noon , the maid appeared to say that her mistress was awake . The Marquis bade her remain for a moment . He went toward his wife 's room , but immediately returning , told the maid that her mistress preferred to dress alone , and wished her to go with the custode to visit her sick child among the mountains . " Stop and ask Padre Luigi to come instantly to the palace , " said he , " and return by evening , but not before , or you will take the fever in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly departed . The suggestions of the Marquis di Sangrido were the sternest commands to his dependents . He sat quietly for some time , until he heard a tap at the gate , and , descending , he opened to the Padre Luigi . The priest muttered a blessing as he entered , and followed the Marquis up the staircase . They advanced together through the rooms until they reached the chamber of the Marchioness . The priest paused a moment while the Marquis passed in . " Maddalena , " said he to his wife , who was kneeling at her Prie-Dieu , " Padre Luigi is here to receive your confession . " " I have none to make , " returned she in a whisper , as a deathly pallor settled upon her cheek . The Marquis did not respond , but , opening the door , he beckoned to the priest , who entered , and the Marquis retired . " Why are you here ? " demanded Maddalena , suddenly springing up . " Signora , to hear your confession , " replied the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled horror in her eyes , and pointing toward the door . Page image - Page 341 . In vain the priest expostulated and besought her to confide to him the grief that weighed upon her conscience , and to receive his consolation . She said nothing but " Go ! " and waved him away . Padre Luigi passed out of the chamber . The Marquis waited in the adjoining room , and , without speaking , led the way toward the grand staircase . Still without speaking , they descended . The host opened the gate ; the priest murmured a benedicite , and departed . Then the Marquis fastened the bolts and bars , locked the world out from himself and his wife , and slowly ascended the staircase . He went to the secret cupboard , where he had seen , on the previous evening , that the jar full of a green liquid was safe , and taking it in his hands , glided through the vast , silent rooms as spectrally still as when in Rome he had entered his wife 's chamber suddenly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have made your peace with God ? " demanded the Marquis , as he closed the door , and stood before her , holding the jar . She rose slowly , with her eyes fastened upon his ; and tottering across the room , fell at his feet , and still staring in his face , gasped in a piteous whisper : " What do you mean ? " He did not reply ; but placing the jar upon the ground , he raised his wife from the floor , and leading her toward a huge , carved , oaken chair , he placed her upon it , and said in a voice cold and hard as his rigid face : " Maddalena , you must die ! " With silken cords which he drew from his pocket , he bound her with inconceivable rapidity and firmness to the chair . She moaned like a dying child . The suddenness and hopelessness of her fate crushed her at once . Tapestries and curtains hung about the chamber , and the summer light streamed golden through the windows . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon the cypress terraces of the garden fountains were plashing in the sunshine , and in the deep shade of the trees cicadas sang . She thought of them all ; she knew it well ; but not a sound reached her ears . Her whole short life lay clearly before her : the Venetian garden , the dream , the marriage , the blight , the new hope , the love , Giulio . The Marquis raised the jar . The green liquor was vitriol . He stood over her , behind , where he did not see her face . The first drop fell upon her head . " O my God ! " she said slowly , " forgive my sins , but I love him with my whole soul . " In startled Rieti there was constant and terrified surmise all the day after the return of the Marquis and his wife . It was one of the breathless , glaring days of midsummer ; a day of preternatural silence , when the sultry glare is a spell of terror , and men instinctively talk in whispers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only at intervals a solitary cicada stung the ear with its dry , sad tone . There was no dancing at the Osteria ; the cattle and the dogs lay listless in the shade ; and as the awful heats deepened to noon , the inhabitants were stretched in the shadow of the houses uneasily dozing , or , starting suddenly from hot sleep , glanced with vague apprehension about the sky , as if a fearful tempest were gathering . Suddenly a sharp , agonized , muffled scream pierced the very heart of that silence , and curdled the blood in the veins of the awe-stricken peasants . They stared at each other speechlessly , sat transfixed as if awaiting another sound ; then , after long , breathless minutes , turned their pale faces and whispered stealthily together  --  not quite sure if that shriek were earthly ; but muttering Ave Marias , and making the sign of the cross , their eyes gradually turned , as by tacit conviction , toward the grim palazzo Sangrido , standing sullen in the sun . Vincenzo , the valet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ondella the letter of the Marquis sealed with a black seal , and informing her of the death of her niece , the Marchioness Maddalena . The next evening , Padre Luigi and his brother monks celebrated a funeral mass in the little church of Rieti . I heard this history after I had left the little town , but I was glad of an opportunity of returning two years afterward . I found the same padrone at the Osteria , and endeavored to learn from him and from the peasants something farther about the Marquis di Sangrido . He was an old man , they said  --  hideously ugly . They believed , evidently , that he had horns and hoofs . But no one confessed that he had ever seen him . The day after my arrival , I went again to the palazzo . The same old woman examined and admitted me , evidently without recognizing me as the audacious stranger who had penetrated to the black and solemn chamber . She told me that I could not go into the palace , because the Marquis was living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ; but I had her permission to stroll in the garden . It was even more ruinous than before . Everywhere reigned the same desolation and sadness  --  doubly sad and desolate now that I knew the story . Yet everywhere in Italy you feel the possibility of such tragedies . Robert Browning 's poem of " My Last Duchess " and Beckford 's tale of the old woman near Naples are simple studies from life . The old villas and gardens crumbling in that hot southern sun are like memorials of the fierce excesses of hot southern passion . Love , hate , enthusiasm , revenge , despair , dark eyes , black hair , the stiletto , ignorance and mystery , ambition and superstition  --  these are the quick-glancing threads of which that life is spun . Venice explains Venice . The Council of Ten , the Bridge of Sighs , the Piombi , Marino Faliero , as well as Titian and Don Juan , are all bred of that silence , splendor , and isolation . Suddenly , as I turned into a neglected ilex-path , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of age ; he was still erect , and long white hairs clustered around his cold , hard face . He paused courteously , saluted me with dignity , and bade me good day . Perceiving from my reply that I was a foreigner , he stopped and fell into conversation . In all that he said the shrewd observation of the man of the world was evident . He was familiar with the current gossip , spoke of society in Rome , of the belles and the beauties . Passing to pictures and the subjects that most interest strangers , he showed himself a judicious critic and connoisseur . Of certain pictures he spoke with a kind of cold ardor that was very singular , and as I mentioned one that I had seen in the palazzo Mazzo in Rome , he discovered that his friend , the Cardinal Mazzo , was also a friend of mine , and immediately invited me to dine with him on the following day ; but I hastily declined upon plea of my early departure . After a little more conversation , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry that my pictures are all in Rome , " said he , as he turned away . " There are none in the house yonder , " he continued , pointing toward it through the cypresses , " of any interest to those out of the family . " So saying , the Marquis di Sangrido disappeared down the terraces . But I remained in the solitary , sunny garden , remembering the black-shrouded picture , looking along the paths that Maddalena had paced . The tragedy of Maddalena was wringing my heart , but the sun shone bright , the nightingales sang , the wind blew gently , and the courteous tones of the Marquis were ringing in my ears . " God forgive us all our sins ! " I said as I recalled the words of the padrone ; and I passed swiftly and for ever out of the garden and the gate of the Palazzo Sangrido . Back matter
