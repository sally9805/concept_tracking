txt AMERICAN ELOQUENCE . A NATION ' 5 eloquence is , in no remote sense , a nation 's power and a nation 's glory . It has been so in all past time , and among all nations by whom the true spirit of eloquence has been extensively cultivated . It was so among the republics of immortal Greece . The orators of Athens and Sparta imparted to those comparatively small States of which these were the principal cities , a brilliancy and a strength too , that they could have acquired in no other way . And the power and splendor of Rome , in the brightest epochs of her history , lay in her Senate and her Forum , more even than in the discipline and prowess of her military legions . It was those living , undying voices , which thundered in her Capitol , that did more to add to her empire both the East and the West , and to bring the world under her sway , than all the celerity and skill and terribleness of her armies . And in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us equally certain and still more prominent . What is the history of England , even in the brightest and most glorious periods of her power and greatness , but a history of the commanding and triumphant eloquence of her public speakers who have occupied places of trust and influence in her national councils ? 11cr vast power over regions of the globe on which , it has been truly said , the sun in his circuit through the heavens never goes down , has its chief seat and center // in Westminster Hall . Its elementary and vivifying principle lies in the eloquence of her statesmen and orators . How often has a single speech , delivered in her House of Commons , on some great pub1i* emergency , sent a thrill of interest quite round the world , and excited the hopes or the apprehensions of nations far away , on the banks of the Indus and the Ganges ! And so of our own country . How great , how incalculable has been the power of eloquence in this land , and within the period of our brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our government and to the time which tried men 's souls , one is perpetually struck with the effects which eloquence has wrought among ourselves , accomplishing its triumphs , oftentimes , over many doubts and fears , and in circumstances of difficulty and danger when nothing else would or could have gained such triumphs . In Faneuil Hall and on the floor of the first Congress , from which emanated the noble Declaration " that these Colonies were and of right ought to be free and independent , " what an influence was exerted , strong as the force of many waters and yet inspiriting and balmy as the breath of morning , to sway the hearts of millions , and lead them to the same sublime conclusions and the same great and patriotic purposes . So , too , in the Virginia House of Delegates , and in the single voice of Patrick Henry , to say nothing of other illustrious names in that illustrious body , what a potent charm was thrown over that assembly and what a mighty influence for good was exerted-an influence , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying in the ears of a few just around the spot where the orator stood , " Give me liberty or give me death ! " is now the voice of history , uttering the same cry in a nation 's ears , and descending along down the lapse of future time to posterity . How many young minds have felt the power of that memorable speech ; how many more will yet feel it , in coming generations . The leading sentiment breathing through it , mhen distrustfully and tremblingly heard by some who scarcely knew what to make of the orator 's boldness and temerity , is now the free , unfettered and almost innate sentiment of twenty-five millions of people in this land . What a beneficent , blessed influence is that of a fearless , manly , patriotic eloquence , when employed on the side of truth and righteousness ! Has this influence received its full and proper measure of appreciation ? Are our public men who are called to xvield this mighty influence , and our young men who are on their way to those stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the opportunity // of wielding this most desirable influence , and in the widest and most effective manner , if they will but qualify* themselves for it , aware of the high responsibility which is or soon will be resting upon them ? * Is the talent for effective public speaking as much cultivated as it should be ? We think not . We think , also , that a false taste and a false standard of merit , on this subject , are in danger of being introduced among us , and are indeed widely prevalent already , as respects many of our public speakers . We wish , therefore , to offer to our readers , in this article , some suggestions and some strictures on the general subject of American Eloquence . Among the characteristics of our national eloquence we mention the following : Great boldness , both in respect to the positions assumed and to the style of reasoning and illustration employed . Caution is not a prominent element in our national character . And this fact is wont to appear , quite enough , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hesitating scrupulousness in them , lest they should overstep the modesty of nature and depart from strict philosophical accuracy in their statements and reasonings , is not one of our national sins . It certainly does not , in any very marked degree at least , belong to our public speakers , especially to such of them as are of the fashionable school of the present day . This might be very satisfactorily elucidated by referring to the style of public speaking adopted by many of the members of Congress from the new and more Western States . There might be cited many felicitous examples of our meaning , exalted specimens of the kind of eloquence of which we are writing . They are not among your timid , hesitating , milk-and-water speakers . They let you know , that whatever may be true in relation to others , they are not afraid to take high and strong ground . In the very statement of their views , as well as in the cast of their argumentation in support of those views , you see the same spirit and tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come to deal with tropes and figures ; when leaving the dry seventies of logic , they come to display the richness of their rhetorical stores , and the classic copiousness and elegance of their higher efforts in oratory . Let not the reader suppose that we are doing them injustice in these remarks . We are not dealing in caricature , or even in amplification . They claim for themselves the character , as public speakers , which we here ascribe to them . The style of their eloquence is , by-their own showing , // that of unflinching boldness . Their port and bearing , on the arena of Congressional strife , are ever fearless and lofty . But it may be said , these are extreme cases , and not applicable* to the general tone an*haracter of our national eloquence . We admit that they are , in one sense , extreme cases , and we should be sorry if they were not . And still we maintain that something of this cast belongs , undeniably , to no inconsiderable portion of the public speaking , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so striking perhaps , but after this general type and fashion . And when from the present times we go back to the times in which lived the great and gifted men of our early history , we find much of the same boldness characterizing the public speaking then in vogue . It is the character of this people to be bold and sanguine . It is the national temperament . When roused by some great and commanding exigency , like the war of the Revolution for example , the American spirit has ever been distinguished for great boldness , sturdiness and strength . Why , then , should not this trait of character be expected to modify our national eloquence , and to impart to it one of its peculiar and most characteristic features ? American eloquence is also , as a general fact , marked with great vividness and force of conception in our public speakers , whether the views taken by them be right or wrong views , coincident with the nature and reality of things in the case or not , they are usually vivid views-conceived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined to the eye of the speaker 's mindand operating on his mental vision with all the power of living and visible realities . It is impossible to read carefully some of the speeches of our best orators in Congress without being struck with this fact . Indeed , the power of strong and vigorous conception belongs to our national character , and forms a part of that character . Nor is the fact here referred to scarcely less noticeable in some of the worst speakers in our national Senate and House of Representatives , than it is in the best . Strong conceptions of the mind are not always right conceptions . Clear views are not necessarily and of course right views . They may relate to error as well as to truth , to things that do not exist as well as to certain , unalterable and eternal verities , and they may be as strong and vivid in the one ease as in the other . False conceptions on any subject , are not necessarily obscure and feeble . Paine entertained false views concerning Christianity , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benedict // Arnold took some wrong views , on the subject of their duty to their country ; but the views which they took , though erroneous , were strong and vivid enough , as their actual conduct , and the hazard t*ey ran , sufficiently evinced . Alex ander Hamilton entertained false notions of honor , as most think , when he consented to peril his life in that fatal duel with Burr , which has proved an occasion and an example for so many other fatal rencontres , of a similar kind , from that day to this . But though that duel originated in false conceptions of honor , those conceptions were none the less vivid and strong on that account . And so in every case . It belongs to the American character , especially when the passions are excited by any great subject of commanding interest to the mind , to form bold and vigorous conceptions , to take strong and vivid views of things , and to feel their weight and importance , until the mind becomes , oftentimes , exceedingly delighted or exceedingly pained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims . It was so , as manifested in that admirable State paper , the Declaration of American Independence . True , that paper is remarkably calm and dignified throughout . Its spirit and tone are singularly unruffled and quiet ; but what a strength of conception , and what a force and majesty of thought and utterance , does it exhibit . And yet the mind which conceived and gave expression to those noble and magnanimous sentiments , knew full well , at the very moment , that it was giving birth to sentiments which , in the struggle that would ensue to maintain them , would cost the nation some of its best blood . Nay , more than this , the very head of the man who drew up that instrument , he knew was staked on the issue of the impending contest . And what was thus true of this particular State paper , was no less true of most of the State papers , which were drawn up about that period . The petitions to the British Crown , were of this character . The appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this character . The many able and powerful remonstrances against the encroachments of the British Parliament on our most unquestionable rights as free-born subjects of the British Empire , were of this character . A stronger and juster conception of the very first principles of right and wrong in political science , was never entertained or put upon paper . We need never be ashamed of those earnest , dignified , masterly discussions . The spirit of American eloquence breathes and burns in them . That spirit still survives . We see it , in those grand conceptions of national prosperity and national // honor , which from time to time are breaking forth upon us , in the speeches of some of our public men . American eloquence is directed chiefly to the feelings of those to whom it is addres*d , and to the sense of national honor . The strongest and noblest scntiments in man to which the appeals of eloquence can be addressed are , first , the sense of right and wrong , and next , the love of country and of kindred . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all men . And in no country on earth , probably , are they found to exist in a higher degree , than among the plain , unsophisticated , independent yeomanry of this country . Here , then , is a wide field for the operation of a true and vigorous eloquence . Appeals to an enlightened sense of right are always strong appeals . It is very difficult wholly to resist or evade them . And so , in a lesser degree , in respect to appeals addressed to man 's natural love of country and of kindred . Arguments founded on these bases , are always powerful arguments . They go right to the heart . Powerful and effective eloquence always has been and always must be addressed , mainly , to the pas*ions or feelings in man 's heart . What could all the metaphysical subtleties of Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus effect , in impelling men to action , or in accomplishing any great and grand end , when compared with that warm , gushing eloquence , coming from the heart , and going to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed and stimulated , enlightened and convinced , by argument . But let us remember , the work is not effectually done , the grand end and aim of eloquence is not attained , till the consenting sympathies of the inner man of the heart are touched , and roused , and brought into action . True eloquence-effective , useful eloquence-must appeal to the heart , through the understanding and the conscience . It must open the floodgates of sensibility within us , and thus bring into exercise our active powers for the promoting of good or the preventing of evil , or else , its real power and utility will he of a very small amount . And such , we think , in a very grand degree , is the character of American eloquence . The style of eloquence in this country , it is obvious to remark further , is such as great interests , and high hopes of the future , are calculated to inspire . What nation on earth has ever had such prospects before it as this nation has ? With a territory so wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ; with institutions breathing the very spirit of freedom and of an enlarged philanthropy // towards other nations ; with superabounding internal resources both physical and moral ; existing at this enlightened age of the world ; occupying a geographical position in the earth far away from the conflicting interests , the jealousies and wars , of the old w*ld ; young ; ardent ; buoyant with hope and expectation ; with a past history full of happy auguries for the time to come ; and moving on , from year to year , with a progressive advancement in all the elements of national power and wealth and glory , such as no other people on earth has ever paralleled ; - in circumstances such as these , we say , can it be otherwise than that our public men should stand on a high vantage ground , for acquiring and exercising the power of a lofty and vigorous eloquence ? Does not our very condition lead to it , with the blessing of Providence , and if , as a people , we are true to ourselves ? We trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too fondly and boastingly , on this auspicious aspect of our national affairs . And we certainly would do nothing to increase , among our countrymen , feelings of self-complacency and self-exaltation already sufficiently inflated . As a people , our pride of national distinction , and our covetousness of national greatness and glory , certainly do not require any stimulating ; they are great and strong enough in all conscience , without our seeking to increase them . And still it is true , in the soberest view of the case that can be taken , that the tendency of things in relation to the future greatness of this country , is in a high degree conspicuous and encouraging . It is such as to beget the most animating hopes . It presents before us a prospect upon which the eye of the patriot can rest with a deep and lively interest , and over which the heart of the philanthropist and the Christian statesman must dilate with joy . Now who can fail to see what effect such a state of things must exert , and does exert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eloquence in this country ? That style will , in many respects be peculiar . It will be adapted to our condition and character . It will partake of our national spirit . It will breathe our hopes for the future . It will be marked by our national enthusiasm . It will be animated with a sense of our growing greatness and imbued with the peculiar genius of our free and beneficent institutions . Such indeed it now is , and such more and more , it will hereafter become . That , occasionally , and in some of our public speakers , it should appear too turgid and overstrained , or too coarse and unadorned , is not to be wondered at . This , in the circumstances of the case , is only what was // to have been expected , and what can easily be overlooked and made allowance for . And still it is true , that the general tendency of things in this land , is such as must and will produce , in many of our pubijc speakers , an elevated and effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this most nobile art , though in many of our orators and debaters we have poor specimens enough , and though too we have in our national Hall of Representatives not a great many very good speakers , yet we have some of this class ; and in our Senate , there are many ( for so small a body ) the style of whose eloquence , for strength and clearness , for dignity and elevation , for ease and gracefulness , for power to fix the attention , to convince the understanding , to kindle the imagination , and to touch and subdue the heart , would do honor to any nation on earth . Among what we deem thc peculiar excellencies of our national eloquence , we would notice , in a cursory way , those which follow . We have not left ourselves time and space enough , in these remarks , to dwell upon these at length , or to bring forward many examples in illustration of them . These which we do bring forward however we shall endeavor to make to the point . The eloquence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be , by much fervor . It evinces and flows from great strength of feeling . This we have already shown to be one of its characteristics ; it is , also , one of its leading excellencies . Feeling is the soul of eloquence . When a public speaker utters his thoughts from a full heart with his mind deeply impressed with his subject , and his whole soul filled and moved by it , it is then , if ever , that he speaks to effect . It is then that he awakens sympathetic movements in the minds of his hearers , and carries them along with him at his will . This was the leading character of Athenian eloquence . In this spirit were the Philippies of Demosthenes " fulminated over Greece , " and wrought their wonderful effects upon the excitable and mercurial people . In this spirit , the elder Pitt thundered in the English Parliament , and exerted there his transcendant power . It was not so much by a long train of frigid argumentation , as by the sudden flashes of his great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence in the House of Commons-an influence for which , exerted as it was in support of the American cause , this country owes him many thanks and wift long love to cherish his memory . And this is the character of our best speakers at the present time-at least , their // greatest and happiest efforts have been put forth under the impulse of deep feeling , and when the occasion or subject were of the kind to call forth such feeling . Debate on controverted points , where *ie speakers are led to take opposite sides in the discussion , is apt to awaken such feeling , and thus to bring out their whole strength . Hence , it is on such sub jects , and under such circumstances , that the most thrilling and powerful speeches have usually been made . Take as an example the trial of Warren Hastings , before the high court of the Peers , the British House of Lords . What eloquence ever exceeded that of Burke , Fox , Sheridan and the other speakers on that august and imposing occasion . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges , the character and standing of the accused , and the character and standing of the accusers and of the counsel on the other side , the character of the witnesses , and the eager crowd of attending spectators , all in one word , it was the excitement of the scene , it was the deep interest that glowed in the hearts of the speakers , which gave to their efforts upon that occasion , their peculiar cast of rich and overflowing eloquence , and held the court and the victim in one long trance of admiration and delight . So when the British Stamp Act and the Boston Port Bill , presented to this country distinctly the alternative of resistance or submission , and that great question could be no longer blinked or put off-what speakers , and what a blaze of eloquence did that alternative call out . And just so it will ever be . This country has and will always have great speakers , some such at least , because she has and will always have , great occasions to form them and to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performances of our best public speakers . No labor of mind in the hearer is requisite in following them in their addresses . You see at once what they are aiming at . The thread of their reasoning is not so very fine or so very circuitous , as is sometimes the case with public speakers , winding in a perfect labyrinth of intricacies , but that you can generally and easily trace them along the course of their argument , and fl*d no difficulty in apprehending their meaning . And this , in a public orator , is no mean praise , especially on disputed and difficult subjects . Clearness in stating a case and clearness in the argument which is designed to make out that case , and clearness in presenting the considerations which should impress that case upon those to whom it is addressed , are essential to any great excellence in public speaking . There is also in the best orators of our country , a plain , unaffected , natural , businesslike // style , in their speeches , which serves not a little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their hearers . They are , themselves men , of the people . They mingle with them . They k*w how to address them . A strong common sense , a frank , open , business-like air , is always to all men , a welcome introduction in a speakei* . A stranger even , who comes thus recommended to those whom he is to address , is sure to be listened to with respect at least , if not with decided favor and an approval of his sentiments . Now most of our distinguished public speakers are men of this stamp . Their manner of speaking suits the popular mind . It is common sense dealing with common sense . Hence they are , generally , favorites with the people . The people love to hear them , and love to read their printed speeches whenever they can get access to them . Hence , our public journals , which contain the speeches of our ablest orators , are sought with much eagerness and read with avidity . The efforts of our able speakers in Congress , will circulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , and be perused by thousands of eager readers , in their shops and countingrooms , and by their firesides and in their domestic circles . But affectation , on the other hand , and tinsel , and weak , and loose declamation , and all the mere feints and artifices of the would-be orator , will produce no such effect . The plain , good sense of the nation nauseates it and is above it . It is a peculiar advantage in favor of the eloquence of our country , that we are , and from the nature of our circumstances as a people must be . a spectacle to the world . The eyes of the whole civilized world are upon us . Crowned heads in particular , and the privileged orders who surround and uphold their thrones , are deeply interesting spectators of what is passing in this land . So , too , are the poor and oppressed of all nations , so far as they have any knowledge of us . The two extremes of human society , the roughest and the lowest , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes towards our shores . The one , wishfully and hopingly . The other , malignantly and in fear of what that rising star in the West portends . And the voice of our nation 's great and eloquent men , which comes to them every now and then from over the waters , is not heard by them with indifference ; it falls upon ears which are open and eager to hear it . For they know full well , each of these two classes , that that voice has a meaning in it for them prophetic o f good or of evil . And already , young as we are as a nation , o ur national capitol at Washington , and the men assembled 4 // there in consultation and debate , and the measures of international policy there discussed and advocated or opposed , are looked to , and inquired after , and conversed about , by many in other lands , who till lately never heard of America , and *yith a degree of int*rest too of which we have ourselves but faint conceptions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to perceive what is the natural and legitimate tendency of such a state of things as this , in its bearing upon our national eloquence . Who does not see that it must give to our public speakers , whether in the legislative hall , or at the bar , or elsewhere , a very decided advantage , tending to enlarge their views , and strengthen their hopes of success , and thus to impart a loftier devation and a greater efficiency to their public efforts . One thing more we must not forget to notice . It is , that in this country , more than in any other , avenues to the very highest points of distinction , wealth and honor in the gift of a great people , are fully open to all our citizens alike , who have the requisite talents and enterprize to enter the lists of competition for possessing themselves of them . The man of the humblest origin , and obscurest condition , and narrowest circumstances , has the full privilege of putting in his claim , side by side with his competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with brighter promise of success . Only let him not despond . Only let him appreciate properly the privilege he possesses , and assert fearlessly his birthright as an American citizen , and shape his aims accordingly , and he will not be disappointed in the result . Look , for a moment only , at the list of our most able public men and public speakers . Who are they that have filled , that are now filling , the high places of public trust and public honor and distinction in the land ? Who in particular are the men , whose voice in the advocacy of any great cause of national interest and importance , is always listened to with respect , and is wont to exert a controlling influence over those to whom it is addressed ? Are they not , very many of them , in point of original external condition and advantages , men of humble pretensions , and who at the commencement of their course , gave to the eye of a superficial observer no special promise of future eminence ? But step forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how greatly is the scene changed . How rapidly and proudly have they risen , from the obscurity of humble life to the possession of a truly enviable prominence before the world . What has thus been true of these men , may and will be true of many others that shall come after // them . The same avenues to eminence are open to others , which were open to them , and none are debarred from entering them . What an advantage is here for our young men , and how obvious its bearing*pon the style of eloquence which is , or which should be , the eloquence of the nation . Surely , if a free field for competition , and if motives of unequalled power , have any tendency to produce able speakers , then may we of this nation have , and then should we have , speakers of this stamp . Here we rest , as the lawyer 's say , and defer noticing the defects in our national eloquence to some future time . We have now a few inquiries to propound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is eloquence in this country sufficiently cultivated ? We have attempted to show , in preceding pages , that in no nation on earth are the motives so strong , and the facilities so great , for acquiring a good style of public speaking . as in this nation . And yet how few really first rate speakers have we ? How few , compared with what there ought to be . On this subject we may misjudge . But we believe , that the number of first-rate speakers now , is relatively less , in proportion to the population of the country , than it was when the first Congress met . Our present House of Representatives contains , we think , fewer men of real and commanding eloquence , in proportion to the whole number of members that belong to it , than were in the House near 80 years ago , when these colonies proclaimed their independence . If this be a fact , why is it so ? Will it be said , we have not now the same great emergencies to call out the talent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remembered , on the other hand , that the stimulus to effort which these things presuppose , has its drawback , too , in the doubtfulness and uncertainty and many depressing influences , which attended our fathers ' exertions in the cause of freedom , but of which we , in this generation , know nothing . Our country is now great ; then it was small . it is now strong ; it was then weak . A trial of nearly eighty years ' duration , has now fully tested the practicability and firmness of those great principles on which it is built . We have now , it is believel , even greater and more powerful incentives to cultivate the nation 's talent for eloquence , than existed atthat time-greater interests  --  a wider domain  --  a higher and better known reputation among other nations-bri* hter prospects in future-and , we may add , increased perils , too , should we prove recreaut to our trust . Incentives , then , are not wanting , to call forth and put in requisition , the kiwi of 4* // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard of eloquence in this country sufficiently elevated ? Do not , our public speakers adopt too low a standard , and content themselves with a bare s*diocrity in their attainments of this sort , when they should aim higher ? Are our educated young men forming correct views and a correct taste on this subject ? And do our American colleges look enough to this matter . In our colleges young men are trained for public life . Many of them will actually go into public life . They will go-some of them-  --  to the bar , and become advocates and judges . They will go to our legislative assemblies , and frame the laws that will govern us and our children after us . They will enter the pulpit as the heralds of divine mercy , to " allure men to brighter worlds and lead the way . " Are our American colleges doing all that they ought to do , to improve the eloquence of our country ?                   @ @
