A*v . VI.  - -  RECENT ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW . Treaty of Paris , signed Jfarch 30 , 1 856. lift . illiarcy 's Letters to lift . Seibels and Count de Sartiges . Published in the National Intelligencer , September 16 , 1855 . Tmi peace of Paris , concluded in March last , between the leading powers of Europe , not only put an end to a very serious and threatening war , but was made also the occasion for settling-as far as the parties to the peace were concerned-some important principles in international law . To this newest aspect of the law of nations , and if our limits will permit , to some other of the more recent evidences of progress in this science we invite our readers ' attention for a few moments . In the body of the treaty we find a stipulation in regard to the use of the IDanhbe for the purposes of navigation , which calls for a few remarks . It would seem clear , according to natural justice , that if the mouth of a navigable river lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the latter nation ought to have the right of free passage to the sea . The importance of human intercourse to the improvement of the whole world is so great , that it is pointed out in divine providence as a part of God 's economy for mankind . A nation may indeed decide to live within itself , and make no exchanges with foreigners ; but to cut off a nation from such intercourse , when it is ready to give all proper guarantees not to disturb the quiet or safety of another state in its transit , and to pay all fair expenses , seems contrary not only to the law of benevolence , but to the law of justice . And these principles are eminently applicable in the case of rivers , which are made and filled by no mortal hands , which are God 's canals , not merely to drain the more elevated country , but to bear merchandise between these inland districts and the ocean . But international law has not hitherto conceded the full right of using such streams to nations living on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is said , in the case ; that is , benevolence demands that it should be conceded ; but the right can not be enforced , nor is its refusal just ground for war . // Such was the theory in regard to navigable rivers ; but the Congress of Vienna in 1815* established a general rule in re* spect to European rivers , which is more in accordance with natural equity . It ordained that the use of navigable streams , which separate or traverse States , from the point where navigation commences to the sea , should be entirely free ,  --  and not denied , as far as commerce is concerned , to any one ; but that a uniform police , as favorable as possible to the commerce of all nations , might regulate the details of such navigation . A controversy having arisen in 1831 , as to what was to be understood by the Rhine , it was decided that navigation upon this stream should be open through the mouths called the Waal and the Leck , and through the artificial canal of Voorne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through more than one state , except the Danube . By the treaties of Bucharest in 1812 , and of Adrianople in 1829 , the commercial use of the Danube was to remain common to the subjects of Turkey and Russia . But , by the late treaty of Paris , the rules of the Congress of Vienna are applied to this river also . It thus becomes a thoroughfare of commerce , under certain regulations adopted for the improvment of the channel . A similar movement In advance of the older policy , a little before the treaty of Paris , affected one of the principal rivers of this continent Let us be allowed to go back a little , in order to set forth this movement more clearly . In the first years after the independence of the United States was acknowledged , Spain was disposed to claim exclusive control over the Mississippi below the point where the Southern boundary of the United States struck the river . But by the treaty of San Lorenzo el Real in 1795 , the use of the river , and liberty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted to citizens of the United States . The arguments of our negotiators , in endeavoring to persuade the Spanish Government that we had a right to the use of the river , seem to be weakened by a certain inconsistency , and not to assert the true ground . They claim a right as real as any other , but concede it to be an imperfect right . Now , as an imperfect right is one which can not be reduced to the rule of justice and enforced , they admit that Spain is under no obligation to open the river . The treaty above spoken of was not long in operation before we exercised sovereignty over the mouth and the whole course of Mississippi . The navigation of the St. Lawrence was more rigidly closed to visits from our vessels . The British Government always * Articles 105 , 109 in Wheaton 's Elements , Appendix , page 639. // stood on the strict law of nations as then prevailing , while the United States went back of a positive code to the principles of natural equity and justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic sea-board , and New York Ii avin g become a financial center for this continent , the importance of the question was considerably lessened . By the treaty of June 5 , 1854 , commonly called the reciprocity treaty , the navigation of the St. Lawrence , as well as of the canals of Canada , was thrown open to citizens of the United States , on the same conditions which are imposed upon the subjects of Great Britain . This privilege , however , might be revoked by the British Government upon due notice . The United States , on their p art , conceded to the other party the free navigation of Lake Michigan . It is unlikely that , as far as the freedom of river navigation is concerned , the world will go backward . All the great iivers of Europe and North America are now open to those who live upon their waters ; and no interior nation is necessarily prohibited from exchanging visits with the rest of mankind on a friendly footing . Another provision of the treaty of Paris , politically as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Sea . While the shores of the Black Sea , and the avenue to it , were exclusively within Turkish jurisdiction , it seemed reasonable to place that sea in the same category with a river included within the territory of a single nation ; no ship , especially no national ship , had a right to enter the ilellespont or pass by the blue Symplegades . ' And when Russia , by conquest , acquired territory upon this sea , the question of trade lay within the jurisdiction of the two powers . By the treaty of Adrianople , Russian vessels , and others belonging to powers at amity with Turkey , might enter the straits and pursue their way into the inner ocean . Turkey , however , very properly prohibited all armed vessels from running into this channel ; and by the treaty of London in 1841 , the five powers there represented agreed to respect that restriction . In the recent treaty , the contracting powers are again pledged to respect this restriction on national vessels  --  a restriction which is evidently necessary to the security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutralized , or rendered free for the mercantile vessels of all nations ; and no flag of war , whether belonging to the powers having control over the shores or to any other , can be seen upon its waters . The only exception to this is , that Russia and Turkey are allowed to keep up a coast service , the number of vessels for this purpose being determined // by a convention between these two states at the time of the treaty , and not being capable of modification afterwards without the consent of the other contracting powers . May it not be hoped , that how6ver Russia may itch to equip a new navy on the Euxine , the free navigation of the Danube , and the freedom of the sea itself , will render all schemes of conquest on these waters impracticable , as arraying the rest of Europe against them . A movement indicating a liberal policy somewhat analogous to this , marked the negotiations between this country and England in 1854 . The right to fish upon the sea , and for aught that appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations ; but of course there is no right to dry and cure fish even on the unsettled coasts belonging to any sovereign , without the permission of the same . By the treaty of 1783 , in which Great Britain acknowledged the independence of the United States , she conceded to the citizens of the latter permission to fish not only on the Banks , but on those coasts of Newfoundland , which were used by British fishermen for that purpose , as well as along the coasts and in the bays and creeks of British America generally ; but the right of drying and curing fish was conceded only along the unsettled coasts of Nova Scotia , Labrador , and the iMiagdalen Islands , and not on the island of Newfoundland . This right , of course , was terminated by the war in 1812 , and the treaty of Ghent contained no provisions res*jecting the fisheries . The claim made on our part , that the articles of the peace of 1783 , relating to the fisheries , were in their nacure perpetual and so not annulled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A convention , concluded in 1818 , again opened the privilege . The people of the United States might now fish , as well as cure and dry fish , on the greater part of the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland , so long as the same should continue unsettled . This privilege was , however , accompanied with a renunciation on the part of the United States of the liberty " to take , dry or cure fish on or within three marine miles of any of the coasts , bays , creeks , or harbors , of his Britannic Majesty 's dominions in America , not included within the above mentioned limits . " Such was the state of our relations to Great Britain as to this point , until the treaty of 1854 . By this treaty was given to our fishermen leave to take fish , excepting shell fish , on the coasts and in the bays , harbors and creeks of British America , from which they had been excluded before , without limit as to distance from the shore , as well as leave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and curing their fish . A reciprocal privilege was conceded to British subjects , of fishing along the coasts of the United states , from the 36th degree of latitude northwards , . In both cases the liberty does not include salmon and shad fisheries in rivers and in the mouths of rivers . We have given only that article of this treaty , which related to a delicate and agitating subject , on which the passions of men might easily ferment into a war . Other articles , conceived in the same spirit of liberality , promise to cement peace by the strong bond of common interests . The treaty of Paris , which thus carried out the principles of the treaty of Vienna in regard to river navigation , and secured the freedom of the Black Sea , was signed on the 30th of March . On the 16th of April , the same powers by their plenipotentiaries made a solemn declaration , which forms an era in the history of international law . After stating that the uncertainty of maritime law gives rise to differences of opinion between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even conflicts , the document proceeds to mention the following points , as agreed upon between the powers , who were parties to the treaty : That privateering is henceforth to be abolished ; That the neutral flag shall cover enemy 's goods , with the exception of contraband of war ; That neutral goods , with the exception of contraband of war , are not liable to capture under an enemy 's flag ; and That blockades , in order to be binding , must be maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy . The parties to this declaration engage to bring it to the notice of states not represented in the Congress of Paris , and add that it is not binding , except between those powers who have acceded or shall accede to it . By an accompanying protocol , it is agreed that the four principles of the declaration shall be indivisible ; so that powers which accept of them , shall be restricted from entering " into any arrangement in regard to the application of the right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time rest on the four principles contained in the declaration . " In regard to these principles , it may be observed first , that the declaration touching blockades is merely an affirmation of what is now acknowledged to be international law , and appears as such in all treatises on this science . It is , however , a gain // for humanity that paper blockades , with their injustice towards neutrals and the endless train of negotiations for damages coming after , should have an end put to them by the very states which formerly rivaled one auother in their innovations on the received practice of blockade . Another remark for which they call is , that the question of " contraband of war , " one of the most difficult and perplexing when we come to its details , is passed over in silence . It would have been greatly for the advantage of mankind , if the great powers who made the treaty of Paris , had specified what articles are contraband of war , and especially how provisions are to be considered . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document the neutral flag is made to cover the goods that are carried under it . The opposite doctrine-not indeed without attempts to change it even by force on the part of neutrals-has hitherto prevailed , and while our government has ever been seeking to establish the principle that free ships make free goods , our courts have accepted the other principle as a part of international law . The advance and improvement in public law here is very great . This arrangement marks a time when the interests of peace carry the day over those of war . The same great maritime power , whi*** crushed the Baltic confederacy , and through the war with Bonaparte , restricted neutrals within the narrowest boundary of rights , is now a party to a rule which neutrals have longed for but almost despaired of . Great Britain proclaims that her interests are on the side of peace , that she expects to be a neutral in future wars , that she relinquishes that interpretation of the law of nations which she was ready to enforce at the cannon 's mouth . Postponing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privateering , we may ask why these four principles were made indivisible ? Or since the third and fourth of them are not new , why is the rule that free ships make free goods united inseparably with an agreement to abolish letters of : marque ? Does the reason lie in England 's unwillingness to give up the old understanding in regard to neutral ships , unless by keeping the ocean free from private armed vessels , she can gain something to her commerce , which shall be a sort of compensation ? Or as the parties to the treaty were well aware of the strong desire of the United States to introduce such a rule into the international code , and aware also of our dependence in war upon privateers as well as of the readiness of our citizens to rush into such a warfare ,  --  did they mean to secure themselves against our depredations upon their commerce , while they held out to us the long coveted position of safety and of freedom from search for our own vessels ? // In this view of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts of our Government to obtain from the states of Europe a new arrangement of international law touching the rights of neutrals . The President informs us in his message of December 4 , 1854 , that the disposition on the part of Great Britain and France in the early part of the late war with Russia , to relax the strictness of the rights of war on the seas , led our government to renewed efforts to procure the recognition of the doctrines that free ships make free goods , and that a friend 's goods are exempt from seizure on an enemy 's vessel . To the propositions made for this object some powers had not then responded ; others , as Russia and the two Sicilies , had given their assent ; while Prussia approved indeed of a project for a treaty to this effect , but proposed to add an article providing for the renunciation of privateering . As to this dent makes the obvious remark , that with such an international rule , " the commerce of a nation having a small naval force will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This , of course , in a contest with England , whose navy is ten times as large , and her commercial marine not much larger than ours , would place us at a great disadvantage . W* should be compelled to depart from our present peaceful policy , and become a great naval power . Nor would the United States be better situated , thinks the President , in a war with secondary naval powers ; for the extent and exposed condition of our commerce would give any of them a like advantage over us . The President goes on to say that the proposition to forego a resort to privateering is not worthy of more favorable consideration than a proposition to forego using the services of volunteers on land . We fail to see the justice of this remark . That there is a difference between the motives of volunteers on land and privateers-men , or if not , that there is less control over the latter , must be obvious to all . To cite but one authority for this ,  --  Mr. Wheaton says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as liable to gross abuses , as tending to encourage a spirit of lawless depredation , and as being in glaring contradiction to the more mitigated modes of warfare practiced by land . " We only cite the closing words of the President on this topic . " The proposal to surrender the right to employ privateers is professedly founded on the principle , that private property of unoffendirig non-combatants , though enemies , should be exempt from the ravages of war ; but the proposed surrender goes but that little way in carrying out that principle , which equally requires that such private property should not be // seized or molested by national ships of war . Should the leading powers of Europe concur in proposing , as a rule of international law , to exempt private property upon the ocean from seizure by public armed cruisers , as well as by privateers , the United States will readily meet them upon that broad ground . " These latter weighty words will claim our attention before long ; we only notice now the assertion that the proposal to abandon privateering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more on sea than they suffer on laud according to the present rules of warfare . When this is said , are not other reasons for giving up privateering overlooked ? Do not some writers recommend this measure , who yet maintain that private property on the sea is differently situated , in - regard to an enemy , from the same property on land ,  --  that to cripple the enemy 's commerce is more likely to force him into a just peace than any exactions or plundering expeditions on the shore . These views of the President are repeated in the documents from the able pen of Mr. Marcy , which were submitted to the Senate on the 12th of August last . The papers in question are , frst* a letter to Mr. Seibels , our chargt* at Brussels , directing him to urge upon the Belgian government the disastrous consequences which will result from the adoption of this " declaration " to all nations without powerful navies ; and second , a reply directed to M. de Sartiges , French Ambassador , at Washington , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its adhesion to the declaration . This reply is dated the 28th of July last , and has already been extensively commented upon in Europe , although but little has been said or thought about it , or the subject of it , in this country . This silence is owing not so much to the absorbing nature of our present political canvass , as to the want of interest felt by the mass of the people in this country in international questions . And this want of interest has brought it about that the President and his Secretary practically decide such questions for themselves , without asking leave . We should like to know what is the standard for international law among us ? If the Supreme Court of the United States decides on the validity of a certain article of this code , it is a valid decision . Accordingly , it is for us good international law that property and debts of enemies within the country can be confiscated , if Congress so pleases . If the President and Senate make a treaty containing some stipulation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good between us and the other party to the treaty . If a law is passed by Congress containing a sanction to any part of this // code , it is a good and valid sanction . But what is the opinion of the President or Secretary worth , except so far as the former , in the exercise of his constitutional power , can refuse his assent to any given arrangements while he holds office . And yet , when Mr. Monroe proclaimed the doctrine which goes by his name , it went over Europe as if the legitimate power had determined in the case ; and to this day , notwithstanding resolutions of Congress to the contrary , it passes with many for a final announcement of an American principle of interference . But to retnrn to the Secretary 's reply . This document not only sets forth the reasons why the United States can not adhere to the declaration , but criticizes also the declaration itself , and proposes a snbstitute . It was not difficult to pick flaws in this paper ; in fact , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins with the proposition that the uncertainties of maritime law give rise to differences of&gt;pinion and to conflicts between belligerents and neutrals . Therefore the plenipotentaries now attempt to introduce fixed principles into the international code . One of these principles is that privateerin g shall be abolished . But there has been a fixed principle hitherto , and no uncertainty in regard to privateers . They have alway* been allowed . Only two treaties of brief continnance restricted the use of them as between the contracting parties . Another of the principles is that blockades to be binding must be effective . But this is the doctrine of all writers on this branch of law ; and the opposite practice during the war with Bonaparte was in plain violation of neutral rights . The reasons then for the declaration can apply only to two of its provisions , and illogically reach the others . Such is the Secretary 's just criticism . He then proceeds to consider the reasons which may have induced the Congress of Paris to seek the abolition of privateering . If one reason was the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt the President 's proposal in his message of December , 18*4 , and give it protection even against national vessels ? If it be urged that privateers are more apt than a regular navy to disregard neutral rights , this pretense is not well sustained by modern experience . If it be urged that privateers are stimulated by the hope of prize-money , so are the officers and crews of national vessels . Here we seem to discover the astute lawyer , making the best of his side , rather than the statesman , giving due weight to considerations on both sides . We can hardly persnade ourselves that experience does not contradict the Secretary 's assertion . And sure we are , that there are causes which secure the officers and men in the public service from the // demoralizing influences which must act on the captains and crews of privateers . The Secretary of State can not but be perfectly aware of this . Again the inquiry is made , what are privateers ? If this rule should prevail , would it not be impracticable to determine what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be opened for new controversies , in which the stronger naval powers would enforce their judgments ? Whether the glorious uncertainty of law would creep into these provisions , Mr. Marcy knows far better than we . We are not , however , satisfied that this description of vessels is not susceptible of a sharp definition . The main reason for refusing to accede to the declaration , although the same as that urged in the President 's message , is set forth with a good deal of power . The United States can not consent to maintain a large Navy . It is expensive , and " a menace to peace among the nations . " But this we must do , if we must give up privateering , or else be deprived of our only efficient means of opposing a larger naval power . Such a power would hold its inferior in check by one half , or less , of its fleet , and with the rest sweep the commerce of its enemy from the ocean . Such a power , it is not obscurely intimated , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in yielding the empire of the seas to her fleet . It is no doubt true , that Great Britain , in a war with the United States , would be vastly benefited by the abolition of privateering . Owing to the vigor and daring of our seamen , it is probable that the injury we could inflict on her , would be greater than that she could inflict on us . But the Sec*retary leaves the impression as if he thought the injury from privateers would be all on one side . We respect our English relatives too much to believe this . One sentiment expressed by Mr. Marcy , if he meant to give it the broad sense which it wears on its face , ought to be strongly condemned . No nation , says lie , " acts wisely , if it voluntarily surrenders the right to resort to any means sanctioned by international law , which , under any circumstances , may be advantageously used for defense or aggression . " How , then , can privateering be ever abandoned , or how can the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress thinks best , may confiscate the property of non-combatant enemies within its bounds , or debts due to them , at the breaking out of a war ? What progress can there be in the treatment of neutrals by belligerents , or of belligerents by each other , if this sentiment is to be carried out in practice ? The proposition is now renewed , that all private property on // Recent As2ests of international Law . the seas , except it be contraband , be exempt from seizure . On the acceptance of this rule , privateering will fall of course . With this addition , the government of the United States will adopt the declaration . That is , it shall be our understanding of international law , on the mere consent of the President and his Secretary , to be overthrown by the old rule , whenever a new administration sees fit to make the change . But if the provision in question could become the fixed policy of all Christian states , sanctioned by the sovereign authority , and irrevocable when war dissolves treaties of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of humanity ? Let us look at what may be said on both sides . First , it would seem that nations would have less motive to abstain from war than now . There is at present a reluctance to go to war , from a knowledge of the effect which war would have upon commerce . But in the case supposed , a part of this reluctance would cease . The trade goes on as before , except that portion of it which sought the country of the other belligerent . It might be said , too , that wars , when once begun , would last longer than at present . Wars cease , if the cause is an ordinary wrong , and nct an injury affecting the life and stirring up the soul of a nation , whenever the combatants become tired . And they become tired , when they feel the loss of those comforts and of that briskness of trade which they now know how to value . Is it not better to have wars , if they must needs come , ' decided soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to year ? At present , the injury of a war to a nation , if waged only on the sea , is that the commerce of that nation , with all parts of the world , is put in peril . After the adoption of the rule proposed by our Government , the commerce between the belligerents alone will be suspended , but all other descriptions of trade , except to and from blockaded ports , and in articles of contraband , will be pursued as before . And it is obvious that the ability to continue the war will be increased by the fact that trade will pursue most of its wonted channels . Again , might we not say , at least on Mr. Marcy 's principles , that the rule will not prevent the use of privateers , or something like them , in public warfare ? The Government has only to take into its pay any vessels which can be furnished with arms , and the rule is evaded . Still further , with this rule adopted , what is to prevent a nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is far inferior in this respect ? We will make the case // our own and appeal to that Anglophobia , or rather that mingled fear and hate of England , which appears through a veil indeed , but still appears in this document . What is to prevent England , with her immense navy , from blockading the principal ports of the United States ? She is secure on the seas . The right of taking her merchant-vessels , is no longer a war right . She can destroy our commerce with more effect than when she felt the need of gnarding and convoying her merchantmen , and was looking out for privateer clippers on every side . But , on the other hand , the good effects of this new proposition are so obvious , that its favorable reception , where it has been made known by the letter of Mr. Marcy , is not to be wondered at . The commercial classes , in time of war , will pursue , without interruption , nearly all the branches of a legitimate trade . The war will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of taxation , for the time being , need not be increased . Thus mere commercial prosperity calls for such a rule with a loud voice . No doubt , on a low , selfish calculation of advantages , the gain to neutrals would be greater , if private citizens of the belligerent states were excluded from their ordinary channels of trade , and neutrals should occupy their places ; but as it is the interesi* of the whole world , that the whole world should prosper , we presume that this consideration would have little weight . Having made this proposition , the Secretary goes a step farther , and says that a due regard to the fair claims of neutrals seems to require some modification , if not an abandonment of the doctrine in relation to contraband trade . The laws of blockade , he thinks , will afford all the remedies against neutrals that the parties to the war can justly claim . A further interference with the ordinary pursuits of neutrals is contrary , he affirms , to the obvious dictates of justice . This view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cases where there was a flagrant suspicion of an attempt to break a blockade . And to this wide extension of the privileges of neutrals , the United Statesare willing to give their sanction , whenever other powers receive it with favor . * To this proposition*'of the Secretary it is easy to reply in his own words already cited , that no wise nation will give up its " right to resort to any means sanctioned by international law , which under any circumstances may be advantageously used for defense or aggression . " Moreover , what justice is there in the case ? Is it so very plainly just that neutrals have a right to trade with either of the belligerents in what they please ? If it be , the Secretary must propose to have blockades abolished // also , as well as have trade in contraband articles allowed . Why should not justice keep open to neutrals the most important places of trade , as well keep the trade open in all kinds of articles ? Blockade and contraband must stand and fall together . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles for the blockaded place were only transferred to a port communicating with it by railroad , if a small charge for freight and none for risk were all the results of the presence of a hostile fleet . That there is positive ground for some doctrine of contraband is shown by its appearing thus far in all theory and all the practice of the law of nations . It is not as clear as the Secretary would have it , that the rights of neutrals alone must be considered in international law , that in strict justice they have a right to carry on their intercourse with the belligerent in the same way after the war as before . Just here lies the principal difficulty in the law of nations , that the rights and interests of neutrals and of belligerents clash ; hence the changes of practice among nations , and hence the unsettled state of the science . If we could say with Mr. Marcy , that " humanity and justice require that the calamities incident to war should be strictly limite* to the belligerents themselves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the science of which he is so eminent an expounder would be very easy of construction ; no other rule would find place in it , except that neutrals might trade as they pleased uncontrolled by the parties at war . But is this the whole of justice ? Has not also each party to the war a right to make its antagonist feel the evils of disallowing what it believes to be its just claims ? Here , then , are conflicting rights , or rather the neutral has not an absolute and perpetual , but only a modified right of intercourse with even its own friend . The interests of a third party come into , to qualify and modify , what was justice before . But while we do not believe that an essential change in the doctrine of contraband would be for the good of the world , we are ready to rejoice in all the evidences of progress which the peace of Paris and the propositions of our Government furnish . If , from a well founded jealousy of nations having large navies , our Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still rejoice that this questionable mode of warfare is to cease among the great states of Europe . And if perfect immunity for private property on the seas , when not contraband , should be allowed by the consent of all nations , we should hail it not so much as a sign that wars should be put on their proper footing hereafter , as that the nations expected peace to be the rule , and war the exception . // We had intended when we began our remarks to touch upon some other topics of international law , which have an especial importance at the present time , but our limits require us to stop at this point . We hope to pursue the subject on some future occasion .
