Legislative Power of the September , . LEGISLATIVE POWER OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. * THE adoption of written constitutions , in which are embodied certain fundamental principles which are to restrain the rulers of the people is as yet an experiment in the science of government . To insure the success of this desideratum in government , it appears to us that the only rational hope of its accomplishment must be based upon the literal interpretation of the instrument in which these are recorded , in contradistfr*ction to that of a " Uberat construction , " by which an instrument , defining the objects of legislation , may be made to embrace many powers not delegated . The architects of our Constitution were well aware of the baneful influence which such a doctrine must exert upon the minor party to the Federal Consti * " The Congress shall have power : " 1 . To lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises ; to pay the debts and proride for the ' common defense and general welfare of the United States ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the United States . " 2 . To borrow money on the credit of the United States . " 3 . To regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several States , and with the Indian tribes . " 4 . To establish a uniform rule of naturalization , and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States . " 5 . To coin money , regulate the value thereof ; and of foreign coins , and fix the standard of weights and measures . " 6 . To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States . " 7 . To establish post-offices and post-roads. " 8 . To promote the progress of science and useful arts , by securing , for limited times , to authors and inventors , the exclusive rights to their respective writings and discoveries . " 9 . To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court : to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the hinh seas , and offenses against the laws of nations . " 10 . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make rules concernin* captures on land and water . 11 . To raise and support armies ; but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years . " 12 . To provide and maintain a navy . " 13 . To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces . " 14 . To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union , suppress insurrections , and repel invasions . " 15 . To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia , and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States , // tution , and that it would eventually tend to the annihilation of all their endeavors for the formation of a permanent union of the States . To avoid this , the greatest of all evils which could accrue to the written Constitution which they were about to frame , namely , a departure from its letter , they spec/ied the objects to be embraced by the legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sedulous were they in discountenancing any resort to implication of power , that , wherever they have bestowed certain powers of a general nature , they have , the more effectually to guard against this most dangerous mode of deriving power , given the same in detail , as is fully illu4rated in the following extracts from the Constitution itself , to wit : To Congress has been given the power to " coin money " and " to regulate the value thereof : " what then more reasonable than to infer that this power carried along with it , by necessary implication , the power to punish the counterfeiting of that coin ? But so circumspect were the framers of the Constitution , that in order to avoid all resort to implication , they deemed it expedient to confer a separate power to this end , and accordingly decreed , that Con*ress should have power " to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States . " Congress is empowered " to regulate commerce with foreign nations ; " " to raise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy : " to these primary powers what could be more incidental than the power to punish piracies , the power to appoint officers to this army when raised , as also to have control of its " forts , magazines , arsenals , dock-yards , and other needful buildings " ? But so solicitous was the Conventio to banish the term implication from the Constitution , that we perceive a separate power vested by the Constitution to warrant thit exercise of jurisdiction upon these subjects , to wit : " Congress shall have power to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces ; " " to provide for calling forth the militia " " to define and punish piracies committed upon the high seas , and offenses against the laws of nations ; " " to exercise authority over its forts , magazines , arsenals , dock-yards , and other needful buildings . " Are these subsequent clauses of the Constitution to be regarded as mere tautology ? Or are they the result of an acquaintance with the fundamental principle to be observed relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its letter , in contradistinction to implication ? reserving to the States respectively the appointment of the officers , and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress . " 16 . To exercise exclusive legislation in all cas* whatsoever over such district ( not exceeding ten miles square ) *s may , by cession of particular States , and the acceptance of Congress , become the seat of government of the United States , and to exercise like authority over all places purchased , by the consent of the Legislature of the State in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dock-yards , and other needful buildings : and " 17 . To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof . " - Constitution of the United Stat , Sec. 8. // " Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers , and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States , or in any department or officer thereof . " The construction which the Supreme Court of the United States has put upon this clause of the Constitution , has become the broad base upon which the federal government , and those interested in its undue aggrandizement , would rear the stately edifice of implied powers . The decision of this Court maintains that the language of this clause tends to enlarge rather than restrain the government in the execution of its delegated powers . Such is the coincidence and unanimity of ai'gument which pervades the decision of the Chief-Justice of this Court on the bank question , and Mr. Hamilton 's report of the constitutionality of that institution , that it is difficult to conceive that the former had consulted any other authority in the formation of his decision than the above-named report . In arguing this question , Mr. Hamilton says : " That every power vested in a government is in its nature sovereign , and includes , by the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requisite and fairly applicable to the attainment of the ends of such power , and which are not precluded by restrictions and exceptions specified by the Constitution . " The language of the Chief-Justice , after having maintained the sovereign nature of every power vested in the government , is to this effect : that " all the means which are appropriate and which are plainly applicable to the attainment of the end of such power , and which are not prohibited by the Constitution ; and if a certain means ' to r carry into effect any of the powers of the government be appropriate , the degree of its necessity is a question of legislative discretion , and not of judicial inquiry . " Again , Mr. Hamilton argues , " the expressions have a peculiar comprehensiveness ; " they are " to make all laws necessary and proper to carry into execution the foregoing powers , " etc . The Chief-Justice conceives , " that its terms purport to enlarge , not to diminish the powers of the government . No reason has or can be assigned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature under words which purport to enlarge , " etc . We have traced this analogy of argument to point out how error propagates error . Mr. Hamilton , in his financial operations , no doubt , found that the bank in question would facilitate the operations of the treasury department of which he was Secretary , without scrutinizing the ordinary signification of the words " necessary-an-d&gt;proper . " Whether these were used by the Convention in an enlarged or restricted sense , will speedily appear by an appeal to the journal of tiis body  --  the most valid testimony that can be deduced in an inquiry into the views and designs of the framers of the Constitution-an unerring light to guide us in our search into the spirit of the federal compact . This evidence did not exist in print when the above decision was given , the proceedings of this august assembly having been published at a period comparatively recent . Had this evidence existed in the form which now facilitates our inquiries into this clause , we feel // assured that the reverse of this decision must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when first introduced into the Convention , in Mr. Pickney 's draft of a federal constitution , and its subsequent alterations , hurries the mind to the irresistible conclusion , that it had its origin in a desire to restrict and not to enlarge the powers of the proposed government . In Mr. Pickney 's draft , submitted to the Convention on the 29th of May , this clause imposed no qualifying terms upon the government , and read thus : " And to make all laws for carrying the foregoing powers into execution . " ( Journal , page 71 . ) Here , indeed , Mr. Hamilton and the Chief-Justice might have said that the terms of the grant were of " peculiar comprehensiveness , " for they had not yet been qualified by the terms " necessary and proper " to the end proposed ; which , in our opinion , most rigidly restricts the discretion of the federal legislature as to the manner of carrying into execution its foregoing powers ; that is , this clause imposes the condition that the law executing the foregoing powers must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , and so appropriate , that without the enactment of such secondary law , the grant of the first power would be nugatory . These words have a peculiar meaning , and are too self-evident to admit of elucidation . We may , however , arrive at a more satisfactory conclusion as to the purport of this clause from a farther pursuit of its conventional history . Mr. Pinckney 's draft , then , containing this unqualified grant of discretionary power , as to the manner of executing its delegated powers , was submitted to a committee of detail , who , after much deliberation , reported this clause on the 6th of August , as it now obtains in the Constitution , namely , to pass all laws " necessary and proper , " and not all laws whatsoever , which was the amount of the clause as it was submitted to this committee of detail . It is difficult to conceive of a better mode of conveying the views of the Convention than that which results from the insertion of the qualifying terms " necessary and proper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the members of the Convention , containing a clause empowering the proposed federal legislature with discretionary power as to the means of carrying into execution its foregoing powers . This constitution is submitted to * committee for a more special examin* ation , which , in the course of its deliberations , at length arrives at this clause . To some of the committee the language of this ' clause appears too indefinite , and as tending to authorize a system of implication and construction of power which was not in unison with their views of the use of a written constitution , namely , that of limitis*g the government to be created within certain known bounds , that is , limiting it to the letter of the Constitution ; for once launched upon the sea of implication , it was difficult to conceive of a limit to federal power . In their extreme caution to crush , csb ovo , any such spirit in the federal councils , they deemed it necessary to insert the words " necessary and proper , " which , by qualifying the clause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , impli // cation of powers . Thus does it appear to us , that the subsequent alteration of this clause , instead of enlarging , prescribes rigid bounds to the discretion of the federal legislature in the execution of its delegated powers . It is urged by the Chief-Justice , " that this power is placed among the powers of Congress , and not among the limitations of these powers . " The mere location of a clause in the Constitution will scarcely be received as evidence against the conventional history and language of that clause itself . We conceive it , however , any other than misplaced ; for where could a power , authorizing the passage of all laws necessary and proper for the execution of its foregoing delegated powers , be placed otherwise than after the enumeration of those powers ? In short , the very existence of this clause in the Constitution most incontestably establishes our position of its limiting or restraining nature . Had this clause been omitted altogether , it would in no way have affected the rights of the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyed by this clause , would , in the case of its omission , have flowed , ex necessitate rei , from unavoidable implication . To have delegated certain powers to a government , would of necessity have carried with it the intention of executing those powers ; and in the absence of all restriction as to the mode of carrying these into execution , the government would find itself possessed of full discretionary power as to the mode and manner of executing its delegated authority . Under these circumstances , Mr. Hamilton might then have said , with more reason than in the case to which it was applied , that " every power vested in a government is in its nature sovereign , and includes , by force of the term , the right to employ all means requisite and fairly applicable to the attainment of the ends of such power , and which are not precluded by the restrictions and exceptions specified by the Constitution . " Such language would have been in perfect accordance with the case , had the omission of the restrictions and exceptions not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion , that the government possessed the right of using " all means " to attain a desired object , when we have seen the clause modified so as to restrict the federal legislature to those means which are strictly necessary and proper to the end proposed , namely , to the accomplishment of its foregoing powers ? This clause , then , it will readily be seen , had its origin in the same spirit which dictated those which have already been cited as only confirmatory of powers already delegated . It is to be regarded in the same light as those which , after having delegated to Congress the power to " coin money , to regulate the value thereof , " etc. ; " to regulate cowmerce with foreign nations , " etc. ; to avoid even unavoidable implication , ex abundante eautelft , goes on to give the same in detail , namely , Congress shall have power " to provide for the punishing of counterfeiting of the securities and current coin of the United States . " Also , " to define and punish piracies committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations . " So this clause , after having enumerated all the powers designed to be vested in the government , did they look // to with the hope of still farther restricting the government to the " nece8sary " or unavoidable ( for such is the signification of the term ) measures for the accomplishment of its delegated powers . As a further check upon the government in the exercise of implied powers , the States , after the adoption of the Constitution , appended certain other clauses to that instrument , which , even had they been omitted in many instances , could not have effected the security of their rights . The 10th amendment of the Constitution again announced the restricting nature of the instrument in the following words : " The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor proh.ibited to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . " A comparison of the articles of confederation with the present federal Constitution , evinces the omission of a word , which , though in no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance by the use made of it by the Supreme Court of the United States . In the articles of confederation , the words " not e*pressly dele*ated , etc. , " are to be met with , which do not obtain in the present Constitution . Guided by the spirit of implication , which has ever presided over the deliberations of this Court , it has been decided that the omission of this term was indicative of a disposition on the part of the Convention to enlarge the powers of the federal government . Whether this assertion is in accordance with the spirit which dictated this and the other amendments to the Constitution , will soon plainly appear , by reference to the history of these clauses , as set forth in their preamble , namely : " The conventions of a number of the States having , at the time of their adopting the Constitution , expressed a desire , in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers , that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added ; and as extending the grounds of public confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its institution , Resolved , " etc . Thus manifesting the extreme caution which actuated the parties to the federal compact ; and thus upon the face of the record itself refuting most conclusively the latitudinarian doctrine of the Supreme Court . The annexing of declaratory and restrictive clauses to a constitution is certainly an irregular mode of enlarging the powers of the government . If there was wanting all other evidence as to the restrictive nature of these clau.ses , the above would alone refute the opinion of the Court , as unsound and hi*hly subversive of the reserved rights of the States , and thus of the Constitution its'lf . In order to satisfy t e minds of the most cavilling of our opponents , we will pursue our strictures upon this opinion of the Court . The omission or insertion of the term " expressly " can by no distortion of reasoning be made to alter the signification of the clause . The term , as it stood in the articles of confederation , rendered that instrument justly obnoxious to the charge of pleonasm and tautology , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Constitution ; in corrobor ' tion of which it has been asked , " If in a deed of conveyance of land , // would the grantor give more or would the grantee receive more by using the words , doth absolutely , expressly , clearly , and unequivocally grant , bargain , sell , and convey , ' than if the words were simply doth grant , bargain , sell , and convey ? " This view of the question , if it be correct , of which there can be but one opinion , then the relinquishment of the interpretation of the Court as to the implied powers of the government must necessarily follow . That a limited or literal construction of the Constitution , or the letter of the Constitution , is to be our sole guide in administering the powers conveyed by that instrument , and is the true theory of our government , we conscientiously believe will stand the t.est of the most rigid examination into its structure and organization . In order to confirm this point , we can not better prove our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The powers , " says this authority , " delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government , are few and defined . Those which remain to the State governments are numerous and indefinite . The former will be exercised principally on external objects , as war , peace , negotiation , and foreign commerce . The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all objects which , in the ordinary course of a irs , concern the lives , liberties , and properties of the people , and in the external order , improvement , and prosperity of the State . " In this extract we have a just description of the legislative prerogatives of the two governments , namely , State and federal , when governed by the letter of the Constitution , in opposition to those prerogatives which must result from implication of powers from an instrument of defined and enumerated powe1* . But it has &amp;en sai that implication or construction of power is absolutely inseparable from the Constitution ; that a resort to these powers is essential , as a means of carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been asked what are our light-houses , our navy-yards , our arsen* Is , and our magazines ? Are not these powers based upon the doctrine of implication , and unavoidably incidental to the primary powers of regulating commerce and providing for and maintaining an army and navy ? This argument is more specious than valid . As regards the two last instances , we know they have been provided for by the terms of the Constitution itself ; as regards the first , we have only to remark that when the mean shall be nccessary and proper to the end , this connection will make the mean employed constitutional . Who , then , is to decide as to the fitness of the means to the end ? Two rules might be adopted , which would effectually obviate any difficulty , namely : first , that the end must be approached by the most direct means ; and , secondly , that in the absence of this disposition , there must be controlling power , somewhere , to correct the aberration of the federal legislature , and this check naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily rest in one of the parties to that instrument . Whenever , therefore , one of the parties shall object to the exercise of an incidental power , as not appropriate to the end proposed , to an honest legislature such protest // would prove most conclusively that the condition annexed to an incidental power to give it constitutionality , namely , the " necessary and proper , " was wanting . It will scarcely be objected that the protesting State , influenced by the interested motives , would pronounce the mean employed unnecessary and improper , when its disavowal would render an undisputed power nugatory . That person must indeed entertain a low sense of the moral condition of this or any other free community , who could dread that the majority of the legislators of a State , although bound by oath to observe the Constitution , would yet infringe that Constitution , withholding from the government the means of executing its plainly delegated duties . When such can be found , who shall , when called upon to furnish salaries for foreign ministers , refuse , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions can not otherwise be discharged , thus rendering this power of the government nugatory , the liberties and morals of that people who do not rebuke such legislators with scorn and derision is but a phantom . It is not possible in this country to fi d the individual who would say , that although Congress is authorized to make treaties with foreign nations , and appoint ambassadors , yet a law authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to make an appropriation for his transportation across the Atlantic would be unnecessary and improper ; and yet this is all that the Constitution designs when it authorizes Congress to make all laws necessary and proper to carry into execution its foregoing powers . These terms have a definite meaning , and may be taken in contradistinction to those means which shall be most desirable or agreeable to the end proposed . To have attempted to render this clause more restrictive than it now is , would , it is to be feared , have rendered the previously delegated powers nugatory ; per haps it would have been impossible . The very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictive nature . With it the government finds itself restricted to those means which shall , almost by universal consent , be conceded as necessary and proper to the end proposed . Without such clause , the government would have possessed discretionary powers , and have been invested with the power of resorting to all means whatever for the accomplishment of the end proposed , namely , the execution of its foregoing powers . The above , then , being the true theory of a written constitution , it follows that the federal legislature would be restrained from the exercise of many powers which have hitherto been deemed as appertaining to this department of the government . Agreeably then to thejetter of the Constitution , and to a rigid construction of this clause of the Constitution , it follows that the sources of federal legislative power are of a two-fold character , namely : First , that which results from the seventeen specific or enumerated powers . Secondly , from the restrictive clause which grants an extension of the legislative power , in such cases as are " necessary and proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // 242 Legidative Power of the With these definite ideas of the sources of federal legislative power , we think we may easily test the constitutionality of certain laws which have received the sanction of this body . With these views , which we feel are in perfect accordance with the design of a written Constitution , we now proceed to investigate the constitutionality of the most obnoxious of these laws . And first , of the constitutionality of Protective Tariff Laws . " Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excise , to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general we*fare of the United States . But 11 duties , imposts , and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States . " " To regulate commerce with foreign nations , and among the several States , and the Indian tribes . " " To promote the progres of science and the wseful arts , by securing for limited times , to authors and inventors , the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Article 1st . ) As the advocates of protective tariff laws have not arranged it among themselves upon which of these clauses hinges the power of the msjority of representatives in Congress to foster the local interests of their constituents at the expense of the interests of the constituents of the minority , we hope that it wifl be deemed excusable in us if , shrinking from that which they themselves have been anxious to avoid , we shall proceed to examine into each of these clauses in detail . Upon the phrase " general welfare , " to be found in the first above clause , as a corner-stone , has been based the doctrine of implied powers ; which , however inconsistent with the designs of the framers of the Constitution , has been resorted to by the Consolidatioflists , with a hope of encompassing certain powers , which were refused by the Convention , when asked for , as parts of the Constitution . In accumulating authority in support of their usurpations , the majority of Congress have not failed to claim their right of univers 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission would necessarily tend to the conclusion , that if to Congress has been delegated the power of legislating in all such cases in which they deemed the general welfare involved , such an admission conducts to the unavoidable inference that this body is clothed with discretionary powers , as to all and any objects of its legislation , thus rendering the specific grant of powers by the Constitution the work of supererogation ; that the remainder of the instrument is virtually nullified ; that by the *xagical skill of this body , sovereign and independent States , who may have deemed that they had restricted the government which they had created , in such a manner as to insure their reserved rights , these may , in the twinkling of an eye , be consolidated into one grand government , and find themselves under a legislative power as omnipotent as that of the Imperial Parliament of the British Isles . That such an interpretation of these terms " general welfare " is not rational , is // evident from the difficulties to which it leads ; for nothing can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a document , which renders the rest of that instrument nugatory . We therefore now propose to elucidate these ominous phrases , by an examination into their history . By reference to the Journal of the Convention , it will be perceived that there existed a disposition on the part of some of the members of that body to intrust Congress with discretionary power as to the laying and collecting of taxes , which was met by a counter disposition on the part of others . The clause , as originally reported by the committee of detail , stood thus : " The Legislature of the United States shall have power to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises . " In Mr. Pinckney 's draft of a constitution , the words are the same . On the 18th of August , we find the following motion before the committee , namely , " That a clause or clauses be prepared , to restrain the legislature of the United States from establishing a perpetual revenue : " and we shall soon perceive that the terms " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accomplishment of that object . We therefore find , on the 22d of the same month , the committee reporting that the clause should read thus : " To lay taxes , duties , imposts , excises ; for the payment of the debts and necessary *expenses of the United States . " Aft9r much discussion , between the 22d of A*gust and the 4th of September , the clause finally passed the committee as it now stands in the Constitution . Thus do we perceive how great was the jealousy which existed in the Convention , upon the subject of leaving the federal government unrestricted as to the objects to be accomplished by the taxing power . We now see that the phrase " general welfare , " so far from authorizing discretionary power , evidently restricts the government as to the end proposed by its tariff laws , namely , to pay the debts and provide for common defense and general welfare of these United States . The phrase , as also the whole clause , simply prescribes the end to which all moneys raised by taxation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , let us see the opinion of Mr. Madison , as to the import of this phrase , as found in the Federatist , a work by no means favorable to State supremacy . " Some , " says he , " have grounded a fierce attack upon the Constitution on the language in which it is defined . " It has been urged and echoed that the power " to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises ; to pay the public debts , and to provide for the common defense and general welfare , amounts to an unlimited*ommission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for common defense and welfare . " No stronger proof could be given of the distress under which these writers labor for objections , than their stooping to such misconstruction . Had no other enumeration or definition of the powers of Congress been found in the Constitution , than the general expression just cited , the authors of the objection might have had some color for it , though difficult to find a reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all possible cases . A power to destroy the freedom of the press , the trial by jury , or even to regulate the course of descents , or the forms of conveyances , must be very singularly expressed by the terms " to raise money for the general welfare . " The objection here is more extraordinary , as it appears the language used by the Convention is a copy of the articles of confederation . The objects ' of Union among the States , as described in Article 3d , are , " Their common defense and general welfare . " The terms of the 8th article are more identical : " All charges of war and other expenses , that shall be incurred for the common defense and general welfare , and allowed by the United States in Congress , shall be defrayed out of the common treasury . " A similar language occurs in Article 9th . Construe either of these articles by the rules which would justify the construction put on the new Constitution , and they vest in the existing Congress a power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of that assembly , if ; attaching themselves to these general expressions , and disregarding the specifications which ascertain and limit their import , they had exercised an unlimited power of providing for the common defense and general welfare ? I appeal to the objectors themselves , whether they would , in that case , have employed the same reasoning in justification of Congress , as they now make use of it against the Convention ? " How difficult is it for error to escape its own condemnation I " ( Page 315 . ) Suppose , however , for argument 's sake , we were to admit that Congress could enact laws , although based upon no delegated power , and not " necessary and proper " to carry into execution foregoing powers , upon the ground that they were conducive to the " general welfare . " Such an admission would in no way extricate the consolidationists from their difficulties . For how can a law be of general utility , stamped as it is by the veto of one or more States , because subversive of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxing one portion of the Union for the benefit of another ? Having thus traced the origin , progress , and ultimate signification of this ominous phrase , we candidly believe that there can not exist an ingenious mind which will not promptly admit that the phrase can not be regarded as of serious import ; because if aught be*ttached to it , we find ourselves unavoidably hurried to the conclusion that the remainder of the Constitution is a dead letter ; this phrase alone empowe$ng Congress with unlimited legislative authority . " How difficult is it for eixor to escape its own condemnation . " Having , as we conceive , suffi4ently examined into these portentous phrases , and having denuded them of all their would-be potency , and haying incontestably established the fact that they had their origin in the pecuniary exigencies of the government , and that they could by no fair mode of reasoning be made to empower the federal legislature with an authority to foster the interests of one portion of the United States at the expense of the other , we now pass to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with power to regulate commerce with foreign nations . // We were scarcely prepared for this subterfuge on the part of our opponents . We scarcely expected to find them sheltering themselves under a clause which has so little connection with the occult design of protective tariff laws , whose effect is to protect manufactures at the expense of the agricultural and commercial interests of the United States . This clause , as all well know , had its origin in the necessity of investing the general government with power over all subjects involving the interests of more than one State , and to which the legislation of a single State was necessarily in competent . Such was the case with the commercial interests of the States when intrusted to Congress . Tau*ht by the embarrassments which had involved the government of the old confederacy , for the want of this power over commerce , it was . cheerfully resigned , by the insertion of this clause of the Constitution . How difficult would it have been at that time to have divined that this clause , arising as it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does to the federal legislature the power of extending to the remotest parts of the earth our commercial relations , should have been perverted to its present purposes ; that it ever should have been deemed as investing this body with the power of prostrating , at one " fell swoop , " this most lucrative and extensive branch of industry , for the protection of that of manufactures , which embraces but a small portion of the capital of these United States , and certainly not a dollar of many of the States . That Congress may , when acting within its constitutional sphere of legislation , as prescribed by the litera scr*pta of the Constitution , pass laws restricting the importation of foreign manufactures , as a bonct-ftde measure of retaliation for previous aggression upon our commerce by other nations , no one can reasonably doubt . Such retaliation would originate in a desire to extend our commercial relations , and thus be agreeable to the very letter of the Constitution itself . But to argue , that by the same provision of that instrument , this body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that branch of industry , would be such an assumption in argument , that even in the absence of all other evidence*to the contrary , it must fall to the ground by its own weakness . Jf by virtue of this clause , the federal legis lature can legislate upon the subject of manufactures , because they are remotely connected with commerce , by the same course of reasoning , legislation might be made to extend to any and every branch of industry ; and thus this clause alone invests Congress with a grant of universal legislative power . So extensive are the ramifications o* each branch of industry , and so intimately are they woven together , that it would be impossible to assign any limits to the boundaries of legislation , if this latitudinarianism were admissible . Would it be doing any violence to the premises of these ultraconstructionist8 of a written Constitution , to deduce , by the same course of reasoning , the right of Congress to fit out an exploratory expedition to the Antarctic Pole , to establish a university , or to incorporate companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouragement of domestic // manufacture ? These are all as essentially connected with commerce " with foreign nations " as is the present system of protective policy . New discoveries in the polar regions may open new channels for our commerce . Science is so intimately connected with navigation , that the latter could never have attained its present state of perfection without the assistance of the former as regards the last supposition , it would be equally reasonable to encourage commerce and manufactures by the incorporation of companies , as well as by tariff restrictions upon commerce , or the adoption of retaliatory duties . The one or the other might have been adopted with equal propriety , as the discretion of the legislature might have determined . To such absurdities does a departure from the letter of a written constitution lead . Once launched upon the sea of implied powers , a deep and boundless ocean of universal legislation lies before us , without a rock or a shoal to intimidate or interrupt our headlong progress . It has been said , with an air of triumph , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tonnage laws are equally an infraction of the provisions of that instrument . As this argument is specious , it deserves some consideration . These laws , it is known , impose certain duties upon all vessels entering our harbors , discriminating in favor of those owned by our citizens . This certainly partakes of the nature of protection ; but the system of discriminating tonnage duties is strictly a 1 a-ftde commercial retaliation , instituted and kept up as a mean to induce a more liberal intercourse with foreign nations . But when they shall have had their retaliatory effect , or it is apparent that there is no hope of their accomplishing such an end ; when they shall have been carried to such an extent that they exclude the foreign navigator , and restrict the carrying trade to the native merchant , and are maintained as a means of protection to this branch of industry , it is evident that they in no way differ from laws for the protection of manufactures . These laws , however , as they have hitherto existed , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industry , and are chiefly to be ju*tified as a revenue measure . These laws date as early as the third legislative act of the general government , and were thus early enacted to restrict the privileges of foreign vessels , and to induce a desire in all nations wishing to traae with us to enter into treaties conferring reciprocal advantages . And in effecting this object , these laws have undergone material modifications , varying in each case , as the nation treated with was disposed to aband*n the old and obsolete doctrine of restriction , and adopt the more generally received principles of free trade . Viewed in this light , these laws are in accordance both with the letter and the spirit of the Constitution . When , however , they shall be perverted from these their legitimate objects , especially to protect the native shipowner , they necessarily are no longer of general utility to the community at large , but are limited in their operations to the advancement of the interests of a small portion of society ; and that , too , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thus restricted from the benefits arising from the employment of those who will carry cheapest . Under such circumstances , it is evident that they would be unconstitutional ; such partial legislation can not be in unison with the provisions of a Constitution , the very existence of which is attributable to the want of a common government , to regulate those interests of general and not partial utility . Whatever degree of truth the above arguments may possess , there are others , too cogent in their nature , and the source from which they are drawn , not to carry conviction to the minds of all not strongly fortified by interest or prejudice . We allude to those arguments and sources of information to be collected from the Journal of the Convention , where may be seen recorded the proceedings of that body while these clauses were under discussion . We therefore again invite the attention of the reader to this invaluable work , the true receptacle of the spirit of the Constitution . By a reference to this Journal , we find that the clause of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a power " to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the States , " was introduced on the 16th of August , in the draft of a constitution submitted by the committee to whom the previous resolutions of the Convention had been referred . As might have been expected , we find no objections made to this clause ; and all that we know of this clause is the subsequent addition made to it relative to the regulation of intercourse with the " Indian tribes . " This regulation of commerce by a general government having been the chief cause which gave rise to the calling of the Convention , this clause met with not the slightest opposition , and passed into the present Constitution without discussion . On the 18th of August , we find the Convention engaged in discussing the propriety of extending the powers of the new government , and in accordance with these views , it was proposed , among many other powers to be vested in Congress , that it was expedient " to establish public institutions , rewards , and immunities for the promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Again , on the 20th day of August , it was proposed " that a Council of State should assist the President , to be composed of the chief justice and five secretaries , " etc . It devolved upon the Secretary of Domestic Affairs to attend to matters of general police , the state of agriculture and manufactures , the opening of roads and navigation , and the facilitating of communication throughout the United States , and to recommend such measures and establishments as might tend to promote such objects . " In pursuing our subject , we find , that on the 31st of August there was app'ointed a committee , consisting of a member from each State , to act upon such parts of reports as had not been previously acted upon . On the 1st of September this grand committee reported partially , but did not touch the subject of science , trades , canals , or manufactures . On the 4th , the committee again reported partially , but said nothing of manufactures . On the 5th , the committee further and finally reported , recommending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to insert the following clause , that " Congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and the useful arts , by securing for limited times , to authors and inventors , the exclusive right to their respective rights and discoveries . " Thus answering to the many applications which had been made , to invest the proposed government with a power to legislate for the protection of manufactures , science , etc . This clause , then , specifies the only mode in which Congress can rightfully legislate upon the subject of manufactures , namely , as a branch of the useful arts . This clause , emanating from the committee to whom had been referred certain resolutions , proposing to extend the legislative power of the government to the subject of manufactures , without taking any other notice of the subject referred to them , namely , that of manufactures , speaks to our mind a language too explicit to be misunderstood . Their silence upon a specific resolution , which had been referred to them , would alone have been indicative of their disapprobation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them proposing a clause which embraced the power desired by the projectors of the resolutions , the inference that they designed to restrict the federal legislature , in the manner of protecting manufactures , is irresistible . We therefore find ourselves forced to the conclusion , that it is only by granting patents and securing to individuals the rights and privileges resulting from their inventions , that the government can foster an individual or local interest . As regards the argument , that the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations involves the power to protect manufactures , we think it fully refuted in the preceding extracts from the Journal of the Convention . From the introduction of these resolutions su ? *sequent to the clause conferring the power over commerce , it is certain that the consolidation party in the Convention did not so understand it . To suppose that they , who had so ardently desired to invest the general government with a power over manufactures , could have been so ignorant of the preceding day 's transactions , as not to be aware that the power that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , too , nemine contradicente , would be yielding our assent to an impossibility . We are aware , however , that it may be retorted , that this argument is more striking than forcible ; that the term commerce , having also obtained in those resolutions , by the same reasoning it would be inferred that the power over the regulation of commerce had not yet been conferred . This position , as formidable as , at first sight , it may appear , in no way milital*s against our argument as to the constitutionality of these laws ; it rather assures us , that the framers of our Constitution did not deem the power over commerce in such a latitudinarian light as those of the present day who advocate implied powers . The authors of the Constitution no doubt understood this clause , which grants the power over commerce , simply as authorizing Congress to make treaties and laws regulating this branch of industry in a uniform manner throughout the United States , and not in the slightest manner supposing that this clause // would have been perverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is evident that something more than the mere regulation of foreign intercourse was here meant , an encouragement to commerce and manufactures , as a specific branch of industry , being here evidently designed . The committee , however , left nothing to the discretion of the legislature ; they specified the manner in which this legislature should encourage these branches of the useful arts , namely , by securing to ingenious men " the exclusive right to their respective discoveries . " Agreeably then to the principles which we have already laid down , as to the interpretation of a written constitution , it follows , there being no power found among the enumerated powers of Congress to warrant legislation on the subject of manufactures , and it being apparent that it is not " necessary and proper " to carry into execution any of the foregoing powers , that this power can not be constitutionally exercised by that body . It now only remains for us to examine into the motives of the authors of the Constitution , when they rejected the subject of manufactures , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct . As the new government could be organized only upon principles of perfect reciprocity , it was early perceived , that without an ample share of this spirit pervading the contracting parties all attempts to organize a general government would prove abortive . It was evident that while such a spirit pervaded the representatives of the different States , convened in convention , the proposition to invest the proposed government with a power to protect a branch of industry which involved the interest but of one half of the States , must necessarily have received but little encouragement from that body . Being , therefore , a local interest , it is not surprising that it was not deemed worthy of the consideration of those who were convened to organize a general government for general pu*poses , consigning all matters of local import to the local or State governments . Though defeated in the Convention , the advocates of domestic manufactures did not abandon hopes of yet accomplishing their objects . Two short years had scarcely elapsed when we beheld the rejected subject of manufactures revived . In the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for revenue , we perceive that the advocates of this rejected interest at length accomplished their object ; for in the preamble of the law , June 1st , 1799 , we find as follows : " Whereas it is necessary for the support of government , for the discharge of the debts of the United States , and encourage nt and promotion of manufactures , that the duties be laid upon goods , wares , and merchandise imported , ' etc . Thus , by an appeal to the representatives of the people of the manufacturing States assembled in Congress , the manufacturers effected that protection which they had asked in vain from the representatives of the States convened in convention , whose purpose it was , as we have seen , to limit the powers of the federal government in this particular . From this law , then , must we date the origin of the federal usurpation .
