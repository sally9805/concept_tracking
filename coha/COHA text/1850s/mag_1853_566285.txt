txt ART . V.-JOIIN ADAMS ' DIARY AND AUTOBIOGRAPHY . The Works of John Adams , second President of the United States : with a Life of the Author , Notes and illustrations , by his grandson , CHARLES FRANCES ADAMS . Vols . II and III . Boston : Charles C. Little and James Brown . 1850. - Diary : with Passages from an Autobiography . THE Works of John Adams are now in course of publication , by an eminent Boston house , under the editorship of his grandson . The whole undertaking includes a Life of John Adams , in one volume ; a Diary , with passages from an Autobiography , in two volumes ; and several volumes of his writings . Six goodly octavos elegant*y printed on fine paper , with Portraits aud Facsimiles , have already appeared ; and other volumes are yet to come . The first volume , which is to contain a Life of Mr. Adams , has not been published , and perhaps it will not be until all the other volumes have been given to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passages from an Autobiography* and several Essays , on the Canon arid // Feudal Law , the Independence of the Judiciary , &amp;c. , with Notes of Debates in the Continental Congress , in the years 1775 and 1776 . These two volumes will furnish the materials for this article ; but before proceeding to cull characteristic passages , we will glance at the contents of the four following volumes . In the fourth and fifth will be found " Controversial Papers of the Revolution , " one of which is entitled " Novanglus ; " and another , " Thoughts on Government , " occupying alone , more than one volume . Between these treatises is inserted the first Constitution of Massachusetts . The sixth volume contains " Works on Government , " including a Defense of the Con stitutions of Government of the United States of America ; Discourses on Davila ; and several minor pieces , consisting of Letters between Mr. Adams , Samuel Adams , and Roger Sherman ; Letters to John Taylor of Caroline , Va. , and a Review of Mr. Hillhouse 's celebrated Propositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Letters in the Review will be read by the present generation of political students , with as much interest as contemporary pamphlets on the exciting topics of the day . In the seventh volume , a new division of the Works commences , under the head of " Official Letters , Messages , and Public Papers . " How much remains to be published , our readers may estimate for themselves , when we inform them that volume seventh is wholly occupied with letters on public business , written between the years 1777 and 1782 . Subsequent to this date , Mr. Adams spent several years in Europe , during which time , his correspondence was voluminous . With this brief statement , we turn to our allotted task . When the whole undertaking , including the Life and the Works of John Adams , has been completed , it will be time for some one , familiar with our early annals , to assign to the second president of the United States , his true position in our national history , and his rank among our public men . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Diary and Autobiography contained in Vols . II and 111 , and so weave together such extracts as will interest our readers , while giving them an insight into the character of Mr. Adams , and glimpses of the " form and pressure " of the times in which he flourished . In a well written preface , the editor , who is considered one of the profoundest scholars in American History , and in political science , among us , states the nature of the work , and the principles by which he has been guided , in preparing it for the press . " A Diary , " he says , " is the record in youth of a man 's sentiments , in middle life , of his action , and of his recollections in age . To others , it can be interesting // only if it have impressed upon it the stamp of strong individual character . But with this as a substratum , notices of striking scenes , of extraordinary events and noted contemporaries , may be superadded to form a memorial worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said to fill up this idea ; yet , beginning , as they do with the writer 's entrance into responsible life , and extending through a large part of a great career , they may be considered as in a measure superseding the necessity of an elaborate biography . " Yet only in a measure , for the truth of history , and the reputation of John Adams , require that his Life should be written by a free , bold , and elaborate hand . The Diary commences in the autumn of 1755 , and closes in 1796 , thus continuing through a period of more than forty years , of a most active life . But there are many breaks and omissions , which leads the editor to remark as follows : " The broken and partial nature of this Diary , is the circumstance most to be regretted about it . As the time advances towards the most interesting events in the Revolution , the record becomes less and less satisfactory . It is a great disadvantage attending even the most regularly kept of such works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action in which the writer finds himself engaged , is the physical inability to command the leisure necessary to describe it . Thus it happens in the present case , that the sketches sometimes stop just when the reader would have them begin , and at other times no notice whatever is taken of events which are the most prominent in the life of the writer . " This is provokingly true , in numerous cases , and creates the necessity for a complete memoir , yet the breaks in the Diary are partially supplied by passages from an Autobiography , which however closes in 1776 . " An interval of a year takes place , and then follows a paper which appears to have been commenced on the first of December , 1806 , under the title of Travels and Negotiations . ' The greater part of this is only an amplification of his Diary of the same period . " From this paper such portions as furnish interesting details , have been selected , and interwoven with the Diary . Such a work as this needs notes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicious . " The editor has suppressed or altered nothing in the Diary , which might be considered as bearing either against the author himself , or against any other person , for that reason alone . Wherever any omission has been made , it has been from other motives than those of fear or favor . The main purpose has been to present to the public a fair and unbiassed picture of the mind and heart of an // individual , so far as this may be supposed to command any interest . To do this , it is as necesssary to retain the favorable or unfavorable opinions expressed of men , including himself , as those of things or of events . No true , honestly written Diary can be regarded as in itself a correct general history . It is good always as biography , often as furnishing materials for history , and that just in proportion as it appears on its face never to have been written or prepared for publication . But if this be true , it is obviously perverting its character to attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only such passages as show a single side . Rather than this , it were wise not to publish at all . to control rather than to develop his judgment . In the present instance at least , the fact may be relied on , that no experiment of the kind has been tried . " Pref. viii . We believe this statement to be exactly true , for there are some opinions expressed in the Diary , respecting various persons , which seem severe , if not harsh ; and there are dissections of the writer 's own character and motives , which any but a magnanimous man would have refrained from writing . Here let us fix a few dates . Mr. Adams was born in 1735 . He took his degree at Harvard , at the commencement in 1755 , when in his twentieth year . The French and Indian war was on the eve of breaking out , and public events were taking the shape to arrest the attention of enterprising minds . And of all th' young men in America , there was not one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read the horoscope of the future , than the author of this Diary . We begin by giving the first entry in the Journal or Diary , with the accompanying note , because the event alluded to seems to have originated the plan of a Diary . " 1 ' 755 . November 18 . We had a very severe shock of an earthquake . It continued near fourminutes . I then was at my father 's in Braintree , and awoke out of my sleep in the midst of it . The house seemed to rock and reel and crack , as if it would fall in ruins about us . Chimneys were shattered by it within one mile of my father 's house . " The note has no connection with the above entry , but that of time , and shows that it was written after his arrival in Worcester . It is as follows : " in the public exercises at Commencement , i was somewhat remarked as a respondent , and Mr. Maccarty , of Worcester , who was empowered by the selectmen of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , engaged me to undertake it . About three ' weeks after Commencement in 1755 , when I was not yet twenty // years of age , a horse was sent me from Worcester , and a man to attend me . We made the journey , about sixty miles , in one day , and I entered on my office . " That was good traveling , for those days ; but ninety-seven years have made a great difference . On that route , now , instead of two horsemen , and an occasional team , hundreds are passing , several times a day , in the space of two hours , from point to point . Worcester was now his home for about three years . Would the citizens of that populous and thriving city , recognize their present home , from the following description of it , in 1756 , when it contained not more than fifteen hundred inhabitants ? " I take great pleasure in viewing and examining the magnificent prospects of Nature that lie before us in this town . If I cast my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsightly appearance of naked woods , and leafless forests . In another place , a chain of broken and irregular mountains throws my mind into a pleasing kind of astonishment . But if I turn myself round , I perceive a wide , extensive tract before me made up of woods and meadows , wandering streams and barren plains , covered in various places by herds of grazing cattle and terminated by the distant view of the town . " p. 4 . Such was the appearance of Worcester , and its influence on his mind ; what was the society in which he found himself ? Mr. Maccarty , who engaged him as the teacher of the Latin School , was the minister of the town , and had been chosen in preference to Dr. Mayhew , on account of the latitudinarian tendencies of the theology of the latter . Mr. Adams enjoyed the minister 's society to some extent , and generally attended his meeting on the Sabbath , though an occasional entry shows that he sometimes remained at home , to read on religious or political topics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Staid at home reading the Independent Whig . " Then follows a remark which one need not be surprised to meet , from such a " good hater " of ecclesiastical pride and domination : " Very often shepherds that are hired to take care of their masters* sheep go about their own concerns and leave the flock to the care of their dog . So bishops , who are appointed to oversee the flock of Christ , take the fees themselves but leave the drudgery to their dogs , that is , curates and understrappers . " Among the leading families of the place , were the Chandlers , the Putnams , the Willards , and the Gardiners . The Willards of Lancaster , spent much time there , in visiting . These seem to have been very intelligent and agreeable people ; and they had great influence in the county , though Ruggles of Hardwick was a much more powerful man than any of them , and more prominent in colonial politics . It is curious and instructive to note the changes in the position of families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the majority of // their class , took th' side of the English government in the Revolution , and lost their position . At present , there are many respectable people bearing these several names ,  --  whether belonging to the same families , is beyond our knowledge-but not one of them has held a conspicuous place in the county for many years . But though the time came when our author was obliged to separate from these friends , and to hold them as the enemies of his country , yet for the present he derived both pleasure and improvement in their cultivated society . And yet the profit was qualified by a serious drawback . Sceptical and even infidel sentiments had been introduced , and were maintained by some prominent men ; while the germs of the Unitarian defection were beginning to appear . We find this on the first page of the Diary . " For three months I boarded with one Greene , at the expense of the town , and by the arrangement of the select-men . Here I found Morgan 's Moral Philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that town , and that the principles of Deism has made considerable progress among persons in that and other towns in the county . " The following extract bears on the same point : " Drank tea and spent the evening at Mr. Putnam 's , in conversation respecting Christianity . He is of opinion that the apostles were a company of enthusiasts . He says that we have only their word to prove that they spoke with different tongues , raised the dead , and healed the sick , * ( Note to the above . ) " At break . fast , dinner , and tea , Mr. Putnam was commonly disputing with me upon some question of religion . He had been intimate with one Peasley Collins , the son of a Quaker in Boston , who had been to Europe , and came back a disbeliever of everything ; fully satisfied that religion was a cheat , a cunning invention of priests and politicians ; that there would be no future state , any more than there is at present any moral government . Putnam could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would argue to the extent of his learning and ingenuity to destroy or invalidate the evidences of a future state , and the principles of natural and revealed religion , yet I could plainly perceive that he could not convince himself that death was an eternal sleep . " p. 13 . This gentleman was a leading lawyer , with whom young Adams boarded while pursuing his legal studies . His conduct should be noted by the " laudatores acti temporis , " because , as we believe , what was going on in his office , and at his table , was not uncommon , in that day , in other parts of the colony ,  - -  we might have said , the colonies . Yet we think it would be rare , at the present time , to find a lawyer of any distinction , industriously advocating the rankest infidelity in the presence of his pupils and his family . But though he did not make an atheist , nor even a simple deist , of his student , it is possible , that his influence was deadening to religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or earlier , the mind of Mr. Adams had , // began to stumble at , if not to reject , some of the peculiar doctrines of the fathers of New England . The following selections touch on the points referred to . " Suppose a nation in some distant region should take the Bible for their only law-hook , and every member should regulate his conduct by the precepts there exhibited ! Every member would be obliged , in conscience , to temperance and frugality and industry ; to justice and kindness and charity towards his fellow men ; and to piety , love , and reverence , towards Almighty God . In this commonwealth , no man would impair his health by gluttony , drunkness , or lust ; no man would sacrifice his most precious time to cards or any other trifling and mean amusement ; no man would steal , or lie , or in any way defraud his neighbor , but would live in peace and good will with all men ; no man would blaspheme his Maker or profane his worship ; hut a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion would reign in all hearts . What a Utopia ; what a Paradise would this region be 1 " pp. 6-7 . Again : " The great and Almighty author of nature , who at first established those rules which regulate the world , can as easily suspend those laws whenever his providence sees sufficient reason for such suspension . This can be no objection , then , to the mirmles of Jesus Christ . " pp. 7-8 . Once more : " Astronomers tell us with good reason , that not only all the planets and satellites in our solar system , but all , the unnumbered worlds that revolve round the fixed stars are inhabited , as well as this globe of earth . If this is the case , all mankind are no more in comparison of the whole rational creation of God , than a point to the orbit of Saturn . Perhaps all these different ranks of rational beings have in a greater or less degree committed moral wickedness . If so , I ask a Calvinist whether he will subscribe to this alternative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these different species and suffer the penalties of their crimes in their stead , or else all these beings must be consigned to everlasting perdition ? ' " pp. 13-14 . The next day he thought better of the matter , and added : " The reflection that I penned yesterday appears upon the revision to be weak enough . For first , we know not that the inhabitants of other globes have sinned . Nothing can be argued in this manner till it is proved at least probable that all these species of rational beings have revolted from their rightful Sovereign . " p. 14 . While engaged in teaching , he devoted some of his spare time to reading medical works , and for a while , thought of being a physician . His principal reading , however , had reference to the ministerial profession , and he became quite familiar with the writings of several celebrated divines. * In the following passages , we have his own account of his motives in entering upon the study of the law . We do not doubt that the reason here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , that a native impulse , of which he might at that time have been unconscious , was irresistibly impelling him forward to mingle in scenes where the welfare of nations was to be discussed and decided . But let us hear him , on Sunday , August 22 , 1756. // " Yesterday I completed a contract with Mr. Putnam to study law , under his inspection , for two years . . . . Yecessity drove me to this determination , but my inclination , I think , was to preach ; however , that would not do . But I set out with firm resolutions , I think , never to commit any meanness or injustice in the practice of law . The study and practice of law , I am sure , does not dissolve the obligations of morality or of religion ; and , although the reason of my quitting divinity was my opinion concerning some disputed points , I hope I shall not give reason of offence , to any in that profession , by imprudent warmth . " pp. 30-31 . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the forming time of Mr. Adams ' character , we are tempted to dwell a little longer , and tell our readers what hooks he was familiar with , and give them an idea of the tone of his mind . Of authors , besides Morgan , and Thomas Gordon , author of the Independent Whig , already mentioned , we find reference to the following : Cheyne , Sydenhan , and Van Swieten , on medical subjects ; Tillotson , Duncan Forbes , Butler , and Bentley , in divinity ; and Milton , Addison , Bollingbroke , and Voltaire , in poetry , criticism , and history . He was in the habit of writing out whole sermons from Tillotson , and long passages from other standard authors , for the purpose of forming his style . It was drudgery , no doubt , but the time devoted to it was well spent . The perspicuity and vigor of his own style were partly owing to his native character ; but it can not be doubted that these two admirable qualities were strengthened by diligent study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great Puritan poet . " Reading Milton . That man 's soul , it seems to me , was distended as wide as creation . His power over the human mind was absolute and unlimited . His genius was great beyond conception , and his learning without bounds . I can only gaze at him with astonishment , without comprehending the vast compass of his capacity . " In the extracts which follow , we may see something of the natural tone of his mind , and of his efforts at self-improvement ; ( A*t. 20 . ) " All my time seems to roll away unnoticed . I long to study sometimes , but have no opportunity . I long to be a master of Greek and Latin . I long to prosecute the mathematical and philosophical sciences . I lon , , to know a little of ethics and moral *hiiosophy . But I have no books , no time , no friends , I must therefore be contented to live and die an ignorant , obscure fellow . " . . . " May I blush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will rouse up my mind and fix my attention ; I will stand collected within myself , and think upon what I read and what I see ; I will strive , with all my soul , to be something more than persons who have had less advantages than myself . " pp. 13-23 . The following is none too long : " Good sense is generally attended with a very lively sense and delight in applause ; the love of fame in such men is generally much stronger than in other people , and this passion , it must be confessed , is apt to betray men into impertinent exertions of their talents , sometimes into censorious remarks upon others , often into // little meannesses to sound the opinions of others , and , oftenest of all , into a childish affectation of wit and gayety . I must own myself to have been , to a very heinious degree , guilty in this respect ; when in company with persons much superior to myself in years and place , I have talked to show my learning ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , no doubt , be called self-conceit ; I have made ill-natured remarks upon the intellectuals , manners , practice , &amp;c. , of other people ; I have foolishly aimed at wit and spirit , at making a shining figure in gay company ; but instead of shining brighter , I only clouded the few rays that before rendered me visible . Such has been my unhappy fate . I now resolve , for the future , never to say an ill-natured thing concerning ministers or the ministerial profession ; never to say an envious thing concerning governors , judges , ministers , clerks , sheriffs , lawyers , or any other honorable or lucrative offices or officers ; never to affect wit upon laced waistcoats , or large estates or their possessors ; never to show my own importance or superiority by remarking the foibles , vices , or inferiority of others . But I now resolve , as far as lies in me , to take notice chiefly of the amiable qualities of other people ; to put the most favorable construction upon the weaknesses , bigotry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor more for an inoffensive and amiable , than for a shining and invidious character . " pp. 25-26 . We hear so much said about the good morals of former generations , that the close student of our social life during the last century , is often surprised at the amount of low vice which abounded . The endeavor to arrest this , in many of the best families of Northampton , was the main cause of President Edwards ' dismissal . Subsequent to that time , the evil was aggravated throughout New England , through the French and Revolutionary wars , and met with no noticable check until about the year 1790 , when a new era commenced in the history of the church . From that date to this , the tone of morals has been raised , and vital religion has a more pervading influence in society . These remarks were suggested by the two following passages , which give us one phase of life , a hundred years since , and show that Mr. Adams avoided the follies and vices that were prevalent . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he proceeds : " In short , my little school , like the great world , is made up of kings , politicians , divines , L. D. 's , fops , buffoons , fiddlers , sycophants , fools , coxcombs , chimney sweepers , and every other character drawn in history , or seen in the world . Is it not , then , the highest pleasure , my friend , to preside in this little world , to bestow the proper am plause upon virtuous and generous actions , to blame and punish every vicious and contracted trick , to wear out of the tender mind everything that is mean and little , and fire the new born soul with a noble ardor and emulation ? The world affords no greater pleasure . Let others waste their bloom of life at the card or billiard table among rakes and fools , and when their minds are sufficiently fretted with losses , and inflamed by wine , ramble through the streets assaulting innocent people , breaking windows , or debauching young girls . I envy not their exalted happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my pupils will turn out in his future life a hero , and which a rake , which a philosopher , and which a parasite , than change breasts with them , though possessed of twenty laced waistcoats and a thousand pounds a year . Methinks I hear you say , This is odd talk for John Adams I 1711 tell you , then , the occasion of it . About four months since , a poor girl in this neighborhood , walking by the meeting-house upon some occasion in the evening , met a fine gentleman with laced hat and waistcoat , and a sword , who solicited her // 231 to turn aside with him into the horse stable . The girl relucted a little , upon which he gave her three guineas , and wished he might be damned if he did not have her in three months , " ( and so on. ) pp. 9-10 . It is the same old story of " what was yesterday and will be to-morrow . " The poor girl became the mother of a fatherless child , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other passage we must pass over more than a hundred pages ,  --  every one of which is filled with matter of interest ,  --  and about eight years of time . There is a chasm in the Diary which is here filled with an extract from the Autobiography , in which mention is made of his marriage : " 1764 . Here it may be proper to recollect something which makes an article of great importance in the life of every man . I was of an amorous disposition , and , very early , from ten or eleven years of age , was very fond of the society of females . I had my favorites among the young women , and spent many of my evenings in their company ; and this disposition , although controlled for seven years after my entrance into college , returned and engaged me too much till I was married . " I shall draw no characters , nor give any enumeration of my youthful flames . It would be considered as no compliment to the dead or the living . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , and always maintained their character through life . No virgin or matron ever had cause to blush at the sight of me , or to regret her acquaintance with me . No father , brother , son , or friend , ever had cause of grief or resentment , for any intercourse between me and any daughter , sister , mother , or any other relation of the female sex . These reflections , to me consolatory beyond all expression , I am able to make with truth and sincerity ; and I presume I am indebted for this blessing to my education . This has been rendered the more precious to me , as I have seen enough of the effects of a different practice . corroding reflections through life are the never-failing consequences of illicit amours in old as well as in new countries . The happiness of life depends more upon innocence in this respect , than upon all the philosophy of Epicurus or of Zeno without it . " I passed the summer of P764 in attending courts and pursuing my studies , with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently making additions , until the fall , when , on the 26th of October , I was married to Miss Smith , second daughter of the Rev. William Smith , minister of Weymouth , grand-daughter of the Honorable John Quincy of Braintree , a connection which has been the source of ' all my felicity , although a sense of duty , which forced me away from her and my children for so many years , produced all the grief of my heart , and all that I esteem real afflictions in life . " p. 145 . We are not bound , by the plan of this article , to give a connected view of the author 's career , but will mention that he was admitted to the bar , in Suffolk county , in November , 1758 ; after which he resided in that part of Braintree which is now Quincy , and had a continually increasing practice until he was married , five years later . A passage or two , relating to his admission to the bar , will be read with interest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bar in Boston , and the preceptor of Pratt , Otis , Thacher , Cushing , and many others . " Rode to Boston ; arrived about half after ten ; went into the court house and sat down by Mr. Paine , Robert Treat , at the lawyers ' table . I felt shy , under // awe and concern ; for Mr. Gridley , Mr. Pratt , Mr. Otis , Mr. Kent , and Mr. Thacher , were all present , and looked sour . I had no acquaintance with anybody but Paine and Quincy , and they took but little notice . " However , I attended court steadily all day , and at night went to consort with Samuel Quincy and Dr. Gardiner . There I saw the most spacious and elegant room , the gayest company of gentlemen , and the finest row of ladies that ever I saw* but the weather was so dull , and I so disordered , that I could not make one half the observations that I wanted to make . " p. 45 . The next day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a liking to him , gave him good advice , undertook to be his patron before the court , and subsequently admitted him to his society . A few days after , the following scene occurred , which our legal readers can compare with the manner of proceeding in like cases , at the present day . " Went to town ; went to Mr. Gridley 's office , but he had not returned to town from Brookline . Went again ; not returned ; attended court till after twelve , and began to grow uneasy , expecting that Quincy would be sworn , and I have no patron , when Mr. Gridley made his appearance , and on sight of me whispered to Mr. Pratt , Dana , Kent , Thacher , &amp;c. about me . Mr. Pratt said , nobody knew me ; ' yes , * says Gridley , I have tried him , he is a very sensible fellow . ' At last , he rose up , and bowed to his right hand , and said , Mr. Quincy ' - when Quincy rose up ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked out . May it please your honors , I have two young gentlemen , Mr. Quincy and Mr. Adams , to present for the oath of an attorney . Of Mr. Quincy , it is sufficient for me to say he has lived three years with Mr. Pratt ; of Mr. Adams , as he is unknown to your honors , it is necessary to say that he has lived between two and three years with Mr. Putnam of Worcester , has a good character from him and all who know him , and that he was with me the other day several hours , and I take it , he is qualified to study the law by his scholarship , and that he has made a very considerable , a very great proficiency in the principles of the law , and therefore , that the client 's interest may be safely intrusted in his hands . I therefore recommend him , with the consent of the bar , to your honors for the oath . ' Then Mr. Pratt said two or three words , and the clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gridley took me by the hand , wished me much joy , and recommended me to the bar* I shook hands with the bar , and received their congratulations , and invited them over to Stone 's to drink some punch , where the most of us resorted , and had a very cheerful chat . " p. 49-50 . We are drawing near to stirring times , and our hero will soon be on a wider theatre of action . Writs of assistance , the Stamp Act , the Boston Massacre , and the Revolution , are all looming in the distance , and events are preparing Mr. Adams to be the great leader in the coming struggle . Before entering upon those scenes , however , let us cull a few anecdotes of prominent men in ante-revolutionary times . One of the clerical wits of those days was Henry Flynt , " a tutor in Harvard University upwards of fifty-five years , and about sixty years a fellow of the corporation , familiarly called Father Flynt . He lived a bachelor , and was noted for his humor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a class , that has not yet entirely passed away . Indeed , there is no class of men who have been more misunderstood than the puritan clergy of New England ; for while it is common for our popular // 1853.1 John Adams ' Diary and Autobiography . writers , like Paulding , Whittier , Hawthorne , and others , to represent them as dry specimens of morose gravity , and some bigotry , they were really pleasant , companionable men , grave generally , it is true , and learned , but easily unbending , and delighting in a quiet joke . Mr. Webster 's description of his father , would apply to many of them . " He had in him what I recollect to have been the character of the old Puritans . He was deeply religious , but not sour-on the contrary , goodhumored , facetious-showing even in his age , with a contagious laugh , teeth , all as white as alabaster-gentle , soft , playfuland yet having a heart in him that he seemed to have borrowed from a lion . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good humor , and smiles , composed his most usual aspect . " But let us hear from the venerable tutor , as follows : " Father Flynt has been very gay and sprightly this sickness . Colonel Quincy went to see him a Fast day , and was or appeared to be , as he was about taking leave of the old gentleman , very much affected ; the tears flowed very fast . I hope sir , ' says he , in a voice of grief , you will excuse my passions . ' Ay , prithee , ' says the old man , I do n't care much for you nor your passions neither . ' Morris said to him , you are going , sir , to Abraham 's bosom ; but I do n't know but I shall reach there first . ' Ay , if you are going there I do n't want to go . ' In a company of gentlemen , where Father Flynt was present , Mr. Whitefield said , . ' It is my opinion that Dr. Tillotson is now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is my opinion that you will not meet him there ! ' " Mathew Byles , who took the side of the mother country , was of the same kidney . The people of Boston were greatly afflicted by the grievances brought upon them by the oppressive measures of the crown and parliament . They were naturally restive , and spirited in their opposition . In consequence , more troops were sent to keep the people in awe . Alluding to the red coats who swarmed the streets , Mr. Byles remarked , " I perceive the people have got their grievances red-dressed . " We will now turn to the lawyers and politicians : " 1765 . Dec. 23 . Monday . Went to Boston . After dinner rambled after Messrs . Gridley and Otis , but could find neither . went into Mr. Dudley 's , Mr. Dana 's , Mr. Otis 's office , and then to Mr. Samuel Adams 's , and went with him to the Monday night club . There I found Otis , Cushing , Wells , Pemberton , Gray , Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the evening very agreeably indeed . Politicians all at this club . We had many curious anecdotes about governors , counsellors , representatives , demagogues , merchants , &amp;c . " The behavior of these gentlemen is very familiar and friendly to each other , and very polite and complaisant to strangers . Gray , Treasurer of the Province has a very tender mind , is extremely timid . He says , when he meets a man of the other side , he talks against him ; when he axe ts a man of our side , he opposes // him ; - so that he fears he shall be thought against everybody , and so everybody will be against him . But he hopes to prepare the way for his escape , at next May , from an employment that neither his abilities , nor circumstances , nor turn of mind , are fit for . " Cushing Thomas , Speaker of the House , and subsequently a member of the first Congress at Philadelphia is steady , and constant , and busy in the interest of liberty and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procuring intelligence . " Adams is zealous , ardent , and keen in the cause , is always for softness , and delicacy , and prudence , where they will do , but is staunch and stiff and strict and rigid and inflexible in the cause . " pp. 162-3 . The next character is James Otis , who reminds us of the first William Pitt , whom he much resembled in eloquence , and in a bold , fiery , impulsive nature , and in the fact that his latter days were clouded by the same dread eclipse of reason , only more clearly declared . The one shone out brightly again , in his last effort in the house of Lords , just before he expired , while the other was struck down by a bolt from heaven , emblematic of the brilliancy and the scathing force of the erratic flashes of his mind . " Otis is fiery and feverous ; his imagination flames , his passions blaze ; he is liable to great inequalities of temper ; sometimes in despondency , sometimes in a rage . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly transported him , have made him enemies , whose malicious watch over him occasion more caution , and more cunning , and more inexplicable passages in his conduct than formerly ; and , perhaps , views at the chair or the board , or possibly more expanded views beyond the Atlantic , may mingle now with his patriotism . " The Il Penseroso , however , is discernible on the faces of all four . " Adams , I believe , has the most thorough understanding of liberty and her resources in the character and temper of the people , though not in the law and constitution as well as the most habitual , radical love of it , of any of them , as well as the most correct , genteel , and artful pen . He is a man of refined policy , steadfast integrity , exquisite humanity , genteel erudition , obliging , engaging manners , real as well as professed piety , and a universal good character , unless it should be admitted that he is too attentive to the public , and not enough so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are lifelike sketches , by a fellow actor in a great drama , and though the youngest , the most distinguished of them all . The patriotism of Otis proved true as steel ; Cushing and Samuel Adams were afterwards associated with our author , in the counsels of the Congress of the Revolution ; while Gray , like the great majority of the leading lawyers , public men , and merchants , and some of the clergy , turned tory ; or , in the despicable euphemism which is coming into vogue in some quarters , their loyalty got the mastery of their patriotism . While on this subject , it is pertinent to refer to the part taken by the clergy , in relation to public events . A few incidents taken from the Diary , will throw light upon this topic . On the 28th of December , 1765 , we find the following entry : // " Went to Weymouth with my wife ; dined at Father Smith 's ; heard much of the uneasiness among the people of Hingham , at a sermon preached by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a text in James : Out of the same mouth pro ceedeth blessing and cursing . ' In which he said that the ancient weapons of the church were prayers and tears , not clubs ; and inculcated submission to authority in pretty strong expressions . His people said that Mr. Gay would do very well for a distrihuter and they believed he had the stamps in his house , and even threatened , &amp;c . This uneasiness , it seems , was inflamed by a sermon preached there the Sunday after , by Mr. Smith , which they admired very much , and talk of printing , as the best sermon they ever heard him preach . This sermon of Mr. Smith 's was from- ' Render therefore unto CEesar the things that are C*esar 's , and unto God the things that are God 's . ' The tenor of it was to recommend honor , reward , and obedience , to good rulers , and a spirited opposition to bad ones , interspersed with a good deal of animated declamation upon liberty and the times . " pp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common people throughout the colony , sympathized with the popular party , which caused him some trouble . " But , " says the editor , in a note , " he was not averse to gratifying his people , occasionally , by an exchange with his neighbor of Weymouth , the Rev. William Smith , father-in-law of Mr. Adams , who generally seized the opportunity , as in the present instance , of inculcating more acceptable doctrines . " There was a club , consisting of two colonels , two captains , and others , who called on the minister of llingham , every Sunday evening , and talked each other into the notion of passive obedience , as the best way to procure redress . Parson Gay was a Congregationalist , one of the few who did not wholly sympathize with the patriots . We next find mention of certain ministers of the Episcopal Church , who were styled " clergy , " in distinction from dissenting ministers , according to the usage in England . We infer from the following , that parson Wibird ,  - -  whose ecclesiastical affinities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date is one day later than the last . " Heard Parson Wibird ; - Hear , 0 heavens , and give ear , 0 earth I I have nourished and brought up children , and they have rebelled against me ! ' I began to suspect a Tory sermon , on the times , but the preacher confined himself to spirituals . But , I expect , if the Tories should become the strongest , we shall hear many sermons against the ingratitude , injustice , disloyalty , treason , rebellion , impiety , and ill-policy of refusing obedience to the Stamp Act . The church that is , the Episcopal clergy , to be sure , will be very eloquent . The church people are , many of them , favorers of the Stamp Act at present . Major Miller , forsooth , is very fearful that they will be stomackful at home , and angry and resentful . Mr. Veasey insists upon it , that we ought to pay our proportion of the public burdens . Mr. Cleverly is fully convinced that they , that is the Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is wrong to go on with business ; we had better stop , and wait till Spring , till we hear from home . ' - . - He says things go on here exactly as they did in the reign of King Charles I. , that blessed saint and martyr ! ' " pp. 168-9 . " Elter is another of the poisonous talkers , but not equally so Cleverly and Veasey are slaves in principle ; they are devout , religious slaves , and a reli$us bigot is the worst of men . Cleverly converses of late at Mr. Lloyd 's , with some of the seekers of appointments from the Crown-some of the dozen , in the town of // Boston , who ought , as Hancock says , to be beheaded ; or with some of those who converse with the Governor , who ought , as Tom Boylston says , to be sent home with all the other Governors on the continent , with chains about their necks . " p. 169 . On the other hand , the Congregational ministers , almost unanimously took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament . it is often said , that the people of the colonies did not contemplate a separation from the mother country , until the Revolutionary war had gone so far that reconciliation was impossible . This is partly true , for the mass of men do not always foresee what is before them ; but it is equally true ,  --  and will be so found , by those who look into original sources of information-that the ministers had begun to think of independence , and that such spirits as John Adams , were full of the instinct of it , long before the war broke out . It was foreseen , that an attempt would soon be made to introduce the English hierarchy , and bring in ecclesiastical despotism in the church , pan passu , with despotic rule in the state . And inasmuch as the fundamental principles of Congregationalism are ministerial parity , and the independence of the churches , and the rule of the brotherhood , by an equal vote , the ministers were nearly all patriots , Whigs , or friends of liberty . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was prepared for the position , by his talents , his legal and political knowledge , and his early and ardent love of the cause . The idea of independence and national greatness was familiar to his mind , as early as 1755 , when he was still under age , as may be seen by reading that remarkable letter which he addressed to his cousin Nathan Webb , from Worcester . A native , ingrained love of independence and of country kept him from all connection with the crown , and all entanglements with the colonial government , while many of his seniors and his coevals became the parasites and the tools of power in the endeavor to enslave their native land . With a sigh , we leave many a passage which had been marked for insertion , and select this brief entry , as a sign of the times . It was written in 1766 , ten years before the Declaration of Independence , which it prophesied . " May 4 . Sunday . Retiring from meeting this morning , I saw for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triangle made by the three roads , by the house of Mr. James Bracket . The tree is well set , well guarded , and has on it an inscription , Tie Tree of Liberty , and cursed is he who cuts this tree ! ' Q. What will be the consequence of this thought ? I never heard a hint of it till I saw it , but 1 hear that some persons grumble , and threaten to girdle it . " p. 194. // Mr. Adams was now a thriving man , with a growing business , and a rising reputation . We find him busy on his farm , and in riding a very extensive circuit , from the southern extremity of Massachusetts to Maine . The two following extracts will show us how he was employed , and what his thoughts were in JEt . 3 1-33 . " Friday . November 7 , 1766 . Went up to my common pasture to give directions about trimming the trees , that is , lopping and trimming the walnuts and oaks , and felling the pines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darken the whole scene in some places . These I fell without mercy , to open the prospect and let in the sun and air , that the other wood may grow the faster , and that the grass may get in for feed . I prune all the trees ; I leave buttonwoods , elms , maples , oaks , walnuts , savins , hemlocks , and all . The pines that grow in that pasture are , that is , the white pines are , very knotty , crooked , unthrifty things . I am desirous of clearing out the rocky gutter , that is , of clearing away the bushes and pruning all the trees , that we may see clearly the course of the water there , and judge whether it is worth while to dig up the rocks and make a ditch for the water ; and for another reason , too , namely , to let in the sun and air , because that rocky gutter produces a great deal of feed , which I should be glad to sweeten . " p. 201 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have to us , who in our boyhood , went a long pilgrimage , on blistered feet , to see the place which has been made a shrine by the residence of two of the greatest names in our history , and which was then the retreat where the latter was accustomed to gain strength to combat the " wild beasts " at Washington , in the days of the " gag law . " But to proceed with the other quotation . 1768 . January 30 . Saturday night . To what object are my views directed ? What is the end and purpose of my studies , journeys , labors of all kinds , of body and mind , of tongue and pen ? " Am I grasping at money or seeking for power ? Am I planning the illustration of my family or the welfare of my country ? These are great questions . In truth , I am tossed about so much from post to pillar , that I have not leisure and tranquil . lity enough to consider distinctly my own views , objects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting a library ; and I find that a great deal of thought and care , as wellas money , are necessary to assemble an ample and well chosen assortment of books . " But when this is done , it is only a means , an instrument . Whenever I shall have completed my library , my end will not be answered . Fame , fortune , power , say some , are the ends intended by s* library . The service of God , country , clients , fellowmen , say others . Which of these lie nearest my heart ? Self love but serves the virtuous mind to wake , As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake ; The centre moved , a circle straight succeeds , Another still , and still another spreads ; Friend , parent , neighbor , first it will embrace , His country next , and next all human race . // " I am certain , however , that the course I pursue , will neither lead me to fame , fortune , power , nor to the service of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading , or reflection , or business , can be pursued by a man who is now at Pownalborough , then at Martha 's Vineyard , then at Concord , now at Salem , then at Cambridge , and afterwards at Worcester ? Now at Sessions , then at Pleas , now in Admiralty , now at Superior Court , then in the gallery of the House ? What a dissipation must this be ? Is it possible to pursue a regular train of thinking in this desultory life ? By no means . It is a life of here and everywhere , ' to use the expression that is applied to Othello by Desdemona 's father , Here , and there , and everywhere  --  a rambling , roving , vagrant , vagabond life ; a wandering life . At Mein 's book-store , at Bowes 's shop , at Dana 's office , at Fitch 's , Otis 's office , and the clerk 's office , in the court chamber , in the gallery , at my own fire , I am thinking on the same plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by Governor Bernard , to induce Mr. Adams to accept office , Mr. Jonathan Sewall , who was then Attorney General , and a personal friend , was the negotiator from the Governor , and the office which was pressed upon him with much importunity , was that of " Advocate-General in the Court of Admiralty . " His reply was prompt . " That he was sensible of the honor done him by the Governor ; but must be excused from accepting his offer . " To the solicitations of his friend , he returned the same answer , although he was assured that there was no intention of influencing his opinions , by the office . " He had offered it to me merely because he believed I was the best qualified for it , and because he relied on my integrity . I replied , This was going as far in the generosity and liberality of his sentiments as the Governor could go , or as I could desire , if I could accept the office , but that 1 knew it would lay me under restraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore I could not in honor or conscience accept it . " From this time , it was probably understood by the royal party , that Mr. Adams was inflexible in his adherence to the cause of the people .. For an amusing passage which serves to display some of the traits of character of the celebrated Jeremiah Gridley and two of his relatives , the reader is referred to pp. 221-23 . We have interesting notices of the trial of the four sailors who were charged with the crime of killing Lieutenant Panton and Captain Preston , who commanded a portion of the troops by whom blood was shed in State then King 's street , in a collision between an irregular mass of people and the troops ; and though we have no room for details , we must give a paragraph or two referring to the latter case . This transaction was significant of the temper of the times , and while Mr. Adams knew that the counsel of Captain Preston must expect severe reproach , he also felt sure that if his soldiers slew the citizens in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These were his thoughts in the night after the massacre , and they prepared him for the interview which is here recorded . // " The next morning , Ithink it was , sitting in my office , near the steps of the townhouse stairs , Mr. Forrest came in , who was then called the Irish Infant . I had some acquaintance with him . With tears streaming from his eyes , he said , I am come with a very solemn message from a very unfortunate man , Captain Preston , in prison . He wishes for counsel , and can get none . I have waited on Mr. Quincy , who says be will engage , if you will give him your assistance ; without it , he positively will not . Even Mr. Auchmuty declines , unless you will engage . ' I had no hesitation in answering , that counsel ought to he the very last thing that an accused person should want in a free country ; that the bar ought , in my opinion , to be independent and impartial , at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose lives were at stake ought to have the counsel they preferred . But he must be sensible this would he as important a cause as was ever tried in any court or country of the world ; and that every lawyer must hold himself responsible not only to his country , but to the highest and most infallible of all tribunals , for the part he should act . He must , therefore , expect from me no art or address , no sophistry , or prevarication , in such a cause , nor anything more than fact , evidence and law would justify . Captain Preston , ' he said , requested and desired no more ; and that he had such an opinion from all he had heard from all parties of me , that he could cheerfully trust his life with me upon those principles . ' And , ' said Forrest , as God Almighty is my judge , I believe him an innocentman . ' I replied , that must be ascertained by his trial , and if he thinks he can not have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation , he shall have it 1 ' " pp. 230-1 . His retaining fee was a single guinea ; and all he ever received for " fourteen or fifteen days labor in the most exhausting and fatiguing causes , " he ever tried-that of Captain Preston , and afterwards , of the soldiers ,  --  was nineteen guineas , although it was insinuated that he was " tempted by great fees and enormous sums of money . " This affair raised a great clamor against him , which the party of the government secretly fomented ; yet while the case was pending , he was chosen , for the first time , to represent the town of Boston , in the General Court . He was chosen , because the people knew that he was the man for the crisis that was coming on ; and he accepted the office , because he had the ability and the spirit to fill his allotted place , although he foresaw the sacrifices he would be obliged to make , and could not foreknow the success which would reward the struggle for independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one of the greatest and purest of patriots and statesmen . In the Autobiography , he says : " I had never been at a Boston town meeting , and was not at this , until messeagers were sent to me to inform me that I was chosen . I went down to Fanueil Hall , and in a few words expressive of my sense of the difficulty and danger of the times , of the importance of the trust , and of my own insufficiency to fulfil the expectations of the people , I accepted the choice . Many congratulations were offered , which I received civilly , but they gave no joy to me . I considered the step as a devotion of my family to ruin , and myself to death ; for I could scarce perceive a possibility that I should ever go through the thorns and leap all the precipices before me and escape with my life . " At this time I had more business at the bar than any man in th' Province . My health was feeble . I was throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and I had devoted myself to endless labor and anxiety , if not // to infamy and to death , and that for nothing , except what indeed was and ought to be all in all , a sense of duty . In the evening , I expressed to Mrs. Adams all my apprehensions . That excellent lady , who has always encouraged me , burst into a flood of tears , but said she was very sensible of all the danger to her and to our children , as well as to me , but she thought I had done as I ought ; she was very willing to share in all that was to come , and to place her trust in Providence . " p. 232 . And she bore her part bravely , like a Roman matron ; or rather , like a Christian woman of New England . We can think of no woman , in our history , who was more respected in. her lifetime , or who is likely to he held in higher esteem by posterity . But it is proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , as to the relative ability of Mrs. Adams and her husband . Mr. Jefferson , in his refined method of detraction , was accustomed to s.ay that she was superior to him . In one respect , she probably was more than his equal . She had that consummate prudence , that marvelous propriety of conduct , in every situation and exigency of life , which was the chief characteristic of Washington . Yet it is evident on every page of Mr. Adams ' life , that he was the originator of all the plans and measures , in the advocacy of which he became the most effective , if not the most eloquent orator of the Revolution . His was an original , organizing , constructive mind ; at the same time , he had great executive power , and tireless energy . There was this difference between his originality and that of his successful rival ; his opinions were sound , and his plans prudent , while the opinions of Mr. Jefferson were apt to be crotchety , and his methods fanciful . A few facts may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traits of Mr. Adams ' mind . By his advice , the Boston patriots were often able to checkmate the colonial government ; his broaching the bold idea of impeaching the judges led to the suspension of the courts till the Revolution broke out , when they were organized on a new basis ; it was his move which secured the appointment of Washington as Commander-in-chief ; he was the real father of the Declaration of Independence ; the army owed its efficient organization to him , quite as much as to any man in Congress ; his advice respecting foreign affairs generally prevailed ; his genius is stamped on our national and state constitutions , and he was the founder of the American Navy . For proof of these facts , the reader is referred , not merely to the Life and Diary of Mr. Adams , but to the general history of the country . There was another trait of character , worthy of distinct notice , which is indispensable to him who undertakes to manage the cause of the people against the power and the wiles of // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bounds of law , and under the shelter of constitutional rights . This was exhibited at the time when Governor Hutchinson , " in an elaborate speech to both Houses , endeavored to convince them , their constituents , and the world , that Parliament was our sovereign legislature , and had a right to make laws for us in all cases whatsoever , to lay taxes on all things external and internal , on land as well as on trade . " The House appointed a committee to prepare a reply , who drafted an answer , " prettily written . " It was probably the joint work of Samuel Adams and Dr. Warren . The former submitted it to the judgment of John Adams , under whose hand it became almost a new document . He found it full of the spirit of liberty , and asserting abstract principles , with great force ; but it made very little reference to the constitutional rights of the colonists . In the language of Mr. Adams , who speaks of the report as " neatly and elegantly composed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equality , and fraternity , which have since made such a figure in the world ; principles which are founded in nature , and eternal , unchangeable truth , but which must be well understood and cautiously applied . It is not safe , at all times , and in every case , to apply the ratio ultima rerum ,  - -  resort to club law and the force of arms . There was no answer nor attempt to answer the Governor 's legal and constitutional arguments , such as they were . " He therefore set himself down to the painful task of marking out those passages which appealed to natural rights , and involved revolutionary measures ,  - -  rights and measures which were dear to him  --  and proceeded to " discuss the question with the Governor upon principles more especially legal and constitutional . " This paper , when published , settled the public mind ; " its effect upon public opinion was beyond expectation . The Governor 's reasoning , instead of convincing the people that Parliament had sovereign authority over them in all cases whatsoever , seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in any case whatsoever . " Another event , already alluded to , bears on the same point . The account of it , which is too long to be inserted here , may be found in volume II , pp. 328-332 . The substance may be stated in a few words . The project was on foot to make the judges dependent on the crown . The people took the alarm , and there were threats of violence . In this peril , the friends of order as well as liberty were at their wits end , to know what to do . In a company of gentlemen , the matter was earnestly discussed , without coming to any conclusion . // Mr. Adams , on being directly appealed to , suggested a " constitutional resource . " Several voices at once cried out , " a constitutional resource ! what can it be ? " The answer reminds us of the method by which the Earl of Strafford was " laid by the heels , " by probably the greatest adept in the art of resisting arbitrary government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a corrupt court ,  --  we mean the celebrated John Pym . " It was nothing more nor less than an impeachment of the Judges , by the House of Representatives , before the Council . " The suggestion was like a clap of thunder in a clear sky . However , after a vast deal of talking and research , the thing was determined upon , and carried through the House . The council now refused to do anything , and the government party thought they had gained a triumph . Not so did it prove , for the articles of impeachment were printed and read extensively . The consequence was that when the Superior Court came to sit in Boston , and several other places , the grand and petit jurors , as their names were called over , refused to take the oaths . They answered to a man that they would not sit as jurors , while the Chief Justice of the Court stood impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors ! And that was the last of judges and courts till after the battle of Lexington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Massachusetts Bay . We take the following recommendation of Dr. South 's Sermons , for the benefit of young ministers , who are studying style and expression . " Mr. Royal Tyler began to pick chat with me . Mr. Adams , have you ever read Dr. South 's Sermon upon the Wisdom of this World ? ' No. ' i 'll lend it to you . ' I should be much obliged . ' Have you read the Fable of the Bees ? ' Yes , and the Marquis of Halifax 's Character of a Trimmer , and Hurd 's Dialogue upon Sincerity in the Commerce of Life , and Machiavel , and Ca*sar Borgia-hard if these are not enough . ' Tyler . The author of the Fable of the Bees understood human ni*ture and mankind better than any man that ever lived ; I can follow him as he goes along . Every man in public life ought to read that book , to make him jealous and suspicious , &amp;c . ' Yesterday he sent the book , and excellent sermons they are ; concise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loyal fanaticism of the times he lived in , at and after the restoration ; but notwithstanding those things , there is a degree of sense and spirit and taste in them which will ever render them valuable . " Who has not seen the picture of the First Prayer in Congress , and the letter of Mr. Adams , giving an account of it , in which he speaks in high terms of Mr. Duch* , the officiating // clergyman ? It is a pity to spoil such a picture , by the pen and the pencil , but nothing is so fine as truth , and therefore we must tell those of our readers who are not aware of the fact , that Mr. Duch6 became a renegade from the patriotic cause . In 1774 , Mr. Adams was elected to the Continental Congress , in which body he became a very active , and ultimately , a very influential member . For a time , he and Mr. John Dickinson of Philadelphia , were quite cordial . DilThrence of opinion respecting public measures separated them in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mr. Adams alluded to Mi ' . Dickinson , in the following words , broke off all intercourse . " A certain great fortune and piddling genius , whose fame has been trumpeted so loudly , hasgiven a silly cast to our whole designs . " Self-love could not endure this , and the incensed " great fortune " never afterwards spoke or bowed to the author of the letter , yet they were courteous and good-humored towards each other in debate . In the Autobiography , under the date of 1776 , there is an account of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence . As a note to this passage in the text , there is inserted a letter written by Mr. Adams to Timothy Pickering , in 1822 , from which we make the following extract , without apology for its length . It will be seen that Northern representatives in Congress were taught the lesson of deference to Virginia , and the South generally , in the early days of the Confederation . This deplorable policy has been aggravated by time , until it has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be successfully resisted . We devoutly believe " There 's a divinity that shapes our ends , Rou , , h hew them as we will , " and as sincerely , that a good Providence has watched over our national affairs , but we can not resist the wish that the assumption of the South had been resented at once , and forever . But we will give the extract , and leave our readers to their own reflections . " As Mr. Hancock was sick and confined this was in 1'PIA Mr. Bowdoin was chosen at the head of the Massachusetts delegation to Oongress . His relations thought his great fortune ought not to he hazarded . Gushing , two Adamses , and Paine , all destitute of fortune , four poor pilgrims , proceeded in one coach , were escorted through Massachusetts , Connecticnt , New York and New Jersey , into Pennsylvania . We were met at Frankfurt hy Dr. Rush , Mr. Muffin , Mr. Bayard , and several other of the most active sons of liberty in Philadelphia , who desired a conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in a private apartment . They asked leave to give us some information and advice , which we thankfully granted . They represented to us that the friends of government in Boston and in the Eastern States , in their correspondence with their friends in Pennsylvania and // all the Southern States , had represented us as four desperate adventurers . Mr. Cushing was a harmless kind of man , but poor , and wholly dependent on his popularity for his subsistence . Mr. Samuel Adams was a very artful , designing man , but desperately poor , and wholly dependent on his popularity with the lowest vulgar for his living . John Adams and Mr. Paine were two young lawyers , of no great talents , reputation , or weight , who had no other means of raising themselves into consequence , than by courting popularity . ' We were all suspected of having independence in view . Now , ' said they , you must not utter the word independence , nor give the least hint or insinuation of the idea , either in Con*re*s or any r* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the idea of independence is as unpopular in Pennsylvania , and in all the Middle and Southern States , as the Stamp Act itself . No man dares to speak of it . Moreover , you are the representatives of the suffering State . Boston and Massachusetts are under a rod of iron . British fleets and armies are tyrannizing over you ; you yourselves are personally obnoxious to them and all the friends of government ; you have been long persecuted by them all ; your feelings have been hurt , your passions excited ; you are thought to be too warm , too zealous , too sanguine . You mHst be , therefore very cautious ; you must not come forward with any bold measures , you must not pretend to take the lead . You know Virginia is the most populous state in the Union . They are very proud of their ancient dominion , as they call it ; they think they have the right to take the lead , and the Southern States , and Middle States too , are too much disposed to yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Pickering ; and I must confess that there appeared so much wisdom and good sense in it , that it made a deep impression on my mind , and it had an equal effect on all my colleagues . " This conversation , and the principles , facts , and motives , suggested in it , have given a color , complexion , and character , to the whole policy of the United States , from that day to this . Without it , Mr. Washington would never have commanded our armies ; nor Mr. Jefferson have been the author of the Declaration of Independence ; nor Mr. Richard Henry Lee the mover of it ; nor Mr. Chase the mover of foreign connections . If I have ever had cause to repent of any part of this policy , that repentance ever has been , and ever will be , unavailing . " pp. 512-13 . We here finish our citations from Volume II , which is the first volume of the Diary ; and as Mr. Adams is-now fairly engaged in making national history , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life , in this connection . Accordingly we shall content ourselves with an occasional anecdote from the third volume , although it is filled with matter quite as interesting as that contained in the second . In September , 1776 , Dr. Franklin , Mr. Rutledge , and Mr. Adams , were sent by Congress , to hold a conference with Lord Howe , at his request , " on the means of restoring peace between the two countries . " We refer to this simply for the purpose of selecting the following repartees , which are rather pungent . " Two or three circumstances , I afterwards found circulated in Europe , and oftener repeated than any other part of this whole transaction . Lord Howe was profuse in his expressions of gratitude to the State of Massachusetts , for erecting a marble monument , in Westminster Abbey , to his elder brother , Lord Howe , who was killed in America , in the last French war , saying , he esteemed that honor to his family above all things in this world .

" When his lordship observed to us , that he could not confer with us as members of Congress , and public characters , but only as private persons and British subjects , Mr. John Adams answered somewhat quickly , your lordship may consider me in what light you please , and indeed , I should he willing to consider myself ; for a few moments , any character which would be agreeable to your lordship , except that of a British subject .

The Life of John Jay , by his son , Judge William Jay , takes up this subject at considerable length , but does not exhaust it . We can not , of course , enter into this curious chapter of our diplomatic history , but we will express the hope that the forthcoming Life of Mr. Adams will probe the matter to the bottom , without fear or favor . The following scene , at which an American audience would laugh immoderately , seems to have given great delight to the French . " After dinner we went to the Academy of Sciences , and heard M. d'Alembert , as perpetual secretary , pronounce eulogies on several of their members , lately deceased . Voltaire and Franklin were both present , and there presently arose a general cry that M. Voltaire and M. Franklin should be introduced to each other .

And the cry immediately spread through the whole kingdom , and , I suppose , over all Europe , Qu'il etait charmant de voir embrasser Solon et Sophocle ! ' " p. 147 . We select three or four short paragraphs , giving Mr. Adams ' views on several subjects of interest , because they must leave a pleasing impression of his character on every mind . " From all that I had read of history and government , of human life and manners , I had drawn this conclusion , that the manners of women were the most infallible barometer to ascertain the degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have since read , and all the observations I have made in different nations , have confirmed me in this opinion . The manners of women are the surest criterion by which to determine whether a republican government is practipable in a nation or not . The Jews , the Greeks , the Romans , the Dutch , all lost their public spirit , // their republican principles and habits , and their republican forms of government , when they lost the modesty and domestic virtues of their women . What havoc , said I to myself , would these manners that is , Parisian manners make in America ! Our governors , our judges , our senators or representatives , and even our ministers , would be appointed by harlots , for money ; and their judgments , decrees , and decisions , be sold to repay themselves , or , perhaps , to procure the smiles of female proflig*tes .

" p. lii . At London , July 21 , 1786 , Major Langbourne of Va. , dined with Mr. Adams . Their topics of conversation are indicated in these lines " He was lamenting the difference of character between Virginia and New England . I offered to give him a receipt for making a New England in V4rginia . He desired it ; and I recommended to him town meetings , training days , town schools , and ministers , giving him a short explanation of each article . The meetinghouse , and school-house , and training field are the scenes where New England men were formed . Colonel Tumbull , who was present , agreed that these are the ingredients . " In all countries and in all companies , for several years , I have , in conversation and in writing , enumerated the towns , militia , schools , and churches , as the four causes of the growth and defence of New England .

" pp. 400-401 . On Thursday , July 21 , 1796 , he was at Quincy , reading Dr. Watson 's Apology for the Bible , in Answer to T. Paine 's Second Part , of the Age of Reason , ' and on the next Tuesday , he expressed himself as follows : " The Christian Religion is , above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times , the religion of wisdom , virtue , equity , and humanity , let the blackguard Paine say what he will ; it is resignation to God , it is goodness itself to man .

No other institution for education , no kind of political discipline , could diffuse this kind of necessary information , so universally among all ranks and descriptions of citizens . The duties and rights of the man and the citizen are thus taught from early infancy to every creature . The sanctions of a future life are thus added to the observance of civil and political , as well as domestic and private duties . Prudence , justice , temperance , and fortitude , are thus taught to be the means and conditions of future as well as present happiness . " pp. 423-4 .

We can easily imagine that his thoughts often reverted from the scenes of strife around him at the capital , to the seat of peace and domestic enjoyment at " Peacefield .

" The reputation of John Adams has been gradually rising since his death . That event softened the asperity of feeling which had for many years been inflamed against him , and led the then rising generation to read the history of his great services with candor , and growing admiration .
