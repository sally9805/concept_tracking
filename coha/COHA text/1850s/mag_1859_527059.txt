TOM PAINE 'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN AMERICA . " It were wise , nay , just , To strike with men a balance : to forgive , If not forget , their evil for their goods sake . " - Saul , A Drama . L* the year 1774 , David Williams , a gentleman with deistical theories and scientific tastes , lived at Chelsea , near London . It was the same Williams whose tract on Political Liberty , published eight years afterward , and translated by Brissot , earned for him the dignity of citoyen Franfais , when that new order was created by the Revolution . At the time we speak of , Mr. Williams kept a school for boys . Dr. Franklin , who knew him well , often visited him . On one of these occasions , it is said that Williams introduced to the American agent a bright-eyed man approaching to middle age , nalned Thomas Paine , who had been usher in a school and was desirous of trying his fortune in the New World . After a short conversation , Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he gave him full advice with regard to his voyage and to his movements after reaching his destination , and wrote in his behalf a letter to his son-in-law , Bache , introducing hiln as an " ingenious , worthy young man , " very capable of filling the post of " clerk , or assistant tutor in a school , or assistant surveyor . " The " young man " was thirty-seven years of age when he landed in Philadelphia in the autumn of 1774 , to begin the real business of his life . He had been a staymaker , a sailor , an exciseman , a teacher , a shopkeeper , and an author , to say nothing of his twofold matrimonial experience . Such a long and various course of schooling had fitted him to become an American citizen . His father was a staymaker , a Quaker , and poor . The son was sent to a free school , where he was taught reading , writing , and arithmetic ,  --  enough learning to be given to any man at the public expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the right material , he can open the world . At thirteen , he worked at his father 's trade at sixteen , he ran away and shipped on board the privateer " Terrible , " Captain Death : the names of both craft and captain sug6est the black flag and cross-bones . Before the vessel sailed , his father interfered and brought him ashore . Luckily for him ; for , on her next cruise , the " Terrible " was taken into St. Malo , a prize to the " Vengeance , " after one of the most desperate sea-fights on record . Her captain was killed ; out of a crew of two hundred men , only twentysix were found alive , most of them badly wounded . Visions of sea-life again lured Paine away from the shop-board . He shipped in another privateer , and this time actually served out the cruise . In 1759 , we find him living at Sandwich , a staymaker and a married man . In 1761 , he was a widower and an officer of the excise . From this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Cobhett and Cheetham , and eleven months afterward was reinstated on his own petition . In the interval , he found employment in London as usher in a school , at twenty-five pounds a year . His leisure moments he devoted to lectures on Natural Science . In 1768 , he took a second wife at Lewes , the daughter of a tobacconist and the father dying soon after , Paine kept the shop . Here he wrote for his brother-excisemen a petition to government for an increase of salary . Four thousand copies were published by subscription . This piece introduced him to Goldsmith , and a letter from the author to the famous Doctor still exists , requesting " the honor of his company at the tavern for an hour or two , to partake of a bottle of wine . " The year 1774 was an eventful one for Paine . He failed in the sllop , was separated from his wife , and dismissed from // his office as exciseman . After petitioning in vain to be reinstated , he determined to emigrate . His first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia ; but Bache procured him an engagement as assistant editor of the " Pennsylvania Magazine , " at fifty pounds a year . Paine 's contributions were much al ) plauded , and soon attracted subscribers . His " Reflections on the Life and Death of Lord Clive " were considered admirable , but do not suit our Present taste . A song on the Death of General Wolfe , still occasionally reprinted , does not rise above a low level of mediocrity . But here is a paragraph on the Mineral Riches of the Earth , which , many years L ter , found favor in the eyes of the surly Che etham , and may still be read with some interest : - " Though Nature is nay , polite , and generons abroad , she is sullen , rude , and niggardly at home ; return the visit , and she admits you with all the suspicion of a miser , and all the reluctance of an antiquated beauty retired to replenish her charms . Bred up in antediluvian notions , she has not yet acquired the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locks and bolts up her private recesses with extraordinary care , as if not only received to preserve her hoards , but to conceal her age , and hide the remains of a face that was young and lovely in the days of Adam . He that would view Nature in her undress , and partake of her internal treasures , must proceed with the resolution of a robber , if not a ravisher . She gives no invitation to follow her to the cavern*- the external earth makes no proclamation of the interior stores , but leaves to chance and industry the discovery of the whole . In such gifts as Nature cau annually recreate , she is noble and profuse , and entertains the whole world with the interest of her fortune , but watches over the capital with the care of a miser . Her gold and jewels lie concealed in the earth , in cave , of utter darkness ; and hoards of wealth , heaps upon heaps , mould in the chests , like the riches of a necromancer 's cell . " An essay against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paine to the notice of several distinguished men , - among others , to that of Dr. Rush . Many years afterward , in a letter to Cheetham , the Doctor described his first interview with Paine . In this communication , he insinuates that he suggested the famous pamphlet and the no less famous signature , " Common Sense . " But in 1809 , the venerable Doctor was an old man ; and even in earlier days . his keen appreciation of " file ego qui quondam " and " Qoorum pars Wayne fui , " as the choicest passages in Virgil , was good-naturedly noticed by his contemporaries. * Paine 's own account of the work is probably the true one : - " In October , 1 ) T75 , Dr. Franklin proposed giving me such materials as were in his hands towards completing a history of the present transactions and seemed desirous to have the first volume out the next spring . I had then formed the outlines of " Common Sense , " and finished nearly the first part ; and as I supposed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new year wtth a Aew system , I expected to surprise him with a production on that subject much earlier than he thought of . " The times were more suggestive than doctors , even when Franklin was one of them . When Paine came to America , he found the dispute with England the all-absorbing topic . The atmosphere was heavy with the approaching storm . The First Congress was in session in the autumn of that year . On the 17th of September , John Adams felt certain that the other Colonies would support Massachusetts . The Second Congress met in May , 1775 . During the winter and spring the quarrel had grown rapidly . Lexington and Concord had become national watchwords ; the army was assembled about Boston ; Washington was chosen commander-in-chief . Then came Bunker 's hill , the siege of Boston , the attack upon Quebec . There was open war between Great Britain and her Colonies . The Americans had drawn the sword , but were unwilling to raise the flag . From the beginning of the troubles the Colonists had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burnings in ef figy , tea-riots , militia levies , congresses , * See " Climenole " in The Per*felio , 1803. // skirmishes , war , followed each other in regular and logical succession - but theoretically they did not make out so clear a case . They had line-drawn distinctions , not easy to appreciate at this day , between taxes levied for the purpose of raising revenue and duties imposed for the regulation of trade . Parliament could lay a duty on tobacco in a seaport , but might not make the weed excisahle on a plantation , - could break down a loom in any part of British America , could shut out all intercourse with foreign nations hy the Navigation Act , but had not the legal right to make the Colonial merchant write his contracts or draw his hills on stamped paper . As to independence , very few desired it . " Independence , " it was the fashion to say , " woul ( l he ruin and loss of liberty forever . " The Colonists insisted that they were the most loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were determined to resist the obnoxious acts of Parliament with both , if necessary . These arguments of our ancestors led them to an excellent conclusion , and so far are entitled to our respect ; but logically we are afraid that King George had the best of it . Before many months had passed , lagging theory was left so far in the rear by the rapid course of events , that the Colonists felt it necessary to move up a new set of principles to the van , if they wished to present a fair front to the enemy . They had raised an army , and taken the field . Unless they declared themselves a nation , they were confessedly rebels . And yet almost all hesitated . There was a deep-seated prejudice in favor of the English government , and a strong personal liking for the people . Even when it was known that the second petition to the King - Dickinson 's " meature of imbecility " - was disregarded , as it deserved to be , and that the Hessians were coming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reconciliation , they still refused to abandon the pleasing delusion , and talked over the ld plans for redress of grievances , and a constitutional unioa with the mother country . XVith little or no belief in the possibility of either , they stood shivering on the banks of the Hubicon , that mythical river of irretrievable self-committal , hesitating to enter its turbid waters . A few of the bolder " shepherds of the people " tried to urge them onward ; but no one was bold enough to dash in first and lead them through . Paine seize ( l the opportunity . lie had a mind whose eye always saw a subject , when it could perceive it at all , in its naked truth , stripped of the non-material accessories which disturb the vision of common men . He saw that reconciliation was impossible , mere rebellion folly ; and that , to succeed in the struggle , it was necessary to fight Great Britain as an equal ,  --  nation against nation . Tbis course he recommended in " Common Sense , " published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pamphlet that the connection with the mother country was of no use to them , and was rapinlly becoming an impossibility . " It is not in the power of England to do this continent justice . The business of it is too weighty and too intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of convenience by a power so distant . To be always running three or four thousand miles with a talc or a petition , waiting four or fice months for an answer , which , when obtained , requires Jive or six more to explain it in , will in a ftw years be looked upon as folly and childishness . " As to the protection of England , what is that but the privilege of contributing to her wars ? " Our trade will always be a protection . " " Neutrality is a safer convoy than a man-of*war . " " It is the true interest of America to steer clear of European contentions , which she can never do while by her dependence on Britain she is made the make-weight in the scale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not only was a separation necessary annl unavoidable , but the present moment was the right time to establish it . " The time bath found us . " Tbe materials of war were 1859.1 567 // abundant ; the union of the Colonies complete . It might be difficult , if not impossible , to form the continent into a government half a century hence . Now the task is easy . The interest of all is the same . " There is no religious difficulty in the way . " " I fully believe that it is the will of the Almighty that there should be a diversity of religious opinions among us . I look upon the various denominations among us as children of the same flimily , d*fering only in what is called their Christian names . " All things considered , " nothing can settle our affairs so expeditiously as an open and determined declaration of independence . " " This proceeding may at first appear strange and difficult . A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become familiar . " And until independence is declared , the continent will feel itself like a man who continues putting off some unpleasant business from day to day , yet knows it must be done ; hates to set about it , wishes it over , and is continually haunted with the thoughts of its necessity . " To this he thought it necessary to add a labored argument against kings from the Old Testament , which may possibly have had much weight with a people some of whose descendants still triumphantly quote the same holy book in favor of slavery . The King 's speech , " a piece of finished villany " in the eyes of true patriots , appeared in Philadelphia on the same day as " Common Sense . " Thus Paine was as lucky in his time of publication as in his choice of a subject . All contemporaries admit that the pamphlet produced a prodigious effect . Paine himself says ,  --  " The success it met with was beyond anything since the invention of printing . I gave the copyright up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to not less than one hundred thousand copies . " The authorship was attributed to Dr. Franklin , to Sanmel Adams , and to John Adams . It is hardly necessary to mention that the movement party , with General Wash . ington at its head , considered Paine 's " doctrines sound , and his reasoning unanswerable . " Even in England , Liberals read and applauded . The pamphlet was translated into French . When John Adams went to France , he heard himself called le fameux Adams , author of " Common Sense . " It soon became apparent that the people were charged with Independence doctrines , and , like an electrified Leyden jar , only waited for the touch of a skilful hand to produce the explosion . " Coinmon Sense " drew the spark . The winged words flew over the country and produced so rapid a change of opinion , that , in most cases , conservatives judged it useless to publish the answers they had prepared . One or two appeared . iNone attracted attention . About five months later , Congress declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as Common Sense ' could spread through such an extensive country . " In a few years Paine asserted and believed , that , had it not been for him , the Colonial government would have continued , and the United States would never have become a nation . If we countermarch and get into the rear of Time , to borrow an expression from " The Crisis , " and , placing ourselves in January , 1776 , look at " Common Sense " from that date , we may understand without much difficulty why it produced so great an impression . Paine , as later , when he brought out the " Rights of Man , " caused a chord to vibrate in the popular mind which was already strung to the exact point of tension . The publication was not only timely ,  --  it was novel . Paine founded a new school of pamphleteering. lie was the first who wrote politics for the million . The learned political dissertations of Junius Brutus , Publius , or Philanglus were guarded in expression , semi-metaphysical in theory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few ' readers ; * but the * Compare , for instance , Judge Drayton 's Independence Charge to the Grand Jery of Charleston , delivered April 23 , 1776 , with " Common Sense . " // shrewd illustrations of " Common Sense , " the homely force of its statements , and its concise and muscular English stirred the mind of every class . Even Paine 's coarse epithets , " Common Ruffian , " " Royal Brute of Britain , " and the like , which offended the taste of the leaders of the American party ,  --  for party-leaders were gentlemen in 1776 ,  --  had as much weight with the rank-and-file as his arguments . Paine became suddenly famous . General Charles Lee said " that he hurst upon the world like Jove , in thunder . " His acquaintance was sought by all who were of the true faith in Independence ; and when , soon afterward , he visited New York , he carried with him letters from Dr. Franklin and John Adams , introducing him to the principal residents " as a citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sense . " ' Had he been a man of fortune or American-born , he might have reached a place in the foremost rank of the Fathers of the Country . But nativism was powerful , and position important at that time , as Lee and Gates and even Hamilton himself experienced . The signature , " Common Sense , " Paine preserved through life . It became what our authorlings , who ought to know better , will persist in calling a nom * de plume , - a Yankee affectation , unknown to French idioms . In the autumn of 1776 , Paine joined the army as volunteer aide-de-camp to General Greene , and served through the gloomy campaign which opened with the loss of New York in September . He remained in the field until the army went into winter-quarters after the battles of Trenton and Princeton . It was not as a combatant that Paine did the States good service . He played the part of Tyrtmus in prose ,  --  an adaptation of the old Greek lyrist to the eighteenth century and to British America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with essays , continuations of " Common Sense . " The first one was written on the retreat from Fort Lee , and puhlished under the name of " The Crisis , " on the 23d of December , They generally spell it " ssomne. " when misfortune and severe weather had cast down the stoutest hearts . It began with the well-known phrase , " These are the times that try men 's souls . ' The summer soldier arid the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of his country ; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman . " - " But after all , " he continues , " matters might be worse . Howe has done very little . Fort Washington and Fort Lee were no loss to us . The retreat was admirahly planned and conducted . General Washington is the right man for the place , with a mind that can even flourish upon care . " ' He closes with a cheerful sketch of the spirit and condition of the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for union and contributions . This " Crisis " produced the best effect at home ; in England it had the honor of being burned by the hangman . The succeeding " Crisises " were brought out at irregular intervals , whenever the occasion seemed to demand Paine 's attention ; some of them not longer than a leader in a daily paper ; others swollen to pamphlet dimensions . They were read by every corporal 's guard in the army , and printed in every town of every State on brown or yellow paper ; for white was rarely to be obtained . In their hours of despondency , the Colonists took consolation and courage from the " Crisis . " " Never , " says a contemporary , " was a writer better calculated for the meridian under which he wrote , or who knew how to adapt himself more happily to ev ery circumstance Even Cheetham admits , that to the army Paine 's pen was an appendage almost as necessary and as formidable as its cannon . " The next campaign opened gloomily for the Colonies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almanac of that party , 1777 was " the year with three gollows in it . " The English held New York and rava*ed the Jerseys on their way to Philadelphia . howe issued a proclamation " commanding all conjesses and committees to desist and cease from their treasonable doings , " promising // pardon to all who should come in and take the oath of allegiance . Paine met him with a " Crisis . " " By what means , " he asked , " do you expect to conquer America ? If you could not effect it in the summer , when our army was less than yours , nor in the winter , when we had none , how are you to do it ? If you obtain possession of this city , Philadelphia , you could do nothing with it but plunder it ; it would he only an additional dead-weight on your hands . You have both an army and a country to contend with . You may march over the country , but you can not hold it ; if you attempt to garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water running to nothing . Even were our men to disperse , every man to his home , enga*ing to reassemble at some future day , you would he as much at a loss in that case as now . You would be afraid to send out your troops in detachments ; when we returned , the work would he all to do . " Paine then turns to those who , frightened by the proclamation , hetrayed their country , and paints their folly and its punishment . In speaking of them , he calls upon the Pennsylvania Council of Safety to take into serious con ideration the case of the Quakers , whose published protest against breaking off the " happy connection " seemed to Paine of a treasonable nature . " They have voluntarily vead themselves out of the Continental meetin* , " he adds , with a humor , doubtlcs* , little relished hy the Friends , " and can not hope to be restored to it again , but by p*yment and penitence . " In April , Paine was elected , on motion of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a salary of seventy dollars a month . When Philadelphia surrendere 'd , he accompanied Congress in the fii*ht to Lancaster . The day after the affair at Brandywine , a short " Crisis " appeared , explaining the acciden which had caused the defeat of the Continentals , and insisting that the good cause was safe , and that Howe 's victories were no better than defeats . Paine was right . The Americans were gaining more ground in Northern New York than they had lost in Pennsylvania . Burgoyne , who , " Unconscious of impending fates , Could push through woods , but not througi Gates " had capitulated . The news reached Philadelphia on the 18th of October . This winter ought to have closed the war . The alliance with France , Burgoyne 's capture , two campaigns without useful results , Washington 's admirable patience and management at Valley Forge , with starvation and mutiny in the ranks and disaffection to his person in the officers of the Gates faction , ought to have convinced every Englishman in America that the attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignant with the reckless obstinacy of the British government , that he conceived the idea of carrying the war into England with pen and paper ,  --  weapons he began to think invincible in his hands . " If I could get over to England , " he wrote to his old chief , General Greene , " without being known , and only remain in safety until I could get out a proclamation , I could open the eyes of the country with respect to the madness and stupidity of its government . " Greene had no confidence in the success of this appeal to the English people , and advised Paine not to attempt it . In the mean time the French fleet had arrived , bringing M. Gdrard , the first foreign minister to the United States , and with him trouble to Thomas Paine . It is well known that the French government employed Beaumarchais , the author of the " Barber of Seville , " as their agent to furnish secret supplies to the American insurgents , and that Beaumarchais imagined a firm , Rodrigue Hortalez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war furnished by the King , and were to receive return cargoes of tobacco , to keep up mercantile appearances . Silas Deane , a member of Congress from Connecticut , represented the Americans in the business . In 17 77 , Congress , out of patience with Deane for his foolish contracts // with foreign officers , recalled him . lie returned , bringin , with him a claim of Beaumarchais for the cargoes already shipped to the United States . As Deane could produce no vouchers , and Arthur Lee had cautioned Congress against his demands , the claim was laid on the table until the vouchers should he presented . Deane , confiding in the support of his numerous friends , appealed to the public in a newspaper . Congress bore this indignity so amiably ,  --  refusing , indeed , by a small majority to take notice of it ,  --  that henry Laurens , the president , who had laid Deane 's appeal before them for their action , resigned in dis*ust , and was succeeded by John Jay . But Paine , whose position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come from the French government , and not from Beaumarchais , answered Deane in several newspaper articles , entitled , " Common Sense to the Public on Mr. Deane 's Affairs . " In these he exposed the whole claim with his usual unmitigated directness . M. Gdrard immediately announced officially that Paine 's papers were false , and called upon Congress to declare them so and to pay the claim . Party feeling ran high on this question ,  --  a foreshadowing of the French and English factions fifteen years later . Congress passed a resolution in censure of Paine . Mr. Lanreas moved that he be heard in his defence the motion was lost , and Paine resigned his office . A motion from the Deane party to refuse his resignation and to discharge him was also lost ,  --  the Northern States voting generally in Paine 's favor . his resignation was then accepted . As the French government persisted in denying that the King had furnished any snpl ) lies , Congress admitted the debt , and in October , 1779 , drew bills on Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half of francs , at three years ' sight . Beaumarchais negotiated the bills , built a fine hotel , and lived en prince . But neither he nor Deane was satisfied . They still demanded another million . We have no doubt that Paine was cor rect in his facts , however injudicious it may have been to use them in his position . Deane 's best friends gave him up , before many years had passed . M. de Lomdnie , in his interesting sketch of Beaumarchais , has tried bard to show the justice of his demands on the United States , but without much success . He does not attempt to explain how Beaumarchais , notoriously penniless in 1775 , should have had in 1777 a good claim for three millions ' worth of goods furnished . The American public looked upon Paine as a victim to state policy , and his position with his friends did not suffer at all in consequence of his disclosures . Personally , he exulted in his conduct to the end of his life , and took pleasure in watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As he rose like a rocket , so he fell like the stick , " a metaphor which he s passed into a proverb , was imagined by Paine to meet Deane 's ease. * The immediate consequence of Paine 's resignation was to oblige him to hire himself out as clerk to an attorney in Philadelphia . In his office , - *t This l3eaumarchais clahn was kept alive until the beginning of the present generation . In 1794 , Gouverneur Morris , Minister to the French Republic , obtained from the Minister of Finance a receipt to the Crown for a million of francs , signed by Beaumarchais , and sent it home to meet the claim which had again been presented . In 1806 it reappeared , urged by the imperial Ambassador . In 1816 , the Duc de Richelieu minister of Louis XVIII. , sustained it , and declared , on the strength of Gdrard 's assertions , that the million receipt did not in any way concern the United States . Ia 1824 , the daughter of Beaumarchais came to this country to solicit Congress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1835 , when our claim of twenty-five millions on France was settled , eight hundred thousand francs were allowed to the heirs of Beaumarchais , and the business closed forever , - not crc ditably to us . The claim was probably unfounded ; but our government admitted its validity by the fact of payment ; and the money , if due , ought to have been paid forty years before , or a suitable compesisation made for the long delay . To be Liberals in borrowing and Conservatives in repayment is not a desirable financial character for a nation to obtain . 1859.1 571 // Paine earned his daily bread by copying law-papers until he was appointed clerk to the Assembly of Pennsylvania . Early in May , 1780 , while the Assembly of Pennsylvania was receiving petitions from all parts of the State , praying for exemption from taxes , a letter was brought to the speaker from General Washington , and read to the House by Paine as clerk . It stated simply that the army was in the utmost distress from the want of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the symptoms of discontent and mutiny were so marked that the General dreaded the event of every hour . " When the letter was read , " says Paine , " I observed a despairing silence in the House . Nobody spoke for a considerable time . At length a member , of whose fortitude I had a high opinion , rose . If , ' said he , the account in that letter is true , and we are in the situation there represented , it appears to me in vain to contend the matter any longer . We may as well give up first as last . ' A more cheerful member endeavored to dissipate the gloom of the House , and moved an adjournment , which was carried . " Paine , who knew that the Assembly had neither money nor credit , felt that the voluntary aid of individuals could alone be relied upon in this conjuncture . He accordingly wrote a letter to a friend in Philadelphia , a man of influence , explaining the urgency of affairs , and inclosed five hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as his contribution towar ( ls a relief fund . The Philadelphian called a meeting at the coffee-house , read Paine 's communication , and proposed a subscription , heading the list with two hundred pounds in good money . Mr. Robert Morris put his name down for the same sum . Three hundred thousand pounds , Pennsylvania currency , were raised ; and it was resolved to establish a bank with the fund for the relief of the army . This plan was carried out with the best results . After Morris was appointed Superintendent of Finances , he developed it into the Bank of North America , which was incorporat ed both by act of Congress and by the State of Pennsylvania . Paine followed up his letter by a " Crisis Extraordinary . " Admitting that the war costs the Colonists a very large sum , he shows that it is trifling , compared with the burdens the English have to bear . For this reason it would be less expensive for the Americans to raise almost any amount to drive the English out than to submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our ancestors read the " Crisis Extraordinary , " and understood every word of it , we may be sure . Paine 's lucidity of statement is nevermore remarkable than when he handles financial questions . But conviction did not work its way down to the pocket . Few men gave who could avoid it , and each State appeared more fearful of paying , by accident , a larger sum than its neighbor , than of the success of the British arms . Congress , finding it at last almost impossible to get money or even provisions at home , resolved to resort again to the financial expedient which has proved so often profitable to this country , namely , to borrow in Europe . Colonel Laurens , son of the late President of Congress , was appointed commissioner to negotiate an annual loan from France of a million sterling during the continuation of the war . Paine accompanied him at his request . They sailed in February , 1781 , and were graciously received by King Louis , who promised them six millions of livres as a present and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years , the American secretary , who stands respectfully and unnoticed in the presence of his Majesty of France , will sit as one of his judges in a trial for life !

They carried with them two millions and a half in silver ,  --  a great help to Washin0ton in the movement southward , which ended with the capitulation of Yorktown . While // in Paris , Paine was again seized with the desire of invading England , incognito , with a pamphlet in his pocket , to open the eyes of the people . But Colonel Laurens thought no better of this scheme than General Greene , and brought his secretary safely home again . Cornwallis had surrendered , and it was evident that the war could not last much longer . The danger past , the Colonial aversion to pay Union expenses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The want of a " Crisis , " as a corrective medicine for the body politic , was so much felt , that Robert Morris , with the knowledge and approbation of Washington , requested Paine to take pen in hand again , offering him , if his private affairs made it necessary , a salary for his services . Paine consented . A " Crisis " appeared which produced a most salutary effect . This was followed a few days later by another , in which a passage occurs which may be quoted as a specimen of Paine 's rhetorical powers . A rumor was abroad that England was treating with France for a separate peace . Paine finds it impossible to express his contempt for the baseness of the ministry who could attempt to sow dissension between such faithful allies . " We sometimes experience sensations to which language is not equal . The conception is too bulky to be born alive , and in the torture of thinking we stand dumb . Our feelings , imprisoned by their magnitude , find no way out and in the struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It will be difficult to describe better the struggle of an indignant soul with an insufficient vocabulary . When peace was proclaimed , Paine , the untiring advocate of independence , had a right to print his " Jo Pmean . " The last " Crisis " announces , " that the times that tried men 's souls were over , and the greatest and completest revolution the world ever knew gloriously and happily accomplished . " " America need never be ashamed to tell her birth , nor relate the stages by which she rose to empire . " But it is to the future he bids her look , rather than to the past . " The remembrance of what is past , if it operates rightly , must inspire her with the most laudable of all ambition , that of adding to the fair fame she began with .

" As indispensable to a future of prosperity and dignity , he warmly recommends the Union . " I ever feel myself hurt , " he says , " when I hear the Union , that great Palladium of our liberty and safety , the least irreverently spoken of . It is the most sacred thing in the Constitution of America , and that which every man should be most proud and tender of . " Thus he anticipated by seventy-five years our " Union-savers " of 1856 , few of whom dreamed that their pet phrases , or something very like them , originated with Thomas Paine . The war left Paine no richer than it found him . He had made fame , but no money , by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enriched his purse . He had an exalted ideal of an author 's duty when his work is on political subjects . Louis Blanc has written somewhere , " Le journalisme est un sacerdoce . " This seems to have been Paine 's thought , although he may not have expressed it so sonorously ,  --  for there are no phrase-makers like the French . But Paine went , we suspect , much farther than Louis Blanc for he held that the priest ought to take no pay for his ministrations . And he acted up to this unusual theory in literay ethics . If he took out a copyright , he gave it away to some public use . As he himself said , late in life ,  --  " I could never reconcile it to my // principles to make money by my politics or my religion . " " In a great affair , where the happiness of man is at stake , I love to work for nothing ; and so fully am I under the influence of this principle , that I should lose the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were I conscious that I looked for reward . " His friends and admirers did not permit him to have the honor of giving not only his services , but his actual expenses , to the Republic . The State of New York presented him with a confiscated Royalist estate , near New Rochelle , three hundred acres of good land , with the necessary fences and buildings upon it . Pennsylvania voted him five hundred pounds , currency . And the Virginians were talking about making a similar donation , when an unlucky pamphlet from Paine appeared , demolishing the claim of Virginia to the Western country . This publication changed the views of the chivalry , and Paine lost his grant . He owned , besides , a small place in Bordentown , - a gift , we believe , of the State of New Jersey . The other nine States passed him over . New England had expended enough , both of men and means , for the cause , - and the South had fine feelings , but no money . In the autumn of 1783 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from Washington , who had fixed his quarters at Rocky Hill , near Princeton , until he could resign his command to Congress . It ran thus - " I have learned , since I have been at this place , that you are at Bordentown ,  --  whether for the sake of retirement or economy ; he it for either or both , or whatever it may , I shall he exceedingly happy to see you here . " Your presence may remind Congress of your past services to this country ; and if it is in my power to impress them , command my best exertions with freedom , as they will be rendered cheerfully by one who entertains a lively sense of the importance of your works , and who , with much pleasure , subscribes him self G. WASHINGTON . " Such a letter of . hearty approval and respect , from the greatest man of the country , perhaps of the age , ( we Americans , at least , all think so , ) rich , powerful , honored , is certainly a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not an empty offer of service . Washington spoke to several members of Congress in Paine 's behalf , and told them that it would be pleasing to himself ; as well as right and proper , to make a suitable provision for Paine . In 1785 , Congress at last granted him three thousand dollars , much of which they fairly owed him for his loss on the depreciated currency in which his salary as Secretary had been paid . Paine accepted the General 's invitation , and spent some time in his family , at Mrs. Bernan 's , Rocky Hill . One evening of his visit was devoted to setting a neighboring creek on fire . This successful experiment , as performed by the Father of his Country , assisted by Thomas Paine , General Lincoln , and Colonel Cobb , is described in a tract on the Yellow Fever , written by Paine a few years before his death , at the request of Thomas Jefferson . Until the spring of 1787 , Paine spesit his time in Philadelphia or in Bordentown , writing occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for scientific speculations in the company of Franklin and Rittenhouse . He was a member of the American Philosophical Society , as well as an A. M. of the University of Philadelphia . His reputation , his wonderful memory , the shrewd originality of his remarks , made him a welcome guest in the best society . He was no talker or conversationist , ( an excellent word we should like to see legitimated , ) but a quiet , observing man , who spoke to the point , inoffensive in manner , and not unprepossessing in appearance . As one of the lions of the country , he was much looked at , especially by foreigners . We find a sketch of an interview with him in the Travels of the Chevalier de Chastellux . De Lafayette and himself requested permission to call " on that author so celebrated in America and in Europe by his excellent work entitled // Common Sense . " ' Colonel Laurens introduced them . " His physiognomy , " the Chevalier thinks , " did not belie the spirit that reigns throughout his works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to form a connection between us ; for he has written to me since my departure , and seems desirous of maintaining a constant correspondence . " In common with most of the clever men of his day , Paine , as we have said , cultivated a taste for mechanics and natural science . There was an awakening of the mind , in physics as well as in politics , at that period ; and it must be confessed that the natural philosophers have succeeded better than the constitutionmakers . Paine 's mechanical hobby was an iron bridge . A single arch , of four hundred feet span , and twenty feet in height from the chord-line , was to he thrown over the Schuylkill , near Philadelphia . The idea was suggested to him by a spider 's web , a section of which the bridge resembled ; and the principle he worked upon was , that the small segment of a large circle was preferable to the great segment of a small circle . Paine made a complete model of his bridge , in wrought iron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capital and of skill in the working of iron in America would prevent him from carrying out his plan , he sailed for France to lay his model before the Acaddmie des Sciences . Franklin , who always liked him , gave him letters to the celebrated Malesherbes , Le Roy , the Abhd Morellet , the Duke de la Rochefoucauld , introducing him " as an ingenious , honest man , author of Common Sense , ' a famous piece , published here with great effect on the minds of people at the beginning of the Revolution . " He had also a satisfactory credential from Congress , in the shape of the following resolution , adopted by that body in August , 1785 : - " Resolved , That the early , unsolicited , and continued labors of Mr. Thomas Paine in explaining and enforcing the principles of the late Revolution , by ingenious and timely publications upon the nature of Liberty and Civil Government , have been well received by the citizens of these States , and merit the approbation of Congress .
