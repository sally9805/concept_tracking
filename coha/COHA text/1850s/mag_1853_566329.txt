txt ART . IJ.  - -  MEMOJR OF REV . OLIVER ALDEN TAYLOR . Memoir of the Rev. Oliver Alden Taylor , A. M. , late of Manchester , Massachusetts . By Rev. TIMOTHY ALDEN TAYLOR , A. M. Boston : Tappan &amp; Whittemore . HUMAN life is a progressive development . When one steps upon the stage of time , he commences filling a blank ; and is every day , hour , moment , writing it out , till he passes off the stage and the curtain falls ; when he signs and seals it . That is his character , fixed , unchangeable , indestructible ; no hand of friendship can add or erase a line . The only worthy object of publishing it to the world , is to extend a knowledge of its excellencies and perpetuate its remembrance . The volume before us is the work of fraternal affection . It has become common of late to write or edit memoirs of one 's family friends . We had once some misgivings as to the propriety of the custom except in extraordinary cases , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the more we reflect upon it , the less we regret it . It is the working of bereaved affection ; and the working of bereaved affection is always graceful . It is weaving the wreath of evergreen to enliven the winter of the grave , enshrining the dust we love . The marble moulders , but the memoir lives in the family for generations . Besides , who so well qualified to draw a living // portrait as he who best knew and most appreciated the subject , especially if the private or interior life is to be disclosed ? True , the partial affection of parent , child , or brother , may warp the judgment and throw an unnatural halo around the memory of the deceased ; but so may the cordial affecthims of one not of the family ; and none but the warm hand of friendship would undertake the arduous task , unless the subject were a character of public interest ; and thus , if we wait for the cool , disinterested hand , we shall have only the published lives of giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read with admiration , but with little desire , because with little expectation , of imitating them . Who thinks of making the movements of Goliath the model of his own ? Besides , in family biographies , of one excellence we may usually be certain , that the best of the subject will be developed ; and this is what we most need ; for if we are influenced by the characters with which we are conversant , we should have the best , and the best traits brought before us . An exhibition of defects is of little use farther than furnishing beacons of warning ; and objects of warning are not so powerful to influence to goodness as the charming allurements of virtue . The delightful characWr of Doddridge wins more to godliness than the abhorred character of Thomas Paine deters from infidelity . Then the tender love , the warm glow of the bleeding heart , diffuses itself through every line it dictates , spreading a charm over the whole work , awakening an interest and exerting a power over the sympathies , which no stranger pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucretia and Margaret I ) avidson , or of Mary Van Lennep , sketched by any but a mother 's hand ? We are aware that this practice , if encouraged , in an age like ours , when everybody wields the pen , may greatly increase the number of published memoirs , and as the stream swells , much froth may float on the surface ; but the evil will work its own cure ; we would not , therefore , deprecate the accumulated results . For we regard biographical literature as of inestimable value . There is probably no class of literary productions which exerts a more deep or wide-spread influence over the reading public , including the learned and unlearned , than truthful delineations of personal character , displaying the features of the individual life , the palpitatings of the individual heart and mind . Here are the richest mines of thought , not only for the intellectual and moral philosopher , and for those who would touch the more obvious springs of human action , and move the masses either by popular writing or popular eloquence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtues . Here is nature // as it is ; the mind laid bare , dissected , so that we can see the internal organism , the working of the little springs and levers which influence every-day life . We behold one in capacities and circumstances similar to ourselves ; and what he has done or suffered , we feel that we can also do or bear . We regard biography as an instructor of human nature , much superior to history . The latter exhibits little more than those bolder and more masculine features of mind , whose violent ragings heave up the mountain ridges and peaks which mark the progress of nations . We learn little more than these , manifested in diplomatic wiles , in fearless resolve and daring acts , when tracing the doings of legislatures and cabinets , or in perusing the bloody records of war . Indeed , from the lives of such men as Julius Caesar , Marlborough , Nelson , Wellington , Burke , or Chatham , as they appear on the page of history , we should scarcely suspect there was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That such are not the most important human qualities to be recorded for imitation , it would be useless to waste words in proving . The inner soul , the deeper throbbings of the heart yet remain undisclosed . The connubial , parental , filial , and fraternal affections , every day sympathies , reciprocal joys and griefs , also exalted aspirations and pure hopes , too sacred to be known save to the individual heart , which play like spicy breezes along both the lowly and elevated pathways of life , breathing into families and nations an imperceptible spirit of gladness , as the unseen influences of *air , light , and dew mantle the fields of May with green and bloom , should also be spread before us . The first may be compared to those mighty streams which seam our country , whitened with sails and bum . dened with steamboats , hissing and dashing along , teeming with travelers , or loaded with the nation 's products . The others may be likened to the ten thousand rills leaping down our hill-sides , and the countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plains , furnishing drink for man and beast , moistening the earth 's surface , and carpeting it with vital beauty . What a deficiency , were there no water save that which flows in the channels of commerce ! What a barren , desolate scene would society present , were no other human affections cultivated than those which flash and glare on the pages of history . In addition , then , to these last , we need the exhibition of the finer feelings , the delicate and graceful workings , the more spiritual breathings of the soul , which sooth and refine ; an enforcement of the less noisy and yet more fragrant virtues which bloom by the fireside , giving a charm to the slightest incidents // of domestic intercourse , and lightening the drudgery of domestic toil . Not only the philosopher , but all who would understand the complex , yet regular but fitful movements of the heart , need to penetrate the interior chambers of the soul ; must watch the playful humors , the mild and placid joys , the gushing sympathies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which show man to be all but angel , and point to that noble destiny for which he was created , but from which he has fallen . Novels and tales which portray the interior of the mind are greatly admired , and denominated delineations of character , and pictures of life . But biographies are sketches of character and pictures of life , which though perhaps not so gorgeous or startling , are nevertheless more real ; for they are not the creations of the fancy , but the daguerreotypes of the heart . Then , we repeat , let biographies be multiplied ; not only of the great , but also of the obscure ; if one has evinced any striking excellence , if he has suffered patiently , resisted oppression nobly , struggled with poverty and triumphed over difficulties manfully , or exemplified those affections which sweeten life , let the precious gold be coined and pass into general circulation . Especially let the memory of the righteous be thus embalmed , not only because they are stars in the upper firmament , whose serener beams may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples of those finer and more delicate feelings and affections , gracing life and manners , of which we have spoken . To cxemplify a kindness , affection , sympathy , and , we may say , refinement , such as Christ evinced , we must be like Christ . To exemplify a spiritual elevation , a delicacy , purity , and tenderness , such as Angels evince , we must be like Angels . Religion not only purifies the affections which specially belong to her province , but gives grace and beauty to the whole soul . So long as lovers of romance will invent pictures of human life , let the lovers of truth present pictures of actual life , the living heart radiant with joy , throbbing with love , cheerful with hope , or braced to endure . They will inspire imitation and give energy to survivors still wrestling on the arena of life . Besides , biographies furnish rich repositories for the future investigators of history , or for those who hereafter would paint the present age in its minuter lights and shades . What would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts and affections , of Alexander and Themistocles ; to enter the homes of Demostheries and Cicero ; sit around the fireside of Virgil and Lucretius ; to see Cato and Seneca in their undress ? What would we not give for the diaries of some of the mothers and daughters of the ancient great ; for the memoirs of some of // the humbler sort ,  --  to witness the tears and smiles , the daily joys and troubles , which gladdened , vexed , and teased the million , three thousand years ago ? How delightful and instructive , on looking over the sweep of the past , could we , instead of ' surveying darkness and turmoil , the glare of meteors , the distress of nations , chariots and horsemen , living masses armed and dashing one against another , and garments rolled in blood , see here and there some sweet star gently gleaming on the low horizon of society , some fragrant flower opening on the domestic hearth , some smiling wreaths girding the giant statuary of manly deeds . This is whi*it we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the genius of history . The present biography is mainly a compilation . Mr. Taylor commenced a Diary as early as the age of fourteen or fifteen , while yet engaged in the labors of the farm , in which he records the circumstances of the day , his thoughts and feelings , especially his religious experience ; a habit he continued with great minuteness till the morning before his death , when he dictated a few closing lines in broken sentences . His letters also were numerous . From these two sources his brother has drawn the materials for his Memoir . Mr. Taylor is thus really his own biographer ; there being scarcely an event in his life , which he had not recorded with his own hand . The Author has done little more than link together extracts from his journal and letters so as to give continuity and unity to the whole ; seldom venturing an opinion concerning his brother 's character , conduct , or views , being in this respect , we think , more modest than was needful . But admitting the preferableness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak for himself , he has done his part well ; and however the work may please others , to us , owing perhaps to our personal acquaintance with the subject , his family , especially his aged mother , who still survives , with the scenes of his boyhood and y3uth , and the numerous anecdotes we have heard of the young aspirant for learning , it has been to us an extremely interesting volume . It contains a fine likeness of the lamented subject . Oliver Alden Taylor was the son of Capt . Jeremiah Taylor and Martha Shaw Taylor , the daughter of Rev. Timothy Alden of Yarmouth . This was the place of his birth , Aug. 18 , 1801 . His father was a sea-captain , and while on a voyage to the West Indies , through sickness and insanity lost his property . They became extremely poor . When Oliver was about two years of age , they removed to Ashfield , and soon after to Hawley , a wild , mountainous region , on which cultivation had scarcely smiled . His parents were devotedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet to walk " five miles up a long , steep , rugged , mountain pathway to the house of God , to whom he had been dedicated in the everlasting covenant . He was faithfully trained also to religious reflection at home . At an early age he was passionately fond of reading ; and when a mere child was known to weep that owing to his father 's straitened circumstances there was little prospect of his procuring aliberal education . Many a book he read by the feeble light of a torch , and even availed himself of the light of the moon for the same purpose . His religious impressions were early and strong ; and in subsequent years he could never decide with much certainty as to the time when he first gave his heart to Christ . He however entered publicly into covenant with God when about fifteen years of age , and became at once actively engaged in his service . His thoughts were turned to the Christian ministry and to the missionary field as a scene of future labor . But by what means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely hedged up . He was without property , and without influential friends to assist or encourage , and his father needed the profit of his son 's labor for the support of his numerous family . But Oliver 's mind was bent on an education . He solicited aid and sympathy , but both were denied . He often met even with ridicule . Nothing , however , could dampen his ardor , or weaken his determination . He commenced the Latin Grammar while laboring as a hired man on a farm , when the toils of the day were over . At length Rev. Mr. Grout , his father 's pastor , and Rev. Mr. Shepard of Ashfleld , befriended him . He commenced attending Sanderson Academy in the latter place . The star of hope now glimmered more brightly before him , but it suddenly passed beneath a portentous cloud . Amid the darkness and dreariness of a win try night , he was startled by a summons to the dying bed of his father . The immortal spirit fled ere he reached the humble abode . Sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy forebodings ; he shuddered at the gathering darkness . His widowed mother , and eight children , of whom he was the eldest , were thrown , in a measure , upon his care . This was the hour of prayer and faith both on the part of mother and son . She had consecrated him in infancy to God and to the Christian ministry , and what she had given to the Lord she would not take back . The struggle was hard , but trusting in the widow 's God , and the God of the covenant , she gave her cheerful consent that Olivei ' should pursue his studies . His friends , knowing nothing of the mother 's vow or the mother 's faith , censured him for leaving her and the little ones in their // bereavement ; but acting conscientiously , he went manfully forward . Ills uncle , Rev. rimotliy Alden , was at that time President of Alleghany College at Meadville , Pa . Oliver wrote to him , proposing to put himself under his tuition , and pay his way by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception of the offered remuneration . A journey of more than 500 miles was now to be made , and he had nothing wherewith to defray the necessary expenses . But after much effort $11.10 were raised , and with pack on his back and staff in hand , he bade adieu , amid tears and prayers , to the home of his childhood , expecting , not for years , if ever , to see it again . None but a lion-heart could have done this . After a toilsome journey he reached the house of his uncle , just made desolate by the death of his aunt . He was kindly received ; and here he spent two years . His genius soon began to develop itself ; he wrote several pieces of poetry , and made some public addresses , which gained him respect . But becoming convinced that the facilities for a thorough education , such as lie proposed to acquire , could not be obtained at Meadville , he resolved to unite himself to some Eastern College . Union College at Schenectady , on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , 1822 . He applied himself to study with great ardor and diligence , not even relaxing his labors during vacations . He pursued other branches of study than those assigned for the regular course , especially the French language , from which he translated a Mathematical work at the request of Professor Potter , and graduated with honor . July , 1825 . In November , of the same year , lie entered Andover Theological Seminary . Here he was distinguished for the same thirst of knowledge , for the same indefatigable patience and thoroughness in its pursuit . In the summer succeeding , he commenced the German language , in which he became an adept . At the close of his second year in the Seminary , pecuniary embarrassments induced him to teach in the Academy at Gloucester for one year . At its expiration he returned to Andover , and completed his regular course , Sept. 1829 . He now had several advantageous calls to settle in the ministry , but he could not tear himself from Andover . He felt that he had but just begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to remain there , pursuing the study of the Shernitic languages , especially the hebrew , and translating from the German . As the fruit of these studies , he published Rein hard 's " Plan of the Founder of Chi'istianity , " Reinhard 's " Memoirs and Confessions , " " Brief Views of the Saviour , " and several able and learned Articles in various Quarterlies . He spent some time in // the autumn of 1830 at Hartford , Conn. , translating from the German for Mr. Wood bridge . At the close of his engagement , he returned to Andover , still pursuing his favorite studies , and preaching usually on the Sabbath . About this time , he undertook a History of the Pulpit , a work upon which he spent considerable time , but which was never published . In 1835 he was requested to prepare a Catalogue of the library in Andover Theological Seminary , which he completed ,  --  a great work ,  - -  Feb. 1838 . In the autumn of 1836 , he commenced teaching Hebrew to the Junior class , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Prof. Robinson , to take his place as teacher of Hebrew and Greek in Union Theological Seminary , N. Y. , during his absence in the East , but declined ; Prof. Stuart hat . ' ing intimated that he would be wanted at Andover , as a new Professor in Hebrew was about to be elected . But when the Trustees convened , the choice fell upon another . Mr. Taylor now determined to enter the ministry , and accordingly was settled in Manchester , Sept. 18th , 1839 . His ministry was successful ; embittered by trials , yet richly sweetened by Christian friendship . As a Pastor , he was faithful , laborious , and affectionate . His earnestness and fidelity won the respect , and his tenderness and sympathy with the afflicted , gained the love of his flock . He proved himself , in all the branches of pastoral duty , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed ; and died Dec. 18th , 1851 , aged fifty years , trusting alone in the righteousness of his Redeemer . " Blessed are the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt a full analysis of Mr. Taylor 's character ; yet a few thoughts are suggested by his Memoir , upon which it may he profitable for a moment to dwell . Bis religion was watchful , introspective , earnest , pervading . Mr. Taylor guarded sedulously his own heart . He exercised a wakeful inspection over its secret movements , carefully noticing the influences of circumstances , associations , and employments on his religious affections . If these began to cool , or an enemy crept into the obscurest apartment of his soul , he instantly made the discovery , mourning and weeping till deliverance came . The treachery of his heart he well understood , and therefore often weighed his own spirit . He made self-examination a work ; not only endeavoring to search himself but praying God to search him . We rejoice in every specimen of thorough introspective piety , held up to our imitation . The religious tendencies of the age are preeminently directed to activity in behalf of others . It does not seem to be so much the object to glow with intrinsic heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of Christ as a living // fountain in the soul , as to send forth streams ; not so much to be holy , as to make others holy . It is our boast that the times are distinguished for Christian activity . In this respect , greater satisfaction is felt than , in our judgment , is altogether meet . We do not believe that the Church has , in any measure , come up to the standard of Christian effort and enterprise erected in the Scriptures . It is wrong even to make such an insinuation . True , it is a day when much is said about the importance of Christian activity . Many arguments are employed and earnest appeals made to arouse the energies of the Church . All this is well . But as usual , when a new idea is advanced , or an old one resuscitated , only a part of it is , at first , embraced ; in the present case , the impression left on the majority is , that that only is Christian activity which is directed to moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing to do with keeping the citadel , only with carrying-on the open conflict in the provinces ; as though it did not consist in gathering the head-waters , only in moving the machinery . Hence , when Christians are exhorted to work , it is understood to work for others . Just as though it were not work to labor in one 's own field ; labor is work only when it is put forth in the field of his neighbor . We need reminding , perhaps , that the end aimed at by monks and anchorites in times gone by was not altogether wrong ; they were only mistaken as to the means of reaching it . Personal piety is what no human being may omit ; it is his first peculiar duty ;  --  a duty which no one else can do for another . Hence , there is hard , earnest , persevering work to be done in on&amp;s own heart . There must be self-cultivation , selfpruning , self-moulding , as well as efforts to prune and mould others . The laborious work of correcting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unholy desires , and cherishing the Christian graces , must be done . We believe it may be useful to turn the attention of the churches more to this point  --  the importance of heart-religion . Not that heart-religion has gone into forgetfulness-by no means  --  but we fear it has not that hold on the churches that it ought to have ; at least the conversation of Christians does not savor so much of experimental godliness as that of our fathers with their deep and thorough piety was wont to do . How often do we hear men bewailing the enormous sins of Sabbath-breaking , of intemperance , of slavery , of idolatry , of superstition ; but how seldom do we hear one mourning over his own blindness in sin , over his own covetousness , his own idolatry , his own corruptions , crying out with Paul , " Oh wretched man that I am ; who shall deliver me from the body of this death ? " indeed , without reference to any former generation , simply taking the Apostolic standard as // our guide , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of religious ze.al , there may be a decided want of inward piety . It may be owing to this radical deficiency , that the churches so seldom enjoy those refreshings from the presence of the Lord so much desired ; and that the cause of missions and every benevolent operation moves on so slowly . Revivals , and the spread of religion among the nations , depend much on prayer ; and that piayer which God hears is inseparably connected with spiritual-mindedness ; and the fires of benevolence are nothing more than the out-breaking of the fires of holiness , burning in the heart . Unquestionably , a far deeper personal piety must become more prevalent , before the world shall be filled with light and salvation . The Church now does not so much need instruction concerning her duty to the heathen , as a disposition to perform duty known . A heart inflamed with the knowledge she now possesses , would send forth thousands on the wings of mercy to the destitute , and fill the treasury of Zion . We repeat , what the Church preeminently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convey our influence around the world is the overflowing of the fountain , the out-gushing of Christian sympathy , to fill channels already open . We therefore rejoice in every exemplification of deep , introspective piety , glowing in the heart , and beaming forth with the beauties of holiness . Such was Mr. Taylor 's religion ; it was not only introspective , but active , because it was introspective , lie was on fire to benefit his race , often expressing a desire to devote his life to the alleviation of the suffering , and the enlightenment of the ignorant . We have also said that Mr. Taylor 's religion was pervading , shining through all his varied deportment . But the religion of an intelligent being can be pervading only as it is founded in principle . On this the brightness of the Christian character depends , as those icy ciystallizations , clinging to shrub and spray in the sun of a January morning , one of the richest beauties of the winter-landscape , depend on the stems that support them . The great principle which lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's glory . " lie often expresses a desire to be swallowed up in this gloIy . This was his motive and his rule . This principle , deep-seated and ever active , fed the lamp of his piety , when he plunged into the labyrinths of scholastic pursuits , and lighted him through . This is an invaluable lesson to the student . For in burying himself in his studies , which , if he ardently thirst for knowledge , he will be strongly tempted to do , and indeed to some extent must do , would he become eminently learned , he is in the greate stdanger // of smothering his Christian life . His mind being severely and almost constantly employed in intellectual effort , his spiritual fervor is liable to cool , because his mind is directed to other objects of thought than those fitted to warn and invigorate the germs of religious affection . Some of our best young men thus lose their spirituality in College , a fact most deeply to be deplored . But nothing will preserve them from deadness to spiritual realities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the very foundation of Christian character , existing in the soul like " a well of water springing up unto everlasting life . " Such a principle is a fixed purpose to do all for the glory of Cod . This should be written on every volume in the student 's library , on every study , every lesson ; be his compass , his guiding star . In this way , his employments would he religious employments . Then , however hard he may study , however deep he may plunge into the abysses of science , he will associalte thoughts of God with his profoundest investigations ; and escape the danger of losing sight of heaven , and of Christ , " the way . " Could our Collegiate and Theological students make this the pervading principle of their lives , with what splendor would it suffuse their characters , and how much better fitted would they become for the ministerial office . It would constitute , also , a habit of inestimable value , which would abide with them through life , rendering them " wise as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while their talents , learning , and eloquence , are admired by the majority , prevent the too frequent lamentation over their apparent want of warm-hearted and absorbing piety , on the part of the more spiritual of their flocks . This is also a principle , which , in this age , when multitudes of even professedly Christian men are drowning themselves in business , every year launching out farther and further amid the struggling waves of manufacture and trade , needs to be enforced by example as well as precept . The world is all astir in some industrial pursuit . The hero is not now the conqueror of armies , but the most shrewd , efficient man of business . " Money , money ; " " gain , gain ; " is the cry ; every one is tasking himself to the utmost . To be industrious is all proper . We have not aught to say in discouragement of this . Men should not be " slothful in business ; " but they must not forget the counterpart of the precept , " fervent in spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him who died for them . This must become a living principle , writing " holiness to the Lord " on all their powers , on all their opportunities , on all their pursuits ; be interwoven in all their conduct ; so that thoughts of God will be associated with every plan , every enterprise , every act . Could // its voice be heard uttering its searching accents in their inmost souls , morning , noon , and evening , at every interval of business , they would , while diligent in worldly avocations , become examples of atdent , personal piety . Mr. Taylor 's Memoir furnishes us with such an example ; and the student , and the man of business , may be equally profited by its perusal . Principle to the Christian life , is what the mainspring is to a watch ; if this is sound and in its place , it may go wrong ; but if the mainspring is wanting , it will certainly go wrong . Another prominent characteristic of Mr. Taylor was family attachments . His was a home-heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially on the death of his father . He yearned over his widowed mother and orphan brothers and sisters in their destitution ; and would not decide to follow the destiny to which heaven appointed him , until receiving his mother 's cheerful permission . The same trait manifested itself in the tears mutually shed , and in the prayers mutually offered , when the poor youth left the maternal roof to travel on foot to Meadville . It also runs through his diary and letters , breaking out in such expressions as these : " 0 , my dear mother , where is thy soothing voice ? Where are those lips that used so often to speak for my consolation ? Have I been so indifferent to thy kindness as to influence thee to forget thy child ? " " I am here , 0 my dear mother , alone . Could I only have a look at you , my brothers and sisters , the sight would be heartcheering . What is the reason , 0 my dear mother , that my sleep is rendered unpleasant by dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little this side of your house , and you were standing near me , and your appearance so struck me that I cried out , 0 , my dear mother , what is the matter ? ' Then I turned my head away from you and wept . " Once on returning home , his mother was not in the house on his arrival . When he saw her coming , he ran out to meet her , and embracing her , exclaimed , " my mother ! my mother ! 0 my mother ! " But we will not trouble the reader with further quotations ; since most of his letters home are the delightful outpouring of a heart overflowing with the tenderest emotions . He never forgot his poor mother ; the infirmities of age only drew him the closer to her . As he was imprinted on the maternal heart , she was indelibly imprinted on his . Absence , new associations , advancement in science and literature , different spheres of thought , the reception of honors , never weaned him from mothers , sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His counsels // directed , encouraged , cheered . In their sickness and sufferings he was pained ; the quickness of his sympathy making their sorrows his own . But his affections were not expended in words and counsels ; he gave money for their support from his own poverty . He purchased , in part , a neat white cottage for his mother , near the church where she loved to bow before the Almighty . He seldom failed to visit annually that home , though pressed with other cares ; made it happy by his instructive and comforting conversation , and hallowed it by his prayers . His visits were neither fewer , nor were his acts of kindness and endearment less warm and heart-gushing , after he had a family of his own to share his affections . Even unto the hour of his death , it was rather the tenderness and solicitude of a Christian father , than that of a brother . The memoir is a fine exhibition of the family affections , and as such its influence can not be otherwise than salutary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domestic affections , and showing their inestimable worth to society ; believing that , as a community , we need reminding of their importance to human happiness and proper refinement of feeling . The enjoyments they yield are the gentlest , yet the sweetest . All other sources of earthly pleasure are poor , without some minglings of these . How distasteful all the world without them . Say , fond mother , for what would you part with the still , quiet , yet sometimes ravishing joy which flows from maternal love ? For what , devoted son or daughter , brother or sister , would you exchange the sweets arising from those endearing attachments which bind you to parents and to each other ? How pleasant , after the toils of the day , to sit by the quiet fireside , and interchange thoughts with those who can sympathize with all that wounds and tries us ! How full of satisfaction the thought , that , though the selfish world may recklessly lacerate our feelings , yet here are bosoms into which we may pour our complaints without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suffering , how grateful the voice , and how soothing the hand of wife , sister , mother ! Especially when prostrated with disease and afar from home , what would not one give to see the countenance , hear the kind words , and feel the supporting hand of one so dear , and know that there is a mother 's or a sister 's heart by his side , to sympathize with him till the last pulse beats ! Yet are there not multitudes who are willing to forego all this for the sake of gold ? And what name so endearing as that of home ? Yet we fear that this sweetest name , consecrated to household affections , is losing its charm . It certainly is not to many so precious a name as Cal // ifornia or Australia . But sad the day when home shall lose its talismanic power over the heart . The domestic affections are among the deepest instincts of our nature , and can not be trifled with without impairing the entire character . Mr. Taylor had quick and strong sensibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he once exclaims , " Oh the pangs I am called to feel ; the mental agonies to endure ! All is darkness ! The doors of usefulness are closed ! But stop-God does all things well . This heart , I fear , will breakwill break with its own calamities ! And yet heaven is just and merciful . I dare not oppose its decrees , or murmur at the sovereign will of the Redeemer . " Again he writes , " I have been struck by the archer , and his poisoned arrow has quivered for days and weeks in my very heart ; but the wound I have borne in silence . I could roll and toss on my couch , yea , with Jonah declare it better to die than to live ; still only to my God might I utter in sighs the anguish of my soul . Still , I ask , what have my trials been ? Not many or great perhaps to a soul staid on God ; not many or great perhaps to a less sensitive nature than mine , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too easily bruised to come into contact with so rude a world . Every flower I cull is sure to contain a thorn or a sting . " Again , he expresses joyful feelings , showing the same power of emotion . " I have streams of consolation flowing into my soul ; I am overwhelmed with joy ; I soar on wings of celestial love . I am ashameil of my murmurings ; I forgive all my enemies ; I ask forgiveness . I burst into tears of delight . I am swallowed up in unutterable bliss . It is good to be in the hands of God . I am a little child in a vast wilderness , and know not the way whither . But my Father will make a path plain before me and lead me in the way of duty . All events are in the hands of God ; he appoints , directs , and controls . " His tender family affections were but one development of his sensibility . No man , not finely moulded , could experience the feelings he expresses on once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene is touching , and graphically described , we will quote the entire passage . " Towards night my mother proposed to accompany me as far as Rev. Mr. Grout 's , and there pass the night . She set out on foot a little before sundown . I lingered awhile at home . Was pained at the thought of leaving ; more so than ever before , for never have I had so sweet a visit as this last with my mother . I walked back and forth in the room , while my sick sister sat upon the side of the bed . Must 1 leave thee , dear mother ? and thee , dear , dear sacred spot , how can I leave thee ? My heart was full , and the tears started to my eyes , when after having gazed around upon every object , within and without the dwelling of my mother , I hade poor weeping Mary farewell , fearful that under such pleasant circumstances I should never see her again ; nay , fearful that I should no more see her , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her days . Slowly I climbed the hill , endeavoring to throw my sad feelings into a poetic form , and often turning to catch another and another glimpse of the wido*v 's white cottage and little barn , till the final one had been taken , and the scene faded from my view . I spent the night in company with my mother , at Mr. Grout 's . The next day being rainy , I did not leave there before three in the afternoon . Then we shook hands with Mr. G. , who wept , and remarked , he feared I should never see him again . On s* luting him at my arrival , I had called him my father . Mother left for home , and I started on my journey . She had charged me not to say much to her , as we should take leave of each other . Often had we met and parted , but never before had enjoyed so delightful a visit . Since my last interview , my three brothers had made a profession of religion , and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my sisters had entered the marriage state . Having gone a little way with my mother , I left her to wend her way home , while the storm was heating upon her , and I pursued my journey in an opposite direction , offering up prayers on her behalf , that she might be blessed on earth , and find at length eternal peace , beyond the grave . " We are aware that acute susceptibilities , exquisitive sensitiveness in regard to the delicacies of life , strong manifestations of the gentler tendencies , " the melting mood , " in men are little admired . This may do for the female sex , whose highest peifections are thought to be softness , beauty , delicacy , nice perceptions , quick emotions . But man , the stern lord of creation , must be always a hero , at least evince an equanimity , a calm self-possession , though it be but the frozen indifference of stoicism . And a trembling diffidence , a keen sensitiveness to the public gaze or public remark , a blushing reverence before those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough brow-beating aspect of the world , is thought undignified , a weakness , worthy only of a taunt . This was a Roman idea ; and it may be truthfully enough denominated an American idea also ; it being peculiarly nurtured by our institutions . As the highest departments of distinction are open to every class , it is expected that all , of any nobleness of nature , will strive for the mastery . With the prevalence of these sentiments , he who has not the forward , self-thrusting disposition , is no candidate for fame ; while the gentle , timid spirit , who can not look the world in the face , is soon elbowed out of the way ; he is marked as one who can not fight his own battles , and sinks into a cipher . Such should be fostered , encouraged . Instead of this , to say the least , we deem them unworthy of regard . Thus , some of our finest minds are lost to society , whose influence might otherwise have become like the genial breath of spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason of this disesteem of sensibility is , that it is very generally deemed mere nervousness . But it is not altogether what is properly called nervousness ; it is in part mental , sometimes purely so . There is a spiritual organization as well as bodily , and the one has distinctive attributes as well as the oth // er . The mental constitution of one is far more delicately wrought than that of another . Some are all susceptibility ; their feelings are quick and exquisitely fine . The nerves of the soul seem all laid bare ; every passing breath affects them ; every smile , every glance they receive , touches some delicate fibre , giving joy or sorrow . Others are naturally torpid , indurate ; their susceptibilities are bedded too deep to be moved by slight occurrences . They are like the waters lying at the bottorn of the ocean , which scarcely tremble , while the surface rolls and dashes with mountain waves . Especially to fine and tender emotions , are they almost entire strangers ; being nearly as unaffected by scenes fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which taste gazes with admiration , before which sensibility rejoices or weeps ; while its cold form , so perfectly wrought that it might seemingly speak , weep , and rejoice too , stands stern , unmoved , with no answering sympathies . The former organization , so nicely attuned , so easily moved , is one of the highest excellencies of a moral social being ; the latter cool , metallic temperament , seeming woven of iron cordage , most undesirable . Next to the power of penetrating the depths of truth , of tracing its subtle windings , of joining together what is apparently without affinities , thus giving system to thought , and consistency to action , we regard a keen and exquisitely delicate susceptibility to purity , truth , and elegance , one of the highest attributes of mind ; for what so desirable , as , when truth is perceived , to be stirred , to be thrilled with its beauty , its sublimity , its harmony ! One might almost as well not perceive realities at all , as not to feel the charm or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the susceptibility of being exquisitely touched with the grace and loveliness of nature 's objects  --  the flowers , the grass , the waving boughs , the dripping foliage , the murmuring stream , the falling cascade , the stars , the rainbow , the frost-work of winter  --  to glow and swell with emotions in view of the soaring mountain , the sweeping cloud , the boundless scope of the evening heaven , the stormy ocean , the thundering water-fall . How desirable , a nature capable of appreciating , in their varied aspects , the intellectual and moral developments of our fellow-beings ,  --  of feeling the loveliness of a tear , of a smile , of resignation , of sympathy ; the grandeur of suppressed passion , of self-sacrifice , of courage to overcome difficulties , and fortitude to suffer the unavoidable ! How desirable , a nature delicately sympathizing with the multifarious feelings and conditions of those around us ,  --  with the sportiveness of childhood , the animation and hope of youth , the anguish of the bereaved , the dread of the dying , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may truly " rejoice with them that do rejoice , and weep with them that weep ! " But if the emotional part of our nature is an excellence , then the more profoundly susceptible , provided reason still holds the control , the greater the excellence ; for as this is the esoteric ground of all our enjoyments , the greater its impressibility , the intenser the enjoyments we are capable of experiencing . Besides , he who has this in a high degree , is a perfect moral thermometer , nicely sensible to every surrounding change . Such a one must be far more capable of entering into the feelings of those with whom he comes in contact , than persons of less sensibility ; for being keenly alive to every thing that falls under his view , the intellectual or moral manifestations around him will affect him according to their character ,  --  the sad with reciprocal sadness , the joyous with reciprocal cheerfulness , the solicitous with reciprocal anxiety , the wronged and oppressed with sympathetic compassion . Such a man must be admirably fitted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially for the Pastor . And it was this deep and lively sensibility of Mr. Taylor , coming forth in warm affections and kind expressions , which gave a charm to his pastoral life , enabling him to enter into the various interests of his parishioners , in particular with the sick and sorrowing . But the ground of acute sensibility is sometimes complex , lying partly in the mind , and partly in the nerves . While the soul is connected with the body , the brain is admitted to be the seat of the mind  --  the ground of consciousness ; and consequently the soul employs it , as the medium of its operations . Hence itself and the ramifications of the nervous system , become the vehicle of thought and emotion . Perhaps we can not see so distinctly that consciousness of emotion is dependent on the nerves , as that consciousness of the intellectual exercises , especially those which rise immediately out of sensation , is thus dependent . But we know that should the nervous system be entirely paralyzed , we should become , while in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any strong , lively emotion , particularly if suddenly excited , seems to run through the whole frame ; proving that the nervous system is powerfully impressed by it . Indeed , the nervous system , constituting the link that unites body and spirit , was made mainly for the purpose of being affected by the latter , and hence must be acutely susceptible of impressions from it . Now if the nervous system is thus the vehicle of emotion , then it is obvious that the healthy state , both of the moral feelings and of the nervous system , is essential to proper and // 526 Memoir of Rev. Oliver Alden Taylor . well-regulated affections . If one is diseased , the other is apt to be diseased ; if one is over-strained , the other is apt to be over-wrought ; the sluggishness or activity of one is shared by the other . Hence , intense and long protracted emotions , too heavily burdening and chafing the nervous system , enfeeble it ; it partakes of the mind 's excitement , becomes too susceptible , diseased , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too taught a chord of a musical instrument , giving forth too sharp a note . But the nerves are not only weakened by the overaction of the moral feelings , but by disease of body , or improper physical regimen , by intemperance , by too hard or too little exercise , by want of air , or sleep , or cleanliness . Now , when the vehicie of the emotions is unstrung , by whatever cause , the emotions themselves will be out of tune . They become quick , strong , overwhelming , perhaps unmanageable . The reason losing its control , they move irregularly like a train of cars , catching and shaking along , a disordered , broken band . When one is in this diseased , excitable state of the nerves , his sensibility is extreme , frequently unreasonable ; he weeps or laughs without cause ; sometimes being exceedingly irritable , the least disagreeable thing annoys him ; his predominant tendencies and passions break forth on the slightest occasion ; if naturally jealous , he becomes morbidly so ; suspecting every body to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if naturally fearful of death , he perceives the approach of the inexorable foe in every symptom of disease ; if naturally diffident , he shrinks from appearing in public , dreading it even more than death , as on one occasion of his life was the case with the poet , Cowper ; causing a kind of nervous insanity . Those , of course , who have most native susceptibility , are most exposed to over-wrought , over-excited nerves . Hence , poets , to whom great depth and quickness of sensibility are essential for those flashing perceptions of new relations , and for that rapid combination of striking imagery , which are the grand elements in poetical compositions , are peculiarly liable to susceptible nerves . And when this intense mental sensitiveness is combined with excitability of nerves , poetry of the most intense emotion , of exquisite tenderness , of overwhelming passion , and transcendent flight , is sometimes produced , so that tho assertion of Macaulay , ( not generally true , ) that poetry is a species of frenzy or madness , is realized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  opium , tobacco , coffee ; some , even wine or brandy , when they would invoke the Muses . We have heard even of ministers of the Gospel , who , when they would produce a highly-wrought , impassioned sermon , resort to similar // narcotic aid , instead of imploring inspiration from above . But woe to the churches , when they who minister at her altars are guilty of such egregious folly , not to say , gross immorality . We are free to admit that this extreme excitability of the nervous system is not to be admired ; and when occasioned by artificial stimulants , or guilty physical regimen , is worthy of disrespect. it is only of sensibility purely mental , of which we affirm that it ought to be esteemed and cultivated ; while this nervous excitability , when caused by unavoidable disease , or unnecessary hardship , in all its excesses and vagaries , is an object fit for commiseration . Ministers of the present times are specially liable to this unhealthy state of the nerves , and thereby to feelings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , it is more generally true of them than of most uneducated men , that they possess great native sensibility . It was this , in many cases , which originally prompted them to aspire to a public education . This is particularly true of those nursed in penury , and whose youthful years seemed shut up to the doom of drudgery and toil , but who have become earnest students or men of letters , an inherent nobleness of nature , an innate sensibility to the beautiful in the mind 's true dignity and development , first moved them to press against the barriers of their circumstances ; to revolt from the destiny of wasting their high spiritual energies in manual labor , and fired them with the resolution to break away . If they had not been sensible to the intrinsic beauties of truth , or to the more elegant conceptions of polite literature , they would have been satisfied with the allotments of birth , and never undertaken the task of rising above them by mere mental effort . Secondly , their habits of life , studious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their anxieties and trials , the thousand little annoying circumstances daily occuring , causing long protracted , harassing emotions , all tend to overtask the nervous system . From this subject , two lessons of great practical importance may be learned . First , ministers should understand their liabilities and dangers , and guard against them . Their highest usefulness demands it . Secondly , parishes and churches may learn how they often injure a minister , throwing him into a morbid state of discouragement and irritability , crippling his powers , even unmanning him , as decidedly as if prostrated by a fever . People are much inclined to demand great sermons every Sabbath ; they imagine their fine taste renders this indispensable ; not strong , argumentative sermons , rich in thought and glowing with devotion , but high-wrought , spicy , pictur // esque , passionate sermons , which work on the imaginations and feelings of the hearers ; and which consequently , in their production , must have wrought powerfully on the emotions of the writer . For nothing , but a soul heated to the intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melt the passions of hearers . In addition to these powerful and incessant intellectual efforts , if he fails to speak and act agreeably to the various fancies and whims of the multitude , one here , another there , all over the parish , starts up , finding fault , teazing , worrying him , corroding him with anxieties , piercing him with cold looks , embittering both his public duties and solitary hours , driving health from his cheek and sleep from his pillow ; so that he often rises in the morning unrested , feverish , excitable , his nerves all in a tumult , and his thoughts dissipated , utterly incapable of close mental effort ; and worried still more by the very thought that he is disqualified for study , with the Sabbath approaching , when a richly intellectual treat will be required of him , and if he can not provide it , or in consequence of a few failures , he may be driven from his place . Thus his nerves are overcharged , torn and rent , like the shrouds of a storm-wrecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that too by a complaining and over-exacting people , whom he is exhausting his strength , and wasting the energies of life to serve ; and then , as a finishing blow , comes the thought of ingratitude , stinging like the adder 's tooth , and he is prostrated . In this manner , parishes often defeat their own end . They want smart sermons , and by their ungenerous , unmanly treatment , disqualify their minister for writing them . Thus , too , in many instances , they become the indirect , though guilty cause of his dismission , while they take no direct measures to this effect . lie becomes discouraged ; difficulties exist ; small indeed , and were he in health , he would not mind them ; but weak and trembling from nervous prostration , he feels that he can not go on ; he must leave ; he needs rest . We would also that this topic might inculcate a lesson of charity towards a pastor . He may speak unadvisably with his lips as did Moses ; he may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discharge of public duties , needlessly worring about consequences . People may be disposed to blame him , and lie may in truth be deserving of blame . But let them remember that were they in the same state of nervous weakness and excitability , they might speak and act much as he does . While therefore he may be guilty before God , he is a proper object of their charitable regard . We would , by no means , excuse ministers for speaking improperly or acting // wrongly ; for if they would cast their cares more confidingly on the Lord , they would have fewer corrosive anxieties and sleepless nights ; we would only speak for them a kind word , beseeching the churches , for the Gospel 's sake , to exercise a little more of that charity which " suffereth long and is kind . " These thoughts have been suggested by the present memoir . As we traced the course of one of acute sensibility in the struggle of existence ; witnessed the petty annoyances and severe trials he endured-more particularly in his pastoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptible spirit , causing wakeful nights and feverish days ; anxieties and vexations which weakened the springs of life and hurried him to too early a grave ; we could but deplore that one so capable by the fine texture of his nature , of every social enjoyment , should be subjected to such intense suffering by the thoughtlessness or wickedness of professed Christians . We could but exclaim , how can those , who have been touched by a Saviour 's love , be so pitiless towards a minister of Christ , whom they are divinely required to " love for his work 's sake ? " And still Mr. Taylor 's trials were nothing extraordinary . Hundreds in the ministry will behold in these memoirs but a re-acting of their own experience-the almost universality of the fact rendering it the more lamentable , and the more important to be pressed on the consciences of the churches . Did Christians understand the harassing anxieties and often excruciating mental suffering which they sometimes occasion those who are set over them in the Lord , would they not be more tender and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bier of a pastor9 exclaiming , " can it be that we have killed our minister ? " Tears for the dead are indeed grateful , but how useless ! Far better , had those bereaved parishioners spoken one sympathizing word when the heart then cold , could have been soothed and strengthened . Industry and perseverance in the acquisition of knowledge is the great lesson Air . Taylor 's life is fitted to teach . Mere intellect is the product of the Creator 's hand . However great , it is no more deserving of praise or commendation , than the gigantic form or brawny arm . We may admire it as we admire a great mountain , a supernatural luminary in the heavens , or any wonderful phenomenon of nature . Praiseworthiness can belong to intellect only when energized by will , moral purpose ; when it is strengthened , expanded , sharpened by determined and systematic exercise . We then look upon intellectual powers as worthy of commendation , because it is in part the product of individual culture ; the result of moral energy ; this latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . We // know men are proud of mere intellect , of nothing prouder . They wish to have it appear that what they do is rather the inspiration of nature 's gift , than the result of discipline or practised effort . This is not unfrequently a prevalent feeling among students at college , and even among those farther advanced . They would be thought great geniuses ; that their endowments are sufficiently transcendent to pierce the intricacies of langua.ge and the obscurities of science by a glance ; betraying a vanity little less childish than that of the frivolous Miss coaxing for the compliment of a handsome face . Mr. Taylor was never guilty of such consummate folly . Nor are we to estimate the intellectual praiseworthiness of one merely from the position he occupies , or the height he has gained . We must also take into account the depth from which he has risen . He who starts from the middle region of the Alps and wins the summit , is not entitled to the same credit as he who starts from the base and gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dragging one through life to the earth . The manner in which the height is ascended is also another consideration . If one possesses a fine appearance , a musical voice , manners polished and graceful ; if he have cultivated simply those lighter qualities which elicit the applause of the multitude ; if he have condescended to sycophancy , or been assisted by influential friends , he deserves not the same commendation as he , who , with fewer collateral advantages , has risen simply by hard intellectual labor , slowly elevating himself , and always standing on truth and true worth , has won his way by compelling men to feel and acknowledge his power . This was , to some extent , the case with Mr. Taylor . He was cradled in poverty ; his boyhood 's home was one of the obscurest vales in New England ; his early education was defective ; years , often devoted by other lads to mental discipline , he spent in manual labor . To reach the top of the mountain , he had the whole bare front to climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing prepossessing in his appearance , nothing to draw attention , nothing to mark him out as the future conqueror in the field of science and literature . He lived in a region where , at that time , a collegiate education was considered unimportant , scarcely reputable . In his literary plans he was opposed by his friends , laughed at by his neighbors , discouraged by everybody . But he had a thirst for knowledge , which no scanty rills flowing round him could satisfy . He had also one thing morean unconquerable will to ascend to the fountain-head . Mowever high the obstacle arose before him , he resolutely end eavored to surmount it ; if , when one was surmounted , another pre // sented itself , he proceeded with equal ardor to scale it ; if another still , he pressed on with unabated purpose . When his path was shut up in one direction , he sought another opening . He applied to one and another for assistance and sympathy , and when all alike failed . his courage was high as ever . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredulous of his success to lend a helping hand , believing that God had kindled these extraordinary desires of the youth for some useful end . With such force of purpose and glow of enthusiasm , he commenced his career of study ; and his ardor never cooled , his energy never slackened through his collegiate and theological course , nor onward to his death . His eye was fixed on the goal that glittered afar , and no allurement could charm his attention from it . As an example of unbending resolution , of hardy industry , and unfaltering perseverance in literary pursuits , we know of none superior to that of Mr. Taylor . He never quailed , he never desponded , he never said " I ca n't . " What other minds had done he could do , at least make the trial . If he could not move rapidly , he moved slowly , patiently , feeling his way , but never giving over . As said of General Taylor on the field of battle , he would not yield . We wish Mr. Taylor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by the youth collected in our schools of learning , but also by all scattered through our farm.houses and work-shops . His iron resolution , his patient research , his stirring energy , could not be otherwise than inspiring . We need a stronger thirst for knowledge as such , awakened throughout the community , a desire for reading something besides the ephemeral , frothy literature of the day , for perusing systematic and thorough discussions of individual truths and their relations , something permanently valuable and disciplinary . We need more indefatigable students ; who shall pursue the acquisition of truth for its own sake ; who can forego all conflicting pleasures and amusements ; who shall be lured aside by no inducements of gain or prospects of im mediate applause , but press forward with patient toil , animated by the absorbing desire for knowledge implied in Dr. Robertson 's motto , " Sine literis vita , mors est . " We want heroes on the field of learning as well as on the fields of war ; and we believe there are sometimes difficiilties in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the surmounting of which requires , if not as much high , fiery resolution , at least as much high , steady courage . We have no idea that all the bravery in the world belongs to the champions of havoc and blood . The student must be equipped capapie , with helmet , shield , breastplate and sword ; his heart // burn with an unconquerable flame ; his purpose braced with bands of steel . We do not need students who stop to measure the brain , or take the angles of the cranium , in order to ascertain what they can accomplish in the world of intellect and science ; hut students who look simply at what others have done , and at what they themselves have done , or feel the enthusiasm to do , remembering that mind can not be measured by inches , lines , and angles , but by its own inherent energy-its strength of will . Let every young man resolve to be useful ; not stop to enquire whether he can do as much as some others , but resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this in view let him determine to learn all he can , and rise as high as he can in intellectual might . For more and more are we convinced that it is not so much the mind most richly endowed by nature , as the best disciplined mind , that is most effective for good ; not those who strike the heaviest blows , but those whose blows are the best directed and fall most incessantly . In a word , the most useful are the most actively judicious ; and judiciousness , if not native-born , is the adopted child of discipline ,  --  of enlarged , thorough , systematic discipline . Should all our youth aim at this , would they brace themselves to such a noble purpose , what a different class of men would soon be scattered throughout the community ; - would occupy our halls of legislation , our pulpits , our chairs of professional learning ; and how much more genial and refreshing their influence ! It would indeed be " as the dew of Hermon , and as the dew that descended upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no essential difference in the original endowments of men . We have already implied the contrary . But we believe the difference consists mainly in the greater or less degree of mental fire-a fire that develops itself in unresting activity , in energy of will , in sleepless perseverance and concentration of purpose . And this is , in some degree , matter of personal creativeness . To arouse ourselves to some specific action lies in our own power . If we can fix our minds on a definite point one moment , we can by effort , two ; if we can discover one truth , we can another , and then its relation , and thus proceed step by step up the steep of science . As we may increase the inherent energy of the mind by determination of will , each one must do this , would he become a scholar . This Mr. Taylor did , and it is what all can do . We are satisfied , that in estimating the eminence to which one may arise in scholarship , far more is depending on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sometimes thought that hard study , scientific and linguistic researches , obstruct or paralyze the power of genius , espe // cially poetic genius . This Mr. Taylor feared in relation to himself . We wish to offer a few thoughts on this point . J'Vhat is genius ? Genius does not imply different laws of mind ; the mind endowed with this Divine gift , and the mind without it , all will admit , move agreeably to the same general laws . The difference , we apprehend , lies not in the laws of movement , but in the rapidity of movement . The mind of genius flashes , the mind of simple talent creeps , or , at most , but walks . The man of mere talent fastens on some perceived truth , then reaches forth for another , or some relation , then another , and another , and so on , step by step , as we ascend a stair-way . He moves slowly but surely , feeling his way till he reaches his conclusions ; and from these , by a similar process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematical talent . But philosophical or mathematical genius from the perceived truth darts to the same conclusions almost at once-from the bottom stair bounds to the top . The mind may indeed take the intermediate steps , but with such swiftness as scarcely to be conscious of the process . If such a thing is true , another far distant is seen with the speed of intuition to be true . Now the exercise of mind can have no tendency to retard its movements ; nor , if such are the processes of philosophical genius , can widely extended knowledge , the perception of numberless truths , be any hindrance to its efforts . On the contrary , knowledge must be of the greatest assistance ; for the more first truths or established principles one has thus reached , the greater the number of points from which he may start forth to widely different and far distant conclusions ; and standing on these , again start forth on new discoveries , and so on , all the while seeing the relations of each to the whole , and grasping them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we apprehend knowledge or science is in like manner an assistance rather than hindrance to poetical genius . The mind , in the composition of poetry , works as strictly according to its own inherent laws as in the processes of philosophical genius , so far as the intellect is concerned in its production . And let it be distinctly understood , that , in this discussion , we leave entirely out of view that exquisite sensibility , deep tone of sentiment , and quick appreciation of beauty , which give vitality to the creations of poetic genius . The intellectual part consists in discovering striking resemblances between dissimilar thoughts , or striking contrasts between similar thoughts ; in seeing analogies between thoughts or emotions and physical objects ; or between thoughts or emotions and some event in // the affairs of men , past or present ; and in the capacity of constructing , pleasing or new combinations of scenes and imagery . All of which may be reduced to the perception of resemblances and analogies , and of such objects , imagery , or sentiments as fall congruously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind flashes on these discoveries , they being seldom wrought out by labor . The same may be said of the intellectual process in producing the mechanical form of poetry , the rhyme and rythm . The mind instantly perceives what words sound alike , and what words , single and combined , contain the regular succession of sounds ; or to express the idea differently , words sounding alike , or words having the appropriate undulation of sounds , are rapidly suggested , and instantly chosen , the rhyme and verse formed . there is nothing miraculous about it ; we always , in expressing our thoughts , choose the words best suited to our purpose . This we conceive to be a brief analysis of our intellectual operations in the production of poetry ; though the mind of poetic genius is often so rapid , so lightning-like , so multifarious in its enchanting conceptions , that it seems a perfect wizard , moving entirely without law . " The pure ethereal fire , Which seems to radiate from the poet 's lyre , Is to the world a mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arm , While Reason turns her dazzled eye away , And bows her sceptre to her subject 's sway . " Now , how should this larger extent of knowledge obstruct poetical genius ? If it does so , it does it by enlarging the field over which it may expatiate . For , instead of a thousand objects and scenes from which to draw analogies and select congruous objects and resemblances to sit in one harmonious picture , there are now tens of thousands . Can this cramp genius ? It may require more judgment to select from the multiplied resemblances and analogies flashing on the mind ; but it can , by no means , lessen their number , or diminish the power of the mind to perceive them . On the contrary , the imagery must become more varied and rich . The same is true of linguistic acquisitions . As language is the instrument by which poetical conceptions are expressed , linguistic studies can but enlarge the instrument , augment the resources and increase the facility of poetic composition ; rendering the diction more choice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , laborious study , paralyze poetic genius , cool the poetic fire , check that fervid , rapid , electrical movement of the mind in detecting resemblan // ces , or discovering the beauty and fitness of objects and mcidents to be moulded into one individualized , living image ? We can see no necessity for such a result . We admit that poetry , whose imagery is drawn from truths and relations scientifically discovered , would be appreciated only by those who are scientifically learned . It would not be popular poetry . The imagery of popular poetry is all drawn from things and scenes familiar to the people ; otherwise it would not be popular ; for , of course , the relation of the thought or emotion to the object to which it is compared must be seen ; if not , the beauty of the imagery will not be perceived . But does the fact that the imagery is all drawn and the combinations all woven from materials gathered in the scientific world , render the poetry less beautiful and fascinating to the select few-render it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for producing popular poetry ? Not necessarily ; though we admit it may , in some minds not strongly impregnated with the Parnassian fire , really have this effect . The reason is this . The object of scientific research is the investigation of truth , the ascertainment of philosophical relations , the tracing of connections between phenomena and first principles ; in a word , generalization . The object of poetry is not the discovery of truth ; though a mind of poetic genius , combined with a high degree of philosophic power may , in its eagle-flights , and Tartarean plunges , strike on moral and intellectual truths which the mere philosopher would never have reached ; yet its object is not the discovery of truth , but the tracings of resemblances and analogies between truths already discovered , and objects already known . This much , however , may be conceded ; that the investigation of truth , the finding out of new relations ; this stretching away farther and farther into the mysteries of creation ; this climbing to higher and higher glories of God 's government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemblance , giving wing to fancy and conjuring up new combinations and affecting scenes ; though the latter may be a noble work employed in illustrating truth ,  --  in clothing it with a charm to allure the unthinking . Now the mind of an investigator of truth may be elevated by the dignity of its employment to such a degree , that he may be unwilling to condescend to the mere play of resemblances . If philosophical pursuits do curb the flights of imagination , check the exuberance of the poetic gift , it is probably owing more to this than any other cause ,  --  the want of a disposition to indulge the playful tendency , being enamored with higher beauty . But we by no means believe that scientific studies necessarily give a disrelish for the // poetic art . Facts prove that one may come down from his high work of penetrating the arcana of truth , if he choose , and take pastime in playing with poetic analogies , or in weaving fancy 's airy frost-work . This John Quincy Adams sometimes did . A thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious Milton . " He was a laborious student , and profoundly learned in scholastic lore ; and yet , even in the yellow leaf of life , he bade his mighty numbers roll ; and they rolled , and continue to roll , murmuring music that will never die . Nor is there anything marvelous in this , considered as a phsycological phenomenon . For if one has true poetic genius , which sees rapidly these fanciful relatioiis , glancing from one to another , leaping and rushing on with the rage of madness , striking oUt new and unexpected lights of imagination from almost every object , when he relaxes from his severe studies , and frees his mind from the restraints of scientific toil , why should it not follow its native tendencies ? When the obstruction in the stream is removed , why should not the waters resume their accustomed flow ? True , he who has studied the philosophy of the lily 's or violet 's growth and texture may see the one shadowing forth something besides innocence , and the other something besides modesty ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But may not the philosopher lose the freshness and vivacity offirst impressions made by his earliest views of nature ? This , in the true poet , is by no means a certain result of close intellectual application . For one of the essential characteristics of the poetic genius , is the capability of assuming another 's position ,  --  of making , by sympathy , another 's circumstances and the feelings inspired by them , his own . Without this power , one could neither write a Tragedy nor Epic , not even a Ballad , unless it were the bare record of his own experiences . He , then , who has the true poetic vein , can easily transplant himself into the situation of him , who , for the first time , looked out upon this beautiful creation , when , to his imagination , every moving object was endowed with life , and every sound was the breath of vital organs , making his surprise and admiration , and all his strange , conflicting emotions , his own . This Milton did in sketching the sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he who can not perform similar feats while he pursues scientific or linguistic researches , may rest assured that poetry is not his peculiar vocation . But may not close and prolonged intellectual labor deaden the sensibilities ,  --  blunt the fine , exquisite emotions of taste and beauty ? It is sometimes so thought . But it is yet to be proved // that the philosopher is not as capable of deep , lively , arid refined emotions , as he was previous to his profound researches . His sensibilities may , indeed , be turned into different channels ; they may have new objects , but the deep within is neither frozen nor dried up . The study of truth never deadens the susceptibilities of the soul to elegance and beauty , for truth is beauty itself . When Archimedes had solved the difficult problem , and in the joy of the moment ran through the streets crying " Ei*p**c , EUprn*ct ; " he doubtless felt as strong emotions as he was capable of feeling previous to his commencing his mathematical studies . When Sir Isaac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertaining the laws of gravitation , that he was convinced his previous conjectures would prove true , his feelings so overpowered him that he was obliged to call in the assistance of a friend to help him through . Was not here elevated emotion enough to move poetic numbers , if he had been originally endowed with the genius ? Thus the idea that severe study tends to impede or clog poetic genius is a mere boy 's whim , suggested by sheer laziness . We would say to one who aspires to perfection in this divinest art , study science , study it thoroughly in all its departments ; study history , geography ; study language , ancient and modern ; observe narrowly every appearance of nature , every mode of human development , every nook and corner of the human heart ; study hard , study methodically ; widen , by every means , the scope of poetical analogy and combination ; enlarge , by every means , the power of thought and expression ; only let the mind loose occasionally , unbridle Pegasus , and let him race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his power and strengthen it-for genius must have practice to reach perfection ,  --  and the poetic fire burning within , will neither be quenched nor cooled , but become more glowing , and produce richer results . The propriety of Mr. Taylor 's spending so many yearsabout ten-at Andover in scholastic pursuits , after completing his theological studies , considering his ability as a preacher , his power of moving the popular mind , and his eminent social qualities , fitting him so admirably for pastoral duties , has not unfrequently been questioned . We well remember our own suspicions , when , some fifteen years since , in our walks over that sacred hill , we were in the habit of meeting Mr. Taylor with his pale , careworn countenance , rather rusty appearance , and hurried , nervous walk , that possibly he might not be making the most of his powers . We knew that others had similar thoughts ; they were thoughts natural to American minds , // especially to such as were looking forward with ardor to a more active life . As a people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective employment . A dreamer over books is not to our taste . The acquisition of knowledge beyond what may be obtained by passing through the common curriculum of studies prescribed in our colleges and in some professional school , is thought unprofitable . This course being completed , every one must at once engage in some avocation visibly and immediately beneficial to himself or to his generation . To repose longer in Academic bowers is not thought corn mendable , and the uprightness of him who attempts it is very likely to be called in question , and his motives impugned . There is no just idea among us of the value of large acquisitions of learning , or of its necessity to the production of able and well digested works , such as shall instruct , not only the present , but succeeding generations . We need a national Biblical literature ; Biblical scholars of our own . Foreign Biblical works and scholars do not altogether meet our wants , and some of them have , we fear , spread mildew over the harvest fields of the church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing our own atmosphere , filled with the spirit of our own institutions , trained to think and speak as one of us . Religious instruction , modes of biblical interpretation , or theological philosophizing , adapted to the minds and habits of thought of another nation , may not be most profitable to American minds . In fact , we sometimes find that the foreign scion , grafted on New England stock , produces neither foreign nor native fruit , but a sort of " lusus naturre , " a marvel for men to stare at . It operates like putting new cloth unto an old garment . For our part we should rejoice to see a far greater number of the first class of intellects among us devoting themselves exclusively to sacred learning-candid and judicious men , who would thoroughly scrutinize the thousand phases of truth which come floating to us from other lands ; and stripping them of their imported drapery , clothe them with the costume of home production . We know , with the present notions of the community , such purposes of life would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wise men , unbecoming Christians . But the day may not be far distant when the idea of a national biblical literature shall be appreciated , and those who devote themselves to its acquisition and production , admired . Then Mr. Taylor may be commended for what in life he was censured . However this may be , of the propriety and correctness of his course he alone was capable of deciding ; for he alone was responsible ; he alone could hear the voice of his own conscience . His // journal testifies that he entered upon it and continued it with much prayer , and with severe questioning of motives . This , together with the original works and translations , he was thereby enabled to produce , which have blessed , and are still blessing mankind , is enough to lead the generous and enlightened , if they still regard his course as censurable , to throw over it the mantle of charity ; and not only so , but be thankful for the good he actually accomplished . We also indulge the hope that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be happy to trace farther the life of Mr. Taylor and point out other lessons it is fitted to inculcate . But we forbear . His record is on high ; his character is with us . We are glad it has been given to the world It can not fail to give encouragement to learning , to animate and cheer the struggling student , to edify the Christian , to impress upon all the importance of religious principle
