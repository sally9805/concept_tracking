FORTUNE first went to China in 1843 to collect botanical specimens for the Horticultural Society of London . He returned to this country in 1846 , but again revisited the Celestial Empire in 1848 , having been commissioned by the East India Directors to procure tea-plants and tea-makers for their plantations in the Himalayas . His instructions fulfilled , he came back to England in 1861 , and was once more despatched in 1862 to secure an additional stock of plants and workmen . He remained with this object till 1866 , at which period he had spent altogether nearly nine years among the people of China . Each of his journeys has been made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their third edition printed toDcXcXIX . LIVING AGE . VOL . XIX. 9 gether , with the title of " Two Visits to the Tea Countries of China , " and in " A Residence among the Chinese " we have now the account of his last visit , which terminated at the close of 1866 . The value and , interest of these works is very great . The remark suggested to Voltaire by our slender acquaintance with the Celestial Empire has not yet lost all its truth : " We on this globe are like insects in a garden-those who live on an oak seldom meet those who pass their short lives on an ash . " But the inhabitants of the oak are both more frequent now in their visits to the ash , and carry further their survey of the myriads who cover its leaves . The sphere of Mr. Fortune 's observation was as varied as it was prolonged . Instead of confining himself to the districts to which foreigners are limited by treaty , he advanced boldly into the interior . In one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them as one of themselves , and saw them free from every species of restraint . What he had the opportunity of witnessing without disguise he has described without a trace of the exaggeration which has rendered worthless half the books upon China . His narrative is charae** tensed by a soberness and simplicity which are the sure prognostication of veracity . In this respect it presents a strong contrast to the clever and entertaining work of M. Hue . Where the prejudices of this vain-glorious , ecclesiastic do not intervene , his account of Chinese customs is usually exact ; but in his history of his personal adventures he appears throughout to take the proverbial privileges of a traveller . From the outset of his journey he wore , to the horror of the mandarins , the red girdle and yellow hat which are the attributes of royalty , and in which no subject is permitted to appear under pain of perpetual exile . Dressed as an emperor , he assumed imperial authority . A solitary and obnoxious foreigner , he bearded governors of towns and provinces ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his presence , and in the heart of their own country tremblingly obeyed the lordly commands of the majestic M. Hue . If his " open sesame " really effected the wonders // he describes , we must impute it entirely to his own moderation that he is not at this moment Emperor of China . There is a proverb which says that every man will speak of the fair as his own market has gone in it . This is alone sufficient to account for many of the opposite conclusions which travellers have formed of the qualities of the nations they visit . So long as the Jesuits were countenanced in China they filled their books with glowing descriptions of the virtues and civilization of the people , but , after they were persecuted and expelled , spoke in censure as exaggerated as their former praise . Mr. Fortune dwells upon the importance of preserving good humor when surrounded by Chinese . Laugh and joke with them , he says , and all will go well , but once lose your temper , and you will probably be hooted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tact , geniality , and forbearance , is not unlikely to be irritated when a pestering mob call him a " Pak Quei-tze , " or White Devil , which is the general name in China for a foreigner ; and the man who has been pelted with stones brings away very different notions of the people from one who has drawn forth mirth and smiles . Not only does it depend upon the traveller whether he elicits the amiable or evil qualities of the natives , but the impressions made upon him by what he sees are influenced by his disposition his health , his spirits . He who carries sunshine within his own breast throws its golden hue over objects which look sombre to splenetic or uncongenial minds . Another source of discrepancy is to be . found in the different features presented by the inhabtants of different districts . Every writer is prone to generalize his own limited experience , and many persons , Mr. Fortune intimates , have mistaken the traits of the low rabble of Canton for imperial characteristics . Voltaire long ago exposed the error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What , " he asks , " would the Chinese have said if they had been shipwrecked on the French coast at the period when the law of nations sanctioned the confiscation of the cargo , and custom permitted the murder of the crew ? " Thus the dissimilar views are frequently rather one sided than contradictory . Both , said Dr. Johnson of the remarks of Lord Orrery and Delany on Swift , were right-only Delany had seen most of the good side , Lord Orrery most of the bad . It has been usual to speak of the Chinese as a very singular people . Goldsmith , who looked into the subject when he wrote his " Citizen of the World , " in the assumed character of a Celestial philosopher , came to the conclusion that they and we were pretty much alike . The works of Mr. Fortune confirm this opinion . Their radical peculiarities are not greater than those of most other races , and the better they are known the more apparent it becomes that man in China is much the same as man elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless speculation , and has never been explained . They anticipated every European nation by several centuries in some of the noblest triumphs of art and science-in the discovery of the properties of the magnet , in the composition of gunpowder , in the manufacture of silk , in the fabrication of paper , and in the invention of printing . They hit upon ingenious and mechanical contrivances9 and compounded and colored porcelain with a perfection which has defied imitation . The means by which they secured the splendid hues which distinguish their finest vases are still a secret , and were certainly attained by processes too complicated to be the result of chance . The civilization which they conquered in ages past they have sedulously kept . Nowhere is learning held in equal esteem , nowhere is education so widely spread , nowhere are books cheaper or more prized . With all this diffusion of knowledge and the careful retention *of the benefits they inherited from remote ancestors , they have hardly , in hundreds of years , advanced a step . how did it happen that the intellects which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suddenly stopped short-that , having made large strides forward , they should not have continued to make others in the same direction , which our experience shows to be still more easy and just as urgent ? By what means has original thought and inquiry been suspended for ages in millions of enlightened and educated minds , and the craving for progress , which seems an instinct of tutored intellects , been utterly extinguished ? These are questions which many have attempted to answer , but the causes they have assigned appear upon examination to resolve themselves into a statement , under another form , of the effects they are produced to explain . The problem has 130 // hitherto baffled ingenuity , nor can we perceive that our increased acquaintance with the Chinese people has furnished us with additional materials for its solution . " They resemble , " says Voltaire , " the Egyptians , who began by instructing the Greeks , and ended by becoming incapable of being their disciples . " One phase under which this singular absence of inquiry appears is , that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They profess , " say Sir JohaDavis , " to set no value on abstract science apart from some obvious and immediate end of utility . " iDr . Abel , who accompanied Lord Amherst in his embassy , told a mandarin that the metal which Sir Humphry Davy had discovered to be the base of potash would burst into flame on coming in contact with water , and the English philosopher hoped to astonish the Chinese magnate by the exhibition of the phenomenon . The mandarin asked its use , and , finding that it furnished nothing to the material comforts of life , looked such contempt that the Doctor had not the courage to perform the experiment . In his botanical excursions the people , who observed him gathering plants which were neither good for food nor physic , laughed at his eagerness and pitied his ignorance . In the same way they regarded Mr. Fortune with a mixture of awe and compassion , as a person out of his mind , on his endeavoring to explain to them that he collected insects for the purpose of studying their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little folks that he would pay them for any rare specimens they brought to him when he came back from his daily ramble , and the result is an illustration of their utter inability to frame an idea of Natural History . " In the evening when I returned , and caught a glimpse of my boat , I was surprised to see the banks of the stream crowded with a multitude of people of all ages and sizes . Old women and young ones , men and boys , and infants in arms were huddled togetherupon the bank . Some had baskets , others wooden basins ; others again , hollow bamboo tubes ; and the vessels they carried were as various in appearance as the motley groups which now stood before me . M* jung ! m* jung ! ' ( buy insects , buy insects ! ) was now shouted out to me by a hundred voices , and I saw the whole matter clearly explained . On examining the baskets and other vessels which were eagerly opened for my inspection , what a sight was presented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wings , scales , antennie-all broken and mixed up in wild confusion . I endeavored to explain to the good people that my objects were quite misunderstood , and that such masses of broken insects were utterly useless to me . What did it signify P-they were only for medicine , and would have to be broken up at any rate . " ' - Fortune 's Residence among the Chinese , p. 60 . That the insects were articles in the English PharmacopoAa was the only rational motive which the people could discover for Mr. Fortune 's proceedings , and when he had disabused tfiem of this charitable construction they contemplated his purchase of entomological curiosities with the same sort of selfcomplacent pity that our navigators were accustomed to bestow upon the savages who bartered valuable products for a few worthless beads . The Chinese have as little objection as ourselves to profit by folly ; and having ascertained his determination to buy unmutilated insects by the head , instead of broken insects by the pound , they were not slow to adapt the supply to the demand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the double sense of the term , they considered a " drug , " rendered him popular in the district , and wherever he went the villagers invited the deluded Englishman , whose lunacy had taken a turn so lucrative to themselves , " to come in and drink tea . " His display of his accumulated treasures one day from his boat to a crowd upon the canal appears , however , to have raised their respect for his pursuits . " Can all these things have been collected here ? " was on every lip , " for many of them we have never seen , although we are natives of the place , and this is our home . " Objects which individually seemed contemptible , looked imposing in the mass , and they at least admired the sight , though they might be as far as ever from comprehending the science . A nation which will not investigate in faith , and which refuses to approach a subject of which the practical bearings are not apparent on the surface , can never penetrate far into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blossom and the flower before they can gather the fruit ; but the question still recurs , why , having carried knowledge and literature so far , the grand truths of the universe should not possess the same charm for a Chinese as for a European mind . They value such an order // of facts as that Spanish flies applied to the skin will raise a blister , and remain supremely indifferent to the wonders of creation as displayed in the construction of the animated world . What in other countries is the foible of individuals is here the undeviating characteristic of the entire mass of myriads of reading and ingenious people . Notwithstanding the importance attached to medicine by this utilitarian nation , the professors of the art have uAually been rated very low by European observers . Mr. Fortune has formed a higher opinion of their skill . Hewas attacked by fever ; and as a drowning man , he says , will catch at a straw , he sent for a native physician . Though the man was only one of those codntry Nsculapiuses who abound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intelligent manner to ascertaiti the disease , and , his inquiries completed , looked as if he understood both its nature and its cure . He dipped the knuckles of his forefingers into hot tea , and kneaded his patient under the ribs , round the back , and in various other places , nipping and dragging the skin till the subject of all this manipulation could hardly refrain from crying out . The marks remained for several weeks to testify to the severity of the operation . When the sufferer had been sufficiently pinched he was covered with blankets , and required to wash down about a hundred pills with a cup of hot tea . This formidable dose was immediately followed up by three large breakfast-cups of a warm decoction made from a variety of herbs , after which the doctor took his leave with a promise to repeat his visit on the third day , and an assurance that if the fever returned at all the next attack would be slight and final . An hour afterwards a perspiration broke out , and the relief was instantaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feverish symptoms were renewed . Mr. Fortune was once more pinched , took another hundred pills , and again drank the three howls of decoction . He had not yet drained the last cup when his body became moist , and he felt that the remedies had anticipated and beaten the fever . The pinching , we presume , was intended to stimulate the skin and assist the medicines in inducing perspiration . Whether all the materials of the decoction were operative may be doubted . The multiplicity of drugs is a common defect of prescriptions in the Vest as well as the East , but the pot.ion of the Chinaman contained at least the essential ingredients , and he showed from the first a mastery over the disease which the present state of our medical science does not often permit to its most accomplished professors . The contempt of Chinese physic has in many instances been grounded upon fanciful suppos'itions . A celebrated European doctor , in Hongkong , told Mr. Fortune in 1843 , that the natives gathered herbs indiscriminately , and administered them in the lump , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another would . They do nothing , however , of the kind . Like Europeans they probably prescribe medicines which have never been shown to be remedies , but they equally adapt the drugs to the disease , and have discovered several of undoubted efficacy . Dr. Kirk , of Shanghae , states that they have a tonic in common use which rivals , and perhaps surpasses , any which is to be found in our own pharmacopocias . M. Hue announces the far more momentous fa. *t that some of their practitioners can combat the worst cases of hydrophobia  --  a malady upon which our faculty have exhausted experiments , without ever once approximating to a cure . A peasant from the neighborhood of Pekin restored a deaf Chinese at Macao to hearing , after several French , English , and Portuguese physicians had tried upon him in vain the resources of their art . They talked learnedly on the mechanism of the ear , showed their knowledge , but did not touch the disease . The peasant gathered an herb which was considered a specific in the district where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's ears , which discharged a prodigious quantity of matter , and in two days he had completely recovered . No exertions should be spared by the resident Europeans to ascertain the real virtue of these reputed remedies , and secure the blessing for the world . It is of a piece with the usual manner in which knowledge has unaccountably stopped short with the Chinese , that , having from time immemorial been to a considerable extent intelligent practitioners of physic and extremely expert in setting fractured bones , they have never acquired the barest rudiments of that department of surgery which depends on the use of the knife . In all those cases in which European skill has gained , upon the whole , the greatest triumphs , they remain helpless spectators , and have not so much as 132 // attempted the alleviation of suffering humanity . The admirable medical missionaries , who give their services gratuitously , here shine without a rival , and exalt English science and benevolence in the eyes of their conceited and suspicious patients . Many of the injuries which come under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of the women  --  the most preposterous of all the methods contrived by the presumption of man for remodelling the form he received from the Creator . The instep is bent back upon itself , and the four smaller toes are bent down under the instep , till , in the words of M. iluc , " nothing remains at the extremity of their legs except shapeless stumps . " The sul ) port of the body is thus diminished to such a degree that the gait becomes limping , uncertain , and laborious . " Few of the Chinese women , " says iDr . Lockhart , " can walk far , and they always appear to feel pain when they try to walk quickly or on u*-even ground . " The worst result of all is that they frequently fall and break their limbs , and , in spite of the appliances of surgical skill , sometimes die from the effects . The utilitarian propensities of the Chinese might have been expected here to counteract the fancies of a perverted taste . The long nails of certain mandarins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual labor . The crippled feet have not even the recommendation of ministering to the pride of station , for it appears from the account of Mr. Fortune that the custom is nearly as prevalent among the poor as among the rich throughout the central and eastern provinces of the empire . In the southern provinces the laboring classes commonly keep the feet which God has given them . Personal appearance is the sole pretence for the distortion , and this , to eyes that have not been depraved by habit , is spoilt by the practice . " With features of more European cast than Asiatic , " says Mr. Fortune of the women of the city of Tse-kee , " and very pleasing , with a smooth , fair skin , and with a slight color in their cheeks just sufficient to indicate good health , they are almost perfect , were it not for that barbarous custom of compressing the feet . " But we must not triumph too much over Chinese admiration of deformity . What , asks M. Huc , would their ladies say if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imperceptible feet , and that it was infinitely better to have the waist of a wasp than the feet of a goat ? He evidently believes that neither would succeed in shaming the other , and that , rather than revert to nature , the fair controversialists would compromise the matter by adopting both systems at once . The veneration which the Chinese entertain for the remains of their departed relations precludes the notion of dissection , and must alone have prevented their rivalling Europeans in surgical skill . The circumstances attending their funerals are questions of absorbing interest to those who are to be the subjects of the ceremonies as well as to their friends . M. iluc was near dying in his progress through China . On his recovery the prefect of the town called upon him and paid his court by assuring the convalescent traveller that he had ordered for him , while his malady was at its height , a magnificent coffin of the first maker in Kuen-kiang-hien . M. Huc thanked him with warmth for his considerate forethought , and went to see the lodging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four enormous trunks of trees , neatly planed , colored violet , and beautifully varnished . " " Nowhere else , " he continues , " than in China could men be heard exchanging compliments about a coffin . In every country in the world people forbear to speak of this mournful object destined to contain the remains of a relation or friend . It is prepared in secret out of sight of the world , and when death enters the house the coffin is introduced by stealth to avoid aggravating the grief of a heartbroken family . The Cninese view the matter in a totally different light . In their eyes a coffin is an article of the first necessity to the dead , and of taste and luxury to the living . In the great towns they are displayed with elegant decorations in magnificent shops , and carefully painted , varnished , and polished in order to allure the passers-by and induce them to buy . People in easy circumstances always in fact provide themselves beforehand with one to their fancy , and until the time arrives for lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome piece of furniture of which the utility is not immediate , hut which can not fail to be a consoling and agreeable object in a handsomely decorated apartment . The coffin above all is considered an excellent method for children in a decent rank to show the intensity of their filial piety to the authors of their being . It is a great consolation to a son to be able to 133 // TRAVELS IN CHINA . purchase a coffin for an old father or mother , they attach immense importance . Cemeand make a solemn offering of it when they teries are not customary with them , but each least expect it . When we love we are always *4mily provides its own resting-place in the ingenious in contriving agreeable surprises , best situation it can command . Monk Lewis , If a person is not sufficiently favored by for- qwq // of the bones which compose the human frame , that they might be satisfied , by a comparison with the inventory , that not a frrgment was left behind . This supposes some knowledge of the skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , with a view to such occurrences . Sir John Davis once saw an old man , on an occasion of the kind , who had the entire catalogue by heart , and who , as he drew forth each hone wrote down its name on a slip of paper . " I was once or twice , " says Mr. Fortune , " in the wild mountain districts in the interior at the time when the natives visited the tombs . Even the most retired parts had their visitors , and it was both pleasing and affecting to see the little groups assembled round the graves , paying the tribute of affection to those whose memory they revered and loved . The widow was seen kneeling by the grave of her lost husband ; children , often very young , shedding tears of sorrow for a father or mother ; and sometimes an old man , whose hair was white with age , was there mourning the loss of those whom he had looked to as the support of his declining years . " M. Hue maintains that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , " are completely destitute of affection , and have no conception of that union of hearts in which each shares in the joys and griefs of the other . " The filial allegiance , which is still so strong in them , he believes to have been originally founded upon genuine feeling ; but the feeling he contends has died out , *md nothing remains except a formal h'abit , enforced by the fear of the bamboo . Men and women may shed abundance of water in the form of tears ; they may groan and sigh , and seem inconsolable ; but the whole is a lying representation , and merely an example of their prodigious talent for dissimulation . Mr. Fortune , on the contrary , believes that there is as much genuine sorrow amongst the Chinese for the loss of relatives as amongst ourselves , and that parents dote upon children , and children love and reverence their parents . Whether we consider the character of the witness or the nature of the evidence , his testimony is , in our opinion , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apostolic *Iissionary , as he calls himself , like all persons of his intolerant persuasion , judges mankind by their views of popery , which is far from being in good odor at present with the Chinese people . Because they refuse to favor Roman Catholicism , he denies that they have any religion whatever ; or that there is the faintest trace of morality among them , because they are not attracted by the morality of the Jesuits . Even if he had not written with the deep prejudice of a disappointed partisan , his evidence can not extend beyond the narrow sphere of his individual observation , and must be qualified by wellauthenticated instances of an opposite character . Especially this must be the case when his assertions outrage probability . That nature should be entirely dead in three hundred millions of people , who keep up the forms of love and tenderness-that they should all conspire to mimic a virtue of which none of them can frame an idea-that they should be one vast hive of hypocrisy , without any portion of the community possessing tbose better notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity for the hypocrisy-that the very mothers should be destitute of the instinctive affection for their offspring which is vouchsafed to the fiercest of the brute creation-that every emotion , in a word , of man for man , should be utteriy extinct in a civilized nation throughout the whole length and breadth of the land ,  --  is an anomaly , an unprecedented monstrosity which we should not credit upon the asseveration of a hundred M. Hucs . His own book refutes him . He states that the Chinese believe that the worst stages of sickness are caused by the temporary absence of the soul , which is hovering near preparatory to its final flight . They imagine that it its possible to induce it to return by entreaties , and will sometimes run hither and thither , addressing to it the most moving suppliestions . If petitions fail , they have recourse to violence . They shout in the surrounding premises , they let off crackers , they push with their hands . M. Huc was witness to one of these scenes . A son , the pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the last stage of a decline . The Apostolic Missionary heard the prayers , the sobs , the clamors of those who were engaged in pursuit of the fugitive soul . " The scene , " he says , " would have been truly laughable and amusing if we had not known that there was question of a numerous family in expectation of a frightful calamity , and a prey to the most cruel anguish . The voices of those little 135 // children and that old man , invoking with piercing cries the soul of a father and a son , was something heart-rending . " If there is such anxiety to stay the retreating spirit-if there is such violent grief , which M. Huc himself allows to he real , in anticipation of a possible death-why must the tears shed for the death itself be ui*redeemed hypocrisy P Let whoever can suppose that the misery at the apprehended loss is solely raised by the fear of diminished prosperity-that it is pure material selfishness , unmitigated by one spark of personal affection-still the affliction itself is genuine ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears for the dead are almost invariably deceptive , and that those who give vent to them are Qnly adroit performers of woe . Death in China , as elsewhere , must eater innumerable houses without being attended by sorrow . Though the English are noted for the strength of their domestic attachments , Swift maintained that the happiest faces were to he seen in mourning coaches . The particular in which Chinese affection has been supposed to be lowest is in the feelings of fathers for their daughters . " The mother who is happiest in her girls , " says a Chinese maxim , " is she who has only boys . " The strong desire to perpetuate their race in the male line is one reason of their preference for sons , and another is the comparative helplessness of women in earning a livelihood . The pleasure , moreover , of female conversation , which is the most refined and highest charm of our society , loses many of its delights with them in consequence of their neglect to educate their girls . In a country where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much versed in either accomplishment . That this indicates a false and unworthy notion of the capacities of women is undeniable ; but we suspect that we are prone to exaggerate the contempt in which they are held , and that in the upper classes , at least , their condition is the result of a more marked division than is usual with us of the attributes of the sexes , rather than from a complete disdain of feminine qualities . The Chinese simply carry the notion of Milton to excess " For contemplation he , and valor , form 'd ; For softness she , and sweet attractive grace . " M. Hue , indeed , asserts that " the birth of a daughter is generally regarded as a family humiliation and dishonor  --  a sure evidence of curse of Heaven ; " but Mr. Meadows , an uner*eptionable witness , completely disposes of this extravagant libel . " I have seen hundreds of fathers walking about with such little dishonors and curses in their arms , handsomely dressed and prattling away . to the pleased and proud papas. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sufferings , the privations , the contempt , all the sorrows and disgraces which commence at their cradle , accompany them mercilessly to their tomb ; " but this dreary life of unbroken woe did not prevent Mr. Fortune from finding them as apparently light-hearted as they were certainly merry and talkative . Nor does the affliction which , according to M. Hue , perpetually attends them , distract their minds from the same love of dress and petty vanities which occupy the serener thoughts of their sex in Europe . The misery which is amused with toys , and wears the outward form of mirth , can not be very overwhelming . In the houses of the wealthy the women do not mingle in male society , but this isolation does not extend to the lower and middle orders , and even in the class immediately below the highest the seclusion is far from rigid . Mr. Fortune used to observe them peeping at him from behind windows and doors , till curiosity conquering bashfulness they entered the room and stood watching him from a little distance . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm , but soon came back . The only occasion on which he appears to have inspired any real terror was in the case of a young lad , who after looking at him for some time said to his father , " If I go near him , will he bite me The destruction of female infants M. Hue himself admits to be the act of such degraded portions of the population as are to be found in every community ; and says , in total inconsistency with many of his statements , " that we are not to suppose that the Chinese are barbarians , deaf to the voice of nature , who sport with the lives of the beings to whom they have given birth . " Poverty is the usual motive for child-murder . Though the crime is considered to be more frequent than in Europe , no certain information exists on the subject , and some of the grounds for the supposition were derived from false evi 136 // dence or mistaken inferences . It was affirmed that numerous corpses of infants were to be met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were devoured by dogs and pigs . In a country intersected with canals , and where millions of the population reside with their families in floating ho uses upon the water , many , no doubt , had been drowned accidentally . M. Hue , however , declares that , having traversed China for ten sears , he never set eyes upon the body of a single child , and where the case occurs he believes that the death is usually natural , and that the remains , wrapped in a mat , are consigned to the water or laid by the road because the parents have not the means to pay for the sepulture . There is not the same consideration for the bodies of the young as of adults . Mr. Fortune frequently found their coffins piled together in stacks , and M. Hue states that deep wells , into which quick lime is thrown from time to time , are constructed at the public expense for the purpose of receiving all the dead children who may be brought . Notwithstanding the subordinate position of Chinese women , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degenerate from the most self-willed specimens of the sex in Europe , and talked considerably louder and faster than the men . Although if the account of M. Iluc is to be received , they must be the most philosophic females , not to say the most cheerful martyrs , that the world ever saw , their patience and hilarity have no effect in keeping their tempers in check . On the contrary , the violence of their rage produces a novel species of hysterics , which , before its harmlessness is known , might be turned to excellent account by the ladies in our part of the world . One of these fits was witnessed by Mr. Fortune in a bamboo forest , where two men were cutting down some trees which they had bought . They had just felled a particularly fine specimen which was not marked for sale , and the wife of the proprietor , observing the mistake , came hastily up " She commenced first in low short sentences to lament the loss of the bamboo , then louder and louder sentence after sentence rolled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate men for their conduct . At last she seemed to have worked herself up to a frantic state of excitement ; she threw off her head-dress , tore her hair , and screamed so loud that she might have been heard for more than a mile . Her passion reached the climax at last , and human nature could stand it no longer . With an unearthly yell and a sort of hysteric gulp she tumbled backwards on the ground , threw her little feet in the air , gave two or three kicks , and all was still . Up to this point I had been rather amused than otherwise ; but as she lay perfectly still and foamed at the mouth , I became alarmed . The poor men had been standng all this time hanging their heads and looking as sheepish as possible . I now looked round to see what effect this state of things had on them . They both shrugged their shoulders , laughed , and went on with their work . About a quarter of an hour afterwards I came back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying on the ground , but apparently recovering . I raised her and begged her to sit up , which she did with a melancholy shake of the head ; hut she either could not or would not speak . In a little while afterwards I saw her rise np.and walk slowly and quietly home . Such scenes are very common in the country . These Chinese termagants work themselves up into passions for very slight things , and their unpreeations and curses are quite fearful . Many of them stop short , and get pacified before they reach the climax . " - Fortune ' . s Besidence in China , p. 100 . When Mr. Fortune 's ear had got accustomed to the changes which were rung in the progress of these storms , he could tell , without entering the house , whether the fit was at its commencement , middle , or end . The husband was sometimes the object of the termagant 's wrath , and more than enough appears to show that it is not the wives alone that are deserving of compassion . M. Hue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abused , and next pelted each other . Their last resource was to try which of the two could prove most provoking by breaking all the articles in the house . While the shrew was venting her rage upon the crockery in the kitchen , the man seized a large paving-stone in the court . The neighbors , misinterpreting his intentions , rushed forward to prevent bloodshed , but his malice was directed against a large iron pot which he stove in at a blow . * Though frays will some- * The turn which M. Huc gives to this anecdote is an instance of the absurd inferences to which he is led by his prejudiees . " Interest , he eays , is often the sole motive which limits the harshoces of the chinese towards their wives . If they treat them with moderation , it is on a principle of economy , as people spare a horse 137 // times take the same turn with the lower orders among ourselves , the work of destruction is usually confined to the husband , and is seldom ventured on by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deference which is shown to women in England ; but they can take their own part , and there is many a man , we suspect , in the Celestial Empire who finds that his helpmate is the better half . In all countries it is the worst temper that governs , whether it chances to be of the masculine or feminine gender . In nothing does M. Hue give a more unfavorable report of the Chinese than with respect to their moral conduct . In gambling , debauchery , and drunkenness they have never , he says , been surpassed by any nation , and to these vices he ascribes the principal part of their pauperism . Again Mr. Fortune gives evidence on the other side : " The Chinese as a nation are a quiet and sober race ; their disturbances , when they have them , are unusually noisy , but they rarely come to blows , and drunkenness is almost unknown in the country districts , and rare even in densely populated cities . In these respects the lower orders in China contrast favorably with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drunkenness proclaims itself , and by no possibility could Mr. Fortune , in his extensive wanderings , have mistaken excessive intemperance for peculiar sobriety . One form of intoxication , it is true , is largely on the increase-that which arises from the smoking of opium , though all who indulge in it do not employ it to excess . A few weeks ' abuse of this seducing drug reduces its victim to a skeleton . The cheek-bones seem to be piercing the pale skin , which acquires a glassy polish , and the breathing becomes quick and disturbed . From wild excitement the smoker , as he conbecause it costs money , and because if it is killed it must he replaced . This hideous calculation is by no means chimerical in china . " He gives the sequel of the story we have borrowed from him in proof of this position . A bystander said to the husband with a smile , " You are silly , my brother ; instead of breaking the pot with the paving-stone , why did you not break your wife 's bead ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I tkought of that , " answered the husband , " but it would have been foolish . I can get my kettle mended for two hundred cesh , and it would cost no small sum to buy another wife . " *Such replies , " concludes II . Liuc , " are not at all surprising to those who know the Chinese . " What is really surprising is , that M. line should mistake a transparent jest for what he calls " a hideous calculation . " In his eager desire to establish the brutality of the Chinese he forgets that murder in China is punished with death , and that he who killed one wife would not survive to purchase another sumes pipe after pipe , passes into a state of smiling and idiotic languor , and from thence into slumber . When once the habit is acquired it is never , given up . " His days , " says Mr. Fortune of one of these miserable beings , " were evidently numbered , and yet , strange to tell , this man tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that the use of opium was indispensable to his health . " Gambling is rife among all orders , high and low , in China ; and Mr. Fortune describes the eager interest with which the poor stop at stalls to throw dice for oranges , sweetmeats , and other trifles ; but some of the details recorded by M. Hue can hardly be credited till they are confirmed by a more trustworthy observer . He represents them , when they have lost their money , as staking their houses , fields , wives , and clothes . Their garments lost , they are turned naked out of the gambling-house in the midst of winter , and the cold in the north sets them running like madmen . " They lie against the chimneys , which in these countries are constructed at the'ground level along the walls of the houses . They endeavor to warm themselves a little , sometimes on one side , sometimes on the other , while their comrades look on and indulge in atrocious mirth . This horrible spectacle does not last long , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who fall down and die . The others then go back to the house and resume their game with fearful unconcern . " But the most extraordinary statement of M. Hue is , that they sometimes play for their fingers . A sharp little hatchet is produced along with the dice and cards , and at the termination of each game the winner chops off one of the fingers of the loser . As the run of luck camnot be all on the same side , it is inconceivable that anybody should find such exquisite pleasure in cutting off the fingers of his neighbor as to be willing to purchase the luxury at the cost of his own . Ten fingers are soon gone , and the momentary satisfaction iriust be bought by weeks of pain during the healing of the stump , and the still severer penalty of being incapacitated for life from playing any more . Nay , the victims of this bloody game , unable to work or even to feed and dress themselves , must often perish by a lingering death from poverty and neglect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // incredulity ; but he is conscious on the present occasion that he is drawing largely upon the faith of his readers . M. Huc allows that there is an air of decorum in Chinese manners which might deceive a superficial observer ; but he affirms that a closer view shows that the plausible exterior is only a mask for the vilest libertinism . Vice will always court concealment , and in every nation the appearance must be better than the reality . Nor can a heathen country be expected to vie in morals with a Christian land . Yet in this particular , as in every other which relates to the feelings and conduct of the natives , NI . Hue has been guilty of the fault , which he denounces in previous writers , of ascribing to the whole what is only true of a part . He might with equal justice assert that there were few healthy peo* ple in the empire because he had met with many who were sick . A disposition to lie and cheat appears to be the failing which most easily besets a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the Chinese creates a notion that there is more difference than really exists in essential things . M. Hue has drawn an amusing and impartial picture of the figure which we and they present to the eyes of each other " The Europeans who go to China are disposed to think the inhabitants of the Celestial Empire odd and ridiculous ; the Chinese who visit Canton and Macao return the compliment . They exhaust their caustic and mocking vein upon the appearance of the Western devils , express unutterable astonishment at the sight of their scanty garments , their close-fitting pantaloons , their prodigious round hats in the shape of a chimney , their shirt-collars , which appear devised to saw the ears , and which so gracefully surround their grotesque faces with the long nose and blue eyes , without beard or moustache , but which display in compensation on each jaw a handful of red and frizzled hair . They are puzzled , above all , by the shape of the dresscoat . They endeavor , without success , to account for that strange habiliment which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it meet on the chest , and because the tails which hang down behind are entirely wanting in front . They admire the exquisite and refined taste of wearing at the back large buttons like coins without having anything to button to them . How* much more beautiful do they think themselves , with their oblique , narrow , black eyes , high cheek-bones , 139 nose the shape of a chestnut , and shaven head adorned with a magnificent tail which reaches to the heels ! Add to this graceful and elegant type a conical hat covered with red fringe , an ample tunic with large sleeves . black satin boots with white soles of an enormous thickness , and it is beyond dispute that a European can *iever rival a Chinese . But it is chiefly in their habits of life that they assume to be so much our superiors . When they see Europeans spending several hours in gymnastic promenades , they ask if it is not a more civilized mode of passing leisure time to sit quietly drinking tea and smoking a pipe , or else to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger portion of the night at balls and parties has never occurred to them . All the Chinese , even among the upper ranks , begin to sleep in time to be able to rise with the sun . At the hours in which there is the greatest stir and tumult in the principal cities of Europe , those of China enjoy the most profound repose . Every one has gone home to his family , all the shops are shut , the boatmen , the mountebanks , the public readers have finished their labors , and there are no signs of activity , except among the theatres for the working classes , who have no leisure but at night to enjoy the sight of a play . " - Huc 's " L'Empire Chinoi.s* , " tom . ii . p. 122 . Most of these circumstances are only the garnish of life , and do not affect its substance . Fashions are so arbitrary , that one in its own nature is seldom more extraordinary than another ; and they seem ludicrous or rational according as they are strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gives an account of a gentlem an who determined to live and dress according to the rules of common sense , and was soon shut up in a lunatic asykm in consequence . When M. Hue arrived at the port of Canton , after ha*ing lost sight of Europeans , his first glimpse of three gentlemen in black hats , white trowsers , white waistcoats , and white jackets , had such an effect upon him , that he no longer wondered that Orientals unaccustomed to the vision should burst out laughing . In so far as tastes admit of argument , . the Chinese costume will not lose by the comparison . Their pigtails are not less ornamental than the tails of our half-garments , even with the aid of the two decorative buttons at our waist . An eminent classical scholar in this country contrived a dress which had no other fastening than a single button behind . He advertised his invention by wearing it himself in the // streets of London . The people , struck by his singular appearance , stoped to gaze at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions , " Look at that man with only one button . " Upon this he invariably wheeled round , and , pointing to their backs , said , " Look at those men with Two buttons . " The absurdity of these strange appendages always seemed instantly to flash upon their minds , and with an abashed countenance they grew grave at the retort . In the most important particular of all , the Celestial inhabitants are vastly our inferiors . " The great sin , " says Sir John Davis , " of the Chinese costume is the paucity of white linen , and consequently of washing . Even their body-garment is sometimes a species of light silk , but capable of purification . " They have no sheets to their bed , and the want of cleanliness is a common cause of disease of the skin . The Chinese dogs , who never fail to bark at foreigners , appear to distinguish them by their dress , for when Mr. Fortune went habited as a native they ceased to give tongue , though they had continued pertinaciously to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NI . Hue , who believes that he passed everywhere for a genuine Chinaman , was yelped at , on the contrary , through all the provinces he traversed . Every nation , he says , in explanation , has its peculiar smell . That of the Chinese partakes of the nature of musk , and they in their turn detect a distinctive odor in Europeans , though more delicate than that of any other people with which they are acquainted . The noses of the dogs could not * be less acute than those of their masters : and M. Hue supposes that they knew him by the same indications that they discriminate the track of game and vermin . The Chinese rely more upon their dress for warmth than is usual with us : " They can not imagine , " says Mr. Fortune , " how the Europeans can exist with the thin clothing they generally go about in . When the weather was cold I used always to wear a stout , warm , great-coat above my other dress , and yet the Chinese were continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that surely I must feel cold . Their mode of keeping themselves comfortable in winter differs entirely from ours . They rarely or never think of using fires in their rooms for this purpose , but , as the cold increases , they just put on another jacket or two , until they feel that the warmth of their bodies is not carried off faster than it is generated . As the raw , damp cold of morning gives way to the genial rays of noon , the upper coats are one by one thrown off until evening , when they are again put on . In the spring months the upper garments are cast off ' by degrees , and , when the summer arrives , the Chinese are found clad in their dresses of cotton , or the grass-cloth mauufactured in the country . In the northern towns the ladies sometimes use a small brass stove , like a little oval basket , having the lid grated to allow the charcoal to burn and the heat to escape ; this they l ) laee upon their tables or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feet . Nurses also carry these little stoves in their hands under the Yeet of the children . Such , however , is the thickness and warmth of their dresses , that it is only in the coldest weather they require them . Little children in winter are so covered up , that they look like bundles of clothes nearly as broad as they are long , and when the padding is removed in warm weather , it is difficult to imagine that you see before you the same individuals . " The prodigality of clothing is rendered the more necessary by that aversion of the Chinese , of which M. Hue speaks , for " gymnastic promenades . " The most patient , industrious , and persevering of mankind , where there is an object to be gained , exertion without profit is a notion they can not comprehend . To watch Europeans recreating themselves , by pacing up and down with the activity of travellers hurrying to a goal , is a spectacle which raises in them the same emotions with which Cowper contemplated the barren speculations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say I , From reveries so airy , from the toil Of dropping buckets into empty wells , And growing old in drawing nothing * Mr. Fortune and some English friends , who went up the country by canal from Ningpo , were accustomed to get out from the boat when tired of sitting , and walk awhile upon the bank . " Is it not strange* " they heard a Chinese say , " that these people prefer walking when they have a boat as well as ourselves ? " The reason for this singular propensity was discussed by the bystanders , but the only solution they . could hit upon was " that it was our nature to do so . " Among the circumstances in which the Chinese surpass , in their own estimation , the barbarians of the West , politeness occupies a 140 // conspicuous place . Our forms of speech compared to theirs are like the rude blasts of the north compared to the softest breath of the gentle south . Mr. Fortune went to s**e the garden of the merchant Howqua , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " earnest and careful notices , " as they were termed , were put up about the grounds to warn visitors against doing mischief and committing depredations . Several fine fruittrees lined the walks , ' and these were the words in which strangers were requested not to steal the produce ,  --  " Ramblers here will be excused plucking the fruit on this tree . " In a summer-house , called the " Hall of Fragrant Plants , " the language was more urgent : " Those who come here to saunter about are earnestly prayed not to pluck the fruit or flowers , in order that the beauty of the place may be preserved . " This by itself was too blunt and plain-spoken for a Chinese , and was therefore qualified by the addition , " We beg persons who understand this notice to excuse it . " Their acts do not quite keep pace with the overflowing courtesy of their speech . The essence of good manners is in the preference for others in the smaller affairs of life-in a petty benevolence reduced to rule and enforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality in many . The rules are defective in proportion as the civility is barren . Tried by this test , the Chinese are not much in advance of ourselves . They give you , says M. Hue , the most pressing invitations , but it is on condition that you refuse them . The native Christians of a Roman Catholic station in the north went one saint 's day to attend service in a chapel attached to the house of a catechist . The service ended , the catechist pressed the whole of the congregation , which was numerous , to stay and dine with him . Everyone replied to his entreaties by an excuse . With an air of mortification at the repeated reftisals , he at last cau* , ht hold of a cousin , and begged him , by the tics of relationship , to remain . The cousin pleaded business , and , after a protracted contest of earnest requests and peremptory denials , the catechist proceeded to use force , and endeavored to drag his refractory relation into the house . " If , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , at least come in and drink a cup of wine . " The cousin consented to this compromise . After sitting long , and no wine appearing , he yentured to inquire when it was likely to be brought in . " Wine ! wine ! " said his astonished host ; " do you suppose I have any wine here P and do you not know that I never drink wine , since it gives me the stomachache 9 " " Then , why , " replied his guest , " did you not let me *o , instead of insisting on my coming in P The question threw the catechist into a rage . He abused his cousin for an ignorant ho or , asked him where he had learnt manners , and with cutting sarcasm exclaimed , " What ! I do you the civility to invite you to drink wine , and you have not the courtesy to decline ! " NI . line , who witnessed the scene , speculates upon the motives for the usage , and comes to the conclusion that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everybody ; while all , on the other hand , are flattered by receiving warm invitations and by their own delicacy in refusing them . These are matters in which people like to be duped , notwithstanding their inward consciousness that they are deceived . In visiting a Chinese a profusion of low bows pass on either side . In the receptionrooms of the wealthy there are two raised seats , one of which is considered the seat of honor . The host presses it upon the visitor , the visitor upon the host ; and the eonflict of courtesy will sometimes continue for several minutes . At dinners they think with Lady Macbeth that " sauce to meat is ceremony . " " In this case , " says Mr. Fortune , " it is not only the host who is begging the guests to occupy the most honorable seats , hut the guests themselves are also pressing the favored places upon each other . " Hence there is much sitting down and getting up again , every body agreeing to depreciate himself and exalt his neighbor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one occasion , when Mr. Fortune was a guest , nearly a quarter of an hour . The peculiarities of the dinner itself have been well summed up by M. Hoc : " A real , Chinese dinner can not appear otherwise than strange to an unreflecting foreigner who imagines that there can only exist one method of living among all the nations in the world . To begin with desert and finish with soups  --  to drink wine hot and smoking out of small porcelain cups-to employ two little sticks instead 01 a fork to take up the food , which is brought to the table ready cut into mouthfuls  --  to use , in-141 // stead of napkins , little squares of soft cob ored paper , of which a supply is placed by the side of each guest , and which a servant carries away as they are done with  --  to leave your place between the courses to smoke or amuse yourself  --  to raise your chopsticks to your forehead and lay them upon your cup to announce to the company that you have finished your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Chinese , on their part , never get over their surprise when they see us at table , and they inquire how it is that we can swallow our drinks cold , and how we came by the singular and extravagant idea of making use of a trident to convey our food to our mouths , at the risk of running it into our lips or our eyes . They think it very odd that our nuts and almonds are served in their shells , and that the servants do not take the trouble to peel the fruit , and cut out the hones from the meat . Though they are not very nice about the nature of their food , and relish fritters of silkworms and preserved tadpoles , they can not understand the predilection of our epicures for a high pheasant , or a cheese which has all the movements of an animated being . " - Huc 's " L'E*pire Chinois , " tom . i. p. 216 . At a dinner which was attended by Captain Laplace of the French navy , salted earthworms formed part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiding guests ate them without a suspicion of the truth . The nests which the Chinese purchase at a high price and boil with other ingredients into soup belong to a species of swallow in the island of Java . What are the materials used by the birds in the construction of these delicacies is a disputed question . Some say they are composed of fish-spawn , others of the scum of the sea , others of plants ; but , if Bishop Stanley is right in the opinion he gives in his delightful " History of Birds , " those who have partaken of the soup had better remain in ignorance of its essence . Salted earthworms would he preferable . Yet it can not be denied that there is nothing in which nations are more capricious than in their adoption and rejection of articles of diet . A Chinese cook in the service of a European at Macao sent up a dish of snipes without the trail . Host and guests of whom M. Hue was one , rated him , for his ignorance , and told* him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could not he pardoned twice . A few days afterwards he had to dress some birds which were not snipes , TRAVELS IN CHINA . and was careful to preserve their precious contents . He was dismissed , despairing ever to comprehend the culinary code of Europe. *ns , and wondering as much at the gross tasf which could venture upon the entrails a bird as we of the West can marvel at the Chinese relish for earthworms . Frogs are esteemed throughout the empire . They are brought to town in tubs or baskets ; and the frogmonger , in the intervals between serving his customers , chops off the heads of the animals and draws off their skins . They are sold , like every thing in China , by weight . Mr. Fortune and M. Huc agree in the opinion that the Chinese have a singular aptitude for cookery . " You have only , " says the latter , " to take the first man that comes , and after a few days ' practice he will acquit himself of his duties to a miracle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their means ; a single iron saucepan is the sole implement they require for executing the most difficult combinations . " The national predilection is for made dishes more after the manner of the French than the English . The humblest peasant is expert in concocting savory messes out of the simplest materials . A Chinaman , Mr. Fortune states , would starve upon what used , and perhaps continues , to be the harvest diet of Scottish laborers-milk and porridge for breakfast and supper , and bread and beer for dinner . The tea-makers whom he took over to India could not live upon the salt-beef and biscuit of our English sailors . They had a private store of articles with which at small expense they compounded dishes that gratified the palate as well as appeased hunger . The entertainments of the Chinese are very protracted . A private dinner at which Mr. Fortune was present in Shangene having continued for three hours , he inquired of a linguist who sat next him when it would end . " 0 , " was the reply , " it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to go away you can do so now . " The hundreds of little dishes which appear in succession are less the cause of the excessive time which is spent at the table than the unceremonious habit of intermingling eating with recreation and smoking . A play was proceeding in the dining-room during the whole of the meal , and smoking in China never stops . Men , women , and children live with pipes in their // mouths . The laborer smokes in the fields , the clerk at his desk , the traveller on horseback . " If , " says M. Hoc , " a person wakes in the night , he lights his pipe . " The most certain sign that a sick man is about to expire is that he ceases to inhale the fumes of tobacco . Upon this he expends his latest breath ; and the native Christians who came to summon M. line to administer the sacraments to the dying always said in proof of the desperateness of the case- " He no longer smokes . " Of all the distinctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which we should suppose the advantage was more with ourselves than in the use of knives and forks instead of two slender sticks . But Mr. Fortune , who is equally expert in the use of both , decides in favor of the sticks . With dishes prepared in the Chinese fashion it would be almost impossible to pierce the dainty morsels with a fork , whereas " the smallest fra0ment , even to a single grain of rice , can be picked up with perfect ease " by those who have learned to handle the magic little implements which daily convey the food to the mouths of three hundred millions of people . " No article in use amongst ourselves , " adds Mr. Fortune , " could supply their place . Excepting the fingers , nature 's own invention , nothing is so convenient as the chopsticks . " The cold drinks , which are the abhorrence of the Chinese , might be presumed grateful to any palate in the sultry season , but , whatever may be the demerits of warm wine , Mr. Fortune maintains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything half so refreshing on a hot summer day ; I mean pure as the Chinese drink it , without sugar and milk . It is far better than either wine or beer . It quenches thirst , is a gentle stimulant , and wards off many of the fevers incident to such a climate . " Cowper described it perfectly when he called it the herb " which cheers but not inebriates . " Another custom , which at first found little favor with either M. Hue or Mr. Fortune , they discovered upon experience to be exceedingly agreeable . Towels , from which hot water has been wrung out , are brought round in trays after meals , and each of the guests wipes his face with the reeking cloth . The same proces* is gone through after journeys . It is , in fact , the Chinese mode of washing , and , though not the most effectual , Mr. Fortune pronounces it far more refreshing than cold 143 bathing to a person who is hot and tired with walking . The natives rarely use soap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passion with every soul in the empire . In towns they are going on at all hours of the day and night , and are frequent at every village in the country . The Chinese who emigrated to California could not dispense with their gambling-houses and theatre , and the performances at the latter in San Francisco continued without intermission through the twenty-four hours . The actors in their native land are mostly strollers who travel from place to place , and are hired either by rich individuals or by a certain number of people in the district , who club together to defray the expense . A temporary theatre is frequently run up for the occasion  --  a simple business , since there is no scenery ; " and a table , a few chairs , and a covered platform are all that is needed . " The dresses , however , are splendid . Women are not permitted to perform , but the boys who personate the female parts deceive the eyes and ears of foreigners who are ignorant of the usage . The spectators are in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing for the privilege , flock by thousands to the sight . The dense crowds of human heads reminded *Ir . Fortune of the mobs which collect before the hustings at an English election . Talking and smoking go on freely , and the vendors of eatables cry their goods . The actors recite their speeches in a singing falsetto voice-a " sing-song " is the European name for the performance  --  and seemed to Mr. Fortune to set nature at defiance . The plays themselves , which are partly in prose , partly in lyric verse , equally violate probability ; nor is there much attempt at developing character , manners , or sentiment . The Chinese drama is believed to be the earliest in existence , and in accordance with the rule which pervades nearly all their intellectual efforts , having brought it to a point which appeared to render the progress to perfection inevitable , they came to a dead stop , and have left it in the same imperfect state to which it had attained several centuries ago . Much as plays are the delight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect for the authors of the pieces . Their utilitarian propensities lead them to keep their veneration for the literature which instructs , such as grave works on // history and morals , while the literature which amuses , such as novels and poetry , brings no fame . To such an extent is this carried that , according to M. Hue , the writers of fiction never dream of putting their names to their finest productions . " In China people read pretty much as they walk in a beautiful garden for recreation . They admire the arrangement of the walks , the verdure , the trees , the splendor and variety of the flowers , but they come away without having bestowed a thought on the gardener or even inquired his name . " This is the more singular , that they are so far from being indifferent to the entertainment which their lighter literature affords that they devour it greedily , and are beyond doubt a merry people , who love to laugh and make laugh . Their low esteem for works of imagination does not prevent their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fans . Quotations from authors , indeed , are put up everywhere . Upon public and private buildings , upon shops and temples , innumerable choice fragments invite the casual spectator to read and learn . " Enter into the poorest house , " says M. Hue , " in the most miserable village , and though you will often find complete destitution and a want of the commonest necessaries of life , you will be sure to see some beautiful maxims written upon scrolls of red paper . China might , in a sense , be called one enormous library . " These maxims are frequently admirable either for the sagacity of the thought or the felicity of the expression . Of the specimens which follow , the first two are from the " China ' * of Sir John lllavis , * the rest are from M. Hue : " Early l ) referment makes a lazy genius . Great wealth comes by destiny ; moderate wealth by industry .

When men meet they listen to one another ; women and girls look at each other . * Of this excellent work , by far the best and most comprehensive which exists on the entire subject of the manners , productions , and institutions of china , we gave a full account on its first appearance ; ud it is only necessary to add now that the history of English intercourse with the Celestial Empire has been continued in successive editions , and is brought down in that which has just appeared to the breaking out of the pre* at war . TRAVELS IN CHINA . The dog in ' the kennel barks at his fleas ; the dog who hunts does not feel them . Great minds have wills ; others have only wishes . Ore day is worth three to him who does everything in its order . Who is the greatest liar . * He who talks most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instruction , there is a large class of persons who traverse the empire and read to the people passages from the history of their country accompanied with comments . These readers are said by M. Hue to be also *xeellent speakers , and they are listened to by the crowds who throng round them with eager attention . They have no other pay than the gratuities they collect from their hearers . Works in China appear to be treated with more eonslderation tllan those who produce them . Unsaleable books are not used for waste paper , and no Celestial scribbler runs the risk which beset the English author in the days of Grub Street of having his butter , cheese , and bacon served out to him in a le of his own last pamphlet . The very children among the Chinese are taught to avoid treading upon a piece of paper which has anything written or printed on it . M. Hue is of the opinion that no superstitious idea is attached to the practice , but that it proceeds purely from uiverence to the productions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , with the exception of the nine-storied pagodas , which are graeeful objects . They are nearly all in decay , for since the great wall there has been little erected which was intended to last . Sir Christopher Wren said that he built for eternity . The Chinaman builds for his own generation . The most ancient and unchangeable nation in the world , they are themselves the records of the past , and have neither asicient monuments nor ancestral halls . Their most populous places have no individual features of interest , and the uniformity of their streets and shops renders it difficult for a stranger to distinguish one town from another . The habit of confining their houses , when practicable , to a ground-floor , excludes grandeur of elevation nor is there any attempt to obtain an effect from general beauty of form except in the elegant curve of the roofs . But little as they aim at excellence of design , the l ) ro // fusion of carving , and the rich colors with which they decorate pillars , friezes , and every available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air to their best abodes . Here , as in everything else , the spectator wonders to find so much , and yet to find no more . * The works of Mr. Fortune are full of interesting details on the botanical productions of China . The mow-chok , the most beautiful bamboo in the world , is peculiar to this country . It attains to its full height of from sixty to eighty feet in a few months , and Mr. Fortune , who was in the habit of measuring its daily growth in the Chinese woods , found that it shot up from two to two and a half feet in twenty-four hours . Unlike the bushy bamboo of India , with its large joints and branches throughout its stem , the mow-chok usually presents a bare surface for thirty feet from the ground . The freedom from knots and the fineness of its structure render the wood of great importance in the arts . Indeed the number of uses to which this plant can be put is surprising . When it first shoots from the soil it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortune found it excellent , and during the time it was in season had it for dinner every day . The interior portion of the stem is beaten into pulp for paper , the exterior is slit into strips for the weaving of ropes , baskets , and sieves . Ornamental inlaid work is constructed from it , and the entire pole , from its combined lightness and strength , answers every purpose for which poles can be employed . Mr. Fortune has done the service of introducing this invaluable variety into India , and it is now growing on the slopes of the Himalaya . The disputed question of whether black and green tea were the products of different plants , has been finally settled by Mr. Fortune . Though there are two species , one called by botanists Thea boleea , after some mountains in China , and the other Thea yindir , yet it is a mistake to suppose that black tea alone is made from the first , and green tea from the second . Both sorts are made alike from each  --  the inferior teas from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finer kinds from the viridis . The difference in the color depends solely on the mode of preparation . The leaves for the green tea , being roasted almost immediately after they are gathered , and dried off very quickly , retain more of their natural hue , while the black teas owe their color to longer exposure to the air , and to being more slowly dried . The finer descriptions of both are made from the young leaves when they first unfold themselves in spring ; butt the best kinds manufactured are too lightly fired to bear a voyage , being spoilt by the slightest damp , and can never be tasted out of the country . The scented teas owe their flavor to being mixed , when perfectly dry , with the fresh-gathered flowers of the orange or some other odoriferous plant , and after twenty-four hours the dry tea has absorbed the fragrance of the moist flowers , which are then sifted out . The Chinese exercise their ingenuity in giving to the coarser samples of their staple commodity the appearance of the most esteemed sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English merchants on the spot understand their business too well to be deceived , and are too honest for the most part to deceive . More than this L not to be attained . With adulterations of every description at home , it is wild to suppose that commodities abroad will be kept in their pristine purity , or that arascally Chinaman will not be able to find a rascally foreigner to conspire with him in cheating the public beyond the seas . Tea does not form a meal in China , but is drunk at all hours and upon all occasions ; and when it is remembered that the entire poor of our own country contrive to procure it , we perceive how cheap a luxury it mustbe in the land of its manufacture , free from duty , cost of transport , and the profits of the numerous hands through which it passes before it arrives at our tables . Those among ourselves who dread its in , jury to the nerves , may be consoled by knowing that " the most inveterate and abandoned tea-drinkers in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such evil effects . Their * This account of Chinese architecture is derived in usual method of making it is to infuse the tea substance from Mr. James Fer , , usson 's " Illustrated in the cup from which it is to be drunk , inHandbook of Architecture , " a work of singular learning , stead of it from a Southe ' * originality , and acuteness , and which in two octavovol- pouring teapot . umes contains the history of all the styics In the world , relates that the first pound which ever arrived Nobody can read this admirable manual without surprise that one m u should display such a mastery of every at Penrith came as a present , with the direcbranch of an almost endless subject . tion that it was to be st*eped in hot water . // The family boiled the entire pound in a kettle , and never dreaming that the liquid was the precious part , eat the leaves with salt and butter , and wondered that anybody should like such a dish . Yet Captain Basil Hall relates that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after drinking the tea , to hand round the tea-leaves on a silver salver , and as they contain far more nutriment than the liquid , it is not impossible that they may hereafter become an article of diet among the economical Chinese . Rice is the staple food as tea is the national drink of the Chinese . " The chief thing they wish and work for , " says Mr. Gutzlaff , as quoted by Sir John Davis , " is lice : their domestic accounts are entirely regulated by the quantity of rice consumed ; their meals according to the number of bowls of it boiled ; and their exertion according to the quantity wanted . Every substitute for this favorite food is considered meagre , and indicative of the greatest wretchedness . When they can not obtain a sufficient quantity to satisfy their appetites , they supply the deficiency with an equal weight of water , making a sort of gruel . Inquiring whether the Western barbarians eat rice , and finding me slow to give them answer , they exclaimed , Oh ! the sterile regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strange that the inhabitants have not long ago died of hunger . " ' Their very wines are made from rice , for though they possess the grape they do not use it for the purpose . The notions formerly current that every acre of land is cultivated in China , and that the vast population is engaged in a perpetual contest with impending famine , are without a shadow of foundation . The country , being mountainous , is to a great extent incapable of tillage ; but there are enormous tracts , which with skill and capital , could be made to yield crops , and will , doubtless , be reclaimed as the needs . of the people increase . Though the Celestial Empire is not , any more than the kingdoms of Europe , exempt from seasons of scarcity , and the poorer inhabitants may sometimes suffer the extremities of hunger and even die of starvation , like the Irish in the time of the famine , their ordinary condition is the very reverse of pitiable . " I fully believe , " says Mr. Fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there less real misery and want than in China . " " I doubt , " he says on another occasion , " if there is a happier race anywhere than the Chinese farmer and peasantry . " The cheerful look of the laborers is a matter of general observation . Mr. Fortune reckons their wages at about 6d. or 7d. a-day ; but food is cheap in proportion . The only coin of the realm is a small copper piece , of which 100 are equivalent to about 4*d. , and such a low denomination of money for the sole currency of the empire indicates of itself the low price of the common necessaries of life . For a few cash , as the English call them , a Chinese , Mr. Fortune states , can dine in a sumptuous manner upon his rice , fish , vegetables , and tea . What little meat they get is chiefly pork . Of fish they are extremely fond , and some of their methods of catching them are peculiar . All the world is familiar with the manner in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the birds are brought by gentleness and perseverance . Another plan frequently witnessed by Mr. Fortune in the northern provinces was for the men to wade into the water and strike a sharp blow upon the surface with their hands . This frightens the fish , which dive into the mud , and the moment the Chinaman feels one touch his feet , he himself dives also , and soon re-appears , holding up his prey with an air of triumph . But the most singular system described by Mr. Fortune is that by which they seduce the fish themselves to jump into their boats . A strip of white canvas is stretched slanting in the water along the right side , allures or alarms the fish , and has the strange effect of inducing them to leap over it . Indeed they would spring across the boat but for an upright net , which goes from stem to stern on the opposite side , and intercepts them in their passage . The long isolation of the Chinese is the cause why our contrivances and theirs have so little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the variety of operation which is the result shows how many means there are of attaining an end , and how much wider is the scope for human inge4uity than is commonly supposed . M. Huc admits that the industry of the Chinese is marvellous in all which relates to the ordinary wants and conveniences of life . Mr. Fortune speaks of their perseverance in the strongest terms , and it forcibly impresses every visitor to their land . On the rivers and canals , which are their highways , they 146 // the patience of any other people , and navigate shallows which are only ankle deep . The thousands who emigrated to California adapted themselves with ready versatility to any employment which offered . Washer-women were wanted at San Francisco , and instantly the Chinamen took up their stations at the tub . Notwithstanding that in consequence of their defective science they were put to much greater toil than Europeans in their search for gold , " they were content , " Mr. Borthwick says in his " Three years in California , " " with working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take from them . " The community , jealous of their earnings and of their greater disposition to amass than to scatter , discussed the propriety of driving them from the territory . Mr. Borthwick , from his tone , seems more impressed with the liberality which permitted them to stay than with the tyranhical covetousness which meditated their expulsion . Upwards of fifty thousand have also emigrated to the diggings in Victoria , where , according to their usage , they keep together , and preserve their national ways . Their rapid influx to the points of the globe where money is to be made shows that the inhabitants of the Empire know much more of what is passing abroad than we commonly suppose . M. Huc says , that since their war with ourselves they have applied to the study of geography , and have published several accurate treatises on the other parts of the world , and especially on Europe . In all countries without a poor-law , beggars must be tolerated . They are abundant in China , and " seem to demand charity more as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importunity make it policy to bestow something , for the purpose of getting rid of them . A handful of rice or the smallest coin in the realm suffices : " In every string , " says Mr. Fortune , " of a hundred cash there are a number of inferior ones : these are either given to beggars or the beggar lays down one of them for the shopkeeper , who gives in return one of the usual size , so that in this case the beggar receives about the value of half a cash , or the fiftiethpart of a penny . I believe in many cases it is not unusual for the inhabitants of a city to compound with the heads of this strange community . When this is done , a slip of paper is pasted on the doorposts of the per-147 son who has made this arrangement , and no beggar troubles him during the space of time for which he has paid . " These transactions are conducted through the agency of the king of the beggars , who is responsible for the good behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no regular lodging , but sleep under any projection or shed which will shield them from the rain . In Pekin , if the account of M. Huc is to be trusted , there is a large establishment , called the " House of Hens ' Feathers , " where they may pass the night for a cash apiece . The floor of an immense building is thickly strewn with feathers , which constitutes , as it were , one vast , continuous bed . Men , women , and children are received indiscriminately , and lie down in the feathers in rows . The proprietors began by furnishing each lodger with a small wrapper ; but as the beggars frequently contrived to carry away the counterpane under their garments , an enormous quilt , the size of the entire room , was substituted for the portable coverlets . When every body is in his feathers , the quilt , which is suspended from the ceiling , is let - down by pulleys . Holes are cut in it at regular intervals , through which the lodgers put their heads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is drawn up in the morning , that the sleepers may not be caught by their necks and carried up with the quilt to the top of the building . Then , says M. Huc , this immense nest of mendicants may be seen tumbling about in the sea of dirty down , from which they emerge to put on their own miserable rags . the Celestial beggars have recently extended their sphere of operations . They were almost unknown in London till within the last three years , and , according to the Report of the Mendicity Society , have annually increased , till in 1856 , they were become more numerous than the vagrants of any other nation , except the Indians and Italians . Their ordinary habit is to go about in pairs singing their native songs at the doors of churches when the congregation is leaving . Their profession proclaims that they are the scum of their country , and the Mendicity Report describes them as filthy , immoral , pilfering and quarrelsome . The thieves in China are numerous , and Mr. Fortune had the ifi-luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a canal a few miles from Shanghai his boat stranded , and it was necessary to pass the night in this position and wait the rise of the tide . He was near the end of his travels , and went to bed congratulating himself on the quiet and successful manner in which his journey had been accomplished ! While he was meditating upon his security the rogues were plotting his discomfiture , and soon put to flight the pleasant dreams in which he had indulged : " About two in the morning I was awakened by a loud yell from one of my servants , and I suspected at once that we had had a visit from thieves , for I had frequently heard the same sound before . Like the cry one hears at sea when a man has fallen overboard , this alarm can never he mistaken when once it has been heard . Before I had time to inquire what was wrong , one of my servants and two of the boatmen plunged into the canal and pursued the thieves . Thinking that we had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might have been lying outside the boat , I gave myself no uneasiness about the matter , and felt much inclined to go to sleep again . But my servant , who returned almost immediately , awoke me most effectually . " I fear , " said he , opening my door , " the theives have been inside the boat , and have taken away some of your property . " " Impossible , " said I ; " they can not have been here . " " But look , " he replied ; " a portion of the side of your boat under the window has been lifted out . " Turning to the place indicated by my servant , I could see , although it was quite dark , that there was a large hole in the side of the boat not more than three feet from where my head had been lying . At my right hand and just under the window the trunk used to stand , in which I was in the habit of keeping my papers , money , and other valuables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stretched out my hand in the dark to feel if this was safe . Instead of my hand resting on the top of the trunk , as it had been accustomed to *o , it went down to the floor of the boat , and I then knew for the first time that the trunk was gone . At the same moment my servant Tung  --  a came in with a candle , and confirmed what I had just made out in the dark . The thieves had done their work well  --  the boat was empty . My money amounting to more than one hundred Shanghae dollars , my accounts , and other papers - all , all were gone . The rascals had not even left me the clothes I had thrown off when I went to bed . But there was no time to lose , and in order to make every effort to catch the thieves , or at least get back a por tion of my property , I jumped into the canal , and made for thebank . Thetide had now risen , and instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth when we went to bed-I now sank up to the neck , and found the stream very rapid . A few strokes with my arms soon brought me into shallow water and to the shore . Here I found the boatmen rushing about in a frantic manner , examining with a lantern the bushes and indigo vats on the banks of the canal , but . all they had found was a few Manilla cheroots which the thieves had dropped apparently in their hurry . A watchman with his lantern and two or three stragglers , hearing the noise we made , came up and inquired what was wrong ; but when asked whether they had seen any thing of the thieves , shook their heads and professed the most profound ignorance . The night was pitch dark , every thing was perfectly still , and with the exception of the few stragglers already mcntioned , the whole town seemed sunk in a deep sleep . We were therefore perfectly helpless , and could do nothing further . I returned in no comfortable frame of mind to my boat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any inclination to sleep . It was a serious business for me to lose so much money , but that part of the matter gave me the least uneasiness . The loss of my accounts , journals , and drawings , and numerous memoranda I had been making during three years of travel , which it was impossible for any one to replace , was of far greater importance . I tried to reason philosophically upon the matter ; to persuade myself that as the thing could not be helped now it was no use being vexed with it ; that in a few years it would not signify much either to myself or any one else whether I had been robbed or not ; but all this fine reasoning would not do . " Moneyless and clothesless , with his single shirt as wet as the water of the canal , he must have been more than a philosopher if any amount of stoicism could have reconciled him to his situation , and allowed him to finish his night 's rest as though nothing had happened . But men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape , and Mr. Fortune was relieved from the worst part of his troubles in a way which came upon him as suddenly and surprised him as much as the robbery itself . After he had lain for about an hour brooding over his forlorn condition footsteps were heard approaching the banks of the canal . " We were all attention , and . when we could see two figures halt abreast of our boat 148 // our excitement was at a very high pitch . ILouda , louda  --  a term always applied to the captain of the boat-cried one of them . My men immediately started up , and demanded what our visitors wanted . Louda , ' said the same voice , with the greatest coolness , and as if he was transacting a very ordinary piece of business , come over here and receive the white devil 's trunks and clothes . ' When my men reached the opposite side of the canal the thieves had disappeared , but had left my boxes on the bank . The dollars were all gone , but every thing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been under the examination of the thieves , had been carefully put back . My accounts , books , journals , and all that I valued most , had been returned to me . Many things , such as knives , pencils , &amp;c. , which are highly valued by the Chinese , were left untouched ; and even the very padlock of the trunk had been put carefully inside . It was the same with my clothes . Coats , waistcoats , trousers , and even the necktie which I had thrown on the table when I went to bed - everything was returned except the dollars . What an extraordinary people the Chinese are , and how difficult to understand ! The thieves of any other nation would never have thought of bringing back what they did not want ; if they do not appropriate the whole of their booty , they either destroy it or throw it away . Chinese thieves are much more civilized ; they return what it does not suit their purpose to keep . " - Fortune 's Residence in China , p. 380 . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly delighted with his watch , and in the evening one of the number brought it back to him , not , as in the case of Mr. Fortune 's trunk , to restore it to the owner , but politely to request that its late proprietor would have the kindness to instruct him how to wind it up ! The Mandarins soon apprehended the robbers who had carried off Mr. Fortune 's dollars , and returned him little more than a fourth of the sum . The rest they retained for the ex*nses or for themselves . A court of law , say the Spaniards , is a thicket of brambles , and the suitors are sheep , and such of the flock as have the courage to enter leave their fleeces upon the thorns . The Chinese Government has little consideration for depredators . The jails , Sir John Davis says , are miserable abodes , which the people term Ty-yo , or hell . Torture is in use to compel confession , and the supposed criminal is either beaten unmercifully with the bamboo , or his ankles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triangle . M. Hue states that he once met on a road near Pekin a convoy of carts filled with screaming and groaning prisoners . On coming up to the procession he found , to his horror , that every man was nailed by his hand to the wood of the vehicle . lie questioned the conductor upon the cause of this atrocity , who calmly told him that , with the aid of a company of . soldiers , he had succeeded in apprehending a colony of robbers and , not having carried sufficient chains , was compelled to secure them as he could . " But , " inquired M. Huc , " may not some of them be innocent ? " " How can I tell 1 " ' was the reply ; " they have not yet been tried . " The spectacle itself appeared less appalling than the mirth of the soldiers , who point*d out for the amusement of each other the involuntary grimaces produced in the prisoners by the extremity of the torture . The authority is suspicious , the circumstances not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where hammers and nails were plentiful . However severe , too , may be the laws in particular instances , they are minute in their provisions , and those who administer them are not permitted to depart from , them . But whether the incident be true or false , we are assured , upon the highest authority , that the inference drawn from it by M. Hue of the general barbarity of the nation is entirely unfounded . Though the penal code may be rigorous , the people are humane . Nowhere ought the distinction to be better understood than in England , At a period when our jails were pest-houses , and our code the bloodiest in Europe ; when we dealt far more unmercifully with thieves than do the Chinese , and a mother was hanged for stealing a loaf of bread for her famishing children from the counter of a baker , we had reached individually a high state of humanity and civilization , were profuse in our charities and strong in our affections . In 1849 , as M. Hue was travelling through the province of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising his eyes , he saw about fifty cages , roughly constructed with bamboo , suspended to the trees by the way-side , and each containing a human head . Several of them were coming to pieces , and the heads were hanging to the bars by the beard or had fallen to the ground . A band of highwaymen who had long ravished 149 // the surrounding country with impunity had at last been captured , and the mandarin of the province had put up their heads as a terror for evil doers . Barbarous as this reads , it need not astonish educated Englishmen , who are all aware that Dr. Johnson and Goldsmith had seen the decaying heads of English criminals upon the arch which spanned the most crowded thofoughfare of the capital of the kingdom , and that the warm-hearted Irishman founded a jest upon the spectacle . Later still , we learn from Southey , the bodies of more than a hundred highwaymen hung at the same time in chains upon Hounsiow Heath , polluting the air for miles with their stench . And these were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an empire where the inhabitants caniiot , as with us , control the laws , a stringent criminal code is no evidence of a cruel people , still less can we infer their barbarity from the rigor of the proceedings in cases of high treason . The enactments are the work of governors jealous of their supremacy , and , though revolting to justice , eminently calculated to effect their object . All the nearest male relations of the person convicted of this crime , who are sixty or upwards , are to suffer death , bowever innocent . Family allegiance and respect for age are the strongest principles of a Chinese . The knowledge that his guilt will sacrifice the lives of those whom he most reverences , as well as his own , is the most powerful preventive that could be presented to his mind , and this is the object of the iniquitous provision which tyranny devised and custom tolerates . The cruelties practised in the rebellion which is raging are the work of the alarmed and revengeful authorities , or of the equally exasperated and desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excesses . They dread and groan under them . M. Hue , at least , who quotes the etrocities to prove his indictment , might have remembered the wholesale massacres of revolutionary France . The law which involves an innocent relation in the punishment of a guilty is less revolting to a Chinese , that a system of responsibility pervades their code . If , says Mr. Fortune , a disturbance takes place in a shop or private dwelling , the owner is liable to be called to account for it ; and if it occurs in the street , the surrounding inhabitants are held answerable . Thus each man becomes a security for the good behavior of his neighbor . What seems more in accordance with equity , if a person commits suicide from the ill-usage of another , he whose conduct was the cause of the self-destruction is to afford compensation for the evil he has produced . But , according to M. Hue , the regulation encourages suicide , and induces many people to destroy themselves out of spite . " In other countries , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enemy , he endeavors to kil. him ; in China , on the contrary , he kills himself . His foe falls at once into the hands of justice , and will certainly be tortured and ruined , even if he is not put to death . The family of the suicide usually obtains in addition a considerable pecuniary indemnity , and it is by no means rare for some wretch , from a morbid affection for his family , to destroy himself in the house of a rich man . " In the same way the proprietor is , in the first instance , accountable when a dead body is found on his property ; and M. Hue asserts that one of the worst acts of vengeance which a Chinese can practise towards an enemy is to deposit by stealth a corpse on bis* ground . Every one is afraid lest a stranger sbould die on his premises ; and when a poor fellow who had not many minutes to live fell down at the door of a shop , M. Hue heard the owner entreating the sufferer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised himself with the assistance of a passer-by , and had the ebarity to go and expire in the middle of the street . " In every nation laws are modified by usage to an extent which renders it impossible to judge of their operation by the written code alone , and we are not yet sufficiently acquainted with the entire machinery of Chinese society to pronounce confidently upon the provisions which regulate it . The enactments against crime would lead to the conclusion that almost all descriptions of guilt were punished with the bamboo ; but Sir John Davis explains that the number of blows awarded by the code is , in manifold cases , only the measure of the offence , and can be commuted into a fine . In other instances it is probable that alleviating facts may have escaped the observation of Europeans , and that they equally misjudge many circumstances through ignorance of their bearings , and of their adaptation to the wants and feelings of the Chinese . The stern provisions against filial disobedience would seem intoler 150 // ably cruel to those who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruling principle of the nation , and the bond which has held together its three hundred millions of inhabitants . The tree has only to be judged by its fruits . Though the spell of peace has been broken in our own day , no kingdom has enjoyed such a long freedom from foreign or intestine war , none has exhibited equal industry , contentment , and cheerfulness . The assertion that the Chinese are a semi-barbarous nation is denied by almost every traveller who has penetrated beyond their ports and lived freely among the people . In the refinements of life , in courtesy , humanity , and domestic affection , they are at least our equals , and in some respects our superiors ; and if we have far outstripped them in science , we may yet do well to call to mind how many of our arts , luxuries , and pleasures came to us from the East , and that we were once the pupils of those of whom we now boast ourselves the masters . The items of the account can no where be better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dr. Draper , an American : " If the European wishes to know how much he owes to the Asiatic , he has only to cast a glance at an hour of his daily life . The clock which summons him from his bed in the morning was the ir*vention of the East , as were also clepsydras and sundials . The prayer for his daily bread , which he has said from his infancy , first rose from the side of a Syrian mountain . The linens and cottons with which he clothes himself , though they may be very fine , are inferior to those which have been made from time immemorial in the looms of India . The silk was stolen by some missionaries , for his benefit , from China . He could buy better steel than that with which he shaves himself in the old city of Damascus , where it was first invented . The coffee he expects at breakfast was first grown by the Arabians , and the natives of Upper India prepared the sugar with which he sweetens it . A schoolboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If his tastes are light and he prefers tea , the virtues of that excellent leaf were first pointed out by the industrious Chinese .

The egg he is breaking was laid by a fowl whose ancestors were domesticateci by the Malaccans , unless she may have been , though that will not alter the case , a ' modern Shanghai . If there are preserves and fruits on his board , let him remember with thankfulness that Persia first gave him the cherry , the peach , the plum . If in any of those delicate preparations he detects the flavor of alcohol , let it remind him that that substance was first distilled by the Arabians , who have set him the praiseworthy example , which it will be for his benefit to follow , of abstaining from its use .

Of public amusements it is the same . The most magnificent fireworks are still to be seen in India and China ; and , as regards the pastimes of private life , Europe has produced no invention which can rival the game of chess . We have no hydraulic constructions as great as the Chinese canal , no fortifications as extensive as the Chinese wall ; we have no Artesian wells that can at all approach in depth to some of theirs ; we have not yet resorted to the practice of obtaining coal-gas from the interior of the earth ; they have borings for that purpose more than 3000 feet deep . " - Draper 's lIuman Physiology , p. *395. it is our part now to repay the benefits we have received , and diffuse the light of Christianity and the triumphs of science over the Eastern world . The books which have am peared upon China since the commencement of the present war dwell upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port , to navigate every river , and traverse every road of the empire . Desirable it would be , no doubt , both for us and them ; but from the methods which are ordinarily suggested for obtaining the end we utterly dissent . All the material benefits in the world can not weigh as one grain of dust in the balance against moral principle , and humanity itself must be shocked at the suggestion that we should find excuses for forcing our way by violence and bloodshed , as the only arguments which are likely to prevail at present . It would be a poor defence to urge for a *irisoner at the Old Bailey that he had brokea into the house and knocked down the inmates because he despaired of getting permission'to walk in at the door . Time has only strengthened our opinion that we flagrantly violated both justice and mercy at the commencement of the quarrel . Upon the facts which were assumed during the debates in the Houses of Parliament , nothing could be more triumph-. 151 // ant than the arguments of the Opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gladstone  --  a speech which we have heard persons of all parties declare to have been the most impressive piece of oratory ever pronounced within their memory . But invincible as the case was even then , there is reason to believe that it was below the truth , for the sole plea upon which our officials rested their defence-that the English flag was flying on the lorcha-is now stated by persons of high authority to have been totally false . This was always asserted by the Chinese ; and , if their version turns out to be correct , what atonement can we make for thousands of lives sacrificed to maintain upon a mistaken assumption a pretended right ? These are the things which alarm men who believe that there is a divine Ruler of the universe , and who hold that a victory won by brute force against justice is one of the worst defeats . Therefore we would fain hope that a different spirit will preside over the remainder of these unhappy proceedings-that English Christianity will be placed before English supremacy , and that the eternal laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevail with our rulers over the shortsighted cravings of unscrupulous commerce .
