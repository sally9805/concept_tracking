A FEW years ago I was sojourning for a day or two in ? 1 the beautiful village of Burlington , Vermont , which spreads out so pleasantly over a gentle slope upon the eastern margin of Lake Champlain . I had just come hem Ticonderoga and Crown Point , and was on my way toward St. John 's , Chambh*e , Montreal , and Quebec . It was in sultry August . At early dawn I mounted a horse , and in company with a young lady upon another , rode to a little embowered cemetery within sound of the cascades of the charming Winooski . There sleep several of the patriarchs and some of the heroes of that northern border ; and among them reposes the mortality of ETHAN ALLEN , the colossus of the group . We clambered over the style , and waded through the deep grass , which was sparkling with dew , until we reached the tomb of the hero , encanopied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate for such a sturdy republican . Upon a granite base rests a plain white marble slab , bearing the following unostentatious inscription : Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year lICS , by harper and Brothers , in the Clerk 's Office of the District Court for the Southern District of New York .

Near this humble monument are the graves of several of his relatlYes , and that of his brother Ira , the earliest historian of Vermont as a State of our confederation . Their earth-beds were inclosed by a chain , supported by small granite obelisks , and c*crtained with shrubs of seringo , lilac , and rose .

There was a charm within that consecrated acre . " I like that ancient Saxon phrase which calls The burial-ground God 's Acre !

There was a peculiar charm there in that early morning light , in the midst of the birds and blossoms , and the unceasing chorus of the Winooski . History opened wide her wonderful volume , romance delineated its glowing pictures , while patriotism and poetry , uniting loftiest sentiment and sweetest melody , tilled the heart with exquisite emotions . Who can stand at the grave of a man whose deeds sparkle like diamonds upon the pages of his country 's history and not feel a spirit akin to worship stirring within him ? Such a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tryi:ig scenes . Ethan Allen was not a native of the State in whose historic drama he acted a conspicuous J ) art . lie was born in Connecticut in 1739 , in the town of Litchifeld , it is believed , before his l ) parents left there for a residence in Cornwall . He was not much favored in early life with the schoolmaster 's instructions by book and birch . " The critic , " he observes , in the introduction to his Narrative of his Captivity , " will be pleased to excuse any inaccuracies in the performance itself as the author has unfortunately missed of a liberal education . " That " miss " did not affect his future usefulness . The vigor of his intellect and his physical energy supplied all wants of college learning in fitting him for the peculiar sphece in which he was called to act . He was not the coarse , ignorant , unsocial , and arroBant man whom popular belief is disposed to contemplate in the character of Ethan Allen . He was not polished by the attrition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social communion ; for his home was among pioneers in a rude wilderness , whose chief reliance , in the battle of life , was upon physical strength rather than upon conventional proprieties . He was truly a Boanergesa son of thunder-among his associates ; honest in his intentions , fearless in the performance of his duties , frank in the expression of his opinions , generous toward his enemies and opponents , eminently judicious in council , and a civil and military leader who never disappointed the expectations of his followers . Such was the man  --  the chief instrument in laying the foundations of one of the sovereign States of our confederacy-whose career we are about to consider . It is to be lamented that a man so conspicuous should have passed from among us without a memento traced by the pencil of art . The true lineasnents of his face and person arc lost forever . * Ethan was the eldest of six brothers , four of whom , with himseig emigrated to the fertile territory west of the Green Mountains , which stretches along almost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thither they went , among the earlier settlers , disputed the mastery with the beasts of the forest , and opened , with the axe and plow , the generous bosom of mother earth to the blessed sunlight and the fattenin0 rain . The French and Indian war had just ended , and no question of political jurisdiction over that wilderness had yet been raised when the Aliens built their first rude cabins there . That question , however , was soon presented to the settlers for a practical decision ; and we must briefly survey its history in order to comprehend the dawning of the public life of our hero . It must be remembered that the western boundaries of provinces in America for which charters were originally obtained from the British monarchs were wholly indefinite , some of them being , by the words of the instrument , on " the South Sea , " or Pacific Ocean . The interior of the vast continent and the distance from ocean to ocean were unknown ; and the forecast of statessnen did not perceive the l ) robability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and having , by necessity , fixed boundaries and defined sovereign privileges . Herein was concealed the kernel of many difficulties , especially in connection with the New England colonies . When Charles the Second of England gave the province of New Netherland ( which he did not possess ) to his brother , the Duke of York , the eastern boundary was defined by the patent as being on the Connecticut River , while the western boundaries of Massachusetts and Connecticut were , by their charters , upon the " South Sea , " or Pacific Ocean . Here was di- * The portrait of General Ethan Allen was never painted . The picture at the head of th 5 article contains a drawing of an heroic statue of the hero made by the skillful hand of Mr. B. H. Kinney , of Burlington , Vermont , kindly furnished to the writer by the artist . It is an ideal of the celebrated leader . The drawing of the tomb of the patriot was made by the writer at the time of his visit above alluded to . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compromises could settie . It was an open question when the Duke obtained his new possessions by conquest , and the name of the province was changed to that of New York , one of the proprietor 's titles . Commissioners settled it , by agreeing that the boundary line between the New England provinces and New York should be at twenty miles eastward of the Hudson , and running parallel with that river . This line was first established between New York and Connecticut , and , by precedent , some time afterward , between New York and Massachusetts . New Hampshire finally appeared , and , pleading those precedents , asked to have the line of its sister colonies extended northward as its own definite western boundary . New York had already controverted the right of Massachusetts to the northern extension of the Connecticut line ; now that province emphatically protested against the new claim . As the country had never been surveyed or settled , the claim and the protest were of little immediate consequence , but of great 1 ) rospective importance . Thus the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1741 . Weatworth , on receiving his commission , was authorized by the King to issue patents for unimproved lands within the limits of his province . Settlers were then penetrating the wilderness westward of the Connecticut River , and some had gone over the Green Mountains and built their pioneer fires even upon the wooded borders of Lake Champlain . Numerous applications for grants were made , and in 1749 , Governor Wentworth gave a patent for a township of land , six miles square , near the northwestern angle of Massachusetts , having for its western limit a line parallel with that of the two adjoining provinces , or twenty miles eastward of the Hudson River . In honor of the Governor of New Hampshir* the township was called Bennington . That grant first brought the territorial question between New York and New Hampshire to a direct issue . New York claimed the whole territory north of Massachusetts , as far eastward as the Connecticut River , and , of course protested against the grants of Governor Wentworth , declaring them illegal and null . The latter disregarded all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be just , and at the commencement of the French and Indian war in 1754 he had issued patents for fourteen townships westward of the Connecticut River . That war periled the frontier settlements , for Indian invasions were frequent , and for five years very t'ew men were bold enough to seek a new home in that northern wilderness . But when , in 1759 and 1760 , Canada passed from under the French dominion to that of the English , and this border territory became a place of comparative safety , a great number of adventurers sought possessions there . There was a sudden gush of enterprise , and the consideration of applica tions for patents composed much of Governor Wentworth 's daily business . Within four years he issued grants for one hundred and thirtyeight townships of the size of Bennington ; and that territory , comprising a greater portion of the present State of Vermont , was known as the " New Hampshire Grants " from that time until the kindling of the war for Independence . The original proprietors of the Grants had received their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputes had awakened some doubts in their minds respecting the validity of their titles , and many of them sold their lands in parcels to practical farmers at a large advance . Among these farmers were the Aliens and several of their friends from Connecticut , who settled in the township of Bennington at about the year 1763 . Emigration flowed in that direction with a continnally augmenting stream . All the townships became its receptacles , and were rapidly filling with a hardy , independent resident population , when the authorities of New York perceived the necessity of immediate and efficient interfercace , before it should be forever too late . Lieutenant-Governor Colden ( then acting Governor ) , accordingly , wrote an energetic letter to Governor Wentworth , protesting against his grants . He also sent a proclamation among the people , declaring the Connecticut Elver to be the boundary between New York and New Hampshire . Protests and proclamations were alike unheeded by Wentworth and the people , until 1764 , when the matter was laid before the King in council for adjudication . It was decided in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wentxvorth ceased issuing patents for lands westward of the Connecticut River , and a source of immense wealth for himself was thus suddenly checked . The settlers , regarding the question as one of territorial jurisdiction only , felt very little interest in the decision , for they believed their civil rights and property would be as much respected by the authorities of one colony as another . They were contented . But their pleasant dream of confidence was soon dispelled . New York acted unwisely if not unjustly . Not content with the award of territorial jurisdiction over the Grants , it was claimed , on the authority of able legal decisions , that that jurisdiction included the right of property in the soil as well as of government . 1'he authorities of New York declared all the patents for lands westward of the Connecticut River , issued by Wentworth , to be void , and proceeded to order the survey and sale of farms in the possession of actual settlers who had bought and paid for them , and in many instances had made great progress in improvements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sowing dragon 's teeth to see them produce a crop of full-armed men . The settlers had been disposed to be quiet , loyal friends of New York ; now they were converted into determined , rebellious , and defiant foes . A new nad powcr // ful element of opposition to the claims of New York was thus evoked . It was no longer the shadowy , unsubstantialgovernment of New Hampshire , panoplied in proclamations , that opposed the arrogant pretensions of New York ; it was the sinews and muskets of the people of the Grants , backed by all New Hampshire - ay , by all New England-who now stood in battlearray against her . She gave them the degrading alternative of leaving their possessions to others , or of repurchasing them-an alternative to which , as freemen conscious of being right , they could not submit . They did not submit , but declared their readiness to defend their soil , hand to hand , against any force the oppressor might send . Foremost among those who counseled resistance , and resolved to fight for vested rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young manhood . At length the Governor and Council of New York summoned all the claimants under the New Hampshire Grants to appear before them at Albany , with their deeds and other evidences of claim , within three months , failing in which , the claims of all the delinquents should be rejected . The settlers , governed by the advice of Allen and other leading men , paid no attention to the summons , and their lands were considered forfeited . In the mean time New York speculators had been busy in purchasing large tracts of these menaced estates , and the people of the Grants , foreseeing much trouble from this new element of mischief sent one of their number to England to lay their case before the King and Council . He obtained an order for the Governor of New York to abstain from issuing any more patents or lands eastward of Lake Champlain . That order was issued in July , 1767 . As it was not ex post facto in its operation , the New York patentees proceeded to take possession of their grants by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupants of land for which they had paid . Some forcibly resisted the officers sent to serve the writs , but a majority seemed disposed to meet their opponents in the courts . A resident of Shaftesbury was taken to Albany for trial , in a suit of ejectment . A decision in his case would affect all others , and Ethan Allen was employed as general agent of the people of the Grants to attend the trial and defend their claims . He first procured a copy of Wentworth 's commission , then employed Mr. Ingersoll , an eminent Connecticut lawyer , as counsel , and in June , 1770 , they appeared in court at Albany . The whole proceedings proved to be a solemn farce ; many of the judges and lawyers in that province were connected with the speculators , and the case in hand was predetermined before the trial commenced . The verdict was in favor of the New York complainant . Allen was exceedingly indignant , and it was with great difficulty that he could treat AttorneyGeneral Kemp courteously when that officer called upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneer , and then advised him to go home and persuade his Green . Mountain friends to make the best terms they could with their new landlords , at the same time reminding him that their case was a desperate one , for " might often prevails over right . " The suggestion thoroughly aroused the sleeping lion of Allen 's nature , and he vehemently exclaimed , " The gods of the valleys are not the gods of the hills I " The startled Attorney-General asked him to explain his meaning . " Come to Bennington , " said Allen , with a frown , " and you shall understand it ! " When Allen reported to his constituents the result of his mission , they perceived the alternative to be slavery or resistance . They did not long hesitate in their choice of evils . The news spread from bill to hill , from valley to valley , and from hamlet to cottage , and the indignant people , as with one voice , expressed their determination to defend their rights at all hazards . They saw the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to listen longer to fair words from their oppressors . The time for talking about charters , and grants , and jurisdiction , had passed , and the bold mountaineers prepared to fight rather than yield . Suits for ejectment continued to be brought before the courts at Albany , to which the settlers paid no attention . Then sheriffs and civil magistrates were ordered to go into the Grants and execute the mandates of the law . Now came the crisis . The parties had hitherto waged their contests by words , at a distance ; now officers of the law and the people met face to face . Men from New York , already on the Grants under titles from the civil authorities there , beheld the gathering storm and fled for shelter beyond the disputed boundary . The Green Mountain Boys met. in council at Bennington , and , by unanimous vote , " Resolved to support their rights and property , which they possessed under the New Tlampshire Grants , against the usurpations and unjust claims of the Governor and Council of New York , nv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This was the gauntlet of defiance which sheriffs and civil magistrates had the temerity to take up . The sheriffs came with attendants ; their opponents always outnumbered them and drove them away . The opponents were indicted as rioters , but the sheriffs found it as hard to catch the bodies of any of the settlers as it was to seize their property . Dunmore , then Governor of New York , a haughty hireling of the Crown , became very indignant . He issued a thundering proclamation , and ordered the sheiffs to call out the posse cornitates  --  the power of the country-to aid them . Sheriff Ten Eyck , of Albany , with seven hundred and fifty New York militia at his back , marched to arrest James Brackenridge . He found eighteen armed men in the house , who defied him . He threatened to break in the door . " Attempt it , and you are a dead man ! " exclaimed a burly voice from within . He was on the point of executing the // threat , when he perceived three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A quick but bloodless retreat was effected , and Sheriff Ten Eyck went back to Albany and reported the New Hampshire Grants in a state of rebellion . Dunmore loved his ease , and of course loved peace . He attempted to gain by strategy what he could not hope to effect by force . Bribes were offered ; settlements of new lands in the Grants were promoted , so as to secure for New Yorkers a squatter sovereignty ; and measures were taken to sow divisions among the mountaineers . The people had more to dread from these silent measures than from the strong arm of the law . The leaders perceived it , and long before Samuel Adams or Dabney Carr invented that powerful engine of the Revolution , the Committee of Correspondence , the Green Mountain Boys had set the machine in motion . In every township they formed Committees of Safety and Correspondence , and all over the Grants the most subtle vigilance was exercised . The people also assembled in general convention , and resolved that no man should be taken from the Grants by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did more . They formed a general military association to assist in maintaining the spirit of that resolve of the Convention . And Ethan Allen was chosen Colonel Commandant by unanimous consent . Seth Warner , Remember Baker , and others of less note in history , were made captains , and under these the people were disciplined in the art of war . The bold hunters also enrolled themselves , and devoted their sure rifles to the service of the people . Civil authority , in relation to intruders , was executed by martial force , and every stray offcnder from New York caught upon the disputed domain , was summarily tried by a Committee of Safety , and punished as summarily , not in a way to imperil life or limb , but , as the sentence significantly declared , " chastised with the twigs of the wilderness . ' Many a poor wight departed the Grants with a receipt in full , thus legibly written upon his back , attesting the payment of the penalty of transgression . Colonel Allen now became a marked man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life . He then first wore a sword in defense of right . William Tryon , who had lately come from North Carolina , where he had severely handled the Regulators  --  the opponents of oppression in that province , was now Governor of New York , and he regarded Allen as a traitor . The people regarded him as a patriot . His relative position to Governor and people made him both , and with energy he performed the acts of both traitor and patriot . With the rigor of martial law he enforced the expressed will of the people , opposing sheriffs here , and driving off New York settlers there . Tryon offered twenty pounds sterling for the apprehension of Allen , and the same for each of his chief associates . They were not apprehended . Then he offered one hundred and fifty pounds for Allen , and fifty for each of his six chief associates . They were not apprehended . They were not even intimidated . They were emboldened , and , with ludicrous pomp , Allen offered a reward of five pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York to any officer of the military association of Green Mountain Boys . These were certainly bold measures , and Colonel Allen frankly confessed that the conduct of himself and associates , interpreted by the laws of New York or of well-ordered society , was certainly riotous. // But he excused it with the plea that the oppressions of the strong , denying undoubted rights to the weak , had forced them to take the only method left them to defend those rights . They stood upon the soil they had purchased with money and improved by labor . They went not upon the domain of that strong oppressor , but stood only on the defensive ; and he thought it cruel and unjust for them to be branded as outlaws , and have a price set upon their liberty . One mild evening toward the close of April , 1772 , the people of Bennington were alarmed by intelligence that Governor Tryon was moving up the Hudson River with an army to invade the Grants , chastise offenders , and enforce submission . The news spread rapidly , and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They took grave counsel together ; resolved that " it was their duty to oppose Governor Tryon and his troops to the utmost of their power ; dragged two cannons and a mortar from Hoosic fort to Bennington ; called out the militia , and made every preparatiorf to give the expected invader a warm reception . But Tryon had no such belligerent intentions . He had heard of the fruitless expedition of sheriff Ten Eyck , and had conceived the idea that the Regulators of the New Hampshire Grants were more formidable than the Regulators of the Raw and Eno . Instead of marching with power into their country , he sent them a mild proclamation , and sweetly proposed a tilt in diplomacy , lie promised protection to any deputation they might send to negotiate excepting Ethan Allen and his associate outlaws . The proposition was agreed to . Two delegates went to New York , bearing a letter from the people of the Grants to the Governor and*Council , and also a firm but respectful protest , both drawn up by Ethan Allen . These contained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abounded with much logic respecting the position they had assumed . They contained a noble defense of the Green Mountain Boys , and were highly honorable to the head and heart of our hero . The negotiations were friendly , and the brothers Fay went back to Bennington , at about the middle of July , messengers of precious promises for good . The people gathered there from hill and valley , heard the good news , and shouted lustily . They felt that they had achieved a triumph , and now would come long days of peace . The old Hoosic cannon , and one belonging to Bennington , were brought out and made to thunder applause , and Seth Warner 's company of Green Mountain Boys made a grand display , and concluded with a fee de joic in the midst of loud huzzas from the excited multitude . That night was one of pleasant dreams all over the Bennington region . Almost as early as the next day-dawn clouds of difficulty appeared . Even while the Commissioners were in pleasant treaty , or while the Fays were hastening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed Green Mountain Boys were executing the laws of the Convention against an unlucky surveyor and some New York settlers . The former was caught in the wilderness exercising his profession in behalf of over- the - line speculators . They broke his instruments , passed sentence of perpetual banishment against him , and promised him the delights of suffocation by a halter , if they should ever catch him within the domains of the Grants again . Settlers upon Otter Creek were as summarily dealt with at the same time . On the spot where Vergennes now stands , at the Falls of the Otter , a New Hampshire settler , who owned a saw-mill there , had been driven off by tenants of Colonel Reed , a New York speculator . Colonel Allen proceeded to regulate matters there . He gave the invading tenants notice to quit as soon as they could pack up their personal property . He then burned their tenements , destroyed the stones of a gristmill they had erected by pitching them over the Falls , and restored the saw-mill to its original owner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears of Tryon , but the harmony was soon disturbed by the discordant notes from Otter Creek . Ills anger was fiercely kindled , and he wrote a sharp letter of rebuke to the inhabitants of the Grants , and peremptorily ordered them to reinstate the New York settlers at the Falls . The people immediately assembled in convention at Manchester , and chose Colonel Allen for their secretary . In their behalf he wrote a firm but respectful answer to Tryon 's letter , in which he justified the measures at the Falls , truly represented that the act took place before the return of the Commissioners to Bennington , and then told the Governor plainly that the New York settlers should not be reinstated , lie also assured the Governor that if surveyors and settlers were still to be sent to the Grants , then the people of that domain must consider the negotiations of the Commissioners a nullity . Here , then , the old difficulties were fully renewed , and the people further resolved to expel , or otherwise punish , any person within the disputed district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military , under the authority of New York . Several persons were soon punished under the new regulation . One for accepting office from Tryon , and endeavoring to perform its functions , was " chastised " by a very large hickory " twig of the *vilderness , " to the amount of two hundred stripes ; while a boasting , in -- judicious physician of Arlington , escaped with a whole skin , but with no less mortification . He had openly ridiculed the Convention and the military force , declared himself a partisan of New York , defied the power of the authorities of the Grants , and armed himself in defense of his defiant position .. lIe was caught at some unguarded hour and conveyed to the Green Mountain Tavern , in Bennington , for trial . In front of the tavein was a sign-post twenty- // qwq creased in intensity , and commotions , riots , and bloodshed became qnite common near the border . The Green Mountain Boys , under the judicious guidance of Allen , carefully acted on the defensive , and never pursued aggressors beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring of 1774 , the New York Legislature passed a most despotic law , entitled an Act for preventing tumultuous and riotous assemblies , and for punishing rioters . It empowered the governor and council to order " indicted rioters , " as Ethan Allen and other leaders were called , to surrender themselves for trial within seventy days after the date of the order , or to be considered as convicted and sentenced to suffer death  --  the Supreme Court having power given by the Act to order the execution , whenever the offender should be arrested , the same as if there had been an actual trial and ajudicial sentence ! This law , instead of intimidating the people of the Grants , united them in closer affiliation ; and in a general convention , assembled at Bennington , they resolved to hold themselves in readiness , at a minute 's warning , to " defend those who , for their merit in the great and general cause , had been falsely denominated rioters . " The proscribed persons also issued a manifesto , drawn up by Ethan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which contained a logical defense of themselves , and severe remarks on the course pursued by their oppressors . " Printed sentences of death will not kill us , " they said ; " and if the executioners approach us , they will be as likely to fall victims to death as we ; " for they had fully resolved , that , if any person should attempt to apprehend any of them or their friends , they would kill them on the spot . The people of the Grants then closed the door upon further parley or controversy , and armed themselves to fight for their leaders , their homes , and their vested rights . The quarrel was about to culminate in a bloody crisis . While on that northern border a little storm of war was rising , the whole political atmosphere of the colonies was becoming black with a gathering tempest . All local troubles soon ceased to have paramount interest , for all eyes were turned anxiously toward the brooding darkness . The low , rumbling thunder , in colonial assemblies and in popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first leaped from the clouds at Lexington , and the thunder-peal awoke a continent to arms . It is not our province to detail the opening events of that Revolution , which resulted in the freedom of thirteen Anglo-American colonies and gave birth to a new empire . Our hero was a prominent actor in an important episode in the opening of that great drama , and to that we will turn without preface . The British Government , perceiving the great importance of preserving Canada as a loyal colony when the inevitable contest should commence , had used the most energetic and extraordinary efforts to accomplish that object . The great concessions made to the Roman Catholic population , called the Quebec Act , and which deeply offended Protestant England , was the first of those efforts . Remarkable vigilance was every where exercised in that province by royal officers ; and in order to keep open a free communication between Canada and the interior of the province of New York , the old fortresses of Ticonderoga and Crown Point- the scenes of many struggles between the French and English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boston , Samuel Adams and Joseph Warren , also appreciated the importance of winning Canada to the Republican cause , or , in the event of a failure to do so , to acquire possession of those strongholds upon Lake Champlain . Accordingly , almost a month before the skirmish at Lexington , they , as members of the Boston Committee of Correspondence , sent a secret agent into Canada to ascertain and report the political feelings of the people . He soon became convinced that fear alone kept the Canadians , and especially those of British extraction , from joining the other colonies in their opposition ; and from Montreal he sent urgent advice to his employers to take immediate measures to capture Ticonderoga . On his way north he had consulted with the Allens and other leaders of the people of the Grants , and they had agreed to undertake the enterprise themselves when the proper time should arrive . The whole matter was kept a profound secret , except among a few leading men ; and yet , eight days after the affair at Lexington , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the patriots of Massachusetts , Connecticut , and the New Hampshirc Grants . At that time the minute-men of New England , armed and unarmed , were rushing toward Boston to confine the British troops ito that peninsula . The Colonial Assembly of Connecticut was in session , and some leading members of that body conceived and concocted a plan for seizing Ticonderoga , and appropriating its cannons and other munitions of war to the use of the gathering army . They acted only as private citizens , but procured a loan of eighteen hundred dollars from the Assembly . They appointed Edward Mott and Noah Phelps a committee to proceed to the frontier towns , ascertain the condition of the fort and the strength of the garrison , and , if possible , induce Colonel Ethan Allen to join the expedition with his Green Mountain Boys . On their way they laid their plans before Colonel Eas*on and Mr. John Brown , at Pittsfield , in Massadius*tts , and these men , afterward leaders of troops , accompanied the committee to Bennington . Easton enlisted about forty volunteers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Bennington the following day . Colonel Allen promptly responded affirmatively , immediately assembled his Green Mountain Boys , and sent detachments to watch the roads northward to prevent intel- // ligence being conveyed to the doomed fortresses . At dusk on the 7th of May quite a little army gathered at Castleton , fourteea miles east of Skenesborongh ( now Whitehall ) , when Allen was chosen commander:in*chief , with Colonel Easton and Seth Warner for his lieutenants . At the same time a party was sent to Skenesborongh to capture Major Skene ( a son of the Governor ) , secure boats , and hasten to join the invaders at Shorebam , opposite Ticonderoga . Another party was sent down the lake , beyond Crown Point , to secure boats and bateaux in that direction . In the mean time another scbeme had been formed elsewhere for the same object . When intelligence of the bloodshed at Lexington reached Nev* Haven , Benedict Arnold , captain of an independent company there , marched with them immediately to Cambridge . No doubt he had received some hint of the enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he went before the Massachusetts Committee of Safety and proposed a similar expedition in the same direction . His representations coinciding with the advice of the secret agent in Canada made the Committee accept his proposition with eagerness . They granted him a colonel 's commission , and authorized him to raise a corps of troops not exceeding four hundred in number . Furnished with money and munitions of war , he went into the western counties of Massachusetts to raise his men . At Stockbridge he heard of the expedition under Allen , already on its march . He engaged others to enlist men , while he hastened forward with a single servant , joined the party at Castleton , and with a singular want of courtesy in his manner ( for his ambition was really more powerful than his patriotism ) , he claimed the chief command by virtue of what he called his superior commission . This was objected to , fo ' he came single-handed , without officers or troops ; and the soldiers declared they would club their muskets and march homeward rather than serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of necessity , the ambitious Arnold joined the party as *a volunteer , and on the evening of the 9th , after stealthy marches , two hundred and seventy resolute men ( of whom two hundred and thirty were Green Mountain Boys ) were encamped on the shore of Lake Champlain , opposite Ticonderoga , while the garrison were totally unsuspicious of the presence of an enemy . On the previous day Phelps had gone forward , gained admission into the fort as an awkward inhabitant of the neighborhood wh wished to be shaved , and , asking many sii*questions , obtained a great amount of necess*1nformation , and then returned to the camp . The night-clear , starry , and a little frostywore away , and yet the boats expected from Skenesborough or below did not arrive . With the few in possession , Allen , with the officers and eighty-three men , crossed the lake and landed beneath the steep shore under the Gren adiers ' Battery . Nathan Beman , then a shrewd lad , and afterward a famous wolf-hunter in the northern wilderness , consented to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fort , where he played daily with the boys of the garrisn . The day had almost dawned , yet the boats had not returned with more troops . IJelay would be dangerous , and Allen was about to proceed with the fourscore men , when Arnold declared , with an oath , that he alone wonld lead the men into the fort . Allen as stoutly swore that he should not . Fortunately the prudence of others put an end to the dispute by a compromise , which *dltwed Arnold to march by the side of Allen , the latter , however , to be considered the chief commander . Again Arnold was compelled to yield , and just as the east was brightening with the unfolding day , the little band were drawn up , in three ranks , upon the shore , a few rods from the fort . Stealthily but quickly they ascended the eminence to the sally-port . The sentinel snapped his fusee , but it missed lire , and he retreated into the fort along the covered way , followed closely by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the area of the barracks . Another sentinel was felled by Allen 's sword , and as the invading troops rushed into the parade they gave a tremendous shout . The alarmed soldiers of the garrison leaped from their pallets , seized their arms , and rushed to the parade , but only to be made prisoners by the intrepid New Englanders . At the same moment Colonel Allen , with young Beman at his side , ascended the steps to the door of the quarters of Delaplace , the commandant of the fort , and giving three loud raps with the hilt of his sword , he , with a voice of peculiar power , ordered the captain to appear immediately or the whole garrison should be sacrificed . The commander and his wife both rushed to the door , when , to their astonishment , they saw the face of an old acquaintance , for Allen and Delaplace had long been friends . With a frown , the commander instantly demanded his disturber 's errand . Pointing to his armed men , before whom the whole garrison were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to surrender . " " By what authority do you demand it ? " said Delaplace . " In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress ! " thundered Allen , and , raising his sword over the head of the captain , who was about to speak , ordered him to be silent , and to surrender immediately . Theie was no alternative . Delaplace had about as much respect for the Continental Congress as Allen had for Jehovah , and they respectively relied upon and feared powder and ball more than either . In fact ; the Continental Congress was then but a shadow ; for it had no existence until six hours afterward , when it assembled in Carpenter 's Hall , in Philadelphia , and its " authority " was hardly acknowledged in prospect , even by the armed patriots in the field . But the order was obeyed , the garrison of forty-eight men were // made prisoners of war arid sent to Hartford , and more than a hundred iron cannon , with mortars , and swivels , and ammunition , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge , and used hy the troops under Washington in driving the British from Boston the following spring . Warner arrived , with the rear division , soon after the surrender of the fort ; and forty-eight hours afterward he was in possession of Crown Point . Arnold , ambitions for fame , was like a chafed tiger . He saw the laurels resting solely on the Green Mountain Boys , and for a moment his covetousness rose superior to his generosity . He asserted his right to the chief command of the garrison at Ticonderoga , but the troops disregarded his orders . His anger flashed out in oaths and loud thre* ts when the Connecticut Committee , clothed in semi-official authority , formally installed Allen in command , and ordered him to keep it until he should receive orders from higher authority . Arnold sent a written protest to the Massachusetts Coinmittee of Safety , but that body confirmed the action of the Connecticut Committee . Arnold yielded , and , like a good patriot and sensible man , he joined Allen in planning other enterprises . The upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Englanders . Major Skene and his people at Skenesborough had been captured by the party sent thither from Castleton , and with a schooner and several bateaux they were brought to Ticonderoga . These vessels formed the nucleus of a fleet on the lake , and with these Allen and Arnold proALLaN AT Tt*ONDEaOO* // qwq ment , which , if it had been commenced when first proposed by him , before the British Government had concentrated its strength to repel invasion , might have resulted in an easy conquest of Canada , instead of such a disastrous failnre as marked the campaign in the winter of 1775- " 76 . On the arrival of Colonel Hinman at Ticonderoga , Colonel Allen 's command ceased , and most of his men went home . With Seth Warner he immediately went to Philadelphia to ask the Continental Congress to pay the Green Mountain Boys for their military services , and to authorize him to raise a new regiment in the New Hampshire Grants . Their appearance in Philadelphia created a great sensation . Their heroism was known , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they walked along the streets , and the passage to Carpenters Hall , where Congress was sitting , was filled with people anxious to get a glimpse of the Goliath of the Green Mountains who had defied the armies of Tryon . They were introduced upon the floor of Congress , and allowed to state their desires verbally . And their wishes were gratified . The soldiers who assisted in capturing the Champlain fortresses were allowed the same pay as those in the Continental army just organized ; and Congress asked the Provincial Convention of New York to first consult General Schuyler , and with his approval to authorize the raising of a regiment of Green Mountain Boys , " under such officers as the said Green Mountain Boys should choose . " This accomplished , Allen and Warner hastened ta New York , and boldly presented themselves at the door of the Convention . The resolve of Congress had already been received , and was then under discussion . The Convention represented the same people who elected the Assembly of the previous year , by whom Allen and Warner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could they receive such men ? To some it was a perplexing question . Some bowed to the authority of law as supreme , notwithstanding they had repudiated those lawgivers as " enemies of their country . " Others could not quiet the suggestions of their consciences that these men were outcasts ; but others , forgetting the past , and looking only upon the recent brave and patriotic deeds of these men in the cause of liberty , vehemently asserted the injustice and impolicy of allowing ancient local feuds to divide brothers in a common and holy cause . The debate was suddenly cut short by Isaac Sears  --  the brave King Sears  --  the leader of the Sons of Liberty from the Stamp Act times , who moved that Ethan Allen should be admitted to the floor of the House . An overwhelming vote was given in the affirmative , and the same privilege was granted to Seth Warner . They entered , and both addressed the House ; and when they had retired , the Convention proceeded to authorize the raising of a regiment . General Schuyler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclamation of that noble patriot to the Grants , announcing the pleasing fact that five hundred Green Mountain Boys were wanted for the war , and that they might choose their own officers below a colonel . The regiment was soon raised , and Seth Warnerwas chosen Lieutenant-Colonel , it being understood , probably , that Allen would receive the appointment of Colonel . A few days after his return he joined General Schuyler as a volunteer , at Ticonderoga , and from thence sent a letter of thanks to the New York Provincial Convention , in which he feelingly alluded to " the friendship and union that had lately taken place " between those who bad been unhappily controverting for years . In conclusion he spoke of the fidelity and courage of the Green Mountain Boys , and said , " I will be responsible , that they will reciprocate this favor by boldly hazarding their lives , if need be , in the common cause of America . " General Schuyler 's quick perception made him regard Colonel Allen as an exceedingly useful man , if he could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some reluctance , and he was chiefly employed as a pioneer among*the Canadians , with whom he was well acquainted . On arriving with his forces at Isle Aex Noix , near the foot of the lake , General Schuyler wrote an address to the people of Canada , especially intended for the French inhabitants , and commissioned Allen to bear it to them , and to use his influence in winning them to the support of the Americans . It told them that the invading army was not directed against them , their religion , or their property , but only against the British ; and earnestly exhorted them to make common cause with the Americans in efforts to secure freedom . Allen first went to Chambl6e , twelve miles below St. John 's , and , mingling with the most intelligent and influential inhabitants there , soon received assurances of their sympathy and aid , if success could be made to appear probable ; To show their sincerity , they furnished him with an armed escort through the forests , from place to place , and he every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friendship from the Caughnawaga Indians near Montreal ; and after traversing the country between the Sorel and the St. Lawrence for eight days , he returned to the camp and reported to General Schuyler his belief that , should the American army invest St. John 's and advance into Canada with a respectable force , the inhabitants would immediately join them . For his prudence , sagacity , industry , and perseverence in this dangerous mission Colonel Allen was highly commended by General Schuyler . At isle Aux Noix General Schuyler sickened , and was compelled to leave the command of the army with General Montgomery and return to his home at Saratoga . Montgomery was then besieging St. John 's , and he immediately sent Colonel Allen into Canada again to unite as many inhabitants as he could in favor of the // qwq granted . Only thirty-eight of his companions remained , and thesebecame his fellow-prisoners . They were well treated by the British officers on the field ; but when Allen was brought before that petty tyrant , General Prescott , who possessed no generous impulses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victor at Ticonderoga , he exhibited extreme passion , brandished his cane over Allen 's head , and threatened to beat him . At the same time he used coarse and unfeeling language , denouncing Allen as a rebel , and promising him death on the gallows at Tyburn . " I told him , ' says Allen , " he would do well not to cane me , for I was not accustomed to it , and shook my fist at him , telling him that was the beatle of mortality for him , if he offered to strike . " Prescott was greatly enraged , yet he feared his unarmed captive ; so , in violation of all honor nd the common rules of war , he ordered his prisoner to be bound hand and foot in irons , and thrust into a confined portion of the Gaspi schooner of war . His irons were heavy shackles on wrists and ankles , fastened to a bar eight feet in length . A generous seaman lent him his chest to sit upon , and that was his only seat by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five long weeks , was this brave man fettered , and guarded by men With bayonets , while almost hourly he was subjected to coarse jokes or deliberate insults . his companions were fettered in pairs , and suffered in the same way . In the mean time , though feeble-handed in men and munitions of war , Montgomery pushed forward the siege of St. John 's . He also sent a party to attack the garrison at Cbambl6e , twelve miles below . They were successful . One hundred men became their prisoners , and the spoils of victory were more than a hundred barrels of powder , with military stores and provisions . Tbey also took the standard of the regiment to which the garrison belonged , and this , the first trophy of the kind , was sent to the Continental Congress , and placed conspicuously over the chair of the president of that body . At the same time Carleton was endeavoring to send relief to St. John 's . He embarked quite a large number of troops at Montreal , with a view of landing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this he was foiled by Colonel Seth Warner and three hundred Green Mountain Boys , who signally repulsed him . On learning this event , some British troops at the mouth of the Sorel immediately fled to Quebec , and the commander at St. John 's , despairing of relief from Carleton , surrendered to Montgomery . Prescott and Carleton now became alarmed for the safety of Montreal , and fearing an attempt to rescue Allen and his fellow-prisoners , they sent them all down to Quebec . There the Colonel was transferred to another vessel , and soon to a third , where he experienced humane treatment and the courtesy due to his rank from Captain Littlejohn . He removed the galling irons from his prisoner , invifed him to his own table , and in many ways proved the sincerity of his declaration that no brave man like Colonel Allen should be ill-used onhoardof his ship . The relief was temporary . A few days afterward Colonel Arnold , who had made a perilous journey across the country , by way of the Kennehec and Chaudibre , witb a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levi , opposite Quebec . His apparition shocked the people of that old French city as if a thunder-bolt had fallen from a clear sky . They had already heard of the fall of St. John 's and the surrender of Montreal to Montgomery , and many regarded Quebec as in imminent danger . The ship Adamant was on the point of sailing for England with dispatches to the Ministry , and Carleton resolved to send his prisoners thither by the same vessel . Tbey were placed in the charge of the notorious spy , Brooke Watson , then a merchant of Montreal and afterward Lord Mayor of London . They were also accompanied by Guy Johnson , Daniel Clans , and about thirty other Loyalists who had been driven from the Mohawk Valley . Under such a maP , and in such company , the unhappy prisoners could expect no mercy . They were closely confined in irons in a small , unventilated apartment , where they suffered from sickness and other privations , and were daily annoyed by palpable insults . Yet they were allowed sufficient food , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they thus suffered , when the Adamant sailed into the harbor of Portsmouth , and there , for the first time , the prisoners were allowed to enjoy the fresh air and the blessed sunlight upon the deck . When intelligence of their arrival spread through the town great multitudes flocked to see them ; and as the guard escorted them to Pendennis Castle the streets , windows , and the tops of houses were crowded with people anxious to get a glimpse of the famous leader of the Green Mountain Boys , whose exploits on the shores of Lake Champlain had become known throughout the realm . Allen was , indeed , a rough and curious specimen of a New Englander ; for he was dressed in the suit of Canadian clothes in which he was captured , which consisted of a short double-breasted fawn-skin jacket , vest of the same material , breeches of coarse sagathay , worsted stockings , a decent pair of shoes , two plain shirts , and a red worsted cap . His beard and hair had grown long , shaggy , and matted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized man of Saxon blood . Governor Hamilton , of Pendennis Castle , treated the prisoners kindly , and Colonel Allen with distinction . He dared not disobey orders by removing his irons , but he sent a breakfast and dinner every day from his own table , and occasionally a bottle of wine ; while another gentleman sent him bountiful suppers . His stomach had never before been served so well ; and people of every class , prompted by curiosity , came to see him , for they regarded the captor of the renowned Ticonderoga as no ordinary man . All , however , agreed that he would prob // ably be hanged , and this gave Allen some uneasiness . Yet he maintained his self-possession , and charmed every person who came to see him by his bold and independent carriage , bis flnency of language , and his display of strong native talent . He never lowered his high patriotic tone of sentiment when speakin' of his conntry ; and , with bands and feet manacled , and high walls and glittering bayonets around him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance to oppression until the hand of the oppressor was withdrawn . Having reason to fear death on the gallows , Colonel Allen concluded to employ stratagem for effect on the policy of the Ministry . He obtained permission to write to Congress . As the letters must be seen by his jailers , it was concluded that he would speak of the hopelessness of the cause , the necessity of submission , flatter the Government by loyal words and acknowled , , ments of clemency , and that he would advise them to cease rebellion and a*ce1 t pardon . They were disappointed . I-Ic gave a truthful narrative of his cruel treatment ; told how he was kept in irons in England like a felon , instead of being respected as an unfortunate prisoner of war ; and requested Congress to refrain from the terrible retaliation in their power to exercise until they should be advised of the final action of the Government toward himself and fellow-prisoners . The letter was addressed in his bold handwriting , to " The Illustrious Continental Congress . " " Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom Allen handed the communication , " and would send your letter to Concress with instructions to retaliate on our own people ? I have scat your letter to Lord North . " That was precisely what the cunning prisoner desired . " This , " says Allen , " gave me inward satisfaction , though I carefully concealed it with a pretended resentment ; for I found I had come Yankee over him , and that the letter had gone to the identical person I had desi*ned it for . " No doubt that letter had the intended TaB raisoxans iN THE STREETS OF PORTSMOUTH . // effect ; for it gave the Ministry knowledge of the situation of the prisoners , and the important fact that their countrymen possessed full power to retaliate any acts of violence which might be used against these unfortunate men . The unjust treatment of these prisoners gave the Opposition inParliament a powerful weapon , which they used against the Ministry with effect . They argued that they were either rebels and felons or else unfortunate prisoners of war ; and added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of rebellion , and propose to quell an insurrection by hanging a few insurgents , when a continent of such rebels was in arms . A rumor also went abroad that a writ of habeas corpus was about to be issued to set the prisoners free or to bring them to trial before a proper magistrate . The Ministry became alarmed by the rising clamors of the popular voice , and , yielding to the logic of events , changed their policy . They consented to consider Allen and his companions prisoners of war , and , as such , they were placed on board the Solebay frigate , of Sir Peter Parker 's fleet , to be conveyed to Halifax . That fleet was then preparing for the expedition against the Carolinas which resulted so disastrously to the British , in the summer of 1776 . Allen was soon made to feel that neither clemency nor civil treatment were to be expected from Symonds , the commander of the Solebay . The first salutation which that official gave to the captive Colonel was , " Go below , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place where only gentlemen may walk ! " The indignant Colonel obeyed ; but , two days afterward , having shaved and arranged his toilet as well as he could , he boldly appeared on deck . The commander was greatly enraged by this effrontery ; nor was his anger abated when the prisoner told him coolly that he was Colonel Allen , and a " gentleman , " and had a perfect right to walk the deck . As usual , the cowardice of the petty tyrant compromised the matter , and , with an oath , he ordered the Colonel to be careful not to walk on the same side of the deck with himself and other officers . As an example of obedience to the crew Allen obeyed , and always kept on the leeward side , but paced the planks with as much haughty dignity of demeanor as Symonds himself could possibly assume . Parker 's fleet rendezvoused in the harbor of Cork , from whence it sailed for America toward the middle of February , 1776 . While there , the prisoners experienced the proverbial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became known that Allen and his fellow-captives were on board the Solebay , several gentlemen of Cork combined in presenting each of the common prisoners with a good suit of clothes , an overcoat , and two shirts ; and to Allen they gave a sufficient quantity of broadcloth for two suits , also eight shirts and stocks ( ready made ) , several pairs of silk and worsted hose , shoes , and two beaver hats , one of which was richly trimmed with lace . They also furnished him bountifully with sea-stores , and offered him fifty guineas in gold . He would accept only seven guineas , because , he said , " it might have the appearance of avarice . " To the other prisoners they also gave a good supply of tea and sugar . All of these things were taken on board by the second lieutenant during the absence of the commander . Symonds was exceedingly angry when informed of it . He swore that " the American rebels should not be feasted at that rate by the rebels of Ireland ; " and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea and sugar of the common prisoners among his own crew . A terrible storm compelled the fleet to return to Cork , where the prisoners were separated , and placed in different vessels . Allen remained in the Solebay , and was fortunate enough to be permitted to employ the ship 's tailor in making him a fine suit of clothes of his broadcloth . Arrayed in these , with his silk stockings and fine laced hat , his really noble and dignified appearance seemed to inspire Symonds with a sentiment of respect , and he treated his captive with more civility . The voyage was a long one , and they did not reach the American coast , at the mouth of the Cape Fear River , in North Carolina , until early in May . There the prisoners were reunited ( except one who had died , and another who had escaped by swimming ashore ) , and were placed on board the 2llercury , to be conveyed to Halifax . Montague , the commander , was an ignorant , prejudiced brute , and denied the unfortunate men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in sickness . Allen remonstrated with him , but received in reply the assurance that their treatment was a matter of no moment , as they would all be hanged as soon as they arrived at Halifax , and that General Washington and the Continental Congress would soon share the same fate . " If you wait for that event , " said Allen , with a voice and countenance full of severe rebuke , you 'll die of old age. ** On the voyage the vessel touched at Sandy Hook , below the outward harbor of New York ( Raritan Bay ) , in which a British fleet , under Admiral Howe , was moored . Washington then had possession of the city of New York , and Governor Tryon and other royal officials were fugitives on board the flag-ship of Lord Howe . Tryon , and the old Attorney-General Kemp , whom Allen had met at Albany during the bitter controversies between New York and the New Hampshire Grants , came on board the Mercury . They saw and knew Allen , but did not speak to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with a stern countenance , as I was walking on the leeward side the deck with the midshipmen ; and adds , " What passed between the officers of the ship and these visitors I know not ; but this I know , that my treatment from the officers was more severe afterward . " The prisoners arrived at Halifax at about the middle of June ; and for six weeks they were // confined on board a sloop , in that harbor , under the immediate command of the brutal Montague . There they were treated with the greatest cruelty . They were half-starved ; denied the services of a physician , though many were sick with the scurvy ; and , finally , the commander , to whom Allen had addressed several respectful letters , petitioning for some relief , forbade any more letters being brought to him from " the rebel . " At length the Colonel found means to communicate with Governor Arbuthnot . The prisoners were immediately placed in Halifax jail , sufficient food given them , and the attendance of a physician allowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them crowded in a small room , some sick with the scurvy . Soon some were sent to the hospital , others were sent to labor on the public works , and by the close of August only thirteen of the captives taken with him at Montreal remained with Colonel Allen . Among the prisoners whom Allen found in Halifax jail was James Lovell , of Boston , who had been carried thither when the British evacuated that city in the preceding spring , because lie was an influential patriot . He afterward became a member of the Continental Congress , and active as one of the committee on foreign affairs . Although entitled to a parole , it had been withheld , and , with others who claimed VOL . XVIJ. - No. 102. -3 A the same privilege , he was kept in close confinement . When Allen 's friends heard of his arrival at Halifax they joined with those of Lovell in Massachusetts , and of others from Connecticut , in efforts to procure their exchange . While these negotiations were going on , and partial arrangements were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prisoners , Howe ordered those at Halifax to be sent to New York . This order produced a happy change in the condition of the captives , for they were placed on board the Lark frigate , which was commanded by a gentleman and humane man , Captain Smith . " When I came on deck , " says Allen , " he met me with his hand , welcomed me to his ship , invited me to dine with him that day , and assured me that I should be treated as a gentleman " by himself and his ship 's crew . This unexpected kindness made the big tears roll down the hardy hero 's cheek , and the emotions of gratitude made him speechless for a moment . As soon as he could command his voice , Colonel Allen assured the Captain that his kindness should be reciprocated , if an opportunity should . allow the service . " This is a mutable world , " said Captain Smith , " and one gentleman never knows but it may be in his power to help another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aanuxiae TIlE MUTINEERS . // the sentiment of the humane commander was signally verified . There were about thirty American prisoners , besides Allen and Lovell , on board the Lark , and among them was one who bad recently been commander of an American armed schooner . A few days after leaving Halifax he had succeeded in forming a conspiracy , with part of the prisoners , to kill Captain Smith , seize the vessel , and divide among themselves almost two hundred thousand dollars of hard money , known to be on board . They had also enlisted some of the crew in their scheme . The chief conspirator revealed his designs to Allen and Lovell , and solicited their co-operation in bringing 6ver the remainder of the prisoners . Allen did not allow a thought of the justification of the rules of war for such an infamous act to intrude itself , but immediately and most decidedly condemned the scheme as a base and wicked return for kind treatment . He assured the ringleader that he would peril his own life in defense of that of Captain Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solicited Allen to remain neutral , and let them proceed , in their own way . This concession he peremptorily refused , and promised them pardon and secrecy only on condition that they should solemnly pledge themselves to abandon the design instantly . They cowered b3neath the rebuking glance of his stern eye , gladly accepted his terms , and Colonel Allen had the pleasure of thus paying his debt of gratitude to the excellent Captain Smith . Toward the end of Octobar the Lark arrived in the harbor of New York , and the prisoners were placed on board the Glasgow transport . Mr. Lovell was soon afterward exchanged and set at liberty , but Colonel Allen was only admitted to parole within the limits of the city . He landed at about the first of December , and a day or two afterward a scene occurred between him and Rivington , the " King 's printer , " the memory of which undoubted tradition has pre served . Allen had been made acquainted with the course pursued by Rivington toward the Whigs , and the harsh manner in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his long captivity . Being free to act within the limits of his parole , he resolved to chastise the offending printer , and made no secret of his resolution . Rivington was informed of it , and was prepared for the reception of the wrathy Colonel . He saw him one day , just after dinner , come up the street and stop at his door . " I was certain the hour of reckoning had come , " says Rivington , in his humorous account of the interview . " There was no retreat . He entered the sore and asked of the clerk , Does James Rivington live here ? ' He answered , Yes , Sir . ' Is he at home ? ' He said he would see , and went up to my room to inquire what should be done . I had made up my mind . I looked at the bottle of Madeira-possibly took a glass . There was a fearful moment of suspense . I heard him on the stairs . In he stalked . Is your name James Rivington ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more happy than I am to see Colonel Ethan Allen . ' Sir , I have come- ' Not another word , my dear Colonel , until you have taken a seat and a glass of old Madeira . ' But , Sir , I do n't think it proper- ' Not another word , Colonel . Taste this wine ; I have had it in glass for ten years . Old wine , you know , unless it is originally sound , never improves by age . ' He took the glass , swallowed the wine , smacked his lips , and shook his head approvingly . Sir , I come- ' Not another word until you have taken another glass ; and then , my dear Colonel , we will talk of old affairs ; and I have some droll events to detail . ' In short , " says Rivington , " we finished two bottles of Madeira , and parted as good friends as if we never had cause to be otherwise . " The tender heart of Colonel Allen was sorely afflicted by the scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . The sugar - houses , the jail , and old // hulks in the harbor were used as prisons for the captives taken in the recent battles near Brooklyn and Fort Washington . Privation , sickness , and death held high carnival there ; and the picture of their sufferings , drawn by the unpolished pen of Colonel Allen , chills the blood and makes the involuntary curse upon the inflictors rise to the lips and plead for utterance . These things are on the records of history ; and we will here pass them by with the remark that all that Colonel Allen could do , in his own destitute condition , by his official influence , for the relief of the sufferers , was done by him in full measure during his parole . He also suffered much , for he became destitute of money , and was not allowed communication with his friends in Vermont . Yet his stout heart was not moved by personal troubles , nor his zeal for liberty in the least subdued ; and when a British officer of high rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though in a wrong cause , and the desire of General Howe to show him great favors , by appointing him commander i a regiment of Loyalists , and then tried to dazzle him with brilliant prospects of official promotion , and the possession of large sums of money and broad acres of land by the thousand in whichever of the subdued colonies he might choose them , the inflexible patriot indignantly spurned the tempter , saying , in his own recorded language , " That if by faithfulness I had recommended myself to General Howe , I should be loth , by unfaithfulness , to lose the General 's good opinion ; besides that , I viewed the offer of land to be similar to that which the devil offered to Jesus Christ , to give him all the kingdoms of the world if he would fall down and worship him , when , at the same time , the damned soul had not one foot of land upon earth . This , " says Allen , " closed the conversation , and the gentleman turned from me with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Colonel Allen , with a bigot 's tenacity , adhered to that bigotry , which was , properly defined , true patriotism . The bold and powerful stroke given to British power on the frozen banks of the Delaware , and which put many prisoners into the hands of the Americans , caused a slight lifting of the heel of oppression from the poor captives in New York . Allen was allowed to go to Long Island early in January , 1777 , where his condition was quite tolerable , by comparison . There , within prescribed limits , he remained until the following August , when , under the false pretense that he had infringed his parole , he was conducted by a strong guard to New York , and immured in the provost jail . There he lay for three days , without a morsel of food , and exposed to the insults of Keef , the sergeant of the guard , who stood at his door and administered prison law under the brutal provost marshal , Cunniughtim . At sunset on the third day the sergeant gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week afterward he was transferred to a more comfortable apartment . There he remained in close confinement until the following May , sometimes treated to a day in the dungeon below becausc of his freedom of speech in the presence of Keef . Soon after the capture of Burgoyne the fact became known to one of his fellow-prisoners in a room above . He communicated the news to Colonel Allen by thrusting a little billet through the open floor into his room . The overjoyed patriot could not suppress his emotions , and he shouted from his grated window to some British soldiers in the street , " Burgoyne has marched to Boston to the tune of Yankee Doodle 1 " For this he spent a night in the damp dungeon , and was menaced with more severe punishment ; hut the fact which he had proclaimed was so significant of danger to scores of British officers in the power of the Americans tl*t good treatment of Colonel Allen appeare*l to be wise policy . Allen 's captivity ended on the 3d of May , 1778 , when he was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was exchanged for Colonel Archibald Campbell , of the British army , who was brought there by Elias Boudinot , Commissary of Prisoners . Campbell " saluted me , " says Allen , " in a very handsome manner ; saying that he never was more glad to see any gentleman in his life ; and I gave him to understand . that I was equally glad to see him , and was apprehensive that it was from the same motive . " They all parted with friendly expressions ; and Colonel Sheldon , of the Li , ht Horse , immediately escorted Colonel Allen to the head-quarters of the army at Valley Forge . Washington received him most cordially ; an ( l Allen poured out the gratitude of his full heart for the interest the Commander-lu-Chief had taken in his behalf during his long and cruel captivity of thirty-one months . He obtained permission of Washington to return to his home to recruit his health and strength . He then set off for the North in company with General Gates , who was proceeding to Fishkill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Already the Continental Congress , sitting at York , had honored Allen with a brevet commission of colonel in the regular army , and awarded him back pay as lieutenant-colonel during his captivity . Bearing these testimonials of his country 's gratitude , the gallant soldier hastened homeward , every where r*ceiving the most marked attention of people of mill classes . Early in the evening of the last day of May he arrived at Bennington . His appearance there was unexpected , for his friends supposed he had gone to Valley Forge to join the army for actual service . The news of his arrival spread from house to house . The people of the neighborhood gathered around him with every expression of joy ; and the Green Mountain Boys gave audibility to these expressions among the distant hills by firing cannons , and shouting long and loud huzzas . At sunrise the next morning the whole country around was in motion ; and Colonel Herrick , who had nobly seconded Stark in the battle near Bennington the previous year , // ordered fourteen discharges of cannon- " thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " One for Young Vermont I " In that there was deep significance . During Allen 's long captivity the people of the New Hampshire Grants had been making rapid political progress . They had , in convention at Westminster , in January , 1777 , declared themselves free and independent of New Hampshire , New York , and all other sovereignties ; adopted a State Constitution , and organized a new government , under the title of VERMONT , in allusion to its chief physical feature - the Green Mountains . This movement had awakened the old feud between the inhabitants of that territory and New York . Governor Clinton , and other active men in the latter State , had from the beginning opposed the claims of Vermont to independence ; and the new government of New York , established a few mouths later , reasserted the supremacy of that State over the territory east of Lake Champlain to the Connecticut River . The bloody enactments , and the claims to lands occupied by settlers , promulgated by the Colonial Assembly , were not revived ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that shape it was sufficiently important to array the Green Mountain Boys against New York ; and hence the significance of that one gun for Vermont . " Colonel Allen soon comprehended the state of affairs . He regarded Vermont as in the right position , and immediately panoplied himself in her defense . The old colonial battleground again felt his tread , and his voice was more potent than ever among his former companions and associates . he counseled great caution , for he saw fatal danger covered by the fair professions of New York ; and he resolved to reject every proposal , from whatever quarter , which did not imply the absolute independence of Vermont . He embodied this sentiment and a recapitulation of past grievances in an address which he sent forth to the inhabitants of Vermont . Sagacity , logic , forecast , and patriotism marked that document , and it met a hearty response . It was respectful , hut defiant ; and closed with the peroration , " What enemy of the State of Vermont , or what New York landALLEN IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand before you in the day of your fierce anger I " We can not , in the space allotted to this article , detail the progress of that controversy , and the important part which Colonel Allen performed in the drama until its close . It became exceedingly complicated , especially when British interference formed an essential element . We may only touch briefly such more luminous points as serve to exhibit the character of our hero in a proper light . New Hampshire , from which Vermont had separated , became a party in the quarrel , because several of its western townships had been , at their own request , annexed to the latter State . The Continental Congress had been appealed to , in the summer of 1778 , for its adjudication ; and the Legislature of Vermont appointed Colonel Allen its agent to go before the Supreme National Council at Philadelphia for the special purpose of ascertaining the views of that body respecting the independency of the new commonwealth . He soon found his mission to be more difficult than he expected . Faction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England delegates favored Vermont ; those of New York , of course , opposed it ; those of the Middle and Southern States were indifferent ; and some denied the power of Congress to act in the matter at allaffirming , in the excess of their zeal for State Rights , that Vermont , by its own act , was irrevocably independent . Colonel Allen went home a wiser man , yet not with a satisfied spirit . While he felt certain that Congress would not deny the independence of Vermont , he felt quite as certain that the new State , as long as that independence was claimed , would be left exposed to invasions from Canada , without material aid or general sympathy . He immediately advised a settlement of all difficulties with New Hampshire , by giving back her truant townships ; and he earnestly urged the inhabitants of the new State to adhere to their Declaration of Independence at all hazards . He also wrote and published , in 1779 , a treatise entitled " A Viedication of the Opposition of the Inhabitants of Vermont to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Form an Independent State . " Its falchion blows aroused the ire of the people of New York ; find John Jay wrote , " There . is quaintness , impudence , and art in it . " " He might have added , " says Sparks , " argument , and the evidences of a good cause . * Colonel Allen was now the great civil and military leader in Vermont . He was appointed general-in-chief of the militia , and was continually engaged in public affairs . The people felt some irritation at the course of Congress ; and their leaders , perceiving a disposition on the part of the other colonies to remain apathetic , at least , resolved to take measures for establishing an isolated and wholly independent sovereignty . This disposition was observed by the British authorities in Canada , and it was made a basis for reporting to the British Ministry that Vermont , without doubt , might be drawn over to the side of the Crown . Machinery working for that important end was immediately put in motion . The leaders were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high authority . The duty devolved upon Colonel Beverly Robinson , then commander of a corps of loyalists , and who figured somewhat conspicuously , some months later , in the treason of Arnold . He wrote from New York to Ethan Allen in March , 1780 . He alluded to the fact that they were both American ; that he lamented the distresses of his native country ; that he had been informed that Allen , and other leading men in Vermont , were opposed to the wild scheme of separation from Great Britain promulgated by the Continental Congress ; that the people of that commonwealth might enjoy protection and happiness under Great Britain , as a separate province ; and asked Allen to communicate freely with him , as all matters between them should be shrouded in the most profound secrecy . The letter was sent by a British soldier , disguised as a farmer , who handed it to Allen in the streets of Arlington . Allen dismissed him with much courtesy , and then laid the document before Governor Chittenden and other friends . Their sagacity perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve the political interests of Vermont ; and they resolved to pass the letter over in silence , but to keep up a show of disaffection by coquetting with the British authorities in Canada . A friendly letter was accordingly dispatched by Governor Chittenden to General Haldimand , in Canada , proposing a cartel for an exchange of prisoners - some scouts from Vermont having been made captive . This proceeding was to cause a delay in any contemplated invasion of the defenseless frontier of Vermont , from the St. Lawrence or the lake . No reply was made ; but soon a formidable British force appeared on Lake Champlain . The people were thoroughlyalarmed , and seized their arms to repel the invaders . To their surprise no hostilities were attempted . The British commander sent a flag to General Allen , with a letter to Governor Chittenden , assenting to the proposed cartel , and offering a truce with Vermont until the matter should be arranged . General Allen was appointed to negotiate the preliminaries of the cartel . Wishing to make friends of the New York borderers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the shores of Lake Champlain and the Hudson River . The privilege was granted , and the enmity of the people of that region was so completely disarmed that a general desire to have their territory annexed to Vermont was expressed . The negotiations resulted satisfactorily to both parties ; and , to the utter surprise of the people , the enemy 's fleet moved down the lake , and the Vermont military force was disbanded and sent home at the moment when all expected invasion , and conquest appeared so easy . At that time the British force in Canada was about ten // thousand strong , while the Vermont militia did not exceed seven thousand . The whole secret was known only at that time to General Allen , his brother Ira ( then a colonel of militia ) , and six other judicious friends who controlled the public affairs of the State . The winter soon afterward set in , and nothing more was done until spring . Vermont was saved from invasion , and the enemy rejoiced in the supposed advantage of having detached a discontented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements were carefully reported to the British Ministry , and also gave uneasiness to Congress . Lord George Germain , Colonial Secretary , indulged in many pleasing dreams of the submission of the colonists , while sitting in his easy chair in London ; and he wrote a congratulatory letter to Sir Henry Clinton , in New York , on " the happy return of the people of Vermont to their allegiance , " at the very time when events were hastily tending toward the discomfiture of Coruwallis and the overthrow *f British power within the domain of the revolted colonies . The British officers in New York were also well acquainted with the movements of the Vermont leaders ; and Colonel Robinsonwonderedwhy hisletter hadneverheen answered by General Allen . He finally wrote another in the same strain to that officer ; and at about the same time Allen received notice of the appointment of commissioners in Canada to arrange the cartel . Now was an opportunity to work upon the fears of Congress for the benefit of Vermont , and General Allen used it adroitly . He sent to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Haldimand respecting the commission , together with a letter from himself , in which he explained the mode by which the communications came into his hands , and other matters in relation to the proposed cartel . Then , in the most forcible language , he uttered an eloquent defense of the conduct of the inhabitants of Vermont , reiterated her claims to independent sovereignty , and referred indignantly to the attempt of neighbors to not only abridge her rights , but to destroy her existence . " I am confident , " he remarked , " that Congress will not dispute my sincere attachment to the cause of my country , though I do not hesitate to say I am fully grounded in opinion that Vermont has an indubitable right to agree on terifis of a cessation of hostilities with Great Britain , provided the United States persist in rejecting her application for a union with them . " He concluded his letter with these significant words : " I am as resolutely determined to defend the independence of Vermont as Congress are that of the United States ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hardy Green Mountain Boys , into the desolate caverns of the mountains , and wage war with human nature at large . " The coquetry with the British authorities in Canada continued during the remainder of the war . A correspondence , carried on chiefly by Ethan and Ira Allen , was kept up , and mes sengers from beyond the St. Lawrence came to them secretly , were detained until answers could be prepared , and then as secretly were sent back . Colonel Ira Allen also made friendly visits to General Haldimand . Thus they amused the enemy , kept back invasion , made Congress uneasy , sustained their claims to independence , but were compelled to suffer the effects of suspicion concerning their patriotism . But these were all removed from their fair fame when peace came , and concealment became no longer a necessity , and the escutcheons of Ethan and Ira Allen are as free from the tarnish of wavering patriotism or inconsistency as those of any of the men of the Revolution whom we delight to honor . Although appointed colonel in the Continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office . His time was fully employed with the civil and military affairs of Vermont . Soon after his return from his captivity , in 1778 , he was elected to a seat in the State Legislature . How long he occupied that station , or how late in life he retained his military command , we have now no means of ascertaining ; for the record , if ever made , has been lost . When rising peace blessed the land with its beams , in 1782 , he returned to the pleasant pursuits of the farmer-not , however , among his old friends at Bennington , but in a newer region of his beloved Vermont . For a short time he resided at Arlington , and afterward at Sunderland . At length he settled in the vicinity of Onion River , near the scene of some of his earlier exploits against New York intruders , where , with his brothers , he had purchased large tracts of land . There he remained , in the enjoyment of the quiet of agricultural life , until his death , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apoplexy , in February , 1789 . His funeral was largely attended ; and , as we have said at the commencement of this sketch , he was buried within sound of the cascades of the Winooski . Ethan Allen possessed a vigorous but partially cultivated intellect , and his niitural independence of thought often led his mind far away from the beaten tracks of human investigation . In religion he became a free-thinker ; and , in 1782 , he gave expression to his opinions in a little book , entitled " Reason the only Oracle of Man ; or , a Compendious System of Natural Religion . " It was published at Bennington two years later , and attracted much attention , especially among the orthodox divines of New England , who severely condemned it . While it possesses many striking and original thoughts , it exhibits remarkable crudity in their development ; and the whole work may be regarded as a melancholy picture of the gropings of a benighted yet gifted spirit in the dark valley of human reason , unaided by the light of Divine revelation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
