Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : SONG OF THE FLOWER ANGELS . from Song of the flower angels ( 1851 ) We tend the flowers of every hue , But love the red , and white , and blue  --  Red , and white , and blue . The red is Love 's sweet blushing hue , And white is fair as Faith to view , And Truth is imaged in the blue  --  Red , and white , and blue ; Where Faith is free , and Love is true , We sow the red , and white , and blue . In Eastern Lands the seed we cast , But thorns would choke or mildew blast , Red , and white , and blue : Sweet Love was lost in passion 's fires  --  From idol-worship Faith retires  --  And Truth by despot 's power expires ,  --  Red , and white , and blue ,  --  All faded , perished , where they grew  --  The flowers of red , and white , and blue . Then to the Western world we came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red , and white , and blue . Love , and Faith , and Truth were sown  --  And oh , how strong the plants are grown ! And o'er the earth the flowers are strown , Red , and white , and blue ; For Freedom , eagle-pinioned , flew To bear the red , and white , and blue . Now in a Banner , fair to see , The hues are twined in trinity , Red , and white , and blue : The red and white , like flowers of light , And stars , as seeds , the blue bedight ; And o'er the world this Banner bright  --  Red , and white , and blue  --  Shall have a guard of angels true , Who love the red , and white , and blue .
