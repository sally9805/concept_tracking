ART . IL-YEAST-A PROBLEM . Yeast-A Problem : reprinted with corrections and additions from Frazer 's Magazine . A VERY marked and , in many respects , a gratifying change has been going on during the last few years in the light literature of the country . We have yet far too many of the vapid and strained imitations of the French Satanic School in circulation ; but each succeeding year sees the piles of impassioned and insane stuff in yellow and dingy-red covers shrinking farther away into the dusty and forgotten corners of book-stalls and shops . In England we learn that systematic efforts are made to banish from society this kind of literature , not by the arm of power , but by the substitution of healthier works . Some enterprising persons have undertaken to supply the traveling public with a " railroad literature , " which may not only please , but instruct and elevate . On the London and Northwestern Railway , for example , all the book-stands have been taken and filled with useful and healthy books . Perhaps this plan could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book trade " here is more free and unfettered . But without any plan , of systematic opposition , the public taste of America is evidently becoming cloyed with the foreign translations , and yet worse imitations , which a few years ago were the most abundant kind of light reading . This is doubtless in part the result of a natural reaction ; but we believe the Magazine literature , now so common , has done much , not only to awaken , but to gratify a better taste . Magazines are yet far from being what we desire to see them , but we are thankful for what they have done , and we cherish the hope that they will improve with age and experience . There is another feature in much of the current fictitious reading which is worthy of serious attention : we allude to the religious elements which now enter largely into a great portion of it . The Wizard of the North produced his charming fictions for their own sakes-for the sake of the story . The same is true of the works of Richardson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now the story is subordinate to some other end . Two or three volumes are thrust upon us f*Br the purpose of illustrating as many lines of moral or religious sentiment ; and each often contains a deadly poison . All kinds of reading , even the secular newspapers , deal largely in religious // sentiments and allusions , often defective , and quite as often perniciously false . Old and familiar religious terms are rapidly losing their once well understood and massy signification . Religion no longer means Christianity , and faith has become almost synonymous with credulity . A man 's piety must now , according to some , be measured by the extent of his credulity , and not by the subject matter of his belief . And many of the most popular producers of light reading evidently deem themselves " set for the defense of the truth , " and speak with an ex cathedra gravity , as if they were the only teachers worthy of a hearing . A gradual approximation has been going on for years between the better kind of works of fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Put the two side by side , and it would prove a formidable task for the wisest sabbath school superintendent or parochial librarian to tell which he must choose and which reject . Many of the works professedly published for religious people , are not much higher in religious sentiment , than bond fide romances and novels , while they are often inferior in style and execution . The amount or quantity of religious truth in both seems to be regulated by the homceopathic principle . This process of approximation or assimilation , going on between the literature of the world and religious literature , may help to explain what is now pretty evidently the condition of the church . The world and the church are much nearer together than formerly . This is evident in the manners , the spirit and the business of the present day . And the peculiarity in the current literature to which we are calling attention , may be viewed as partly the cause and partly the effect of the change in the spirit of professed Christians . Whether we are to account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been with the world 's usual shrewdness more clearly seen , and rapidly developed , than the direct , or that Christians have lowered their former high standard-flying from excess of puritanism to excess of worldliness  --  or that both these suppositions are in part correct , it seems clear that the distance between the two is less than it was in days gone by . The advance ranks in society , in Christian countries , are quite up with the rear ranks in evangelical churches , so that , should this process of assimilation continue to go on , soon conversion will be impossible , and something like Christian training will be the only work left for the church to perform . These remarks have been suggested by the work , the title of which we have placed at the head of this article . It is the production of a clergyman ; and we regard it as worthy of notice , that a greater number than formerly of ministers and of their // immediate connections are engaged in the production of the equivocal literature which stands between fiction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Yeast " ( Mr. Kingsly ) has had considerable experience in novel writing , and seems equally expert in producing romances , tragedies and sermons ! But though a clergyman , he is certainly not a very orthodox one , whether tried by the standard of Whitgift or Marsh , Philpotts or Bickersteth . He seems to be a man of quick observation , of keen sensibility , of varied but badly selected reading . It is not difficult to trace in his works the influences which have moulded his tastes and directed his observation . He was evidently bred a churchman and immersed in the milk-and-water theology yvhich now characterizes many of the English episcopalians . He was then taken and plunged into chartist politics , and afterwards into the seething caidron of German metaphysics , bubbling over with sense and nonsense , piety and blasphemy . From this trine immersion , he came out like the shot silks , showing now one , then another , and at times a variety of colors at once . " Yeast , " just passed to a second edition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of a certain class . Being written by a clergyman , it will among some exert a wider influence on that account , especially as it deals not with the positives , but the negatives of religion . It is designed to call attention not to the excellencies of Christianity , but to the objections which men of the present day bring against it . The story is miserable enough . Few will read the book for the sake of the tale , or for the love scenes which it describes . The framework of the story is so feeble as to be unable to hold together the heterogeneous materials which are crowded into it . The work bears evident marks of its Magazine origin , being a series of stirring sketches tacked together as an after-thought , by a very meagre plot . The characters which are brought upon the stage , come no one can tell whence , and go no one can tell whither . And yet the book is interesting , for the author has a rare facility of combination and description . And his broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshness even to common-place truths , and frequently disposes us to re*xamine positions which we had long supposed to be settled . This is one of the dangerous qualities of the book . Among readers who have not mastered the reasons for the opinions which they may have been taught to respect , a doubt is always a dangerous visitor . We do not like the negative , fault-finding style of discussing any subject , much less that of // religion . The following extract from the author 's preface will put us in possession of his design : " In the following pages I have attempted to show what some at least of the young in these days are thinking and feeling . I know well that my sketch is inadequate and partiaL I have every reason to believe from the criticisms which I have received since its first publication that it is , as far as it goes , correct . I put it as a problem . It would be the height of arrogance in me to do more than indicate the direction in which I think a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers may complain that I have no right to start doubts without answering them . I can only answer-would that I had started them ! would that I was not seeing them daily around me under some form or other in just the very hearts for whom one could most wish the peace and strength of a fixed and healthy faith . To the young this book can do no harm ; for it will put into their minds little but what is there already . To the elder it may do good ; for it may teach some of them , as I earnestly hope , something of the real but too often utterly unsuspected *tate of their own children 's minds ; something of the reasons of that calamitous estrangement between themselves and those who will succeed them , which is often too painful and oppressive to be confessed to their own hearts . " To effect the objects above announced , the author has invented a variety of characters , each one a type of a class , and he brings them together to make the " Yeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero is a Mr. Launcelot Smith , who is floating about on the dark ocean of doubt and infidelity ; we have as an offset , his cousin , who has just entered Rome by Dr. Pusey 's gate . We have a squire of the old school , who drinks , swears , and collects his rents ; his two daughters , one of whom is a church-woman at heart and remains such , the other is so only by education , and is converted by Mr. Smith to something which is neither Mahommedanism , Christianity , nor Germanism , but a compound of the three . We have an artist and his little wife , who believe in nothing but the beautiful , and who seem to have very little to do with the story . There is a gigantic game keeper , who appears to be the author 's beau ideal of a Christian suited to these times . He is a compound of Methodism , Chartism and Carlylism . Then there is a colonel , who lives by his wits , and , finding this rather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three churchof-England clergymen , who are utterly bewildered ( as they well ziay be ) by the strange spirits among whom they have fallen . And , passing by a host of dii Minores , we have lastly a mysterious personage , a kind of hybrid between an angel and Mephistopheles , who seems to possess powers of ubiquity ; who believes everything and yet scarcely anything as anybody else believes it ; he comes from the moon , for aught we can discover , and after lecturing Mr. Smith on various topics , suddenly disappears and carries off the principal charactcrs with him . Such are some of the " Yeast-makers " in // England . The title is appropriate to the work . It is " Yeast , " certainly , though it has not the definiteness of a " problem . " The work is clearly the production of a man of talent , and is interesting not so much for continuous reading , as for the occasional perusal of its nervous , stirring sketches . Yet we are firmly persuaded , that its tendency , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is evil , and only evil continually . " We shall now produce some of the grounds on which this conviction rests . The author of " Yeast , " like nearly all who undertake to frighten society into goodness by painting larger than life , upon a dark background , the ghastly evils which lurk within it , shows too clearly his full sympathy with all the radical and disorganizing elements which are at work . If there is any subject of which the wise King 's words are true , " there is nothing new under the sun , " it is infidelity . Its form may change like that of Proteus , but its elements are ever the same-it is only Proteus still . Thus , Mr. Kingsly does not mention a single objection which has not in substance been answered , time and again . But his head appears to have grown giddy by looking into the great " Yeast vat , " and he has himself fallen therein . As he who went to teach Ramohun Roy the principles of the Christian religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of " Yeast " shows that he is almost as " yeasty " and unsettled in mind as those whom he has stepped down to help . We object at the outset to the point of view from which his pictures are drawn ; as well as to the remedies which he suggests for existing evils . Reform and fault-finding have their cant as well as spurious religion , and we are rather plentifully supplied with reform cant at the present day . Throughout this work those who cast aside the word of God as a fable , who treat with scorn sentiments which the great and good of past ages devoutly cherished , who believe in nothing but their own discoveries , and who will have no law but their own fancies or passions which they call their " nature , " are spoken of as men of superior intellectual powers - of the first order of talent-as men who exhibit genius in some way , by the very recklessness of their course . Hear how the author makes his hero plead for himself : " What , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , wild , uneducated sportsman as a Pariah , and an outcast because he is not ashamed to be a man ? Because he can not stuff his soul 's hunger with cut and dried hearsays , but dares to think for himself ? Because he wants to believe things , and dares not be satisfied with only believing that he ought to believe them ? " In another // place , the author asks , after making Mr. Smith declare broadly his unbelief , " What was to be done with so intractable a heretic ? Call him an infidel and a materialist of course and cast him off with horror . But Argemone was beginning to find out that when people are really in earnest , it may be better sometimes to leave God 's method of educating them alone instead of calling the poor honest seekers hard names which the sp&amp;akers themselves do n't understand . " Nothing now is proof of originality or power but singularity , at least such would seem to be the sentiment of many who claim to be reformers . The sceptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate rosult of their honest search after truth . In the fashionable cant , they are spoken of as persons " intensely sincere , " " terribly in earnest , " &amp;c . All this must have a pernicious effect upon the young . It is an easy and cheap method of acquiring the reputation of genius , and of intense love of truth , simply to reject what all good men have reverenced , and to throw the reins upon the neck of an undisciplined nature . And many will be disposed to travel this broad road to notoriety , if not to fame . And we are sorry to see that Christian writers much more sound and cautious than the author of " Yeast , " sometimes sanction the cant of the times by their example . The order and rule defying spirits are " free thinkers , " who " boldly state their opinions . " They are the " independent , " the " deep and earnest thinkers , " who will " clear a path for themselves . " We have only to look around us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained a name mainly by the recklessness with which they have trampled upon all that is holy , and all that is venerated by religious men . They have not discovered a single truth that is valuable to the human family , they have not wiped one tear from the face of sorrow , they have not consoled a single mourner , nor bound up one broken heart , yet they are the men with whom wisdom will die , and to whom the praises of genius must be sung . Launcelot Smith , the hero of our author , is no exception to these remarks . All who see him call him a genius , and predict great th*gs of him ; yet he effects nothing , nor does he say anything worthy of remembrance . The only useful thing he does , is to earn a sixpence by carrying a trunk ! By looking very wise , by smiling at old prejudices , and by acting as a porter , he earned the reputation of being a man of genius . And we could find real flesh and blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the other side of the great water , who have yet done no more for their race than did the imaginary Mr. Smith . We de* mur to this absurd fashion of lionizing all who choose to run a // muck against truths which have called forth more research than they could give them , were they to live to the age of Methuselah . We have little faith in those who are puffed into notice by " mutual admiration societies , " and who are great only in posse but never in esse . Bacon would have required fruit from them ere he would have granted them his suffrage . He would have put them to the test to which the idols of the heathen were put , " let them do good or do evil , that we may he dismayed and behold it together . " It is not denied that men of high endowments often wander in the mazes of error and infidelity ; but the number of such is much smaller than has been supposed . Many who appeared great , very stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be meteors , or masses of gelatino*is matter that shone only so long as a borrowed impulse kept them careering through the sky . Self-control and subjection to law are far better proofs of force of character than the abandon , intellectual and moral , which at the present day is esteemed such mark of power . The highest created intelligences of which we have any knowledge , are subject to law and rule . They do God 's " Commandments harkening to the voice of his word . " We charge the author of " Yeast , " therefore , though it is probably without intention on his part , with giving to his readers the impression that scepticism , especially if it have a transcendental origin , is proof of mental power . It is moreover very common among writers of the school to which Mr. Kingsly belongs , to speak of these disbelieving heroes , as " sincere inquirers , " yearning for truth ; as " soul-hungry " for it , &amp;c . And their psychological condition must be learned from the number and texture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our philoso* phy nor our charity will go farther than to admit that there may be earnest , sincere minds , perplexed with doubts . But these are the exceptions and not the rule , and wherever such minds are found , they will not dwell long in an atmosphere of doubt . How minds which are filled only with negations , which believe nothing firmly , which reject revealed religion , and yet have adopted nothing in its place , can be enthusiastic or deeply in earnest , passes our comprehension . If they have adopted a new philosophy instead of Christianity , then they are no longer inquirers , and it is folly to treat them as such . If they are merely occupied with negations or doubts , they can not have much enthusiasm or earnestness . The school of modern Germanized religionists have little reference to human depravity in their speculations , and they seldom allude to the influence of the heart and its prejudices upon the adoption of a creed . // This in their estimation is a coarse and unpleasant topic , which must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is very apt to spoil a sentimental theory . We can scarcely escape the conviction that this class of writers think the Bible has outlived its day , or rather that it is not now enough for the spiritual wants of men . Hence they are trying to sink shafts into hitherto untried fields , and to bore new artesian wells from which the waters of truth and life , now so shallow or unsatisfying in the fountain which God opened up , may be supplied to the perishing . The author of " Yeast " does not once , that we can discover , appeal to the Word of God as the Book which must " end the strife when wit and reason fail . " The inadequacy of church authority is shown , but not the sufficiency of the Scriptures . And the very idea of the work under consideration is , that some new means of influencing the bold , the reckless , the intellectual , must be discovered , for the Scriptures are inadequate . " Who is there in these days who could teach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingsly . And when speaking of the poor and neglected classes , he remarks : " I am beginning to fancy strongly in spite of all the preachers say , that before ever you can make them Christians you must make them men and women . We had supposed that nothing was more firmly established by the experience of the benevolent , than that people must be christianized first , in order to raise them in the scale of being . For this among other things was the gospel given . The work of raising the fallen and degraded , must be performed in England and elsewhere , not by giving the people the dogmas of men or of the church , but the Scriptures in their purity . The best means of combating the infidelity of this or any other age , is by vindicating the truth , authority and sufficiency of God 's Word for all the spiritual wants of men , and by giving it to all with full liberty to read it , and carry out their convictions of its teachings . We have long felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can fairly point out where lies the aggressive power of infidelity in the old world . Doubtless human depravity-an evil heart of unbelief-is its fountain ; but there are certain channels often opened by the avowed friends of religion , through which this fountain pours its burning streams over a land . Infidelity of itself lacks soul and unity . It is a system or collection of negations , which can have no strong hold upon the heart . There is no unanimity among its avowed champions . It is only when scepticism can find some great social or religious evil in the community , that its forces can be rallied or uni // ted . Then they are not united among themselves , but in dislike to the real or supposed evil . The French infidels of the last century could have done nothing , even among that volatile people , but for the dreadful and glaring evils , social and religious , which then oppressed the nation . These things gave unity to the philosophers , and power to their destructive doctrines . Speculative infidelity is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if possible , of America . Two prominent characteristics of the English mind are stubborn adherence to its own way , and a strong sense of justice . These two qualities will help to explain the singular policy of England in many instances . After she has suffered for her pertinacious stubborness , her sense of justice asserts its right to reign , and she often heartily does the very things against which she sturdily fought . This has been illustrated in her contests with nearly all her colonies . We allude to these characteristics for the purpose of illustrating the infidel struggles which are from time to time revived there . Often is scepticism adopted by agitators mainly because it is a capital stone with which to pelt the men in power , ( who must defend both church and state , ) who doggedly re fuse to yield some rights demanded by the people . It was after the dreadful deluge of French infidelity , that the English government becoming convinced of the justice of many of the agitators ' claims , granted some of the most valuable reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always be found associated with some political or ecclesiastical grievance . And in proportion as these are great or widely felt , will unbelief develop itself . As French infidelity obtained the sympathy of many in England by fastening itself upon the political grievances of the times , so now German scepticism seeks support from the ecclesiastical evils of the country . So long as a dark background remain* , against which ecclesiastical and political evils may be vividly portrayed , England will be disturbed by infidel agitators , whenever the general mind is stirred and put in motion . While church and state remain , presenting the most unconquerable of forces  --  a moral vis inertke-in the way of reform , the unbelief and radicalism of other lands will find a welcome among the dissatisfied . Puseyites have multiplied and gone over to Rome , because the state has too much power over the church ; and infidels have rapidly increased because they see that the church helps to perpetuate the social evils of the state . All over the continent also hosts may be mustered whose infidelity springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fact that everywhere they find the legalized defenders of religion leagued with the government // to obstruct the progress of human freedom . It was this portentous fact that called into existence the hundreds of clubs and secret societies at which all government , human and divine , was denounced as a curse , an inveterate foe to individual freedom and right . The masses , both in England and on the continent , find their infidelity much more easily than by reading abstruse , philosophical works . There is no life or substance in mere scepticism , whatever may be its origin ; but the many are ready to adopt its badge and Shibboleth , if by these means they may hope to obtain that , which they desire and to which they feel they have a right . The fact that nearly all the leading infidels of England are contending for social and religious reform - for a political religion-an earthly " good time coming , " clearly points out the source of their infidelity and corroborates the above remark . The state of things around them rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track . But this is a view which few church-of-England men are willing to adopt . Besides the very fact that the church is allied to the state , induces men who neither love nor understand religion , to discuss the subject as they would the cornlaws , or any other subject purely of the earth , earthy . And when , in addition to this , many are taught from infancy to ignore everything but the state religion , we need not be surprised to learn that they have little respect for anything that bears religion 's sacred name . It is paying a merited compliment to the institutions of our own country , when we say that people brought up here , who have never lived in England , can not understand the state of society there . This knowledge can not be learned from books ; it can not be acquired by a mere visit to the old country . It must be obtained , if at all , by a residence amidst the institutions of the mother country , and by having a personal interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , so often repeated there and quoted here , to the effect that there any man may rise to the highest honors in whatever rank he may have been born-that there is nothing to prevent the peasant from rising to take rank with the peer-is like other boasting expressions , less than half true . iNo man can engage in active life in England , or in society , whose habits were formed there , without feeling the influence of cast at every step , without feeling that there is something harder to be overcome than the most carefully framed statutes . The influence of aristocratic institutions is around the aspiring youth like an atmosphere , and his special vexation is that he sees nothing palpable , // distinguishable in joint or limb , to hinder his advancement , while he ever feels something like an invisible curse hanging upon him . There are some who are endowed with an elasticity of spirit sufficient to overcome this , and their names are blazoned over all the world . But there are far more who are conscious of power without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And to avenge themselves on church and state , they become infidels to destroy religion , and radicals to overturn the constitution . External influences of this character , acting upon " human nature , " would make " Yeast " in any country . And the best remedy is , not the study of German infidelity , useful as that may be in its place , but a penitent return in precept and in practice to the instructions of the sacred oracles . Neither would a new philosophy , nor a new gospel , effect a cure , even though Carlyle should write that gospel , and his devout followers , like Mr. Kingsly , be employed to proclaim it . Thank God , in this country , whatever other evils we may have to combat , we have no hoary consolidated systems of oppression , political or ecclesiastical , on which agitators may nail their infidel placards . The absurdities of the cbntinent , or of the mother country , may be taken up here as the fashions are , not from want nor for comfort , but from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( slavery excepted , ) which will put into the hands of the discontented a lever to overturn society , or which may form a kind of string on which to thread their errors , and thus give them longevity , by keeping them together . When one Newman went to Rome , and the other to ruin in an opposite direction , they , being in theory still members of the national church , disturbed the whole body and created a sensation throughout the land . But here a man publishes his folly , and soon drops froirt the body to which he may have belonged into the land of silence and forgetfulness . He could borrow little from his connection with any venerable body in church or state . It would be hard to put society in this country into the yeasty state in which Mr. Kingsly declares young England to be , for here we have no grievances which can give infidelity a back bon&amp; . Scepticism can not spread by itself ; or rather it can not obtain a permanent foothold among such practical people as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political or ecclesiastical , on which it may be engrafted . We take our leave of " Yeast , " with the wish that its author would turn his talent to topics which he can discuss from a Christian point of view . The history of the past should have // satisfied him that England especially can not be frightened into reforms , nor can any people be improved either in manners or in morals , simply by exhibiting before them doubts , difficulties and corruptions. *J7 he vicious and discontented can discover these without help . It is for the Christian philanthropist to devise and apply the remedy .
