ART . V. - Report of a General Plan for the Promotion of Public and Personal Health , devised , prepared , and recommended by the Commissioners appointed by the Legislature of Massachusetts , relating to a Sanitary Survey of the State . Boston : Dutton &amp; Wentworth , State Printers . 1850 . Svo. pp. 544 . THE character and purpose of sanitary science are such , that every one is directly interested in diffusing a knowledge of it as widely as possible . It does not , like medical science , offer to cure diseases , but aims to prevent them . It is based upon well-observed and accurately-recorded facts . Drawing its inferences from a careful observation of the lamentable results of the actual mode of life , both of communities and individuals , it does not present a new theory of living , but points out the evils which may be avoided , and the advantages which may be gained by obedience to sanitary laws . It is no vague project for lengthening the natural term of life . It holds out no promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be reckoned by centuries . Its only promise is to remove whatever artificially curtails or saddens our mortal life . When the old pass away , we are sad , but not comfortless . " Some natural tears are shed , " as we receive their parting blessing ; but we have faith , even amidst our tears , that it is a merciful dispensation which calls them to another life . But it is not so when infancy dies , or when youth and manhood perish by the roadside . When the silver cord is loosed before the music of the harp has been heard ; when the golden bowl is broken before the waters of life have filled it , then our hearts are desolate and refuse to be comforted . It is the death of the young , the premature blighting of the flower in the bud , which , more than any other affliction , requires for its consolation the exercise of the highest Christian faith . The instincts of nature refuse to believe , that because such trials are permitted by the Great Disposer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the details of sanitary science , from the forbidding statistical columns of Health Returns and Registration Reports , we learn the comforting lesson , that these saddest of all afflictions are owing more to the transgressions of man than to the // decrees of Providence . Thousands die annually before their time , and tens of thousands waste much of their lives on beds of sickness , not by the inscrutable purposes of their Creator , but because the noisome atmosphere of uncleanliness , disease , and death has been allowed to gather and float about them , till the lamp of life has gone out . Sanitary improvement is now generally recognized in Europe as one of the great reform movements of the day . It has attained this position more on account of its intrinsic importance , than from the exertions of its friends . It is much indebted to the efforts of a few persevering and philanthropic men , like Mr. Chadwick and Mr. Southwood Smith ; but it has chiefly commended itself to public notice through the magnitude of the interests which it affects . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , it has attracted considerable attention and accomplished much good . It is regarded , not merely as an auxiliary , but as an indispensable prerequisite , to any attempt for the general and perma* nent elevation of the poorer classes . In this country the sanitary movement is less known . Our readers are doubtless familiar with its name , though it has not yet assumed before the community the importance which rightfully belongs to it . We trust , however , that the Report of the Sanitary Commis. - sion of Massachusetts will do much towards creating a more enlightened public sentiment upon the subject . We do not propose at the present time to give a history of the sanitary movement , or even an exposition of the principles upon which it is founded . Our object is to present , as briefly as possible , a few of the most important facts , which form at once the basis of sanitary science , and the most urgent reasons for sanitary reform . Pure air , exercise , and cleanliness , have been recognized since the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years . But until very lately , there have been no data by which to estimate , with any degree of exactness , the enormous waste of life and health , which result from the privation and insufficient supply of these essential conditions of physical existence . The labors of the Registrar-General in England , and of the Bureaus of Health in France and Germany , have at length supplied this defect , so far as those countries are concerned . Their Registration // Reports do not contain merely a barren enumeration of each year 's births , marriages , and deaths . They present accurately .. recorded observations , in every case , of the date and cause of death , and also of the occupation , age , sex , habitation , and locality of those who have died . It is from these Reports , which contain the actual sanitary history , not of a single community , but of millions of individuals , and which now embrace a series of years , that we are enabled to ascertain the comparative healthiness of different classes and occupations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities with each other , and with that of the country . With these Reports before us , it is easy to eliminate the unnecessary , from the inevitable , causes of disease and death ; and thus to show how sickness may be avoided and human life prolonged . Let us look at some of the facts with regard to this matter . In the first place , there is an annual , needless sacrifice of human life in this country and in Europe , which is great enough to stagger belief . The English Registration Reports show that two per cent. , or one death to every fifty inhabitants , is the annual average mortality for the healthy districts of England . In a large proportion of the districts , ( nearly one half of the whole number , ) the average rate is somewhat less than this . These districts do not exhibit this low ratio of mortality merely because they are rural . They contain towhs and cities , whose population varies from ten to forty thousand inhabitants . Even in Birmingham , a manufacturing town with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the authority of an intelligent writer in the British and Foreign Medical Review for January , 1848 , is less than two per cent . Thus it appears from actual observation , that in nearly one half of England , in towns as well as in the country , the rate of mortality is two per cent. , or less . In the other parts of England , which , in ' a sanitary point of view , differ from these only in circumstances that are removable , the ratio is much greater . According to the writer just quoted , the annual mortality in Birmingham is one in 50.63 of the population , or less than two per cent . In London , it is one in 39.10 ; in Sheffield , one in 29.28 ; in Liverpool , one in 34.92 ; in Leeds , one in 35.44 ; in Manchester , one in 39.93 . In the whole of England , it is one in 45.8 , or 2.18 per cent . A glance at these figures is enough to show // an appalling waste of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns should have a sanitary condition inferior to that of Birmingham ; and , a fortiori , the mortality of the United Kingdom ought not to be greater . It has , in fact , been proved that the rate of mortality for the whole kingdom might be reduced , hy proper sanitary regulations , to less than two per cent. , - the rate of Birmingham and of nearly half the districts of England . If this were the case , there would be a saving of the excess above that rate , which would amount annually to more than 50,000 lives in Great Britain alone . Surely , such a sacrifice of life should arouse the attention of every philaHthropist . The Registration Reports of Massachusetts , imperfect as they are , show that the amount of unnecessary sickness and the waste of life are proportionally as great in New England , as among our Transatlantic brethren . We learn from the Report of the Sanitary Commission , that the average rate of mortality , during a period of ten years , in three country towns of New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.49 per cent . This agrees very nearly with the healthiest English district . In Boston , according to the City Registrar 's Report , the average rate for the ten years ending with 1850 inclusive was one in 41 , or 2.43 per cent . For the year 1849 , when the cholera prevailed , it was as high as one in 26 , or 3.84 per cent . For the last half of this decade , the rate was one in 34 , or 2.94 per cent . This is nearly one per cent . greater than the mortality of Birmingham with all its smoke , and dirt , and manufactories ; and hut little less than the average mortality of Liverpool , one of the unhealthiest cities in England . Observation has shown , as we have stated , that the average rate of mortality in any community need not exceed two per cent . If the number of deaths in Boston had been kept at this standard for the last ten years , by proper sanitary regulations , there would have been in this city a saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anguish and grief might have been averted , how many hearts might have been saved from desolation , and families from gloom , and homes , how often , from poverty and misery , if the hand of the destroying angel had been so often stayed ! The waste of life in our large towns may be seen in a still // more striking manner , by comparing different sections of the same city with each other . For this purpose , let us make a comparison of three different sections of Boston . We are enabled to do this with considerable exactness through the kindness of Mr. Simonds , the City Registrar . Compare , for example , the mortality of the population for the year 1850 , on Beacon Hill , with that of the inhabitants of what is called " the Back Bay , " and of those who dwell along the wharves , in Broad , Sea , and Cove Streets . We give the population of these sections as set down in the city census report for the same year . The first section which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Streets inclusive , extending from the State House to Charles Street . Belknap and West Cedar Streets were not included . This section of the city is all high land and thoroughly drained by nature . The houses are large and well ventilated . The inhabitants belong to the upper classes of society , and in England would be denominated the " gentry . " The population of this district is 2615 . Of this number , 2054 are Americans , and 561 foreigners . Most of the latter class are probably domestics in the families of the former . The number of deaths in this section for 1850 was only 35 ; this is one in 74.7 of the inhabitants , or 1.3 per cent . In Herefordshire , one of the healthiest districts of England , the rate of mortality is about one in 68.49 . In the country towns of New England , cited above , it is one in 67 . Thus the Beacon Hill district of Boston exhibits a more favorable rate of mortality than either of these rural localities . We should he careful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this statement . The year 1850 was one of unusual health in Boston . Moreover , many of the inhabitants of this district spend a considerable portion of each year out of the city , and doubtless several deaths occurred , during their absence , which are not included in the enumeration . It would therefore be a nearer approximation to the actual mortality to assume one in 67 , or the rate of the country towns , just cited , as the rate of the Beacon Hill district . Even this is much more favorable than the standard of two per cent. , or one in 50 , to which sanitary science has shown the mortality of every community may be reduced . // The next section is that upon " the Back Bay . " It contains the district which is included between Pleasant Street and the marsh , and extends from the Providence Railroad station to West Orange Street . lit is composed entirely of newly made land . The streets are narrow , the sewerage and drainage are imperfect . The houses are small , and built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 5121 . Of this number , 1348 are foreigneis , and 3773 Americans . The native inhabitants are mostly tradespeople and mechanics . They are intelligent , and are as attentive to the known laws of hygiene as the average of any community . Here the mortality was one in 52.7 of the inhabitants , or 1.9 per cent . This rate is much higher than that of the first district , and nearly equal to the mortality of Birmingham . It is not , however , a large mortality , and is a close approximation to the standard of two per cent . If the year had been sickly , the rate would have been considerably increased . Let us now look at the last district selected for comparison . It comprises Broad , Cove , and Sea Streets . These streets are situated near the wharves . They are built principally upon made land , and have numerous blind alleys , or cul-desacs , leading from them . The streets and alleys are badly drained , and crowded with an overflowing population . A large number of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their refuse of every description stagnates about the yards , spreading on every side poisonous exhalations , laden with disease and death . A majority of the houses contain several families , and some of them have no less than nine or ten . Even the cellars of the houses are often inhabited . In some instances , one cellar leads to another , and this to a third , a sort of dungeon , all inhabited by human beings of both sexes and every age . The population of these three streets was 2813 , of whom 2738 were foreigners , and only 75 Americans . The mortality was one in 17.6 of the population , or 5.65 per cent. , and this in a year remarkable for its healthiness . What it would have been in a sickly year , we dare not conjecture . There are but few instances on record of a mortality like this , in any community , except during the visitation of a pestilence or an epidemic . Doubtless , the habits of the people , their excesses and inattention to personal cleanliness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mortality . But after making all due allowances , there remains an appalling per percentage of death . If one in every seventeen and a half of the population in those streets is doomed to death annually , a fearful responsibility will rest upon the community until such pestiferous abodes are purified . The pestilential atmosphere of the spot will spread , and contaminate the healthier districts of the town . All must suffer for the neglect and indifference with which such abodes are regarded . No community can have so fearful a plague spot near it with impunity . It appears , then , that the mortality of the whole of Boston and of several of its districts presents the following contrasts . The rate for the whole city ( omitting decimals ) is one in 38 of the inhabitants . For the Beacon Hill district , it is one in 74 ; for the Broad Street district , one in 17 ; and along " the Back Bay , " one in 52 . We were at first inclined to regard these figures as an exaggeration . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost decimated of its population . But a careful rei*xamination has confirmed the accuracy of the statement . We are told a great deal of the contrasts of European life . We have heard much of famine in the midst of plenty ; of splendor set off by squalid misery ; of abject wretchedness showing its gaunt and deformed features by the side of ease and luxury . Undoubtedly this is true . We can bear personal testimony to the accuracy of the picture . And yet we can recall , neither from our own observation nor from the statements of others , any contrasts of life , ( not even in London , ) greater or more striking , than that which we have copied above , and which may be gathered from the columns of the Registrar 's account of the mortality of Boston . Whether similar results would be obtained , if similar investigations were made with regard to . New York , Philadelphia , and other cities in the United States , we do not know . Not having the means at command , by which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter . It is time to return from this digression . The sanitary movement does not merely relate to the lives and health of the community ; it is also a means of moral reform . It appeals to the philanthropist , and to Christians of every sect . The ultimate connection between filth and vice has been noticed // by all writers upon this subject . Outward impurity goes band in hand with inward . pollution , and the removal of the one leads to the extirpation of the other . Cleansing the body is not more a symbol , than it is a means and a condition , of inward purity . Wesley was wont to say , that cleanliness stands next to godliness , and there is scripture authority for putting clean hands before a pure heart . We do not mean that building proper sewers and drains , clearing the cellars , ventilating the houses , and diminishing the excessive crowding of the population in the Broad Street district would put an end to all the vice and crime that lurk there . But no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrading and disgusting vices , and alleviate much of the misery , which prevail in that section of the city . A series of able articles appeared not long since , in the London Morning Chronicle , upon the condition of the poor . They presented a frightful picture of the poverty , utter absence of self-respect , degradation , filth , and vice of the laboring classes . The details are too heart-sickening and disgusting to be reproduced here . It is difficult to conceive of humanity sunk so low as was represented in these reports . We only allude to them now on account of the constant and abundant evidence which they give of the connection of vice with filth , of spiritual with physical uncleanliness . It is undeniable that the moral condition of a community is typified in the character of their habitations . The Edinburgh Review for April , 1850 , gives the following graphic picture of the sure and gradually demoralizing influence of such polluted dwellings upon one unaccustomed to them . " There can he no sight more painful , than that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these dwellings . For a time there is a desperate exertion to keep the place clean ; several times in the forenoon is the pavement in front of the house washed , hut as often does the oozing fifth creep along the stones , and she feels at length that her labor is in vain . The noxious exhalations infuse their poison into her system , and her energies droop . Then she becomes sick , and cleanliness being impossible , she gets accustomed to its absence , and gradually sinks into the ways of her neighbors . The art of concealing dirt is substituted for the habit of cleanliness ; she becomes a dirty , debilitated slat. tern , followed by sickly , scrofulous , feverish children ; and she falls through successive stages of degradation , till , physical wretchedness // having done its worst , she reaches the lowest of all , that in which she has ceased to complain . The fate of the children is , if possible , more heart-hreaking . All idea of sobriety , all notion of self-respect , all sense of modesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they congregate in masses and mix with the worst vagrants . At last some dreadful fever forces on the notice of the public the existence of their squalid dens of misery ; such as those in the Saffron Hill district , - where twenty-five people were found living in a room sixteen feet square , - where a man and his wife , and four children , occupying one room , took in seven lodgers , - and where one house contained a hundred and twenty-six people , and only six or seven beds . These people save nothing , but invariably spend all they earn in drink ; and with that precocious depravity too surely evinced by human beings when herded together like beasts , the young of both sexes live together from the ages of twelve and thirteen years. ** This is an appalling picture ; and yet the same language might be used without exaggeration , of parts of Fort Hill and other places in Boston . Human beings , men , women , and children , - boys and girls , - living together like swine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than swine , steeped in vices that we dare not mention , may be seen by any one who will visit Burgess Alley and other localities , in the Broad Street district . Let us be thankful for one exception , however ; the wrecks of only a few rosy-cheeked American women can yet be found there . It is difficult to find an adequate remedy for evils of such magnitude . Evidently , the first thing to be done is to ascertain their utmost extent . They should be exposed in all their vileness . The wound must be probed to the bottom , however painful or disagreeable the operation , before a cure is attempted . Hence the great importance of an accurate registration of every case of death , with the attendant circumstances of age , sex , locality , disease , etc . These are a portion of the facts by which the sanitary condition of a people is made known ; and without which , sanitary science is impossible . An accurate record of births and marriages is equally indispensable . We have not space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ births , marriages , and deaths of a community indicate , by their varying proportions , its seasons of prosperity and adversity , of health and disease . Like the three quantities which a geometer demands for the 11 * // construction of a triangle , they form the three great facts , without which the sanitary condition of a people can not be determined . Notwithstanding the registration laws , which have existed for some years in Massachusetts , the returns made under them were very deficient . Within the last few years , however , the laws have been revised , and these facts , which are so important to the welfare of the State , are at present recorded almost with the accuracy of the English registration system . Let us now advert briefly to the economical aspect of the sanitary question . This is scarcely less importafit than its physical and moral bearings ; and perhaps in the present age , when the auri sacra fames is diffused so widely , will exert the greatest influence upon the public mind . The waste or misapplication of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presses upon the community . It is none the less real , because it does not come in the form of a direct impost . The expenses of sickness , of doctor 's bills , nurses , medicines , and funerals , are far greater than is generally supposed ; and they fall with the greatest severity upon the classes that are least able to bear them . It has been calculated that for every case of death , there are twenty-eight cases of sickness ; and consequently , for every case of unnecessary death , twenty-eight cases of unnecessary sickness . Apply this rule to Boston . We have shown that there are in this city , every year , eleven hundred deaths that might be prevented . Then there are more than thirty thousand cases of unnecessary sickness in Boston every year . Now endeavor to estimate the needless expense which is thus entailed upon the community by the cost of sickness ; and ( in doing so ) let it he remembered , that among the ill ventilated , badly drained , and crowded dwellings of the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but abides longer , and leaves behind it more enfeebled and broken constitutions than anywhere else . Including the loss of labor attendant and consequent upon sickness , and the cost of medicines , nursing , medical attendance , and the like , we can not be accused of exaggeration in estimating the cost of sickness at the average rate of five dollars for every case . This would give more than one hundred and fifty thousand dollars , annually , as the expense // which Boston incurs for preventable sickness . A comparison of this estimate with a similar one made , by careful inquiries , for the city of London , will show that we have kept far within the limits of the truth . In the tables of the Vital Statistics of England and Wales , the annual waste , resulting from un- . necessary sickness , funerals , and labor thereby lost , reduced to an equivalent in money , is stated , for the metropolis alone , at the enormous amount of two millions of pounds sterling . This is at the rate , in round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred thousand of the population of London . Estimated at the same rate , the annual loss to Boston on account of preventable sickness , would be represented by a grand total of rather more than seven hundred thousand dollars . But this is not all . In the words of a writer , already quoted - " There is another enormous item of waste or misappropriation of money , not contained in these tables ; namely , the sums squandered in the shape of defective and costly structural arrangements , above and below ground ; - in sewers , which are little better than elongated cess-pools , put down in wrong places , built of wrong materials , faulty in shape , with insufficient fall ; - in cisterns and water.butts , with their paraphernalia of pipes and ball . cocks , adapted to a limited and intermittent supply of water ; - in shops and work-shops , destitute of all means of ventilation ; - in houses and hovels , furnished with the costly and barbarous cess-pool , expensive alike to landlord and tenant . Add to these the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft ; by the smoke nuisance , with its double waste of fuel and soap ; and by the discharge of the refuse of towns into the sea . What these barbarisms have cost and are costing us , it would be difficult to say ; but that they amount to several millions ( pounds ) a year , no reasonable man can doubt . We refer our readers to the Reports of the Health of Towns Commission , and the publications of the Health of Towns Association for particu-. lars . If ' the estimates appear exaggerated , let them halve or quarter every item , and there will still remain the most remarkable expos6 ever yet made of municipal and national extravagance . " We should be glad to give a sketch of the most important measures of sanitary reform which have been proposed ; but our limits forbid They all , however , with various differences of detail , are alike in embracing the following circumstances as indispensable ; namely , an ample supply of good water , pure // air , and light , with sufficient drainage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cardinal points of sanitary reform . No expense , which is necessary to secure them , is extravagant , and any arrangements , which neglect them , will in the end prove costly . The prevention of disease is much easier and more economical than its cure . It has been stated as one of the broad principles of sanitary economics , that " it costs more money to create disease than to prevent it ; and that there is not a single structural arrangement , chargeable with the production of disease , which is not in itself an extravagance . " Narrow streets , without proper sewers and without open spaces , and small houses destitute of sufficient ventilation and without drains , may in the first instance cost little capital , and for a short time give large dividends ; but by destroying the health and lives , and impairing the productive energy of those who dwell in them , they diminish the real wealth of the community , and eventually curtail the returns of the capitalist and landlord . We have already alluded to the comparative neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Moved by the intrinsic importance of the subject , and awam*e of the increasing attention bestowed upon it in Europe , the Legislature of Massachusetts , in 1849 , appointed a commission for the purpose of making a sanitary survey of the State . Lemuel Shattuck , of Boston , Nathaniel P. Banks , Jr. , of Waltham , and Jehiel Abbott , of Westfield , were selected by the Governor and Council as Commissioners to carry out the intentions of the Legislature . The result of their labors was presented at the last session of the Legislature in a long Report , which evinces much industry , and a thorough acquaintance with the subject . We understand that the work of preparing the report was chiefly performed by Mr. Shattuck , to whom it was assigned on account of his long acquaintance with sanitary matters . The act of the Legislature directed the Commissioners to prepare " a plan for a sanitary survey of the State , embracing a statement of such facts and suggestions as they might think proper to illustrate the subject . " Under this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a sanitary survey , but added to it various collateral matters , which they deemed important . Thus the Report is // prefaced by a brief account of tbe sanitary movement abroad and at home , and followed by an appendix , which occupies more than one third of the volume . This appendix contains much valuable matter , such as the various Health Acts of Massachusetts ; actual sanitary surveys of several towns in the Commonwealth ; a classification of the causes of death generally adopted in registration ; some account of tenements for the poor ; cholera reports ; atmospheric observations ; and many other matters which the Commissioners wished to bring before a community where the sanitary movement was in its infancy . The bill which the Legislature are advised to pass , is entitled " an Act for the Promotion of Public and Personal Health . " It consists of forty sections , in which are described the duties of the various health officers of the State , the extent and character of their jurisdiction , their compensation and mode of election , and the penalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A superficial reading of the act would lead one to believe that it is so complicated in its machinery and minute in its details as to be impracticable . This impression is removed by a more care .. ful study of its provisions . It is both simple and p*racticable in its essential parts ; and we hope it will divert the attention of our legislators for a season from their political strife . The Act provides for the creation of a General Board of Health for the State , and of local Boards for each town or city . The executive officer of the General Board is to be a Secretary , appointed by them , who shall receive an adequate compensation and devote his whole time to the duties of his office . Each local Board is likewise required to appoint one of their own members as a local secretary , who shall sustain to them the same relation that the general secretary does to the general Board . Provision is also mr*de for the appointment in each town of a medical officer and sanitary surveyor , with appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual organization which exists for the superintendence of the schools of the State . The duties of the general Board , assisted by the Secretary , are to superintend the execution of the sanitary laws of the State ; to decide upon sanitary questions , submitted to them by the State , by cities or towns , or the local Boards ; to // advise with regard to the location and sanitary regulations of public buildings and institutions ; to superintend the taking of the census , and the registration of births , marriages , and deaths ; to perform various other duties , appertaining or incident to these , and to " diffuse as far as practicable , throughout the commonwealth , information relating to the sanitary condition of the State and its inhabitants . " The local Boards are required to carry into execution , within their respective jurisdictions , the sanitary laws of the State and the regulations of the General Board , and to carry out such local sanitary measures as circumstances may demand . We sincerely hope that this plan , or one similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we should rejoice if Massachusetts would take the lead in this reform as she has done on so many other occasions . The duties of the proposed Secretary of the General Board of Health are similar to those of the English Registrar-General , the importance of whose labors can scarcely be over-estimated . The plan for a sanitary survey consists of a series of measures , fifty in number , which are presented in the form of separate recommendations . In the words of the commission , " they are not of equal importance , " and are not " all the useful sanitary measures which a complete and perfect plan would require . " The commission do not propose that these measures should become Jaws at present . They are only offered to the consideration of the legislature and of the public , to be adopted whenever such a course may be advisable . The expediency of some of them may be doubted , while others are of the highest importance . Some are identical with the provisions of the proposed Health Act , and others are subsidiary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of the Report , and are enforced by numerous arguments and illustrations . Our remarks have already reached a length which precludes us from entering into a close examination of them ; we can only commend a few of the most important to the careful attention of our readers . " We recommend that tenements for the better accommodation of the poor be erected in cities and villages . " " We recommend that public bathing houses and wash houses be established in all cities and villages . " // " We recommend that , whenever practicable , the refuse and sewage of cities and towns be collected and applied to the purposes of agriculture . " " We recommend that measures be taken to prevent , as far as practicable , the smoke nuisance. ** These are important measures . Fortunately they have already been submitted elsewhere to the test of experience ; and it has been shown that they can be carried into effect , not only as measures of sanitary reform , but as offering to the capitalist opportunities for profitable investment . Large buildings , containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cities of England and of the continent , in which two or more rooms are occupied by single families , according to their means . These buildings are substantial , well ventilated and drained , supplied with an abundance of water and light , and provided with out-houses in such a way as to secure individual decency and self-respect . The rent which the occupants pay is not greater than what other families of the less fortunate poor are obliged to give for a part of some miserable hovel , or for a portion of a room , in a crowded , undrained , filthy house , where the atmosphere is poisoned within and without , both morally and physically . The property invested in these tenements , which are called " model lodging-houses , " has proved to be as safe and profitable as any investments , except the best . For the proof of this assertion , we refer our readers to the Appendix of the Report of the Commission , and particularly to Dr. Simon 's Report upon dwelling-houses for the better accommodation of the London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model tenements for the poor , a vast benefit would be conferred upon the community , as well as upon the poor themselves , and that capital so invested would yield a fair return . The whole matter commends itself ' with peculiar force to the wealthy and philanthropic portion of our community . Public baths were established by the corporation , in Liverpool , in the year 18452 . They contain warm and cold , shower , plunge , and vapor baths , with every grade of comfort and elegance . The price varies from about two cents for the cheapest bath to twenty-five cents for the dearest . They have proved to be successful both as an investment and as a source of public comfort and health . Public wash-houses // for the poor have also been estahlished in various parts of ' Great Britain . They are provided with fuel , boilers , and all the necessary apparatus for washing and drying . Each washer-woman pays one penny ( ahout two cents ) for the use of the tuhs , water , drying apparatus , &amp;c. , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been in every way successful , and are important additions to the comfort and subsistence of the poor . The sanitary advantage of obliging all manufactories and other establishments to consume their own smoke , and of applying the refuse and sewage of cities and towns to agricultural purposes , is too obvious to need illustration ; hut the economy of the measure , or rather the extravagance of neglecting it , has not been demonstrated until lately . These are practical and important matters , and the Commission have done well in directing public attention to them . The Commission advise , " that in laying out new towns and villages , and in extending those already laid out , ample provision he made for a supply , in purity and abundance , of light , air , and water ; for drainage and sewerage , for paving and for cleanliness . " In this country , where new towns spring up so rapidly , and old ones seem to possess the power of indefinite extension , the manner of laying out streets and sewers becomes of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are growing into towns , and towns into cities , and cities are constantly extending their borders . In this rapid development , the m*inner of growth has been unfortunately confided to private interest . In most instances , there have been no general plans ; and where general plans have existed , they have been suggested hy the convenience or interest of the landed proprietors . Thus the grade , width , and direction of streets have been determined by an interested person , and not with any reference to the necessities of an ultimately dense population . Courts are built , closed at one end , and often at both ends , with a single narrow entrance at the side . Sometimes , for the purpose of economizing space and obtaining large rents , courts are built within and beyond courts , without regard to sanitary principles ; they are entered by narrow and arched passage ways , and when densely inhabited , are filled with a stagnant and pestiferous atmosphere . For a time , in the embryo stage of a town 's existence , // these retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as the population increases , they become abodes of filth and centres of disease and contagion . A farseeing economy would prevent this , by taking into view the future necessities of a large population , as well as the temporary interest of a few individuals . The beneficial effect of this policy , if generally adopted , upon the comfort , health , productive energy , and wealth of the community for future generations , would almost exceed calculation . In reality , the subject is not so much a matter of economy , or even of health , as of imperious duty . The Commissioners further recommend " that the general management of cemeteries and other places of burial , an.d of the interment of the dead , be regulated by the local Boards of Health . " The subject of intramural burials has lately occupied a considerable share of public attention , and we feel assured that public opinion is taking a right direction with regard to them . The fact that noxious exhalations and dele .. terious gases rise and spread from graveyards , carrying poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has also been discovered , that the respect for the bodies of the dead , which our tenderest feelings demand , does not conflict at all with a proper regard for the health of the living . Intramural burials , even when the body is deposited beneath the sacred aisles of the sanctuary , are often not less revolting than they are injurious . It is not more in accordance with the ia*s of sanitary science than with the holiest sentiments of our nature , that the departed should rest , not by the side of crowded thoroughfares , where the idle laugh and profane oath go up to Heaven on the same breath that carries the prayer of the mourner and bereaved , but in retirement and solitude , away from the haunts of busy men , where Nature , by her manifold agencies , shall resolve the body into dust , with a blessing instead of a curse to the living . Another recommendation of the Commission is , " that persons be specially educated in sanitary science , as preventive advisers as well as curative advisers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . It strikes at the root of the whole matter . Disease can often be prevented , and rarely cured . The world has yet to learn that , in medicine as in morals , prevention is far easier and better than cure . When disease // has fairly commenced its attack , the physician can do little else , with his whole battery of drugs , from calomel to thoroughwort , than watch the progress , mitigate the violence , and alleviate the distress of the struggle ; and when it must terminate fatally , he can " smooth the pathway to the tomb , " making the passage thither less painful both to the dying and the bereaved . But if disease can not be cured , it can often be avoided and prevented . This is what should be done ; and if this recommendation were adopted , and men were in the habit of seeking advice and information with regard to their habitations , occupation , diet , etc. , so as to learn , when well , the art of preserving health , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerted upon the sanitary condition of the community . Hitherto , such advice has not been often sought , or much valued . Its importance , however , is daily becoming more apparent ; and we hope the time is not far distant , when men will give as much heed to the advice which would prevent a fever , as to that which seemingly cures it . There are many other points in this Report which we should be glad to discuss , and some which we might be inclined to criticize ; but we feel that our remarks should be drawn to a close . Its appearance marks a new epoch in cisAtlantic sanitary legislation , and we hope it may be the harbinger of a comprehensive and enlightened system of sanitary reform . We commend the Report to the consideration of the philanthropists , economists , and legislators of our country , with the confident belief , that if the principles which it presents should receive the sanction of public opinion and the authority of law , they would prove of inestimable advantage to the whole community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the conditions of perfect health , either public or personal , are seldom or never obtained , though attain . able ; - that the average length of human life may be very much extended , and its physical power greatly augmented ; - that in every year , within this Commonwealth , thousands of lives are lost which might have been saved ; - that tens of thousands of cases of sickness occur , which might have been prevented ; - that a vast amount of unnecessarily impaired health and physical debility exists among those not actually confined by sickness ; - // that these preventible evils require an enormous expenditure and loss of money , and impose upon the people unnumbered and immeasurable calamities , pecuniary , social , physical , mental and moral , which might be avoided ; and that measures for prevention , will effect infinitely more , than remedies for the cure of disease .
