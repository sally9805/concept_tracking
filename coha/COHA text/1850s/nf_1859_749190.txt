txt //solid foundations of liberty must rest upon individual character ; which is also the only sure guarantee for social security and national progress . John Stuart Mill truly observes that " even despotism does not produce its worst effects so long as individuality exists under it ; and whatever crushes individuality IS despotism , by whatever name it be called . " Old fallacies as to human progress are constantly turning up . Some call for Caesars , others for Nationalities , and others for Acts of Parliament . We are to wait for Caesars , and when they are found , " happy the people who recognise and follow them . " 1 This doctrine shortly means , everything FOR the people , nothing BY them ,  --  a doctrine which , if taken as a guide , must , by destroying the free conscience of a community , speedily prepare the way for any form of despotism . Caesarism is human idolatry in its worst form  --  a worship of mere power , as degrading in its effects as the worship of mere wealth would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations would be that of Self-Help ; and so soon as it is thoroughly understood and carried into action , Caesarism will be no more . The two principles are directly antagonistic ; and what Victor Hugo said of the Pen and the Sword alike applies to them , " Ceci tuera cela . " This will kill that . The power of Nationalities and Acts of Parliament is also a prevalent superstition . What William Dargan , one of Ireland 's truest patriots , said at the closing of the first Dublin Industrial Exhibition , may well be quoted now . " To tell the truth , " he said , " I never heard the word independence mentioned that my own country and my own fellow townsmen did not occur to my mind . I have heard a great deal about the independence that we were to get from this , that , and the other place , and of the great expectations we were to have from persons from other countries coming amongst us . Whilst I value as much as any man the great advantages that must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been deeply impressed with the feeling that our industrial independence is dependent upon ourselves . I believe that with simple industry and careful exactness in the utilization of our energies , we never had a fairer chance nor a brighter prospect than the present . We have made a step , but perseverance is the great agent of success ; and if we but go on zealously , I believe in my conscience that in a short period we shall arrive at a position of equal comfort , of equal happiness , and of equal independence , with that of any other people . " All nations have been made what they are by the thinking and the working of many generations of men . Patient and persevering labourers in all ranks and conditions of life , cultivators of the soil and explorers of the mine , inventors and discoverers , manufacturers , mechanics and artisans , poets , philosophers , and politicians , all have contributed towards the grand result , one generation building upon another 's labours , and carrying them forward to still higher stages . This constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has served to create order out of chaos in industry , science , and art ; and the living race has thus , in the course of nature , become the inheritor of the rich estate provided by the skill and industry of our forefathers , which is placed in our hands to cultivate , and to hand down , not only unimpaired but improved , to our successors . The spirit of self-help , as exhibited in the energetic action of individuals , has in all times been a marked feature in the English character , and furnishes the true measure of our power as a nation . Rising above the heads of the mass , there were always to be found a series of individuals distinguished beyond others , who commanded the public homage . But our progress has also been owing to multitudes of smaller and less known men . Though only the generals ' names may be remembered in the history of any great campaign , it has been in a great measure through the individual valour and heroism of the privates that victories have been won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' battle , "  --  men in the ranks having in all times been amongst the greatest of workers . Many are the lives of men unwritten , which have nevertheless as powerfully influenced civilisation and progress as the more fortunate Great whose names are recorded in biography . Even the humblest person , who sets before his fellows an example of industry , sobriety , and upright honesty of purpose in life , has a present as well as a future influence upon the well-being of his country ; for his life and character pass unconsciously into the lives of others , and propagate good example for all time to come . Daily experience shows that it is energetic individualism which produces the most powerful effects upon the life and action of others , and really constitutes the best practical education . Schools , academies , and colleges , give but the merest beginnings of culture in comparison with it . Far more influential is the life-education daily given in our homes , in the streets , behind counters , in workshops , at the loom and the plough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men . This is that finishing instruction as members of society , which Schiller designated " the education of the human race , " consisting in action , conduct , self-culture , self-control ,  --  all that tends to discipline a man truly , and fit him for the proper performance of the duties and business of life ,  --  a kind of education not to be learnt from books , or acquired by any amount of mere literary training . With his usual weight of words Bacon observes , that " Studies teach not their own use ; but that is a wisdom without them , and above them , won by observation ; " a remark that holds true of actual life , as well as of the cultivation of the intellect itself . For all experience serves to illustrate and enforce the lesson , that a man perfects himself by work more than by reading ,  --  that it is life rather than literature , action rather than study , and character rather than biography , which tend perpetually to renovate mankind . Biographies of great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and useful , as helps , guides , and incentives to others . Some of the best are almost equivalent to gospels  - -  teaching high living , high thinking , and energetic action for their own and the world 's good . The valuable examples which they furnish of the power of self-help , of patient purpose , resolute working , and steadfast integrity , issuing in the formation of truly noble and manly character , exhibit in language not to be misunderstood , what it is in the power of each to accomplish for himself ; and eloquently illustrate the efficacy of self-respect and self-reliance in enabling men of even the humblest rank to work out for themselves an honourable competency and a solid reputation . Great men of science , literature , and art  --  apostles of great thoughts and lords of the great heart  --  have belonged to no exclusive class nor rank in life . They have come alike from colleges , workshops , and farmhouses ,  --  from the huts of poor men and the mansions of the rich . Some of God 's greatest apostles have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes taken the highest places ; nor have difficulties apparently the most insuperable proved obstacles in their way . Those very difficulties , in many instances , would ever seem to have been their best helpers , by evoking their powers of labour and endurance , and stimulating into life faculties which might otherwise have lain dormant . The instances of obstacles thus surmounted , and of triumphs thus achieved , are indeed so numerous , as almost to justify the proverb that " with Will one can do anything . " Take , for instance , the remarkable fact , that from the barber 's shop came Jeremy Taylor , the most poetical of divines ; Sir Richard Arkwright , the inventor of the spinning-jenny and founder of the cotton manufacture ; Lord Tenterden , one of the most distinguished of Lord Chief Justices ; and Turner , the greatest among landscape painters . No one knows to a certainty what Shakespeare was ; but it is unquestionable that he sprang from a humble rank . His father was a butcher and grazier ; and Shakespeare himself is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aver that he was an usher in a school and afterwards a scrivener 's clerk . He truly seems to have been " not one , but all mankind 's epitome . " For such is the accuracy of his sea phrases that a naval writer alleges that he must have been a sailor ; whilst a clergyman infers , from internal evidence in his writings , that he was probably a parson 's clerk ; and a distinguished judge of horse-flesh insists that he must have been a horse-dealer . Shakespeare was certainly an actor , and in the course of his life " played many parts , " gathering his wonderful stores of knowledge from a wide field of experience and observation . In any event , he must have been a close student and a hard worker ; and to this day his writings continue to exercise a powerful influence on the formation of English character . The common class of day labourers has given us Brindley the engineer , Cook the navigator , and Burns the poet . Masons and bricklayers can boast of Ben Jonson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a trowel in his hand and a book in his pocket , Edwards and Telford the engineers , Hugh Miller the geologist , and Allan Cunningham the writer and sculptor ; whilst among distinguished carpenters we find the names of Inigo Jones the architect , Harrison the chronometer-maker , John Hunter the physiologist , Romney and Opie the painters , Professor Lee the Orientalist , and John Gibson the sculptor . From the weaver class have sprung Simson the mathematician , Bacon the sculptor , the two Milners , Adam Walker , John Foster , Wilson the ornithologist , Dr. Livingstone the missionary traveller , and Tannahill the poet . Shoemakers have given us Sir Cloudesley Shovel the great Admiral , Sturgeon the electrician , Samuel Drew the essayist , Gifford the editor of the ' Quarterly Review , ' Bloomfield the poet , and William Carey the missionary ; whilst Morrison , another laborious missionary , was a maker of shoe-lasts . Within the last few years , a profound naturalist has been discovered in the person of a shoemaker at Banff , named Thomas Edwards , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisure to the study of natural science in all its branches , his researches in connexion with the smaller crustaceae having been rewarded by the discovery of a new species , to which the name of " Praniza Edwardsii " has been given by naturalists . Nor have tailors been undistinguished . John Stow , the historian , worked at the trade during some part of his life . Jackson , the painter , made clothes until he reached manhood . The brave Sir John Hawkswood , who so greatly distinguished himself at Poictiers , and was knighted by Edward III . for his valour , was in early life apprenticed to a London tailor . Admiral Hobson , who broke the boom at Vigo in 1702 , belonged to the same calling . He was working as a tailor 's apprentice near Bonchurch , in the Isle of Wight , when the news flew through the village that a squadron of men-of-war was sailing off the island . He sprang from the shopboard , and ran down with his comrades to the beach , to gaze upon the glorious sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a sailor ; and springing into a boat , he rowed off to the squadron , gained the admiral 's ship , and was accepted as a volunteer . Years after , he returned to his native village full of honours , and dined off bacon and eggs in the cottage where he had worked as an apprentice . But the greatest tailor of all is unquestionably Andrew Johnson , the present President of the United States  --  a man of extraordinary force of character and vigour of intellect . In his great speech at Washington , when describing himself as having begun his political career as an alderman , and run through all the branches of the legislature , a voice in the crowd cried , " From a tailor up . " It was characteristic of Johnson to take the intended sarcasm in good part , and even to turn it to account . " Some gentleman says I have been a tailor . That does not disconcert me in the least ; for when I was a tailor I had the reputation of being a good one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my customers , and always did good work . " Cardinal Wolsey , De Foe , Akenside , and Kirke White were the sons of butchers ; Bunyan was a tinker , and Joseph Lancaster a basket-maker . Among the great names identified with the invention of the steam-engine are those of Newcomen , Watt , and Stephenson ; the first a blacksmith , the second a maker of mathematical instruments , and the third an engine-fireman . Huntingdon the preacher was originally a coalheaver , and Bewick , the father of wood-engraving , a coalminer . Dodsley was a footman , and Holcroft a groom . Baffin the navigator began his seafaring career as a man before the mast , and Sir Cloudesley Shovel as a cabin-boy . Herschel played the oboe in a military band . Chantrey was a journeyman carver , Etty a journeyman printer , and Sir Thomas Lawrence the son of a tavern-keeper . Michael Faraday , the son of a blacksmith , was in early life apprenticed to a bookbinder , and worked at that trade until he reached his twenty-second year : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excelling even his master , Sir Humphry Davy , in the art of lucidly expounding the most difficult and abstruse points in natural science . Among those who have given the greatest impulse to the sublime science of astronomy , we find Copernicus , the son of a Polish baker ; Kepler , the son of a German public-house keeper , and himself the " garcon de cabaret ; " d'Alembert , a foundling picked up one winter 's night on the steps of the church of St. Jean le Rond at Paris , and brought up by the wife of a glazier ; and Newton and Laplace , the one the son of a small freeholder near Grantham , the other the son of a poor peasant of Beaumont-en-Auge , near Honfleur . Notwithstanding their comparatively adverse circumstances in early life , these distinguished men achieved a solid and enduring reputation by the exercise of their genius , which all the wealth in the world could not have purchased . The very possession of wealth might indeed have proved an obstacle greater even than the humble means to which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mathematician , held the office of Treasurer of War at Turin ; but having ruined himself by speculations , his family were reduced to comparative poverty . To this circumstance Lagrange was in after life accustomed partly to attribute his own fame and happiness . " Had I been rich , " said he , " I should probably not have become a mathematician . " The sons of clergymen and ministers of religion generally , have particularly distinguished themselves in our country 's history . Amongst them we find the names of Drake and Nelson , celebrated in naval heroism ; of Wollaston , Young , Playfair , and Bell , in science ; of Wren , Reynolds , Wilson , and Wilkie , in art ; of Thurlow and Campbell , in law ; and of Addison , Thomson , Goldsmith , Coleridge , and Tennyson , in literature . Lord Hardinge , Colonel Edwardes , and Major Hodson , so honourably known in Indian warfare , were also the sons of clergymen . Indeed , the empire of England in India was won and held chiefly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren Hastings , and their successors  --  men for the most part bred in factories and trained to habits of business . Among the sons of attorneys we find Edmund Burke , Smeaton the engineer , Scott and Wordsworth , and Lords Somers , Hardwick , and Dunning . Sir William Blackstone was the posthumous son of a silk-mercer . Lord Gifford 's father was a grocer at Dover ; Lord Denman 's a physician ; judge Talfourd 's a country brewer ; and Lord Chief Baron Pollock 's a celebrated saddler at Charing Cross . Layard , the discoverer of the monuments of Nineveh , was an articled clerk in a London solicitor 's office ; and Sir William Armstrong , the inventor of hydraulic machinery and of the Armstrong ordnance , was also trained to the law and practised for some time as an attorney . Milton was the son of a London scrivener , and Pope and Southey were the sons of linendrapers . Professor Wilson was the son of a Paisley manufacturer , and Lord Macaulay of an African merchant . Keats was a druggist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself , Davy once said , " What I am I have made myself : I say this without vanity , and in pure simplicity of heart . " Richard Owen , the Newton of Natural History , began life as a midshipman , and did not enter upon the line of scientific research in which he has since become so distinguished , until comparatively late in life . He laid the foundations of his great knowledge while occupied in cataloguing the magnificent museum accumulated by the industry of John Hunter , a work which occupied him at the College of Surgeons during a period of about ten years . Foreign not less than English biography abounds in illustrations of men who have glorified the lot of poverty by their labours and their genius . In Art we find Claude , the son of a pastrycook ; Geefs , of a baker ; Leopold Robert , of a watchmaker ; and Haydn , of a wheelwright ; whilst Daguerre was a scene-painter at the Opera . The father of Gregory VII . was a carpenter ; of Sextus V. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargeman . When a boy , Adrian , unable to pay for a light by which to study , was accustomed to prepare his lessons by the light of the lamps in the streets and the church porches , exhibiting a degree of patience and industry which were the certain forerunners of his future distinction . Of like humble origin were Hauy , the mineralogist , who was the son of a weaver of Saint-Just ; Hautefeuille , the mechanician , of a baker at Orleans ; Joseph Fourier , the mathematician , of a tailor at Auxerre ; Durand , the architect , of a Paris shoemaker ; and Gesner , the naturalist , of a skinner or worker in hides , at Zurich . This last began his career under all the disadvantages attendant on poverty , sickness , and domestic calamity ; none of which , however , were sufficient to damp his courage or hinder his progress . His life was indeed an eminent illustration of the truth of the saying , that those who have most to do and are willing to work , will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like character . He was the son of poor parents in Picardy , and when a boy was employed to tend sheep . But not liking the occupation he ran away to Paris . After encountering much misery , he succeeded in entering the College of Navarre as a servant . The situation , however , opened for him the road to learning , and he shortly became one of the most distinguished men of his time . The chemist Vauquelin was the son of a peasant of Saint-Andre-d'Herbetot , in the Calvados . When a boy at school , though poorly clad , he was full of bright intelligence ; and the master , who taught him to read and write , when praising him for his diligence , used to say , " Go on , my boy ; work , study , Colin , and one day you will go as well dressed as the parish churchwarden ! " A country apothecary who visited the school , admired the robust boy 's arms , and offered to take him into his laboratory to pound his drugs , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue his lessons . But the apothecary would not permit him to spend any part of his time in learning ; and on ascertaining this , the youth immediately determined to quit his service . He therefore left Saint-Andre and took the road for Paris with his havresac on his back . Arrived there , he searched for a place as apothecary 's boy , but could not find one . Worn out by fatigue and destitution , Vauquelin fell ill , and in that state was taken to the hospital , where he thought he should die . But better things were in store for the poor boy . He recovered , and again proceeded in his search of employment , which he at length found with an apothecary . Shortly after , he became known to Fourcroy the eminent chemist , who was so pleased with the youth that he made him his private secretary ; and many years after , on the death of that great philosopher , Vauquelin succeeded him as Professor of Chemistry . Finally , in 1829 , the electors of the district of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he re-entered in triumph the village which he had left so many years before , so poor and so obscure . England has no parallel instances to show , of promotions from the ranks of the army to the highest military offices ; which have been so common in France since the first Revolution . " La carriere ouverte aux talents " has there received many striking illustrations , which would doubtless be matched among ourselves were the road to promotion as open . Hoche , Humbert , and Pichegru , began their respective careers as private soldiers . Hoche , while in the King 's army , was accustomed to embroider waistcoats to enable him to earn money wherewith to purchase books on military science . Humbert was a scapegrace when a youth ; at sixteen he ran away from home , and was by turns servant to a tradesman at Nancy , a workman at Lyons , and a hawker of rabbit skins . In 1792 , he enlisted as a volunteer ; and in a year he was general of brigade . Kleber , Lefevre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Cyr , D'Erlon , Murat , Augereau , Bessieres , and Ney , all rose from the ranks . In some cases promotion was rapid , in others it was slow . Saint Cyr , the son of a tanner of Toul , began life as an actor , after which he enlisted in the Chasseurs , and was promoted to a captaincy within a year . Victor , Duc de Belluno , enlisted in the Artillery in 1781 : during the events preceding the Revolution he was discharged ; but immediately on the outbreak of war he re-enlisted , and in the course of a few months his intrepidity and ability secured his promotion as Adjutant-Major and chief of battalion . Murat , " le beau sabreur , " was the son of a village innkeeper in Perigord , where he looked after the horses . He first enlisted in a regiment of Chasseurs , from which he was dismissed for insubordination : but again enlisting , he shortly rose to the rank of Colonel . Ney enlisted at eighteen in a hussar regiment , and gradually advanced step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him " The Indefatigable , " and promoted him to be Adjutant-General when only twenty-five . On the other hand , Soult 2 was six years from the date of his enlistment before he reached the rank of sergeant . But Soult 's advancement was rapid compared with that of Massena , who served for fourteen years before he was made sergeant ; and though he afterwards rose successively , step by step , to the grades of Colonel , General of Division , and Marshal , he declared that the post of sergeant was the step which of all others had cost him the most labour to win . Similar promotions from the ranks , in the French army , have continued down to our own day . Changarnier entered the King 's bodyguard as a private in 1815 . Marshal Bugeaud served four years in the ranks , after which he was made an officer . Marshal Randon , the present French Minister of War , began his military career as a drummer boy ; and in the portrait of him in the gallery at Versailles , his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his own request . Instances such as these inspire French soldiers with enthusiasm for their service , as each private feels that he may possibly carry the baton of a marshal in his knapsack . The instances of men , in this and other countries , who , by dint of persevering application and energy , have raised themselves from the humblest ranks of industry to eminent positions of usefulness and influence in society , are indeed so numerous that they have long ceased to be regarded as exceptional . Looking at some of the more remarkable , it might almost be said that early encounter with difficulty and adverse circumstances was the necessary and indispensable condition of success . The British House of Commons has always contained a considerable number of such self-raised men -- fitting representatives of the industrial character of the people ; and it is to the credit of our Legislature that they have been welcomed and honoured there . When the late Joseph Brotherton , member for Salford , in the course of the discussion on the Ten Hours Bill , detailed with true pathos the hardships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a factory boy in a cotton mill , and described the resolution which he had then formed , that if ever it was in his power he would endeavour to ameliorate the condition of that class , Sir James Graham rose immediately after him , and declared , amidst the cheers of the House , that he did not before know that Mr. Brotherton 's origin had been so humble , but that it rendered him more proud than he had ever before been of the House of Commons , to think that a person risen from that condition should be able to sit side by side , on equal terms , with the hereditary gentry of the land . The late Mr. Fox , member for Oldham , was accustomed to introduce his recollections of past times with the words , " when I was working as a weaver boy at Norwich ; " and there are other members of parliament , still living , whose origin has been equally humble . Mr. Lindsay , the well-known ship owner , until recently member for Sunderland , once told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in answer to an attack made upon him by his political opponents . He had been left an orphan at fourteen , and when he left Glasgow for Liverpool to push his way in the world , not being able to pay the usual fare , the captain of the steamer agreed to take his labour in exchange , and the boy worked his passage by trimming the coals in the coal hole . At Liverpool he remained for seven weeks before he could obtain employment , during which time he lived in sheds and fared hardly ; until at last he found shelter on board a West Indiaman . He entered as a boy , and before he was nineteen , by steady good conduct he had risen to the command of a ship . At twenty-three he retired from the sea , and settled on shore , after which his progress was rapid " he had prospered , " he said , " by steady industry , by constant work , and by ever keeping in view the great principle of doing to others as you would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Birkenhead , the present member for North Derbyshire , bears considerable resemblance to that of Mr. Lindsay . His father , a surgeon at Lancaster , died , leaving a family of eleven children , of whom William Jackson was the seventh son . The elder boys had been well educated while the father lived , but at his death the younger members had to shift for themselves . William , when under twelve years old , was taken from school , and put to hard work at a ship 's side from six in the morning till nine at night . His master falling ill , the boy was taken into the counting-house , where he had more leisure . This gave him an opportunity of reading , and having obtained access to a set of the ' Encyclopaedia Britannica , ' he read the volumes through from A to Z , partly by day , but chiefly at night . He afterwards put himself to a trade , was diligent , and succeeded in it . Now he has ships sailing on almost every sea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among like men of the same class may be ranked the late Richard Cobden , whose start in life was equally humble . The son of a small farmer at Midhurst in Sussex , he was sent at an early age to London and employed as a boy in a warehouse in the City . He was diligent , well conducted , and eager for information . His master , a man of the old school , warned him against too much reading ; but the boy went on in his own course , storing his mind with the wealth found in books . He was promoted from one position of trust to another  - -  became a traveller for his house  --  secured a large connection , and eventually started in business as a calico printer at Manchester . Taking an interest in public questions , more especially in popular education , his attention was gradually drawn to the subject of the Corn Laws , to the repeal of which he may be said to have devoted his fortune and his life . It may be mentioned as a curious fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total failure . But he had great perseverance , application , and energy ; and with persistency and practice , he became at length one of the most persuasive and effective of public speakers , extorting the disinterested eulogy of even Sir Robert Peel himself . M. Drouyn de Lhuys , the French Ambassador , has eloquently said of Mr. Cobden , that he was " a living proof of what merit , perseverance , and labour can accomplish ; one of the most complete examples of those men who , sprung from the humblest ranks of society , raise themselves to the highest rank in public estimation by the effect of their own worth and of their personal services ; finally , one of the rarest examples of the solid qualities inherent in the English character . " In all these cases , strenuous individual application was the price paid for distinction ; excellence of any sort being invariably placed beyond the reach of indolence . It is the diligent hand and head alone that maketh rich  --  in self-culture , growth in wisdom , and in business . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any solid reputation which they may individually achieve can only be attained by energetic application ; for though an inheritance of acres may be bequeathed , an inheritance of knowledge and wisdom can not . The wealthy man may pay others for doing his work for him , but it is impossible to get his thinking done for him by another , or to purchase any kind of self-culture . Indeed , the doctrine that excellence in any pursuit is only to be achieved by laborious application , holds as true in the case of the man of wealth as in that of Drew and Gifford , whose only school was a cobbler 's stall , or Hugh Miller , whose only college was a Cromarty stone quarry . Riches and ease , it is perfectly clear , are not necessary for man 's highest culture , else had not the world been so largely indebted in all times to those who have sprung from the humbler ranks . An easy and luxurious existence does not train men to effort or encounter with difficulty ; nor does it awaken that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective action in life . Indeed , so far from poverty being a misfortune , it may , by vigorous self-help , be converted even into a blessing ; rousing a man to that struggle with the world in which , though some may purchase ease by degradation , the right-minded and true-hearted find strength , confidence , and triumph . Bacon says , " Men seem neither to understand their riches nor their strength : of the former they believe greater things than they should ; of the latter much less . Self-reliance and self-denial will teach a man to drink out of his own cistern , and eat his own sweet bread , and to learn and labour truly to get his living , and carefully to expend the good things committed to his trust . " Riches are so great a temptation to ease and self-indulgence , to which men are by nature prone , that the glory is all the greater of those who , born to ample fortunes , nevertheless take an active part in the work of their generation  --  who " scorn delights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wealthier ranks in this country that they are not idlers ; for they do their fair share of the work of the state , and usually take more than their fair share of its dangers . It was a fine thing said of a subaltern officer in the Peninsular campaigns , observed trudging alone through mud and mire by the side of his regiment , " There goes 15,000l. a year ! " and in our own day , the bleak slopes of Sebastopol and the burning soil of India have borne witness to the like noble self-denial and devotion on the part of our gentler classes ; many a gallant and noble fellow , of rank and estate , having risked his life , or lost it , in one or other of those fields of action , in the service of his country . Nor have the wealthier classes been undistinguished in the more peaceful pursuits of philosophy and science . Take , for instance , the great names of Bacon , the father of modern philosophy , and of Worcester , Boyle , Cavendish , Talbot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be regarded as the great mechanic of the peerage ; a man who , if he had not been born a peer , would probably have taken the highest rank as an inventor . So thorough is his knowledge of smith-work that he is said to have been pressed on one occasion to accept the foremanship of a large workshop , by a manufacturer to whom his rank was unknown . The great Rosse telescope , of his own fabrication , is certainly the most extraordinary instrument of the kind that has yet been constructed . But it is principally in the departments of politics and literature that we find the most energetic labourers amongst our higher classes . Success in these lines of action , as in all others , can only be achieved through industry , practice , and study ; and the great Minister , or parliamentary leader , must necessarily be amongst the very hardest of workers . Such was Palmerston ; and such are Derby and Russell , Disraeli and Gladstone . These men have had the benefit of no Ten Hours Bill , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked " double shift , " almost day and night . One of the most illustrious of such workers in modern times was unquestionably the late Sir Robert Peel . He possessed in an extraordinary degree the power of continuous intellectual labour , nor did he spare himself . His career , indeed , presented a remarkable example of how much a man of comparatively moderate powers can accomplish by means of assiduous application and indefatigable industry . During the forty years that he held a seat in Parliament , his labours were prodigious . He was a most conscientious man , and whatever he undertook to do , he did thoroughly . All his speeches bear evidence of his careful study of everything that had been spoken or written on the subject under consideration . He was elaborate almost to excess ; and spared no pains to adapt himself to the various capacities of his audience . Withal , he possessed much practical sagacity , great strength of purpose , and power to direct the issues of action with steady hand and eye . In one respect he surpassed most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and age , instead of contracting , only served to mellow and ripen his nature . To the last he continued open to the reception of new views , and , though many thought him cautious to excess , he did not allow himself to fall into that indiscriminating admiration of the past , which is the palsy of many minds similarly educated , and renders the old age of many nothing but a pity . The indefatigable industry of Lord Brougham has become almost proverbial . His public labours have extended over a period of upwards of sixty years , during which he has ranged over many fields  --  of law , literature , politics , and science ,  --  and achieved distinction in them all . How he contrived it , has been to many a mystery . Once , when Sir Samuel Romilly was requested to undertake some new work , he excused himself by saying that he had no time ; " but , " he added , " go with it to that fellow Brougham , he seems to have time for everything . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute unemployed ; withal he possessed a constitution of iron . When arrived at an age at which most men would have retired from the world to enjoy their hard-earned leisure , perhaps to doze away their time in an easy chair , Lord Brougham commenced and prosecuted a series of elaborate investigations as to the laws of Light , and he submitted the results to the most scientific audiences that Paris and London could muster . About the same time , he was passing through the press his admirable sketches of the ' Men of Science and Literature of the Reign of George III. , ' and taking his full share of the law business and the political discussions in the House of Lords . Sydney Smith once recommended him to confine himself to only the transaction of so much business as three strong men could get through . But such was Brougham 's love of work  --  long become a habit  --  that no amount of application seems to have been too great for him ; and such was his love of excellence , that it has been said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that of a shoe-black , he would never have rested satisfied until he had become the best shoe-black in England . Another hard-working man of the same class is Sir E. Bulwer Lytton . Few writers have done more , or achieved higher distinction in various walks  --  as a novelist , poet , dramatist , historian , essayist , orator , and politician . He has worked his way step by step , disdainful of ease , and animated throughout by the ardent desire to excel . On the score of mere industry , there are few living English writers who have written so much , and none that have produced so much of high quality . The industry of Bulwer is entitled to all the greater praise that it has been entirely self-imposed . To hunt , and shoot , and live at ease ,  --  to frequent the clubs and enjoy the opera , with the variety of London visiting and sight-seeing during the " season , " and then off to the country mansion , with its well-stocked preserves , and its thousand delightful out-door pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Rome ,  --  all this is excessively attractive to a lover of pleasure and a man of fortune , and by no means calculated to make him voluntarily undertake continuous labour of any kind . Yet these pleasures , all within his reach , Bulwer must , as compared with men born to similar estate , have denied himself in assuming the position and pursuing the career of a literary man . Like Byron , his first effort was poetical ( ' Weeds and Wild Flowers ' ) , and a failure . His second was a novel ( ' Falkland ' ) , and it proved a failure too . A man of weaker nerve would have dropped authorship ; but Bulwer had pluck and perseverance ; and he worked on , determined to succeed . He was incessantly industrious , read extensively , and from failure went courageously onwards to success . ' Pelham ' followed ' Falkland ' within a year , and the remainder of Bulwer 's literary life , now extending over a period of thirty years , has been a succession of triumphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industry and application in working out an eminent public career . His first achievements were , like Bulwer 's , in literature ; and he reached success only through a succession of failures . His ' Wondrous Tale of Alroy ' and ' Revolutionary Epic ' were laughed at , and regarded as indications of literary lunacy . But he worked on in other directions , and his ' Coningsby , ' ' Sybil , ' and ' Tancred , ' proved the sterling stuff of which he was made . As an orator too , his first appearance in the House of Commons was a failure . It was spoken of as " more screaming than an Adelphi farce . " Though composed in a grand and ambitious strain , every sentence was hailed with " loud laughter . " ' Hamlet ' played as a comedy were nothing to it . But he concluded with a sentence which embodied a prophecy . Writhing under the laughter with which his studied eloquence had been received , he exclaimed , " I have begun several times many things , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down now , but the time will come when you will hear me . " The time did come ; and how Disraeli succeeded in at length commanding the attention of the first assembly of gentlemen in the world , affords a striking illustration of what energy and determination will do ; for Disraeli earned his position by dint of patient industry . He did not , as many young men do , having once failed , retire dejected , to mope and whine in a corner , but diligently set himself to work . He carefully unlearnt his faults , studied the character of his audience , practised sedulously the art of speech , and industriously filled his mind with the elements of parliamentary knowledge . He worked patiently for success ; and it came , but slowly : then the House laughed with him , instead of at him . The recollection of his early failure was effaced , and by general consent he was at length admitted to be one of the most finished and effective of parliamentary speakers . Although much may be accomplished by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set forth in the following pages serve to illustrate , it must at the same time be acknowledged that the help which we derive from others in the journey of life is of very great importance . The poet Wordsworth has well said that " these two things , contradictory though they may seem , must go together  --  manly dependence and manly independence , manly reliance and manly self-reliance . " From infancy to old age , all are more or less indebted to others for nurture and culture ; and the best and strongest are usually found the readiest to acknowledge such help . Take , for example , the career of the late Alexis de Tocqueville , a man doubly well-born , for his father was a distinguished peer of France , and his mother a grand-daughter of Malesherbes . Through powerful family influence , he was appointed Judge Auditor at Versailles when only twenty-one ; but probably feeling that he had not fairly won the position by merit , he determined to give it up and owe his future advancement in life to himself alone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Tocqueville bravely acted it out . He resigned his appointment , and made arrangements to leave France for the purpose of travelling through the United States , the results of which were published in his great book on ' Democracy in America . ' His friend and travelling companion , Gustave de Beaumont , has described his indefatigable industry during this journey . " His nature , " he says , " was wholly averse to idleness , and whether he was travelling or resting , his mind was always at work . . . . With Alexis , the most agreeable conversation was that which was the most useful . The worst day was the lost day , or the day ill spent ; the least loss of time annoyed him . " Tocqueville himself wrote to a friend  --  " There is no time of life at which one can wholly cease from action , for effort without one 's self , and still more effort within , is equally necessary , if not more so , when we grow old , as it is in youth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without ceasing towards a colder and colder region ; the higher he goes , the faster he ought to walk . The great malady of the soul is cold . And in resisting this formidable evil , one needs not only to be sustained by the action of a mind employed , but also by contact with one 's fellows in the business of life . " 3 Notwithstanding de Tocqueville 's decided views as to the necessity of exercising individual energy and self-dependence , no one could be more ready than he was to recognise the value of that help and support for which all men are indebted to others in a greater or less degree . Thus , he often acknowledged , with gratitude , his obligations to his friends De Kergorlay and Stofells ,  --  to the former for intellectual assistance , and to the latter for moral support and sympathy . To De Kergorlay he wrote  --  " Thine is the only soul in which I have confidence , and whose influence exercises a genuine effect upon my own . Many others have influence upon the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence as thou on the origination of fundamental ideas , and of those principles which are the rule of conduct . " De Tocqueville was not less ready to confess the great obligations which he owed to his wife , Marie , for the preservation of that temper and frame of mind which enabled him to prosecute his studies with success . He believed that a noble-minded woman insensibly elevated the character of her husband , while one of a grovelling nature as certainly tended to degrade it . 4 In fine , human character is moulded by a thousand subtle influences ; by example and precept ; by life and literature ; by friends and neighbours ; by the world we live in as well as by the spirits of our forefathers , whose legacy of good words and deeds we inherit . But great , unquestionably , though these influences are acknowledged to be , it is nevertheless equally clear that men must necessarily be the active agents of their own well-being and well-doing ; and that , however much the wise and the good may owe to others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be their own best helpers . CHAPTER II  --  LEADERS OF INDUSTRY  --  INVENTORS AND PRODUCERS " Le travail et la Science sont desormais les maitres du monde . "  --  De Salvandy . " Deduct all that men of the humbler classes have done for England in the way of inventions only , and see where she would have been but for them . "  --  Arthur Helps . One of the most strongly-marked features of the English people is their spirit of industry , standing out prominent and distinct in their past history , and as strikingly characteristic of them now as at any former period . It is this spirit , displayed by the commons of England , which has laid the foundations and built up the industrial greatness of the empire . This vigorous growth of the nation has been mainly the result of the free energy of individuals , and it has been contingent upon the number of hands and minds from time to time actively employed within it , whether as cultivators of the soil , producers of articles of utility , contrivers of tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of art . And while this spirit of active industry has been the vital principle of the nation , it has also been its saving and remedial one , counteracting from time to time the effects of errors in our laws and imperfections in our constitution . The career of industry which the nation has pursued , has also proved its best education . As steady application to work is the healthiest training for every individual , so is it the best discipline of a state . Honourable industry travels the same road with duty ; and Providence has closely linked both with happiness . The gods , says the poet , have placed labour and toil on the way leading to the Elysian fields . Certain it is that no bread eaten by man is so sweet as that earned by his own labour , whether bodily or mental . By labour the earth has been subdued , and man redeemed from barbarism ; nor has a single step in civilization been made without it . Labour is not only a necessity and a duty , but a blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The duty of work is written on the thews and muscles of the limbs , the mechanism of the hand , the nerves and lobes of the brain  --  the sum of whose healthy action is satisfaction and enjoyment . In the school of labour is taught the best practical wisdom ; nor is a life of manual employment , as we shall hereafter find , incompatible with high mental culture . Hugh Miller , than whom none knew better the strength and the weakness belonging to the lot of labour , stated the result of his experience to be , that Work , even the hardest , is full of pleasure and materials for self-improvement . He held honest labour to be the best of teachers , and that the school of toil is the noblest of schools  --  save only the Christian one ,  --  that it is a school in which the ability of being useful is imparted , the spirit of independence learnt , and the habit of persevering effort acquired . He was even of opinion that the training of the mechanic ,  --  by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his daily dealing with things actual and practical , and the close experience of life which he acquires ,  --  better fits him for picking his way along the journey of life , and is more favourable to his growth as a Man , emphatically speaking , than the training afforded by any other condition . The array of great names which we have already cursorily cited , of men springing from the ranks of the industrial classes , who have achieved distinction in various walks of life  --  in science , commerce , literature , and art  --  shows that at all events the difficulties interposed by poverty and labour are not insurmountable . As respects the great contrivances and inventions which have conferred so much power and wealth upon the nation , it is unquestionable that for the greater part of them we have been indebted to men of the humblest rank . Deduct what they have done in this particular line of action , and it will be found that very little indeed remains for other men to have accomplished . Inventors have set in motion some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society owes many of its chief necessaries , comforts , and luxuries ; and by their genius and labour daily life has been rendered in all respects more easy as well as enjoyable . Our food , our clothing , the furniture of our homes , the glass which admits the light to our dwellings at the same time that it excludes the cold , the gas which illuminates our streets , our means of locomotion by land and by sea , the tools by which our various articles of necessity and luxury are fabricated , have been the result of the labour and ingenuity of many men and many minds . Mankind at large are all the happier for such inventions , and are every day reaping the benefit of them in an increase of individual well-being as well as of public enjoyment . Though the invention of the working steam-engine  --  the king of machines  --  belongs , comparatively speaking , to our own epoch , the idea of it was born many centuries ago . Like other contrivances and discoveries , it was effected step by step  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time apparently useless , to his successors , who took it up and carried it forward another stage ,  - -  the prosecution of the inquiry extending over many generations . Thus the idea promulgated by Hero of Alexandria was never altogether lost ; but , like the grain of wheat hid in the hand of the Egyptian mummy , it sprouted and again grew vigorously when brought into the full light of modern science . The steam-engine was nothing , however , until it emerged from the state of theory , and was taken in hand by practical mechanics ; and what a noble story of patient , laborious investigation , of difficulties encountered and overcome by heroic industry , does not that marvellous machine tell of ! It is indeed , in itself , a monument of the power of self-help in man . Grouped around it we find Savary , the military engineer ; Newcomen , the Dartmouth blacksmith ; Cawley , the glazier ; Potter , the engine-boy ; Smeaton , the civil engineer ; and , towering above all , the laborious , patient , never-tiring James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most industrious of men ; and the story of his life proves , what all experience confirms , that it is not the man of the greatest natural vigour and capacity who achieves the highest results , but he who employs his powers with the greatest industry and the most carefully disciplined skill  --  the skill that comes by labour , application , and experience . Many men in his time knew far more than Watt , but none laboured so assiduously as he did to turn all that he did know to useful practical purposes . He was , above all things , most persevering in the pursuit of facts . He cultivated carefully that habit of active attention on which all the higher working qualities of the mind mainly depend . Indeed , Mr. Edgeworth entertained the opinion , that the difference of intellect in men depends more upon the early cultivation of this HABIT OF ATTENTION , than upon any great disparity between the powers of one individual and another . Even when a boy , Watt found science in his toys . The quadrants lying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of optics and astronomy ; his ill health induced him to pry into the secrets of physiology ; and his solitary walks through the country attracted him to the study of botany and history . While carrying on the business of a mathematical-instrument maker , he received an order to build an organ ; and , though without an ear for music , he undertook the study of harmonics , and successfully constructed the instrument . And , in like manner , when the little model of Newcomen 's steam-engine , belonging to the University of Glasgow , was placed in his hands to repair , he forthwith set himself to learn all that was then known about heat , evaporation , and condensation ,  --  at the same time plodding his way in mechanics and the science of construction ,  --  the results of which he at length embodied in his condensing steam-engine . For ten years he went on contriving and inventing  --  with little hope to cheer him , and with few friends to encourage him . He went on , meanwhile , earning bread for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiddles , flutes , and musical instruments ; measuring mason-work , surveying roads , superintending the construction of canals , or doing anything that turned up , and offered a prospect of honest gain . At length , Watt found a fit partner in another eminent leader of industry  --  Matthew Boulton , of Birmingham ; a skilful , energetic , and far-seeing man , who vigorously undertook the enterprise of introducing the condensing-engine into general use as a working power ; and the success of both is now matter of history . 5 Many skilful inventors have from time to time added new power to the steam-engine ; and , by numerous modifications , rendered it capable of being applied to nearly all the purposes of manufacture -- driving machinery , impelling ships , grinding corn , printing books , stamping money , hammering , planing , and turning iron ; in short , of performing every description of mechanical labour where power is required . One of the most useful modifications in the engine was that devised by Trevithick , and eventually perfected by George Stephenson and his son , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes of immense importance have been brought about , of even greater consequence , considered in their results on human progress and civilization , than the condensing-engine of Watt . One of the first grand results of Watt 's invention ,  --  which placed an almost unlimited power at the command of the producing classes , - - was the establishment of the cotton-manufacture . The person most closely identified with the foundation of this great branch of industry was unquestionably Sir Richard Arkwright , whose practical energy and sagacity were perhaps even more remarkable than his mechanical inventiveness . His originality as an inventor has indeed been called in question , like that of Watt and Stephenson . Arkwright probably stood in the same relation to the spinning-machine that Watt did to the steam-engine and Stephenson to the locomotive . He gathered together the scattered threads of ingenuity which already existed , and wove them , after his own design , into a new and original fabric . Though Lewis Paul , of Birmingham , patented the invention of spinning by rollers thirty years before Arkwright , the machines constructed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be profitably worked , and the invention was practically a failure . Another obscure mechanic , a reed-maker of Leigh , named Thomas Highs , is also said to have invented the water-frame and spinning-jenny ; but they , too , proved unsuccessful . When the demands of industry are found to press upon the resources of inventors , the same idea is usually found floating about in many minds ;  --  such has been the case with the steam-engine , the safety-lamp , the electric telegraph , and other inventions . Many ingenious minds are found labouring in the throes of invention , until at length the master mind , the strong practical man , steps forward , and straightway delivers them of their idea , applies the principle successfully , and the thing is done . Then there is a loud outcry among all the smaller contrivers , who see themselves distanced in the race ; and hence men such as Watt , Stephenson , and Arkwright , have usually to defend their reputation and their rights as practical and successful inventors . Richard Arkwright , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was born in Preston in 1732 . His parents were very poor , and he was the youngest of thirteen children . He was never at school : the only education he received he gave to himself ; and to the last he was only able to write with difficulty . When a boy , he was apprenticed to a barber , and after learning the business , he set up for himself in Bolton , where he occupied an underground cellar , over which he put up the sign , " Come to the subterraneous barber  --  he shaves for a penny . " The other barbers found their customers leaving them , and reduced their prices to his standard , when Arkwright , determined to push his trade , announced his determination to give " A clean shave for a halfpenny . " After a few years he quitted his cellar , and became an itinerant dealer in hair . At that time wigs were worn , and wig-making formed an important branch of the barbering business . Arkwright went about buying hair for the wigs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorted to by young women , for the purpose of securing their long tresses ; and it is said that in negotiations of this sort he was very successful . He also dealt in a chemical hair dye , which he used adroitly , and thereby secured a considerable trade . But he does not seem , notwithstanding his pushing character , to have done more than earn a bare living . The fashion of wig-wearing having undergone a change , distress fell upon the wig-makers ; and Arkwright , being of a mechanical turn , was consequently induced to turn machine inventor or " conjurer , " as the pursuit was then popularly termed . Many attempts were made about that time to invent a spinning-machine , and our barber determined to launch his little bark on the sea of invention with the rest . Like other self-taught men of the same bias , he had already been devoting his spare time to the invention of a perpetual-motion machine ; and from that the transition to a spinning-machine was easy . He followed his experiments so assiduously that he neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was reduced to great poverty . His wife  --  for he had by this time married  --  was impatient at what she conceived to be a wanton waste of time and money , and in a moment of sudden wrath she seized upon and destroyed his models , hoping thus to remove the cause of the family privations . Arkwright was a stubborn and enthusiastic man , and he was provoked beyond measure by this conduct of his wife , from whom he immediately separated . In travelling about the country , Arkwright had become acquainted with a person named Kay , a clockmaker at Warrington , who assisted him in constructing some of the parts of his perpetual-motion machinery . It is supposed that he was informed by Kay of the principle of spinning by rollers ; but it is also said that the idea was first suggested to him by accidentally observing a red-hot piece of iron become elongated by passing between iron rollers . However this may be , the idea at once took firm possession of his mind , and he proceeded to devise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to tell him nothing on this point . Arkwright now abandoned his business of hair collecting , and devoted himself to the perfecting of his machine , a model of which , constructed by Kay under his directions , he set up in the parlour of the Free Grammar School at Preston . Being a burgess of the town , he voted at the contested election at which General Burgoyne was returned ; but such was his poverty , and such the tattered state of his dress , that a number of persons subscribed a sum sufficient to have him put in a state fit to appear in the poll-room . The exhibition of his machine in a town where so many workpeople lived by the exercise of manual labour proved a dangerous experiment ; ominous growlings were heard outside the school-room from time to time , and Arkwright ,  --  remembering the fate of Kay , who was mobbed and compelled to fly from Lancashire because of his invention of the fly-shuttle , and of poor Hargreaves , whose spinning-jenny had been pulled to pieces only a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on packing up his model and removing to a less dangerous locality . He went accordingly to Nottingham , where he applied to some of the local bankers for pecuniary assistance ; and the Messrs . Wright consented to advance him a sum of money on condition of sharing in the profits of the invention . The machine , however , not being perfected so soon as they had anticipated , the bankers recommended Arkwright to apply to Messrs . Strutt and Need , the former of whom was the ingenious inventor and patentee of the stocking-frame . Mr. Strutt at once appreciated the merits of the invention , and a partnership was entered into with Arkwright , whose road to fortune was now clear . The patent was secured in the name of " Richard Arkwright , of Nottingham , clockmaker , " and it is a circumstance worthy of note , that it was taken out in 1769 , the same year in which Watt secured the patent for his steam-engine . A cotton-mill was first erected at Nottingham , driven by horses ; and another was shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Derbyshire , turned by a water-wheel , from which circumstance the spinning-machine came to be called the water-frame . Arkwright 's labours , however , were , comparatively speaking , only begun . He had still to perfect all the working details of his machine . It was in his hands the subject of constant modification and improvement , until eventually it was rendered practicable and profitable in an eminent degree . But success was only secured by long and patient labour : for some years , indeed , the speculation was disheartening and unprofitable , swallowing up a very large amount of capital without any result . When success began to appear more certain , then the Lancashire manufacturers fell upon Arkwright 's patent to pull it in pieces , as the Cornish miners fell upon Boulton and Watt to rob them of the profits of their steam-engine . Arkwright was even denounced as the enemy of the working people ; and a mill which he built near Chorley was destroyed by a mob in the presence of a strong force of police and military . The Lancashire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessedly the best in the market . Then they refused to pay patent-right for the use of his machines , and combined to crush him in the courts of law . To the disgust of right-minded people , Arkwright 's patent was upset . After the trial , when passing the hotel at which his opponents were staying , one of them said , loud enough to be heard by him , " Well , we 've done the old shaver at last ; " to which he coolly replied , " Never mind , I 've a razor left that will shave you all . " He established new mills in Lancashire , Derbyshire , and at New Lanark , in Scotland . The mills at Cromford also came into his hands at the expiry of his partnership with Strutt , and the amount and the excellence of his products were such , that in a short time he obtained so complete a control of the trade , that the prices were fixed by him , and he governed the main operations of the other cotton-spinners . Arkwright was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much worldly shrewdness , with a business faculty almost amounting to genius . At one period his time was engrossed by severe and continuous labour , occasioned by the organising and conducting of his numerous manufactories , sometimes from four in the morning till nine at night . At fifty years of age he set to work to learn English grammar , and improve himself in writing and orthography . After overcoming every obstacle , he had the satisfaction of reaping the reward of his enterprise . Eighteen years after he had constructed his first machine , he rose to such estimation in Derbyshire that he was appointed High Sheriff of the county , and shortly after George III . conferred upon him the honour of knighthood . He died in 1792 . Be it for good or for evil , Arkwright was the founder in England of the modern factory system , a branch of industry which has unquestionably proved a source of immense wealth to individuals and to the nation . All the other great branches of industry in Britain furnish like examples of energetic men of business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have laboured , and of increased power and wealth to the community at large . Amongst such might be cited the Strutts of Belper ; the Tennants of Glasgow ; the Marshalls and Gotts of Leeds ; the Peels , Ashworths , Birleys , Fieldens , Ashtons , Heywoods , and Ainsworths of South Lancashire , some of whose descendants have since become distinguished in connection with the political history of England . Such pre-eminently were the Peels of South Lancashire . The founder of the Peel family , about the middle of last century , was a small yeoman , occupying the Hole House Farm , near Blackburn , from which he afterwards removed to a house situated in Fish Lane in that town . Robert Peel , as he advanced in life , saw a large family of sons and daughters growing up about him ; but the land about Blackburn being somewhat barren , it did not appear to him that agricultural pursuits offered a very encouraging prospect for their industry . The place had , however , long been the seat of a domestic manufacture  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen weft and cotton warp , being chiefly made in that town and its neighbourhood . It was then customary  --  previous to the introduction of the factory system  --  for industrious yeomen with families to employ the time not occupied in the fields in weaving at home ; and Robert Peel accordingly began the domestic trade of calico-making . He was honest , and made an honest article ; thrifty and hardworking , and his trade prospered . He was also enterprising , and was one of the first to adopt the carding cylinder , then recently invented . But Robert Peel 's attention was principally directed to the PRINTING of calico  --  then a comparatively unknown art  --  and for some time he carried on a series of experiments with the object of printing by machinery . The experiments were secretly conducted in his own house , the cloth being ironed for the purpose by one of the women of the family . It was then customary , in such houses as the Peels , to use pewter plates at dinner . Having sketched a figure or pattern on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impression might be got from it in reverse , and printed on calico with colour . In a cottage at the end of the farm-house lived a woman who kept a calendering machine , and going into her cottage , he put the plate with colour rubbed into the figured part and some calico over it , through the machine , when it was found to leave a satisfactory impression . Such is said to have been the origin of roller printing on calico . Robert Peel shortly perfected his process , and the first pattern he brought out was a parsley leaf ; hence he is spoken of in the neighbourhood of Blackburn to this day as " Parsley Peel . " The process of calico printing by what is called the mule machine  --  that is , by means of a wooden cylinder in relief , with an engraved copper cylinder  --  was afterwards brought to perfection by one of his sons , the head of the firm of Messrs . Peel and Co. , of Church . Stimulated by his success , Robert Peel shortly gave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two miles from Blackburn , he devoted himself exclusively to the printing business . There , with the aid of his sons , who were as energetic as himself , he successfully carried on the trade for several years ; and as the young men grew up towards manhood , the concern branched out into various firms of Peels , each of which became a centre of industrial activity and a source of remunerative employment to large numbers of people . From what can now be learnt of the character of the original and untitled Robert Peel , he must have been a remarkable man  --  shrewd , sagacious , and far-seeing . But little is known of him excepting from traditions and the sons of those who knew him are fast passing away . His son , Sir Robert , thus modestly spoke of him : - " My father may be truly said to have been the founder of our family ; and he so accurately appreciated the importance of commercial wealth in a national point of view , that he was often heard to say that the gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from trade . " Sir Robert Peel , the first baronet and the second manufacturer of the name , inherited all his father 's enterprise , ability , and industry . His position , at starting in life , was little above that of an ordinary working man ; for his father , though laying the foundations of future prosperity , was still struggling with the difficulties arising from insufficient capital . When Robert was only twenty years of age , he determined to begin the business of cotton-printing , which he had by this time learnt from his father , on his own account . His uncle , James Haworth , and William Yates of Blackburn , joined him in his enterprise ; the whole capital which they could raise amongst them amounting to only about 500l. , the principal part of which was supplied by William Yates . The father of the latter was a householder in Blackburn , where he was well known and much respected ; and having saved money by his business , he was willing to advance sufficient to give his son a start in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robert Peel , though comparatively a mere youth , supplied the practical knowledge of the business ; but it was said of him , and proved true , that he " carried an old head on young shoulders . " A ruined corn-mill , with its adjoining fields , was purchased for a comparatively small sum , near the then insignificant town of Bury , where the works long after continued to be known as " The Ground ; " and a few wooden sheds having been run up , the firm commenced their cotton-printing business in a very humble way in the year 1770 , adding to it that of cotton-spinning a few years later . The frugal style in which the partners lived may be inferred from the following incident in their early career . William Yates , being a married man with a family , commenced housekeeping on a small scale , and , to oblige Peel , who was single , he agreed to take him as a lodger . The sum which the latter first paid for board and lodging was only 8s. a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the weekly payment being increased a shilling , to which Peel at first demurred , and a difference between the partners took place , which was eventually compromised by the lodger paying an advance of sixpence a week . William Yates 's eldest child was a girl named Ellen , and she very soon became an especial favourite with the young lodger . On returning from his hard day 's work at " The Ground , " he would take the little girl upon his knee , and say to her , " Nelly , thou bonny little dear , wilt be my wife ? " to which the child would readily answer " Yes , " as any child would do . " Then I 'll wait for thee , Nelly ; I 'll wed thee , and none else . " And Robert Peel did wait . As the girl grew in beauty towards womanhood , his determination to wait for her was strengthened ; and after the lapse of ten years  --  years of close application to business and rapidly increasing prosperity  --  Robert Peel married Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pretty child , whom her mother 's lodger and father 's partner had nursed upon his knee , became Mrs. Peel , and eventually Lady Peel , the mother of the future Prime Minister of England . Lady Peel was a noble and beautiful woman , fitted to grace any station in life . She possessed rare powers of mind , and was , on every emergency , the high-souled and faithful counsellor of her husband . For many years after their marriage , she acted as his amanuensis , conducting the principal part of his business correspondence , for Mr. Peel himself was an indifferent and almost unintelligible writer . She died in 1803 , only three years after the Baronetcy had been conferred upon her husband . It is said that London fashionable life  --  so unlike what she had been accustomed to at home  --  proved injurious to her health ; and old Mr. Yates afterwards used to say , " if Robert had n't made our Nelly a ' Lady , ' she might ha ' been living yet . " The career of Yates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uninterrupted prosperity . Sir Robert Peel himself was the soul of the firm ; to great energy and application uniting much practical sagacity , and first-rate mercantile abilities  --  qualities in which many of the early cotton-spinners were exceedingly deficient . He was a man of iron mind and frame , and toiled unceasingly . In short , he was to cotton printing what Arkwright was to cotton-spinning , and his success was equally great . The excellence of the articles produced by the firm secured the command of the market , and the character of the firm stood pre-eminent in Lancashire . Besides greatly benefiting Bury , the partnership planted similar extensive works in the neighbourhood , on the Irwell and the Roch ; and it was cited to their honour , that , while they sought to raise to the highest perfection the quality of their manufactures , they also endeavoured , in all ways , to promote the well-being and comfort of their workpeople ; for whom they contrived to provide remunerative employment even in the least prosperous times . Sir Robert Peel readily appreciated the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we may allude to his adoption of the process for producing what is called RESIST WORK in calico printing . This is accomplished by the use of a paste , or resist , on such parts of the cloth as were intended to remain white . The person who discovered the paste was a traveller for a London house , who sold it to Mr. Peel for an inconsiderable sum . It required the experience of a year or two to perfect the system and make it practically useful ; but the beauty of its effect , and the extreme precision of outline in the pattern produced , at once placed the Bury establishment at the head of all the factories for calico printing in the country . Other firms , conducted with like spirit , were established by members of the same family at Burnley , Foxhill bank , and Altham , in Lancashire ; Salley Abbey , in Yorkshire ; and afterwards at Burton-on-Trent , in Staffordshire ; these various establishments , whilst they brought wealth to their proprietors , setting an example to the whole cotton trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manufacturers in Lancashire . Among other distinguished founders of industry , the Rev. William Lee , inventor of the Stocking Frame , and John Heathcoat , inventor of the Bobbin-net Machine , are worthy of notice , as men of great mechanical skill and perseverance , through whose labours a vast amount of remunerative employment has been provided for the labouring population of Nottingham and the adjacent districts . The accounts which have been preserved of the circumstances connected with the invention of the Stocking Frame are very confused , and in many respects contradictory , though there is no doubt as to the name of the inventor . This was William Lee , born at Woodborough , a village some seven miles from Nottingham , about the year 1563 . According to some accounts , he was the heir to a small freehold , while according to others he was a poor scholar , 6 and had to struggle with poverty from his earliest years . He entered as a sizar at Christ College , Cambridge , in May , 1579 , and subsequently removed to St. John 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is believed that he commenced M.A. in 1586 ; but on this point there appears to be some confusion in the records of the University . The statement usually made that he was expelled for marrying contrary to the statutes , is incorrect , as he was never a Fellow of the University , and therefore could not be prejudiced by taking such a step . At the time when Lee invented the Stocking Frame he was officiating as curate of Calverton , near Nottingham ; and it is alleged by some writers that the invention had its origin in disappointed affection . The curate is said to have fallen deeply in love with a young lady of the village , who failed to reciprocate his affections ; and when he visited her , she was accustomed to pay much more attention to the process of knitting stockings and instructing her pupils in the art , than to the addresses of her admirer . This slight is said to have created in his mind such an aversion to knitting by hand , that he formed the determination to invent a machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For three years he devoted himself to the prosecution of the invention , sacrificing everything to his new idea . At the prospect of success opened before him , he abandoned his curacy , and devoted himself to the art of stocking making by machinery . This is the version of the story given by Henson 7 on the authority of an old stocking-maker , who died in Collins 's Hospital , Nottingham , aged ninety-two , and was apprenticed in the town during the reign of Queen Anne . It is also given by Deering and Blackner as the traditional account in the neighbourhood , and it is in some measure borne out by the arms of the London Company of Frame-Work Knitters , which consists of a stocking frame without the wood-work , with a clergyman on one side and a woman on the other as supporters . 8 Whatever may have been the actual facts as to the origin of the invention of the Stocking Loom , there can be no doubt as to the extraordinary mechanical genius displayed by its inventor . That a clergyman living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part been spent with books , should contrive a machine of such delicate and complicated movements , and at once advance the art of knitting from the tedious process of linking threads in a chain of loops by three skewers in the fingers of a woman , to the beautiful and rapid process of weaving by the stocking frame , was indeed an astonishing achievement , which may be pronounced almost unequalled in the history of mechanical invention . Lee 's merit was all the greater , as the handicraft arts were then in their infancy , and little attention had as yet been given to the contrivance of machinery for the purposes of manufacture . He was under the necessity of extemporising the parts of his machine as he best could , and adopting various expedients to overcome difficulties as they arose . His tools were imperfect , and his materials imperfect ; and he had no skilled workmen to assist him . According to tradition , the first frame he made was a twelve gauge , without lead sinkers , and it was almost wholly of wood ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of Lee 's principal difficulties consisted in the formation of the stitch , for want of needle eyes ; but this he eventually overcame by forming eyes to the needles with a three-square file . 9 At length , one difficulty after another was successfully overcome , and after three years ' labour the machine was sufficiently complete to be fit for use . The quondam curate , full of enthusiasm for his art , now began stocking weaving in the village of Calverton , and he continued to work there for several years , instructing his brother James and several of his relations in the practice of the art . Having brought his frame to a considerable degree of perfection , and being desirous of securing the patronage of Queen Elizabeth , whose partiality for knitted silk stockings was well known , Lee proceeded to London to exhibit the loom before her Majesty . He first showed it to several members of the court , among others to Sir William ( afterwards Lord ) Hunsdon , whom he taught to work it with success ; and Lee was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Queen , and worked the machine in her presence . Elizabeth , however , did not give him the encouragement that he had expected ; and she is said to have opposed the invention on the ground that it was calculated to deprive a large number of poor people of their employment of hand knitting . Lee was no more successful in finding other patrons , and considering himself and his invention treated with contempt , he embraced the offer made to him by Sully , the sagacious minister of Henry IV. , to proceed to Rouen and instruct the operatives of that town  --  then one of the most important manufacturing centres of France  --  in the construction and use of the stocking-frame . Lee accordingly transferred himself and his machines to France , in 1605 , taking with him his brother and seven workmen . He met with a cordial reception at Rouen , and was proceeding with the manufacture of stockings on a large scale  --  having nine of his frames in full work ,  --  when unhappily ill fortune again overtook him . Henry IV. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rewards , honours , and promised grant of privileges , which had induced Lee to settle in France , was murdered by the fanatic Ravaillac ; and the encouragement and protection which had heretofore been extended to him were at once withdrawn . To press his claims at court , Lee proceeded to Paris ; but being a protestant as well as a foreigner , his representations were treated with neglect ; and worn out with vexation and grief , this distinguished inventor shortly after died at Paris , in a state of extreme poverty and distress . Lee 's brother , with seven of the workmen , succeeded in escaping from France with their frames , leaving two behind . On James Lee 's return to Nottinghamshire , he was joined by one Ashton , a miller of Thoroton , who had been instructed in the art of frame-work knitting by the inventor himself before he left England . These two , with the workmen and their frames , began the stocking manufacture at Thoroton , and carried it on with considerable success . The place was favourably situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbouring district of Sherwood yielded a kind of wool of the longest staple . Ashton is said to have introduced the method of making the frames with lead sinkers , which was a great improvement . The number of looms employed in different parts of England gradually increased ; and the machine manufacture of stockings eventually became an important branch of the national industry . One of the most important modifications in the Stocking-Frame was that which enabled it to be applied to the manufacture of lace on a large scale . In 1777 , two workmen , Frost and Holmes , were both engaged in making point-net by means of the modifications they had introduced in the stocking-frame ; and in the course of about thirty years , so rapid was the growth of this branch of production that 1500 point-net frames were at work , giving employment to upwards of 15,000 people . Owing , however , to the war , to change of fashion , and to other circumstances , the Nottingham lace manufacture rapidly fell off ; and it continued in a decaying state until the invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . for Tiverton , which had the effect of at once re-establishing the manufacture on solid foundations . John Heathcoat was the youngest son of a respectable small farmer at Duffield , Derbyshire , where he was born in 1783 . When at school he made steady and rapid progress , but was early removed from it to be apprenticed to a frame-smith near Loughborough . The boy soon learnt to handle tools with dexterity , and he acquired a minute knowledge of the parts of which the stocking-frame was composed , as well as of the more intricate warp-machine . At his leisure he studied how to introduce improvements in them , and his friend , Mr. Bazley , M.P. , states that as early as the age of sixteen , he conceived the idea of inventing a machine by which lace might be made similar to Buckingham or French lace , then all made by hand . The first practical improvement he succeeded in introducing was in the warp-frame , when , by means of an ingenious apparatus , he succeeded in producing " mitts " of a lacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pursue the study of mechanical lace-making . The stocking-frame had already , in a modified form , been applied to the manufacture of point-net lace , in which the mesh was LOOPED as in a stocking , but the work was slight and frail , and therefore unsatisfactory . Many ingenious Nottingham mechanics had , during a long succession of years , been labouring at the problem of inventing a machine by which the mesh of threads should be TWISTED round each other on the formation of the net . Some of these men died in poverty , some were driven insane , and all alike failed in the object of their search . The old warp-machine held its ground . When a little over twenty-one years of age , Heathcoat went to Nottingham , where he readily found employment , for which he soon received the highest remuneration , as a setter-up of hosiery and warp-frames , and was much respected for his talent for invention , general intelligence , and the sound and sober principles that governed his conduct . He also continued to pursue the subject on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compass the contrivance of a twist traverse-net machine . He first studied the art of making the Buckingham or pillow-lace by hand , with the object of effecting the same motions by mechanical means . It was a long and laborious task , requiring the exercise of great perseverance and ingenuity . His master , Elliot , described him at that time as inventive , patient , self-denying , and taciturn , undaunted by failures and mistakes , full of resources and expedients , and entertaining the most perfect confidence that his application of mechanical principles would eventually be crowned with success . It is difficult to describe in words an invention so complicated as the bobbin-net machine . It was , indeed , a mechanical pillow for making lace , imitating in an ingenious manner the motions of the lace-maker 's fingers in intersecting or tying the meshes of the lace upon her pillow . On analysing the component parts of a piece of hand-made lace , Heathcoat was enabled to classify the threads into longitudinal and diagonal . He began his experiments by fixing common pack-threads lengthwise on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing the weft threads between them by common plyers , delivering them to other plyers on the opposite side ; then , after giving them a sideways motion and twist , the threads were repassed back between the next adjoining cords , the meshes being thus tied in the same way as upon pillows by hand . He had then to contrive a mechanism that should accomplish all these nice and delicate movements , and to do this cost him no small amount of mental toil . Long after he said , " The single difficulty of getting the diagonal threads to twist in the allotted space was so great that if it had now to be done , I should probably not attempt its accomplishment . " His next step was to provide thin metallic discs , to be used as bobbins for conducting the threads backwards and forwards through the warp . These discs , being arranged in carrier-frames placed on each side of the warp , were moved by suitable machinery so as to conduct the threads from side to side in forming the lace . He eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success ; and , at the age of twenty-four , he was enabled to secure his invention by a patent . During this time his wife was kept in almost as great anxiety as himself , for she well knew of his trials and difficulties while he was striving to perfect his invention . Many years after they had been successfully overcome , the conversation which took place one eventful evening was vividly remembered . " Well , " said the anxious wife , " will it work ? " " No , " was the sad answer ; " I have had to take it all to pieces again . " Though he could still speak hopefully and cheerfully , his poor wife could restrain her feelings no longer , but sat down and cried bitterly . She had , however , only a few more weeks to wait , for success long laboured for and richly deserved , came at last , and a proud and happy man was John Heathcoat when he brought home the first narrow strip of bobbin-net made by his machine , and placed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of nearly all inventions which have proved productive , Heathcoat 's rights as a patentee were disputed , and his claims as an inventor called in question . On the supposed invalidity of the patent , the lace-makers boldly adopted the bobbin-net machine , and set the inventor at defiance . But other patents were taken out for alleged improvements and adaptations ; and it was only when these new patentees fell out and went to law with each other that Heathcoat 's rights became established . One lace-manufacturer having brought an action against another for an alleged infringement of his patent , the jury brought in a verdict for the defendant , in which the judge concurred , on the ground that BOTH the machines in question were infringements of Heathcoat 's patent . It was on the occasion of this trial , " Boville v. Moore , " that Sir John Copley ( afterwards Lord Lyndhurst ) , who was retained for the defence in the interest of Mr. Heathcoat , learnt to work the bobbin-net machine in order that he might master the details of the invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not quite understand the merits of the case ; but as it seemed to him to be one of great importance , he offered to go down into the country forthwith and study the machine until he understood it ; " and then , " said he , " I will defend you to the best of my ability . " He accordingly put himself into that night 's mail , and went down to Nottingham to get up his case as perhaps counsel never got it up before . Next morning the learned sergeant placed himself in a lace-loom , and he did not leave it until he could deftly make a piece of bobbin-net with his own hands , and thoroughly understood the principle as well as the details of the machine . When the case came on for trial , the learned sergeant was enabled to work the model on the table with such case and skill , and to explain the precise nature of the invention with such felicitous clearness , as to astonish alike judge , jury , and spectators ; and the thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt its influence upon the decision of the court . After the trial was over , Mr. Heathcoat , on inquiry , found about six hundred machines at work after his patent , and he proceeded to levy royalty upon the owners of them , which amounted to a large sum . But the profits realised by the manufacturers of lace were very great , and the use of the machines rapidly extended ; while the price of the article was reduced from five pounds the square yard to about five pence in the course of twenty-five years . During the same period the average annual returns of the lace-trade have been at least four millions sterling , and it gives remunerative employment to about 150,000 workpeople . To return to the personal history of Mr. Heathcoat . In 1809 we find him established as a lace-manufacturer at Loughborough , in Leicestershire . There he carried on a prosperous business for several years , giving employment to a large number of operatives , at wages varying from 5l. to 10l. a week . Notwithstanding the great increase in the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new machines , it began to be whispered about among the workpeople that they were superseding labour , and an extensive conspiracy was formed for the purpose of destroying them wherever found . As early as the year 1811 disputes arose between the masters and men engaged in the stocking and lace trades in the south-western parts of Nottinghamshire and the adjacent parts of Derbyshire and Leicestershire , the result of which was the assembly of a mob at Sutton , in Ashfield , who proceeded in open day to break the stocking and lace-frames of the manufacturers . Some of the ringleaders having been seized and punished , the disaffected learnt caution ; but the destruction of the machines was nevertheless carried on secretly wherever a safe opportunity presented itself . As the machines were of so delicate a construction that a single blow of a hammer rendered them useless , and as the manufacture was carried on for the most part in detached buildings , often in private dwellings remote from towns , the opportunities of destroying them were unusually easy . In the neighbourhood of Nottingham , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regular bodies , and held nocturnal meetings at which their plans were arranged . Probably with the view of inspiring confidence , they gave out that they were under the command of a leader named Ned Ludd , or General Ludd , and hence their designation of Luddites . Under this organization machine-breaking was carried on with great vigour during the winter of 1811 , occasioning great distress , and throwing large numbers of workpeople out of employment . Meanwhile , the owners of the frames proceeded to remove them from the villages and lone dwellings in the country , and brought them into warehouses in the towns for their better protection . The Luddites seem to have been encouraged by the lenity of the sentences pronounced on such of their confederates as had been apprehended and tried ; and , shortly after , the mania broke out afresh , and rapidly extended over the northern and midland manufacturing districts . The organization became more secret ; an oath was administered to the members binding them to obedience to the orders issued by the heads of the confederacy ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All machines were doomed by them to destruction , whether employed in the manufacture of cloth , calico , or lace ; and a reign of terror began which lasted for years . In Yorkshire and Lancashire mills were boldly attacked by armed rioters , and in many cases they were wrecked or burnt ; so that it became necessary to guard them by soldiers and yeomanry . The masters themselves were doomed to death ; many of them were assaulted , and some were murdered . At length the law was vigorously set in motion ; numbers of the misguided Luddites were apprehended ; some were executed ; and after several years ' violent commotion from this cause , the machine-breaking riots were at length quelled . Among the numerous manufacturers whose works were attacked by the Luddites , was the inventor of the bobbin-net machine himself . One bright sunny day , in the summer of 1816 , a body of rioters entered his factory at Loughborough with torches , and set fire to it , destroying thirty-seven lace-machines , and above 10,000l. worth of property . Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight of them were executed . Mr. Heathcoat made a claim upon the county for compensation , and it was resisted ; but the Court of Queen 's Bench decided in his favour , and decreed that the county must make good his loss of 10,000l . The magistrates sought to couple with the payment of the damage the condition that Mr. Heathcoat should expend the money in the county of Leicester ; but to this he would not assent , having already resolved on removing his manufacture elsewhere . At Tiverton , in Devonshire , he found a large building which had been formerly used as a woollen manufactory ; but the Tiverton cloth trade having fallen into decay , the building remained unoccupied , and the town itself was generally in a very poverty-stricken condition . Mr. Heathcoat bought the old mill , renovated and enlarged it , and there recommenced the manufacture of lace upon a larger scale than before ; keeping in full work as many as three hundred machines , and employing a large number of artisans at good wages . Not only did he carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business connected with it  --  yarn-doubling , silk-spinning , net-making , and finishing . He also established at Tiverton an iron-foundry and works for the manufacture of agricultural implements , which proved of great convenience to the district . It was a favourite idea of his that steam power was capable of being applied to perform all the heavy drudgery of life , and he laboured for a long time at the invention of a steam-plough . In 1832 he so far completed his invention as to be enabled to take out a patent for it ; and Heathcoat 's steam-plough , though it has since been superseded by Fowler 's , was considered the best machine of the kind that had up to that time been invented . Mr. Heathcoat was a man of great natural gifts . He possessed a sound understanding , quick perception , and a genius for business of the highest order . With these he combined uprightness , honesty , and integrity  --  qualities which are the true glory of human character . Himself a diligent self-educator , he gave ready encouragement to deserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their energies . During his own busy life , he contrived to save time to master French and Italian , of which he acquired an accurate and grammatical knowledge . His mind was largely stored with the results of a careful study of the best literature , and there were few subjects on which he had not formed for himself shrewd and accurate views . The two thousand workpeople in his employment regarded him almost as a father , and he carefully provided for their comfort and improvement . Prosperity did not spoil him , as it does so many ; nor close his heart against the claims of the poor and struggling , who were always sure of his sympathy and help . To provide for the education of the children of his workpeople , he built schools for them at a cost of about 6000l . He was also a man of singularly cheerful and buoyant disposition , a favourite with men of all classes and most admired and beloved by those who knew him best . In 1831 the electors of Tiverton , of which town Mr. Heathcoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to represent them in Parliament , and he continued their member for nearly thirty years . During a great part of that time he had Lord Palmerston for his colleague , and the noble lord , on more than one public occasion , expressed the high regard which he entertained for his venerable friend . On retiring from the representation in 1859 , owing to advancing age and increasing infirmities , thirteen hundred of his workmen presented him with a silver inkstand and gold pen , in token of their esteem . He enjoyed his leisure for only two more years , dying in January , 1861 , at the age of seventy-seven , and leaving behind him a character for probity , virtue , manliness , and mechanical genius , of which his descendants may well be proud . We next turn to a career of a very different kind , that of the illustrious but unfortunate Jacquard , whose life also illustrates in a remarkable manner the influence which ingenious men , even of the humblest rank , may exercise upon the industry of a nation . Jacquard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father being a weaver , and his mother a pattern reader . They were too poor to give him any but the most meagre education . When he was of age to learn a trade , his father placed him with a book-binder . An old clerk , who made up the master 's accounts , gave Jacquard some lessons in mathematics . He very shortly began to display a remarkable turn for mechanics , and some of his contrivances quite astonished the old clerk , who advised Jacquard 's father to put him to some other trade , in which his peculiar abilities might have better scope than in bookbinding . He was accordingly put apprentice to a cutler ; but was so badly treated by his master , that he shortly afterwards left his employment , on which he was placed with a type-founder . His parents dying , Jacquard found himself in a measure compelled to take to his father 's two looms , and carry on the trade of a weaver . He immediately proceeded to improve the looms , and became so engrossed with his inventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself at the end of his means . He then sold the looms to pay his debts , at the same time that he took upon himself the burden of supporting a wife . He became still poorer , and to satisfy his creditors , he next sold his cottage . He tried to find employment , but in vain , people believing him to be an idler , occupied with mere dreams about his inventions . At length he obtained employment with a line-maker of Bresse , whither he went , his wife remaining at Lyons , earning a precarious living by making straw bonnets . We hear nothing further of Jacquard for some years , but in the interval he seems to have prosecuted his improvement in the drawloom for the better manufacture of figured fabrics ; for , in 1790 , he brought out his contrivance for selecting the warp threads , which , when added to the loom , superseded the services of a draw-boy . The adoption of this machine was slow but steady , and in ten years after its introduction , 4000 of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rudely interrupted by the Revolution , and , in 1792 , we find him fighting in the ranks of the Lyonnaise Volunteers against the Army of the Convention under the command of Dubois Crance . The city was taken ; Jacquard fled and joined the Army of the Rhine , where he rose to the rank of sergeant . He might have remained a soldier , but that , his only son having been shot dead at his side , he deserted and returned to Lyons to recover his wife . He found her in a garret still employed at her old trade of straw-bonnet making . While living in concealment with her , his mind reverted to the inventions over which he had so long brooded in former years ; but he had no means wherewith to prosecute them . Jacquard found it necessary , however , to emerge from his hiding-place and try to find some employment . He succeeded in obtaining it with an intelligent manufacturer , and while working by day he went on inventing by night . It had occurred to him that great improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he incidentally mentioned the subject one day to his master , regretting at the same time that his limited means prevented him from carrying out his ideas . Happily his master appreciated the value of the suggestions , and with laudable generosity placed a sum of money at his disposal , that he might prosecute the proposed improvements at his leisure . In three months Jacquard had invented a loom to substitute mechanical action for the irksome and toilsome labour of the workman . The loom was exhibited at the Exposition of National Industry at Paris in 1801 , and obtained a bronze medal . Jacquard was further honoured by a visit at Lyons from the Minister Carnot , who desired to congratulate him in person on the success of his invention . In the following year the Society of Arts in London offered a prize for the invention of a machine for manufacturing fishing-nets and boarding-netting for ships . Jacquard heard of this , and while walking one day in the fields according to his custom , he turned the subject over in his mind , and contrived the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the manufacturer , again furnished him with the means of carrying out his idea , and in three weeks Jacquard had completed his invention . Jacquard 's achievement having come to the knowledge of the Prefect of the Department , he was summoned before that functionary , and , on his explanation of the working of the machine , a report on the subject was forwarded to the Emperor . The inventor was forthwith summoned to Paris with his machine , and brought into the presence of the Emperor , who received him with the consideration due to his genius . The interview lasted two hours , during which Jacquard , placed at his ease by the Emperor 's affability , explained to him the improvements which he proposed to make in the looms for weaving figured goods . The result was , that he was provided with apartments in the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers , where he had the use of the workshop during his stay , and was provided with a suitable allowance for his maintenance . Installed in the Conservatoire , Jacquard proceeded to complete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of minutely inspecting the various exquisite pieces of mechanism contained in that great treasury of human ingenuity . Among the machines which more particularly attracted his attention , and eventually set him upon the track of his discovery , was a loom for weaving flowered silk , made by Vaucanson the celebrated automaton-maker . Vaucanson was a man of the highest order of constructive genius . The inventive faculty was so strong in him that it may almost be said to have amounted to a passion , and could not be restrained . The saying that the poet is born , not made , applies with equal force to the inventor , who , though indebted , like the other , to culture and improved opportunities , nevertheless contrives and constructs new combinations of machinery mainly to gratify his own instinct . This was peculiarly the case with Vaucanson ; for his most elaborate works were not so much distinguished for their utility as for the curious ingenuity which they displayed . While a mere boy attending Sunday conversations with his mother , he amused himself by watching , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a clock in the adjoining apartment . He endeavoured to understand them , and by brooding over the subject , after several months he discovered the principle of the escapement . From that time the subject of mechanical invention took complete possession of him . With some rude tools which he contrived , he made a wooden clock that marked the hours with remarkable exactness ; while he made for a miniature chapel the figures of some angels which waved their wings , and some priests that made several ecclesiastical movements . With the view of executing some other automata he had designed , he proceeded to study anatomy , music , and mechanics , which occupied him for several years . The sight of the Flute-player in the Gardens of the Tuileries inspired him with the resolution to invent a similar figure that should PLAY ; and after several years ' study and labour , though struggling with illness , he succeeded in accomplishing his object . He next produced a Flageolet-player , which was succeeded by a Duck  --  the most ingenious of his contrivances ,  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real duck . He next invented an asp , employed in the tragedy of ' Cleopatre , ' which hissed and darted at the bosom of the actress . Vaucanson , however , did not confine himself merely to the making of automata . By reason of his ingenuity , Cardinal de Fleury appointed him inspector of the silk manufactories of France ; and he was no sooner in office , than with his usual irrepressible instinct to invent , he proceeded to introduce improvements in silk machinery . One of these was his mill for thrown silk , which so excited the anger of the Lyons operatives , who feared the loss of employment through its means , that they pelted him with stones and had nearly killed him . He nevertheless went on inventing , and next produced a machine for weaving flowered silks , with a contrivance for giving a dressing to the thread , so as to render that of each bobbin or skein of an equal thickness . When Vaucanson died in 1782 , after a long illness , he bequeathed his collection of machines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value on them , and they were shortly after dispersed . But his machine for weaving flowered silks was happily preserved in the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers , and there Jacquard found it among the many curious and interesting articles in the collection . It proved of the utmost value to him , for it immediately set him on the track of the principal modification which he introduced in his improved loom . One of the chief features of Vaucanson 's machine was a pierced cylinder which , according to the holes it presented when revolved , regulated the movement of certain needles , and caused the threads of the warp to deviate in such a manner as to produce a given design , though only of a simple character . Jacquard seized upon the suggestion with avidity , and , with the genius of the true inventor , at once proceeded to improve upon it . At the end of a month his weaving-machine was completed . To the cylinder of Vancanson , he added an endless piece of pasteboard pierced with a number of holes , through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while another piece of mechanism indicated to the workman the colour of the shuttle which he ought to throw . Thus the drawboy and the reader of designs were both at once superseded . The first use Jacquard made of his new loom was to weave with it several yards of rich stuff which he presented to the Empress Josephine . Napoleon was highly gratified with the result of the inventor 's labours , and ordered a number of the looms to be constructed by the best workmen , after Jacquard 's model , and presented to him ; after which he returned to Lyons . There he experienced the frequent fate of inventors . He was regarded by his townsmen as an enemy , and treated by them as Kay , Hargreaves , and Arkwright had been in Lancashire . The workmen looked upon the new loom as fatal to their trade , and feared lest it should at once take the bread from their mouths . A tumultuous meeting was held on the Place des Terreaux , when it was determined to destroy the machines . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hanged in effigy . The ' Conseil des prud'hommes ' in vain endeavoured to allay the excitement , and they were themselves denounced . At length , carried away by the popular impulse , the prud'hommes , most of whom had been workmen and sympathized with the class , had one of Jacquard 's looms carried off and publicly broken in pieces . Riots followed , in one of which Jacquard was dragged along the quay by an infuriated mob intending to drown him , but he was rescued . The great value of the Jacquard loom , however , could not be denied , and its success was only a question of time . Jacquard was urged by some English silk manufacturers to pass over into England and settle there . But notwithstanding the harsh and cruel treatment he had received at the hands of his townspeople , his patriotism was too strong to permit him to accept their offer . The English manufacturers , however , adopted his loom . Then it was , and only then , that Lyons , threatened to be beaten out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jacquard machine was employed in nearly all kinds of weaving . The result proved that the fears of the workpeople had been entirely unfounded . Instead of diminishing employment , the Jacquard loom increased it at least tenfold . The number of persons occupied in the manufacture of figured goods in Lyons , was stated by M. Leon Faucher to have been 60,000 in 1833 ; and that number has since been considerably increased . As for Jacquard himself , the rest of his life passed peacefully , excepting that the workpeople who dragged him along the quay to drown him were shortly after found eager to bear him in triumph along the same route in celebration of his birthday . But his modesty would not permit him to take part in such a demonstration . The Municipal Council of Lyons proposed to him that he should devote himself to improving his machine for the benefit of the local industry , to which Jacquard agreed in consideration of a moderate pension , the amount of which was fixed by himself . After perfecting his invention accordingly , he retired at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's native place . It was there that he received , in 1820 , the decoration of the Legion of Honour ; and it was there that he died and was buried in 1834 . A statue was erected to his memory , but his relatives remained in poverty ; and twenty years after his death , his two nieces were under the necessity of selling for a few hundred francs the gold medal bestowed upon their uncle by Louis XVIII . " Such , " says a French writer , " was the gratitude of the manufacturing interests of Lyons to the man to whom it owes so large a portion of its splendour . " It would be easy to extend the martyrology of inventors , and to cite the names of other equally distinguished men who have , without any corresponding advantage to themselves , contributed to the industrial progress of the age ,  --  for it has too often happened that genius has planted the tree , of which patient dulness has gathered the fruit ; but we will confine ourselves for the present to a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of illustration of the difficulties and privations which it is so frequently the lot of mechanical genius to surmount . We allude to Joshua Heilmann , the inventor of the Combing Machine . Heilmann was born in 1796 at Mulhouse , the principal seat of the Alsace cotton manufacture . His father was engaged in that business ; and Joshua entered his office at fifteen . He remained there for two years , employing his spare time in mechanical drawing . He afterwards spent two years in his uncle 's banking-house in Paris , prosecuting the study of mathematics in the evenings . Some of his relatives having established a small cotton-spinning factory at Mulhouse , young Heilmann was placed with Messrs . Tissot and Rey , at Paris , to learn the practice of that firm . At the same time he became a student at the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers , where he attended the lectures , and studied the machines in the museum . He also took practical lessons in turning from a toymaker . After some time , thus diligently occupied , he returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new factory at Vieux-Thann , which was shortly finished and set to work . The operations of the manufactory were , however , seriously affected by a commercial crisis which occurred , and it passed into other hands , on which Heilmann returned to his family at Mulhouse . He had in the mean time been occupying much of his leisure with inventions , more particularly in connection with the weaving of cotton and the preparation of the staple for spinning . One of his earliest contrivances was an embroidering-machine , in which twenty needles were employed , working simultaneously ; and he succeeded in accomplishing his object after about six months ' labour . For this invention , which he exhibited at the Exposition of 1834 , he received a gold medal , and was decorated with the Legion of Honour . Other inventions quickly followed  --  an improved loom , a machine for measuring and folding fabrics , an improvement of the " bobbin and fly frames " of the English spinners , and a weft winding-machine , with various improvements in the machinery for preparing , spinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most ingenious contrivances was his loom for weaving simultaneously two pieces of velvet or other piled fabric , united by the pile common to both , with a knife and traversing apparatus for separating the two fabrics when woven . But by far the most beautiful and ingenious of his inventions was the combing-machine , the history of which we now proceed shortly to describe . Heilmann had for some years been diligently studying the contrivance of a machine for combing long-stapled cotton , the ordinary carding-machine being found ineffective in preparing the raw material for spinning , especially the finer sorts of yarn , besides causing considerable waste . To avoid these imperfections , the cotton-spinners of Alsace offered a prize of 5000 francs for an improved combing-machine , and Heilmann immediately proceeded to compete for the reward . He was not stimulated by the desire of gain , for he was comparatively rich , having acquired a considerable fortune by his wife . It was a saying of his that " one will never accomplish great things who is constantly asking himself , how much gain will this bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct of the inventor , who no sooner has a mechanical problem set before him than he feels impelled to undertake its solution . The problem in this case was , however , much more difficult than he had anticipated . The close study of the subject occupied him for several years , and the expenses in which he became involved in connection with it were so great , that his wife 's fortune was shortly swallowed up , and he was reduced to poverty , without being able to bring his machine to perfection . From that time he was under the necessity of relying mainly on the help of his friends to enable him to prosecute the invention . While still struggling with poverty and difficulties , Heilmann 's wife died , believing her husband ruined ; and shortly after he proceeded to England and settled for a time at Manchester , still labouring at his machine . He had a model made for him by the eminent machine-makers , Sharpe , Roberts , and Company ; but still he could not make it work satisfactorily , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He returned to France to visit his family , still pursuing his idea , which had obtained complete possession of his mind . While sitting by his hearth one evening , meditating upon the hard fate of inventors and the misfortunes in which their families so often become involved , he found himself almost unconsciously watching his daughters coming their long hair and drawing it out at full length between their fingers . The thought suddenly struck him that if he could successfully imitate in a machine the process of combing out the longest hair and forcing back the short by reversing the action of the comb , it might serve to extricate him from his difficulty . It may be remembered that this incident in the life of Heilmann has been made the subject of a beautiful picture by Mr. Elmore , R.A. , which was exhibited at the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1862 . Upon this idea he proceeded , introduced the apparently simple but really most intricate process of machine-combing , and after great labour he succeeded in perfecting the invention . The singular beauty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine at work , when the similarity of its movements to that of combing the hair , which suggested the invention , is at once apparent . The machine has been described as " acting with almost the delicacy of touch of the human fingers . " It combs the lock of cotton AT BOTH ENDS , places the fibres exactly parallel with each other , separates the long from the short , and unites the long fibres in one sliver and the short ones in another . In fine , the machine not only acts with the delicate accuracy of the human fingers , but apparently with the delicate intelligence of the human mind . The chief commercial value of the invention consisted in its rendering the commoner sorts of cotton available for fine spinning . The manufacturers were thereby enabled to select the most suitable fibres for high-priced fabrics , and to produce the finer sorts of yarn in much larger quantities . It became possible by its means to make thread so fine that a length of 334 miles might be spun from a single pound weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finer sorts of lace , the original shilling 's worth of cotton-wool , before it passed into the hands of the consumer , might thus be increased to the value of between 300l. and 400l. sterling . The beauty and utility of Heilmann 's invention were at once appreciated by the English cotton-spinners . Six Lancashire firms united and purchased the patent for cotton-spinning for England for the sum of 30,000l ; the wool-spinners paid the same sum for the privilege of applying the process to wool ; and the Messrs . Marshall , of Leeds , 20,000l. for the privilege of applying it to flax . Thus wealth suddenly flowed in upon poor Heilmann at last . But he did not live to enjoy it . Scarcely had his long labours been crowned by success than he died , and his son , who had shared in his privations , shortly followed him . It is at the price of lives such as these that the wonders of civilisation are achieved . CHAPTER III  --  THE GREAT POTTERS  --  PALISSY , BOTTGHER , WEDGWOOD " Patience is the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Patience lies at the root of all pleasures , as well as of all powers . Hope herself ceases to be happiness when Impatience companions her . "  --  John Ruskin . " Il y a vingt et cinq ans passez qu'il ne me fut monstre une coupe de terre , tournee et esmaillee d'une telle beaute que . . . deslors , sans avoir esgard que je n'avois nulle connoissance des terres argileuses , je me mis a chercher les emaux , comme un homme qui taste en tenebres. "  --  Bernard Palissy . It so happens that the history of Pottery furnishes some of the most remarkable instances of patient perseverance to be found in the whole range of biography . Of these we select three of the most striking , as exhibited in the lives of Bernard Palissy , the Frenchman ; Johann Friedrich Bottgher , the German ; and Josiah Wedgwood , the Englishman . Though the art of making common vessels of clay was known to most of the ancient nations , that of manufacturing enamelled earthenware was much less common . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimens of whose ware are still to be found in antiquarian collections . But it became a lost art , and was only recovered at a comparatively recent date . The Etruscan ware was very valuable in ancient times , a vase being worth its weight in gold in the time of Augustus . The Moors seem to have preserved amongst them a knowledge of the art , which they were found practising in the island of Majorca when it was taken by the Pisans in 1115 . Among the spoil carried away were many plates of Moorish earthenware , which , in token of triumph , were embedded in the walls of several of the ancient churches of Pisa , where they are to be seen to this day . About two centuries later the Italians began to make an imitation enamelled ware , which they named Majolica , after the Moorish place of manufacture . The reviver or re-discoverer of the art of enamelling in Italy was Luca della Robbia , a Florentine sculptor . Vasari describes him as a man of indefatigable perseverance , working with his chisel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . He pursued the latter art with so much assiduity , that when working late , to prevent his feet from freezing with the cold , he was accustomed to provide himself with a basket of shavings , in which he placed them to keep himself warm and enable him to proceed with his drawings . " Nor , " says Vasari , " am I in the least astonished at this , since no man ever becomes distinguished in any art whatsoever who does not early begin to acquire the power of supporting heat , cold , hunger , thirst , and other discomforts ; whereas those persons deceive themselves altogether who suppose that when taking their ease and surrounded by all the enjoyments of the world they may still attain to honourable distinction ,  --  for it is not by sleeping , but by waking , watching , and labouring continually , that proficiency is attained and reputation acquired . " But Luca , notwithstanding all his application and industry , did not succeed in earning enough money by sculpture to enable him to live by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might nevertheless be able to pursue his modelling in some material more facile and less dear than marble . Hence it was that he began to make his models in clay , and to endeavour by experiment so to coat and bake the clay as to render those models durable . After many trials he at length discovered a method of covering the clay with a material , which , when exposed to the intense heat of a furnace , became converted into an almost imperishable enamel . He afterwards made the further discovery of a method of imparting colour to the enamel , thus greatly adding to its beauty . The fame of Luca 's work extended throughout Europe , and specimens of his art became widely diffused . Many of them were sent into France and Spain , where they were greatly prized . At that time coarse brown jars and pipkins were almost the only articles of earthenware produced in France ; and this continued to be the case , with comparatively small improvement , until the time of Palissy  --  a man who toiled and fought against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of romance over the events of his chequered life . Bernard Palissy is supposed to have been born in the south of France , in the diocese of Agen , about the year 1510 . His father was probably a worker in glass , to which trade Bernard was brought up . His parents were poor people  --  too poor to give him the benefit of any school education . " I had no other books , " said he afterwards , " than heaven and earth , which are open to all . " He learnt , however , the art of glass-painting , to which he added that of drawing , and afterwards reading and writing . When about eighteen years old , the glass trade becoming decayed , Palissy left his father 's house , with his wallet on his back , and went out into the world to search whether there was any place in it for him . He first travelled towards Gascony , working at his trade where he could find employment , and occasionally occupying part of his time in land-measuring . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , Flanders , and Lower Germany . Thus Palissy occupied about ten more years of his life , after which he married , and ceased from his wanderings , settling down to practise glass-painting and land-measuring at the small town of Saintes , in the Lower Charente . There children were born to him ; and not only his responsibilities but his expenses increased , while , do what he could , his earnings remained too small for his needs . It was therefore necessary for him to bestir himself . Probably he felt capable of better things than drudging in an employment so precarious as glass-painting ; and hence he was induced to turn his attention to the kindred art of painting and enamelling earthenware . Yet on this subject he was wholly ignorant ; for he had never seen earth baked before he began his operations . He had therefore everything to learn by himself , without any helper . But he was full of hope , eager to learn , of unbounded perseverance and inexhaustible patience . It was the sight of an elegant cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's make  --  which first set Palissy a-thinking about the new art . A circumstance so apparently insignificant would have produced no effect upon an ordinary mind , or even upon Palissy himself at an ordinary time ; but occurring as it did when he was meditating a change of calling , he at once became inflamed with the desire of imitating it . The sight of this cup disturbed his whole existence ; and the determination to discover the enamel with which it was glazed thenceforward possessed him like a passion . Had he been a single man he might have travelled into Italy in search of the secret ; but he was bound to his wife and his children , and could not leave them ; so he remained by their side groping in the dark in the hope of finding out the process of making and enamelling earthenware . At first he could merely guess the materials of which the enamel was composed ; and he proceeded to try all manner of experiments to ascertain what they really were . He pounded all the substances which he supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthen pots , broke them into pieces , and , spreading his compounds over them , subjected them to the heat of a furnace which he erected for the purpose of baking them . His experiments failed ; and the results were broken pots and a waste of fuel , drugs , time , and labour . Women do not readily sympathise with experiments whose only tangible effect is to dissipate the means of buying clothes and food for their children ; and Palissy 's wife , however dutiful in other respects , could not be reconciled to the purchase of more earthen pots , which seemed to her to be bought only to be broken . Yet she must needs submit ; for Palissy had become thoroughly possessed by the determination to master the secret of the enamel , and would not leave it alone . For many successive months and years Palissy pursued his experiments . The first furnace having proved a failure , he proceeded to erect another out of doors . There he burnt more wood , spoiled more drugs and pots , and lost more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " Thus , " said he , " I fooled away several years , with sorrow and sighs , because I could not at all arrive at my intention . " In the intervals of his experiments he occasionally worked at his former callings , painting on glass , drawing portraits , and measuring land ; but his earnings from these sources were very small . At length he was no longer able to carry on his experiments in his own furnace because of the heavy cost of fuel ; but he bought more potsherds , broke them up as before into three or four hundred pieces , and , covering them with chemicals , carried them to a tile-work a league and a half distant from Saintes , there to be baked in an ordinary furnace . After the operation he went to see the pieces taken out ; and , to his dismay , the whole of the experiments were failures . But though disappointed , he was not yet defeated ; for he determined on the very spot to " begin afresh . " His business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pursuit of his experiments . In conformity with an edict of the State , it became necessary to survey the salt-marshes in the neighbourhood of Saintes for the purpose of levying the land-tax . Palissy was employed to make this survey , and prepare the requisite map . The work occupied him some time , and he was doubtless well paid for it ; but no sooner was it completed than he proceeded , with redoubled zeal , to follow up his old investigations " in the track of the enamels . " He began by breaking three dozen new earthen pots , the pieces of which he covered with different materials which he had compounded , and then took them to a neighbouring glass-furnace to be baked . The results gave him a glimmer of hope . The greater heat of the glass-furnace had melted some of the compounds ; but though Palissy searched diligently for the white enamel he could find none . For two more years he went on experimenting without any satisfactory result , until the proceeds of his survey of the salt-marshes having become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he resolved to make a last great effort ; and he began by breaking more pots than ever . More than three hundred pieces of pottery covered with his compounds were sent to the glass-furnace ; and thither he himself went to watch the results of the baking . Four hours passed , during which he watched ; and then the furnace was opened . The material on ONE only of the three hundred pieces of potsherd had melted , and it was taken out to cool . As it hardened , it grew white-white and polished ! The piece of potsherd was covered with white enamel , described by Palissy as " singularly beautiful ! " And beautiful it must no doubt have been in his eyes after all his weary waiting . He ran home with it to his wife , feeling himself , as he expressed it , quite a new creature . But the prize was not yet won  --  far from it . The partial success of this intended last effort merely had the effect of luring him on to a succession of further experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention , which he now believed to be at hand , he resolved to build for himself a glass-furnace near his dwelling , where he might carry on his operations in secret . He proceeded to build the furnace with his own hands , carrying the bricks from the brick-field upon his back . He was bricklayer , labourer , and all . From seven to eight more months passed . At last the furnace was built and ready for use . Palissy had in the mean time fashioned a number of vessels of clay in readiness for the laying on of the enamel . After being subjected to a preliminary process of baking , they were covered with the enamel compound , and again placed in the furnace for the grand crucial experiment . Although his means were nearly exhausted , Palissy had been for some time accumulating a great store of fuel for the final effort ; and he thought it was enough . At last the fire was lit , and the operation proceeded . All day he sat by the furnace , feeding it with fuel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . But the enamel did not melt . The sun rose upon his labours . His wife brought him a portion of the scanty morning meal ,  --  for he would not stir from the furnace , into which he continued from time to time to heave more fuel . The second day passed , and still the enamel did not melt . The sun set , and another night passed . The pale , haggard , unshorn , baffled yet not beaten Palissy sat by his furnace eagerly looking for the melting of the enamel . A third day and night passed  --  a fourth , a fifth , and even a sixth ,  --  yes , for six long days and nights did the unconquerable Palissy watch and toil , fighting against hope ; and still the enamel would not melt . It then occurred to him that there might be some defect in the materials for the enamel  --  perhaps something wanting in the flux ; so he set to work to pound and compound fresh materials for a new experiment . Thus two or three more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for those which he had made with his own hands for the purposes of the first experiment were by long baking irretrievably spoilt for the purposes of a second . His money was now all spent ; but he could borrow . His character was still good , though his wife and the neighbours thought him foolishly wasting his means in futile experiments . Nevertheless he succeeded . He borrowed sufficient from a friend to enable him to buy more fuel and more pots , and he was again ready for a further experiment . The pots were covered with the new compound , placed in the furnace , and the fire was again lit . It was the last and most desperate experiment of the whole . The fire blazed up ; the heat became intense ; but still the enamel did not melt . The fuel began to run short ! How to keep up the fire ? There were the garden palings : these would burn . They must be sacrificed rather than that the great experiment should fail . The garden palings were pulled up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The enamel had not yet melted . Ten minutes more heat might do it . Fuel must be had at whatever cost . There remained the household furniture and shelving . A crashing noise was heard in the house ; and amidst the screams of his wife and children , who now feared Palissy 's reason was giving way , the tables were seized , broken up , and heaved into the furnace . The enamel had not melted yet ! There remained the shelving . Another noise of the wrenching of timber was heard within the house ; and the shelves were torn down and hurled after the furniture into the fire . Wife and children then rushed from the house , and went frantically through the town , calling out that poor Palissy had gone mad , and was breaking up his very furniture for firewood ! 10 For an entire month his shirt had not been off his back , and he was utterly worn out  --  wasted with toil , anxiety , watching , and want of food . He was in debt , and seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length mastered the secret ; for the last great burst of heat had melted the enamel . The common brown household jars , when taken out of the furnace after it had become cool , were found covered with a white glaze ! For this he could endure reproach , contumely , and scorn , and wait patiently for the opportunity of putting his discovery into practice as better days came round . Palissy next hired a potter to make some earthen vessels after designs which he furnished ; while he himself proceeded to model some medallions in clay for the purpose of enamelling them . But how to maintain himself and his family until the wares were made and ready for sale ? Fortunately there remained one man in Saintes who still believed in the integrity , if not in the judgment , of Palissy  --  an inn-keeper , who agreed to feed and lodge him for six months , while he went on with his manufacture . As for the working potter whom he had hired , Palissy soon found that he could not pay him the stipulated wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip himself ; and he accordingly parted with some of his clothes to the potter , in part payment of the wages which he owed him . Palissy next erected an improved furnace , but he was so unfortunate as to build part of the inside with flints . When it was heated , these flints cracked and burst , and the spiculae were scattered over the pieces of pottery , sticking to them . Though the enamel came out right , the work was irretrievably spoilt , and thus six more months ' labour was lost . Persons were found willing to buy the articles at a low price , notwithstanding the injury they had sustained ; but Palissy would not sell them , considering that to have done so would be to " decry and abate his honour ; " and so he broke in pieces the entire batch . " Nevertheless , " says he , " hope continued to inspire me , and I held on manfully ; sometimes , when visitors called , I entertained them with pleasantry , while I was really sad at heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to endure , were the mockeries and persecutions of those of my own household , who were so unreasonable as to expect me to execute work without the means of doing so . For years my furnaces were without any covering or protection , and while attending them I have been for nights at the mercy of the wind and the rain , without help or consolation , save it might be the wailing of cats on the one side and the howling of dogs on the other . Sometimes the tempest would beat so furiously against the furnaces that I was compelled to leave them and seek shelter within doors . Drenched by rain , and in no better plight than if I had been dragged through mire , I have gone to lie down at midnight or at daybreak , stumbling into the house without a light , and reeling from one side to another as if I had been drunken , but really weary with watching and filled with sorrow at the loss of my labour after such long toiling . But alas ! my home proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , I found in my chamber a second persecution worse than the first , which makes me even now marvel that I was not utterly consumed by my many sorrows . " At this stage of his affairs , Palissy became melancholy and almost hopeless , and seems to have all but broken down . He wandered gloomily about the fields near Saintes , his clothes hanging in tatters , and himself worn to a skeleton . In a curious passage in his writings he describes how that the calves of his legs had disappeared and were no longer able with the help of garters to hold up his stockings , which fell about his heels when he walked . 11 The family continued to reproach him for his recklessness , and his neighbours cried shame upon him for his obstinate folly . So he returned for a time to his former calling ; and after about a year 's diligent labour , during which he earned bread for his household and somewhat recovered his character among his neighbours , he again resumed his darling enterprise . But though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enamel , it cost him nearly eight more years of experimental plodding before he perfected his invention . He gradually learnt dexterity and certainty of result by experience , gathering practical knowledge out of many failures . Every mishap was a fresh lesson to him , teaching him something new about the nature of enamels , the qualities of argillaceous earths , the tempering of clays , and the construction and management of furnaces . At last , after about sixteen years ' labour , Palissy took heart and called himself Potter . These sixteen years had been his term of apprenticeship to the art ; during which he had wholly to teach himself , beginning at the very beginning . He was now able to sell his wares and thereby maintain his family in comfort . But he never rested satisfied with what he had accomplished . He proceeded from one step of improvement to another ; always aiming at the greatest perfection possible . He studied natural objects for patterns , and with such success that the great Buffon spoke of him as " so great a naturalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now regarded as rare gems in the cabinets of virtuosi , and sell at almost fabulous prices . 12 The ornaments on them are for the most part accurate models from life , of wild animals , lizards , and plants , found in the fields about Saintes , and tastefully combined as ornaments into the texture of a plate or vase . When Palissy had reached the height of his art he styled himself " Ouvrier de Terre et Inventeur des Rustics Figulines . " We have not , however , come to an end of the sufferings of Palissy , respecting which a few words remain to be said . Being a Protestant , at a time when religious persecution waxed hot in the south of France , and expressing his views without fear , he was regarded as a dangerous heretic . His enemies having informed against him , his house at Saintes was entered by the officers of " justice , " and his workshop was thrown open to the rabble , who entered and smashed his pottery , while he himself was hurried off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait his turn at the stake or the scaffold . He was condemned to be burnt ; but a powerful noble , the Constable de Montmorency , interposed to save his life  --  not because he had any special regard for Palissy or his religion , but because no other artist could be found capable of executing the enamelled pavement for his magnificent chateau then in course of erection at Ecouen , about four leagues from Paris . By his influence an edict was issued appointing Palissy Inventor of Rustic Figulines to the King and to the Constable , which had the effect of immediately removing him from the jurisdiction of Bourdeaux . He was accordingly liberated , and returned to his home at Saintes only to find it devastated and broken up . His workshop was open to the sky , and his works lay in ruins . Shaking the dust of Saintes from his feet he left the place never to return to it , and removed to Paris to carry on the works ordered of him by the Constable and the Queen Mother , being lodged in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture of pottery , with the aid of his two sons , Palissy , during the latter part of his life , wrote and published several books on the potter 's art , with a view to the instruction of his countrymen , and in order that they might avoid the many mistakes which he himself had made . He also wrote on agriculture , on fortification , and natural history , on which latter subject he even delivered lectures to a limited number of persons . He waged war against astrology , alchemy , witchcraft , and like impostures . This stirred up against him many enemies , who pointed the finger at him as a heretic , and he was again arrested for his religion and imprisoned in the Bastille . He was now an old man of seventy-eight , trembling on the verge of the grave , but his spirit was as brave as ever . He was threatened with death unless he recanted ; but he was as obstinate in holding to his religion as he had been in hunting out the secret of the enamel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in prison to induce him to abjure his faith . " My good man , " said the King , " you have now served my mother and myself for forty-five years . We have put up with your adhering to your religion amidst fires and massacres : now I am so pressed by the Guise party as well as by my own people , that I am constrained to leave you in the hands of your enemies , and to-morrow you will be burnt unless you become converted . " " Sire , " answered the unconquerable old man , " I am ready to give my life for the glory of God . You have said many times that you have pity on me ; and now I have pity on you , who have pronounced the words I AM CONSTRAINED ! It is not spoken like a king , sire ; it is what you , and those who constrain you , the Guisards and all your people , can never effect upon me , for I know how to die . " 14 Palissy did indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stake . He died in the Bastille , after enduring about a year 's imprisonment ,  - -  there peacefully terminating a life distinguished for heroic labour , extraordinary endurance , inflexible rectitude , and the exhibition of many rare and noble virtues . 15 The life of John Frederick Bottgher , the inventor of hard porcelain , presents a remarkable contrast to that of Palissy ; though it also contains many points of singular and almost romantic interest . Bottgher was born at Schleiz , in the Voightland , in 1685 , and at twelve years of age was placed apprentice with an apothecary at Berlin . He seems to have been early fascinated by chemistry , and occupied most of his leisure in making experiments . These for the most part tended in one direction  --  the art of converting common on metals into gold . At the end of several years , Bottgher pretended to have discovered the universal solvent of the alchemists , and professed that he had made gold by its means . He exhibited its powers before his master , the apothecary Zorn , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other witnesses believe that he had actually converted copper into gold . The news spread abroad that the apothecary 's apprentice had discovered the grand secret , and crowds collected about the shop to get a sight of the wonderful young " gold-cook . " The king himself expressed a wish to see and converse with him , and when Frederick I. was presented with a piece of the gold pretended to have been converted from copper , he was so dazzled with the prospect of securing an infinite quantity of it  --  Prussia being then in great straits for money  --  that he determined to secure Bottgher and employ him to make gold for him within the strong fortress of Spandau . But the young apothecary , suspecting the king 's intention , and probably fearing detection , at once resolved on flight , and he succeeded in getting across the frontier into Saxony . A reward of a thousand thalers was offered for Bottgher 's apprehension , but in vain . He arrived at Wittenberg , and appealed for protection to the Elector of Saxony , Frederick Augustus I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Frederick was himself very much in want of money at the time , and he was overjoyed at the prospect of obtaining gold in any quantity by the aid of the young alchemist . Bottgher was accordingly conveyed in secret to Dresden , accompanied by a royal escort . He had scarcely left Wittenberg when a battalion of Prussian grenadiers appeared before the gates demanding the gold-maker 's extradition . But it was too late : Bottgher had already arrived in Dresden , where he was lodged in the Golden House , and treated with every consideration , though strictly watched and kept under guard . The Elector , however , must needs leave him there for a time , having to depart forthwith to Poland , then almost in a state of anarchy . But , impatient for gold , he wrote Bottgher from Warsaw , urging him to communicate the secret , so that he himself might practise the art of commutation . The young " gold-cook , " thus pressed , forwarded to Frederick a small phial containing " a reddish fluid , " which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a molten state , into gold . This important phial was taken in charge by the Prince Furst von Furstenburg , who , accompanied by a regiment of Guards , hurried with it to Warsaw . Arrived there , it was determined to make immediate trial of the process . The King and the Prince locked themselves up in a secret chamber of the palace , girt themselves about with leather aprons , and like true " gold-cooks " set to work melting copper in a crucible and afterwards applying to it the red fluid of Bottgher . But the result was unsatisfactory ; for notwithstanding all that they could do , the copper obstinately remained copper . On referring to the alchemist 's instructions , however , the King found that , to succeed with the process , it was necessary that the fluid should be used " in great purity of heart ; " and as his Majesty was conscious of having spent the evening in very bad company he attributed the failure of the experiment to that cause . A second trial was followed by no better results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had confessed and received absolution before beginning the second experiment . Frederick Augustus now resolved on forcing Bottgher to disclose the golden secret , as the only means of relief from his urgent pecuniary difficulties . The alchemist , hearing of the royal intention , again determined to fly . He succeeded in escaping his guard , and , after three days ' travel , arrived at Ens in Austria , where he thought himself safe . The agents of the Elector were , however , at his heels ; they had tracked him to the " Golden Stag , " which they surrounded , and seizing him in his bed , notwithstanding his resistance and appeals to the Austrian authorities for help , they carried him by force to Dresden . From this time he was more strictly watched than ever , and he was shortly after transferred to the strong fortress of Koningstein . It was communicated to him that the royal exchequer was completely empty , and that ten regiments of Poles in arrears of pay were waiting for his gold . The King himself visited him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not at once proceed to make gold , he would be hung ! ( " Thu mir zurecht , Bottgher , sonst lass ich dich hangen " ) . Years passed , and still Bottgher made no gold ; but he was not hung . It was reserved for him to make a far more important discovery than the conversion of copper into gold , namely , the conversion of clay into porcelain . Some rare specimens of this ware had been brought by the Portuguese from China , which were sold for more than their weight in gold . Bottgher was first induced to turn his attention to the subject by Walter von Tschirnhaus , a maker of optical instruments , also an alchemist . Tschirnhaus was a man of education and distinction , and was held in much esteem by Prince Furstenburg as well as by the Elector . He very sensibly said to Bottgher , still in fear of the gallows  --  " If you ca n't make gold , try and do something else ; make porcelain . " The alchemist acted on the hint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He prosecuted his investigations for a long time with great assiduity , but without success . At length some red clay , brought to him for the purpose of making his crucibles , set him on the right track . He found that this clay , when submitted to a high temperature , became vitrified and retained its shape ; and that its texture resembled that of porcelain , excepting in colour and opacity . He had in fact accidentally discovered red porcelain , and he proceeded to manufacture it and sell it as porcelain . Bottgher was , however , well aware that the white colour was an essential property of true porcelain ; and he therefore prosecuted his experiments in the hope of discovering the secret . Several years thus passed , but without success ; until again accident stood his friend , and helped him to a knowledge of the art of making white porcelain . One day , in the year 1707 , he found his perruque unusually heavy , and asked of his valet the reason . The answer was , that it was owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of a kind of earth then much used for hair powder . Bottgher 's quick imagination immediately seized upon the idea . This white earthy powder might possibly be the very earth of which he was in search  --  at all events the opportunity must not be let slip of ascertaining what it really was . He was rewarded for his painstaking care and watchfulness ; for he found , on experiment , that the principal ingredient of the hair-powder consisted of kaolin , the want of which had so long formed an insuperable difficulty in the way of his inquiries . The discovery , in Bottgher 's intelligent hands , led to great results , and proved of far greater importance than the discovery of the philosopher 's stone would have been . In October , 1707 , he presented his first piece of porcelain to the Elector , who was greatly pleased with it ; and it was resolved that Bottgher should be furnished with the means necessary for perfecting his invention . Having obtained a skilled workman from Delft , he began to TURN porcelain with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inscribed over the door of his workshop this distich : - " Es machte Gott , der grosse Schopfer , Aus einem Goldmacher einen Topfer. " 16 Bottgher , however , was still under strict surveillance , for fear lest he should communicate his secret to others or escape the Elector 's control . The new workshops and furnaces which were erected for him , were guarded by troops night and day , and six superior officers were made responsible for the personal security of the potter . Bottgher 's further experiments with his new furnaces proving very successful , and the porcelain which he manufactured being found to fetch large prices , it was next determined to establish a Royal Manufactory of porcelain . The manufacture of delft ware was known to have greatly enriched Holland . Why should not the manufacture of porcelain equally enrich the Elector ? Accordingly , a decree went forth , dated the 23rd of January , 1710 , for the establishment of " a large manufactory of porcelain " at the Albrechtsburg in Meissen . In this decree , which was translated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ambassadors of the Elector at all the European Courts , Frederick Augustus set forth that to promote the welfare of Saxony , which had suffered much through the Swedish invasion , he had " directed his attention to the subterranean treasures ( unterirdischen Schatze ) " of the country , and having employed some able persons in the investigation , they had succeeded in manufacturing " a sort of red vessels ( eine Art rother Gefasse ) far superior to the Indian terra sigillata ; " 17 as also " coloured ware and plates ( buntes Geschirr und Tafeln ) which may be cut , ground , and polished , and are quite equal to Indian vessels , " and finally that " specimens of white porcelain ( Proben von weissem Porzellan ) " had already been obtained , and it was hoped that this quality , too , would soon be manufactured in considerable quantities . The royal decree concluded by inviting " foreign artists and handicraftmen " to come to Saxony and engage as assistants in the new factory , at high wages , and under the patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best account of the actual state of Bottgher 's invention at the time . It has been stated in German publications that Bottgher , for the great services rendered by him to the Elector and to Saxony , was made Manager of the Royal Porcelain Works , and further promoted to the dignity of Baron . Doubtless he deserved these honours ; but his treatment was of an altogether different character , for it was shabby , cruel , and inhuman . Two royal officials , named Matthieu and Nehmitz , were put over his head as directors of the factory , while he himself only held the position of foreman of potters , and at the same time was detained the King 's prisoner . During the erection of the factory at Meissen , while his assistance was still indispensable , he was conducted by soldiers to and from Dresden ; and even after the works were finished , he was locked up nightly in his room . All this preyed upon his mind , and in repeated letters to the King he sought to obtain mitigation of his fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will devote my whole soul to the art of making porcelain , " he writes on one occasion , " I will do more than any inventor ever did before ; only give me liberty , liberty ! " To these appeals , the King turned a deaf ear . He was ready to spend money and grant favours ; but liberty he would not give . He regarded Bottgher as his slave . In this position , the persecuted man kept on working for some time , till , at the end of a year or two , he grew negligent . Disgusted with the world and with himself , he took to drinking . Such is the force of example , that it no sooner became known that Bottgher had betaken himself to this vice , than the greater number of the workmen at the Meissen factory became drunkards too . Quarrels and fightings without end were the consequence , so that the troops were frequently called upon to interfere and keep peace among the " Porzellanern , " as they were nicknamed . After a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shut up in the Albrechtsburg , and treated as prisoners of state . Bottgher at last fell seriously ill , and in May , 1713 , his dissolution was hourly expected . The King , alarmed at losing so valuable a slave , now gave him permission to take carriage exercise under a guard ; and , having somewhat recovered , he was allowed occasionally to go to Dresden . In a letter written by the King in April , 1714 , Bottgher was promised his full liberty ; but the offer came too late . Broken in body and mind , alternately working and drinking , though with occasional gleams of nobler intention , and suffering under constant ill-health , the result of his enforced confinement , Bottgher lingered on for a few years more , until death freed him from his sufferings on the 13th March , 1719 , in the thirty-fifth year of his age . He was buried AT NIGHT  --  as if he had been a dog  --  in the Johannis Cemetery of Meissen . Such was the treatment and such the unhappy end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture immediately opened up an important source of public revenue , and it became so productive to the Elector of Saxony , that his example was shortly after followed by most European monarchs . Although soft porcelain had been made at St. Cloud fourteen years before Bottgher 's discovery , the superiority of the hard porcelain soon became generally recognised . Its manufacture was begun at Sevres in 1770 , and it has since almost entirely superseded the softer material . This is now one of the most thriving branches of French industry , of which the high quality of the articles produced is certainly indisputable . The career of Josiah Wedgwood , the English potter , was less chequered and more prosperous than that of either Palissy or Bottgher , and his lot was cast in happier times . Down to the middle of last century England was behind most other nations of the first order in Europe in respect of skilled industry . Although there were many potters in Staffordshire  --  and Wedgwood himself belonged to a numerous clan of potters of the same name  --  their productions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain brown ware , with the patterns scratched in while the clay was wet . The principal supply of the better articles of earthenware came from Delft in Holland , and of drinking stone pots from Cologne . Two foreign potters , the brothers Elers from Nuremberg , settled for a time in Staffordshire , and introduced an improved manufacture , but they shortly after removed to Chelsea , where they confined themselves to the manufacture of ornamental pieces . No porcelain capable of resisting a scratch with a hard point had yet been made in England ; and for a long time the " white ware " made in Staffordshire was not white , but of a dirty cream colour . Such , in a few words , was the condition of the pottery manufacture when Josiah Wedgwood was born at Burslem in 1730 . By the time that he died , sixty-four years later , it had become completely changed . By his energy , skill , and genius , he established the trade upon a new and solid foundation ; and , in the words of his epitaph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant art and an important branch of national commerce . " Josiah Wedgwood was one of those indefatigable men who from time to time spring from the ranks of the common people , and by their energetic character not only practically educate the working population in habits of industry , but by the example of diligence and perseverance which they set before them , largely influence the public activity in all directions , and contribute in a great degree to form the national character . He was , like Arkwright , the youngest of a family of thirteen children . His grandfather and granduncle were both potters , as was also his father who died when he was a mere boy , leaving him a patrimony of twenty pounds . He had learned to read and write at the village school ; but on the death of his father he was taken from it and set to work as a " thrower " in a small pottery carried on by his elder brother . There he began life , his working life , to use his own words , " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven years old . He was shortly after seized by an attack of virulent smallpox , from the effects of which he suffered during the rest of his life , for it was followed by a disease in the right knee , which recurred at frequent intervals , and was only got rid of by the amputation of the limb many years later . Mr. Gladstone , in his eloquent Eloge on Wedgwood recently delivered at Burslem , well observed that the disease from which he suffered was not improbably the occasion of his subsequent excellence . " It prevented him from growing up to be the active , vigorous English workman , possessed of all his limbs , and knowing right well the use of them ; but it put him upon considering whether , as he could not be that , he might not be something else , and something greater . It sent his mind inwards ; it drove him to meditate upon the laws and secrets of his art . The result was , that he arrived at a perception and a grasp of them which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned , by an Athenian potter . " 18 When he had completed his apprenticeship with his brother , Josiah joined partnership with another workman , and carried on a small business in making knife-hafts , boxes , and sundry articles for domestic use . Another partnership followed , when he proceeded to make melon table plates , green pickle leaves , candlesticks , snuffboxes , and such like articles ; but he made comparatively little progress until he began business on his own account at Burslem in the year 1759 . There he diligently pursued his calling , introducing new articles to the trade , and gradually extending his business . What he chiefly aimed at was to manufacture cream-coloured ware of a better quality than was then produced in Staffordshire as regarded shape , colour , glaze , and durability . To understand the subject thoroughly , he devoted his leisure to the study of chemistry ; and he made numerous experiments on fluxes , glazes , and various sorts of clay . Being a close inquirer and accurate observer , he noticed that a certain earth containing silica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to the heat of a furnace . This fact , observed and pondered on , led to the idea of mixing silica with the red powder of the potteries , and to the discovery that the mixture becomes white when calcined . He had but to cover this material with a vitrification of transparent glaze , to obtain one of the most important products of fictile art  --  that which , under the name of English earthenware , was to attain the greatest commercial value and become of the most extensive utility . Wedgwood was for some time much troubled by his furnaces , though nothing like to the same extent that Palissy was ; and he overcame his difficulties in the same way  --  by repeated experiments and unfaltering perseverance . His first attempts at making porcelain for table use was a succession of disastrous failures ,  --  the labours of months being often destroyed in a day . It was only after a long series of trials , in the course of which he lost time , money , and labour , that he arrived at the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be denied , and at last he conquered success through patience . The improvement of pottery became his passion , and was never lost sight of for a moment . Even when he had mastered his difficulties , and become a prosperous man  --  manufacturing white stone ware and cream-coloured ware in large quantities for home and foreign use  --  he went forward perfecting his manufactures , until , his example extending in all directions , the action of the entire district was stimulated , and a great branch of British industry was eventually established on firm foundations . He aimed throughout at the highest excellence , declaring his determination " to give over manufacturing any article , whatsoever it might be , rather than to degrade it . " Wedgwood was cordially helped by many persons of rank and influence ; for , working in the truest spirit , he readily commanded the help and encouragement of other true workers . He made for Queen Charlotte the first royal table-service of English manufacture , of the kind afterwards called " Queen's-ware , " and was appointed Royal Potter ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made a baron . Valuable sets of porcelain were entrusted to him for imitation , in which produced accurate and beautiful copies . The Duchess of Portland outbid him for the Barberini Vase when that article was offered for sale . He bid as high as seventeen hundred guineas for it : her grace secured it for eighteen hundred ; but when she learnt Wedgwood 's object she at once generously lent him the vase to copy . He produced fifty copies at a cost of about 2500l. , and his expenses were not covered by their sale ; but he gained his object , which was to show that whatever had been done , that English skill and energy could and would accomplish . Wedgwood called to his aid the crucible of the chemist , the knowledge of the antiquary , and the skill of the artist . He found out Flaxman when a youth , and while he liberally nurtured his genius drew from him a large number of beautiful designs for his pottery and porcelain ; converting them by his manufacture into objects of taste and excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical art amongst the people . By careful experiment and study he was even enabled to rediscover the art of painting on porcelain or earthenware vases and similar articles  --  an art practised by the ancient Etruscans , but which had been lost since the time of Pliny . He distinguished himself by his own contributions to science , and his name is still identified with the Pyrometer which he invented . He was an indefatigable supporter of all measures of public utility ; and the construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal , which completed the navigable communication between the eastern and western sides of the island , was mainly due to his public-spirited exertions , allied to the engineering skill of Brindley . The road accommodation of the district being of an execrable character , he planned and executed a turnpike-road through the Potteries , ten miles in length . The reputation he achieved was such that his works at Burslem , and subsequently those at Etruria , which he founded and built , became a point of attraction to distinguished visitors from all parts of Europe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pottery , which he found in the very lowest condition , became one of the staples of England ; and instead of importing what we needed for home use from abroad , we became large exporters to other countries , supplying them with earthenware even in the face of enormous prohibitory duties on articles of British produce . Wedgwood gave evidence as to his manufactures before Parliament in 1785 , only some thirty years after he had begun his operations ; from which it appeared , that instead of providing only casual employment to a small number of inefficient and badly remunerated workmen , about 20,000 persons then derived their bread directly from the manufacture of earthenware , without taking into account the increased numbers to which it gave employment in coal-mines , and in the carrying trade by land and sea , and the stimulus which it gave to employment in many ways in various parts of the country . Yet , important as had been the advances made in his time , Mr. Wedgwood was of opinion that the manufacture was but in its infancy , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount compared with those to which the art was capable of attaining , through the continued industry and growing intelligence of the manufacturers , and the natural facilities and political advantages enjoyed by Great Britain ; an opinion which has been fully borne out by the progress which has since been effected in this important branch of industry . In 1852 not fewer than 84,000,000 pieces of pottery were exported from England to other countries , besides what were made for home use . But it is not merely the quantity and value of the produce that is entitled to consideration , but the improvement of the condition of the population by whom this great branch of industry is conducted . When Wedgwood began his labours , the Staffordshire district was only in a half-civilized state . The people were poor , uncultivated , and few in number . When Wedgwood 's manufacture was firmly established , there was found ample employment at good wages for three times the number of population ; while their moral advancement had kept pace with their material improvement . Men such as these are fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilized world . Their patient self-reliance amidst trials and difficulties , their courage and perseverance in the pursuit of worthy objects , are not less heroic of their kind than the bravery and devotion of the soldier and the sailor , whose duty and pride it is heroically to defend what these valiant leaders of industry have so heroically achieved . CHAPTER IV  --  APPLICATION AND PERSEVERANCE " Rich are the diligent , who can command Time , nature 's stock ! and could his hour-glass fall , Would , as for seed of stars , stoop for the sand , And , by incessant labour , gather all . "  --  D'Avenant . " Allez en avant , et la foi vous viendra ! "  --  D'Alembert . The greatest results in life are usually attained by simple means , and the exercise of ordinary qualities . The common life of every day , with its cares , necessities , and duties , affords ample opportunity for acquiring experience of the best kind ; and its most beaten paths provide the true worker with abundant scope for effort and room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old highway of steadfast well-doing ; and they who are the most persistent , and work in the truest spirit , will usually be the most successful . Fortune has often been blamed for her blindness ; but fortune is not so blind as men are . Those who look into practical life will find that fortune is usually on the side of the industrious , as the winds and waves are on the side of the best navigators . In the pursuit of even the highest branches of human inquiry , the commoner qualities are found the most useful  --  such as common sense , attention , application , and perseverance . Genius may not be necessary , though even genius of the highest sort does not disdain the use of these ordinary qualities . The very greatest men have been among the least believers in the power of genius , and as worldly wise and persevering as successful men of the commoner sort . Some have even defined genius to be only common sense intensified . A distinguished teacher and president of a college spoke of it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the power of lighting one 's own fire . Buffon said of genius " it is patience . " Newton 's was unquestionably a mind of the very highest order , and yet , when asked by what means he had worked out his extraordinary discoveries , he modestly answered , " By always thinking unto them . " At another time he thus expressed his method of study : " I keep the subject continually before me , and wait till the first dawnings open slowly by little and little into a full and clear light . " It was in Newton 's case , as in every other , only by diligent application and perseverance that his great reputation was achieved . Even his recreation consisted in change of study , laying down one subject to take up another . To Dr. Bentley he said : " If I have done the public any service , it is due to nothing but industry and patient thought . " So Kepler , another great philosopher , speaking of his studies and his progress , said : " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eundo , ' so it was with me , that the diligent thought on these things was the occasion of still further thinking ; until at last I brooded with the whole energy of my mind upon the subject . " The extraordinary results effected by dint of sheer industry and perseverance , have led many distinguished men to doubt whether the gift of genius be so exceptional an endowment as it is usually supposed to be . Thus Voltaire held that it is only a very slight line of separation that divides the man of genius from the man of ordinary mould . Beccaria was even of opinion that all men might be poets and orators , and Reynolds that they might be painters and sculptors . If this were really so , that stolid Englishman might not have been so very far wrong after all , who , on Canova 's death , inquired of his brother whether it was " his intention to carry on the business ! " Locke , Helvetius , and Diderot believed that all men have an equal aptitude for genius , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which regulate the operations of the intellect , must also be within the reach of others who , under like circumstances , apply themselves to like pursuits . But while admitting to the fullest extent the wonderful achievements of labour , and recognising the fact that men of the most distinguished genius have invariably been found the most indefatigable workers , it must nevertheless be sufficiently obvious that , without the original endowment of heart and brain , no amount of labour , however well applied , could have produced a Shakespeare , a Newton , a Beethoven , or a Michael Angelo . Dalton , the chemist , repudiated the notion of his being " a genius , " attributing everything which he had accomplished to simple industry and accumulation . John Hunter said of himself , " My mind is like a beehive ; but full as it is of buzz and apparent confusion , it is yet full of order and regularity , and food collected with incessant industry from the choicest stores of nature . " We have , indeed , but to glance at the biographies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , artists , thinkers , and workers of all kinds , owe their success , in a great measure , to their indefatigable industry and application . They were men who turned all things to gold  --  even time itself . Disraeli the elder held that the secret of success consisted in being master of your subject , such mastery being attainable only through continuous application and study . Hence it happens that the men who have most moved the world , have not been so much men of genius , strictly so called , as men of intense mediocre abilities , and untiring perseverance ; not so often the gifted , of naturally bright and shining qualities , as those who have applied themselves diligently to their work , in whatsoever line that might lie . " Alas ! " said a widow , speaking of her brilliant but careless son , " he has not the gift of continuance . " Wanting in perseverance , such volatile natures are outstripped in the race of life by the diligent and even the dull . " Che va piano , va @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverb : Who goes slowly , goes long , and goes far . Hence , a great point to be aimed at is to get the working quality well trained . When that is done , the race will be found comparatively easy . We must repeat and again repeat ; facility will come with labour . Not even the simplest art can be accomplished without it ; and what difficulties it is found capable of achieving ! It was by early discipline and repetition that the late Sir Robert Peel cultivated those remarkable , though still mediocre powers , which rendered him so illustrious an ornament of the British Senate . When a boy at Drayton Manor , his father was accustomed to set him up at table to practise speaking extempore ; and he early accustomed him to repeat as much of the Sunday 's sermon as he could remember . Little progress was made at first , but by steady perseverance the habit of attention became powerful , and the sermon was at length repeated almost verbatim . When afterwards replying in succession to the arguments of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrivalled  --  it was little surmised that the extraordinary power of accurate remembrance which he displayed on such occasions had been originally trained under the discipline of his father in the parish church of Drayton . It is indeed marvellous what continuous application will effect in the commonest of things . It may seem a simple affair to play upon a violin ; yet what a long and laborious practice it requires ! Giardini said to a youth who asked him how long it would take to learn it , " Twelve hours a day for twenty years together . " Industry , it is said , fait l'ours danser . The poor figurante must devote years of incessant toil to her profitless task before she can shine in it . When Taglioni was preparing herself for her evening exhibition , she would , after a severe two hours ' lesson from her father , fall down exhausted , and had to be undressed , sponged , and resuscitated totally unconscious . The agility and bounds of the evening were insured only at a price like this . Progress , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great results can not be achieved at once ; and we must be satisfied to advance in life as we walk , step by step . De Maistre says that " to know HOW TO WAIT is the great secret of success . " We must sow before we can reap , and often have to wait long , content meanwhile to look patiently forward in hope ; the fruit best worth waiting for often ripening the slowest . But " time and patience , " says the Eastern proverb , " change the mulberry leaf to satin . " To wait patiently , however , men must work cheerfully . Cheerfulness is an excellent working quality , imparting great elasticity to the character . As a bishop has said , " Temper is nine-tenths of Christianity ; " so are cheerfulness and diligence nine-tenths of practical wisdom . They are the life and soul of success , as well as of happiness ; perhaps the very highest pleasure in life consisting in clear , brisk , conscious working ; energy , confidence , and every other good quality mainly depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish priest at Foston-le-Clay , in Yorkshire ,  --  though he did not feel himself to be in his proper element ,  --  went cheerfully to work in the firm determination to do his best . " I am resolved , " he said , " to like it , and reconcile myself to it , which is more manly than to feign myself above it , and to send up complaints by the post of being thrown away , and being desolate , and such like trash . " So Dr. Hook , when leaving Leeds for a new sphere of labour said , " Wherever I may be , I shall , by God 's blessing , do with my might what my hand findeth to do ; and if I do not find work , I shall make it . " Labourers for the public good especially , have to work long and patiently , often uncheered by the prospect of immediate recompense or result . The seeds they sow sometimes lie hidden under the winter 's snow , and before the spring comes the husbandman may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker who , like Rowland Hill , sees his great idea bring forth fruit in his life-time . Adam Smith sowed the seeds of a great social amelioration in that dingy old University of Glasgow where he so long laboured , and laid the foundations of his ' Wealth of Nations ; ' but seventy years passed before his work bore substantial fruits , nor indeed are they all gathered in yet . Nothing can compensate for the loss of hope in a man : it entirely changes the character . " How can I work  --  how can I be happy , " said a great but miserable thinker , " when I have lost all hope ? " One of the most cheerful and courageous , because one of the most hopeful of workers , was Carey , the missionary . When in India , it was no uncommon thing for him to weary out three pundits , who officiated as his clerks , in one day , he himself taking rest only in change of employment . Carey , the son of a shoe-maker , was supported in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Marsham , the son of a weaver . By their labours , a magnificent college was erected at Serampore ; sixteen flourishing stations were established ; the Bible was translated into sixteen languages , and the seeds were sown of a beneficent moral revolution in British India . Carey was never ashamed of the humbleness of his origin . On one occasion , when at the Governor-General 's table he over-heard an officer opposite him asking another , loud enough to be heard , whether Carey had not once been a shoemaker : " No , sir , " exclaimed Carey immediately ; " only a cobbler . " An eminently characteristic anecdote has been told of his perseverance as a boy . When climbing a tree one day , his foot slipped , and he fell to the ground , breaking his leg by the fall . He was confined to his bed for weeks , but when he recovered and was able to walk without support , the very first thing he did was to go and climb that tree . Carey had need of this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and nobly and resolutely he did it . It was a maxim of Dr. Young , the philosopher , that " Any man can do what any other man has done ; " and it is unquestionable that he himself never recoiled from any trials to which he determined to subject himself . It is related of him , that the first time he mounted a horse , he was in company with the grandson of Mr. Barclay of Ury , the well-known sportsman ; when the horseman who preceded them leapt a high fence . Young wished to imitate him , but fell off his horse in the attempt . Without saying a word , he remounted , made a second effort , and was again unsuccessful , but this time he was not thrown further than on to the horse 's neck , to which he clung . At the third trial , he succeeded , and cleared the fence . The story of Timour the Tartar learning a lesson of perseverance under adversity from the spider is well known . Not less interesting is the anecdote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself : " An accident , " he says , " which happened to two hundred of my original drawings , nearly put a stop to my researches in ornithology . I shall relate it , merely to show how far enthusiasm  --  for by no other name can I call my perseverance  - -  may enable the preserver of nature to surmount the most disheartening difficulties . I left the village of Henderson , in Kentucky , situated on the banks of the Ohio , where I resided for several years , to proceed to Philadelphia on business . I looked to my drawings before my departure , placed them carefully in a wooden box , and gave them in charge of a relative , with injunctions to see that no injury should happen to them . My absence was of several months ; and when I returned , after having enjoyed the pleasures of home for a few days , I inquired after my box , and what I was pleased to call my treasure . The box was produced and opened ; but reader , feel for me  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reared a young family among the gnawed bits of paper , which , but a month previous , represented nearly a thousand inhabitants of air ! The burning beat which instantly rushed through my brain was too great to be endured without affecting my whole nervous system . I slept for several nights , and the days passed like days of oblivion  --  until the animal powers being recalled into action through the strength of my constitution , I took up my gun , my notebook , and my pencils , and went forth to the woods as gaily as if nothing had happened . I felt pleased that I might now make better drawings than before ; and , ere a period not exceeding three years had elapsed , my portfolio was again filled . " The accidental destruction of Sir Isaac Newton 's papers , by his little dog ' Diamond ' upsetting a lighted taper upon his desk , by which the elaborate calculations of many years were in a moment destroyed , is a well-known anecdote , and need not be repeated : it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it seriously injured his health , and impaired his understanding . An accident of a somewhat similar kind happened to the MS. of Mr. Carlyle 's first volume of his ' French Revolution . ' He had lent the MS. to a literary neighbour to peruse . By some mischance , it had been left lying on the parlour floor , and become forgotten . Weeks ran on , and the historian sent for his work , the printers being loud for " copy . " Inquiries were made , and it was found that the maid-of-all-work , finding what she conceived to be a bundle of waste paper on the floor , had used it to light the kitchen and parlour fires with ! Such was the answer returned to Mr. Carlyle ; and his feelings may be imagined . There was , however , no help for him but to set resolutely to work to re-write the book ; and he turned to and did it . He had no draft , and was compelled to rake up from his memory facts , ideas , and expressions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book in the first instance had been a work of pleasure ; the re-writing of it a second time was one of pain and anguish almost beyond belief . That he persevered and finished the volume under such circumstances , affords an instance of determination of purpose which has seldom been surpassed . The lives of eminent inventors are eminently illustrative of the same quality of perseverance . George Stephenson , when addressing young men , was accustomed to sum up his best advice to them , in the words , " Do as I have done  --  persevere . " He had worked at the improvement of his locomotive for some fifteen years before achieving his decisive victory at Rainhill ; and Watt was engaged for some thirty years upon the condensing-engine before he brought it to perfection . But there are equally striking illustrations of perseverance to be found in every other branch of science , art , and industry . Perhaps one of the most interesting is that connected with the disentombment of the Nineveh marbles , and the discovery of the long-lost cuneiform or arrow-headed character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of writing which had been lost to the world since the period of the Macedonian conquest of Persia . An intelligent cadet of the East India Company , stationed at Kermanshah , in Persia , had observed the curious cuneiform inscriptions on the old monuments in the neighbourhood  --  so old that all historical traces of them had been lost ,  --  and amongst the inscriptions which he copied was that on the celebrated rock of Behistun  --  a perpendicular rock rising abruptly some 1700 feet from the plain , the lower part bearing inscriptions for the space of about 300 feet in three languages  --  Persian , Scythian , and Assyrian . Comparison of the known with the unknown , of the language which survived with the language that had been lost , enabled this cadet to acquire some knowledge of the cuneiform character , and even to form an alphabet . Mr. ( afterwards Sir Henry ) Rawlinson sent his tracings home for examination . No professors in colleges as yet knew anything of the cuneiform character ; but there was a ci-devant clerk of the East India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norris  --  who had made this little-understood subject his study , to whom the tracings were submitted ; and so accurate was his knowledge , that , though he had never seen the Behistun rock , he pronounced that the cadet had not copied the puzzling inscription with proper exactness . Rawlinson , who was still in the neighbourhood of the rock , compared his copy with the original , and found that Norris was right ; and by further comparison and careful study the knowledge of the cuneiform writing was thus greatly advanced . But to make the learning of these two self-taught men of avail , a third labourer was necessary in order to supply them with material for the exercise of their skill . Such a labourer presented himself in the person of Austen Layard , originally an articled clerk in the office of a London solicitor . One would scarcely have expected to find in these three men , a cadet , an India-House clerk , and a lawyer 's clerk , the discoverers of a forgotten language , and of the buried history of Babylon ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only twenty-two , travelling in the East , when he was possessed with a desire to penetrate the regions beyond the Euphrates . Accompanied by a single companion , trusting to his arms for protection , and , what was better , to his cheerfulness , politeness , and chivalrous bearing , he passed safely amidst tribes at deadly war with each other ; and , after the lapse of many years , with comparatively slender means at his command , but aided by application and perseverance , resolute will and purpose , and almost sublime patience ,  --  borne up throughout by his passionate enthusiasm for discovery and research ,  --  he succeeded in laying bare and digging up an amount of historical treasures , the like of which has probably never before been collected by the industry of any one man . Not less than two miles of bas-reliefs were thus brought to light by Mr. Layard . The selection of these valuable antiquities , now placed in the British Museum , was found so curiously corroborative of the scriptural records of events which occurred some three thousand years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new revelation . And the story of the disentombment of these remarkable works , as told by Mr. Layard himself in his ' Monuments of Nineveh , ' will always be regarded as one of the most charming and unaffected records which we possess of individual enterprise , industry , and energy . The career of the Comte de Buffon presents another remarkable illustration of the power of patient industry as well as of his own saying , that " Genius is patience . " Notwithstanding the great results achieved by him in natural history , Buffon , when a youth , was regarded as of mediocre talents . His mind was slow in forming itself , and slow in reproducing what it had acquired . He was also constitutionally indolent ; and being born to good estate , it might be supposed that he would indulge his liking for ease and luxury . Instead of which , he early formed the resolution of denying himself pleasure , and devoting himself to study and self-culture . Regarding time as a treasure that was limited , and finding that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he determined to break himself of the habit . He struggled hard against it for some time , but failed in being able to rise at the hour he had fixed . He then called his servant , Joseph , to his help , and promised him the reward of a crown every time that he succeeded in getting him up before six . At first , when called , Buffon declined to rise  --  pleaded that he was ill , or pretended anger at being disturbed ; and on the Count at length getting up , Joseph found that he had earned nothing but reproaches for having permitted his master to lie a-bed contrary to his express orders . At length the valet determined to earn his crown ; and again and again he forced Buffon to rise , notwithstanding his entreaties , expostulations , and threats of immediate discharge from his service . One morning Buffon was unusually obstinate , and Joseph found it necessary to resort to the extreme measure of dashing a basin of ice-cold water under the bed-clothes , the effect of which was instantaneous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length conquered his habit ; and he was accustomed to say that he owed to Joseph three or four volumes of his Natural History . For forty years of his life , Buffon worked every morning at his desk from nine till two , and again in the evening from five till nine . His diligence was so continuous and so regular that it became habitual . His biographer has said of him , " Work was his necessity ; his studies were the charm of his life ; and towards the last term of his glorious career he frequently said that he still hoped to be able to consecrate to them a few more years . " He was a most conscientious worker , always studying to give the reader his best thoughts , expressed in the very best manner . He was never wearied with touching and retouching his compositions , so that his style may be pronounced almost perfect . He wrote the ' Epoques de la Nature ' not fewer than eleven times before he was satisfied with it ; although he had thought over the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , most orderly in everything ; and he was accustomed to say that genius without order lost three-fourths of its power . His great success as a writer was the result mainly of his painstaking labour and diligent application . " Buffon , " observed Madame Necker , " strongly persuaded that genius is the result of a profound attention directed to a particular subject , said that he was thoroughly wearied out when composing his first writings , but compelled himself to return to them and go over them carefully again , even when he thought he had already brought them to a certain degree of perfection ; and that at length he found pleasure instead of weariness in this long and elaborate correction . " It ought also to be added that Buffon wrote and published all his great works while afflicted by one of the most painful diseases to which the human frame is subject . Literary life affords abundant illustrations of the same power of perseverance ; and perhaps no career is more instructive , viewed in this light , than that of Sir Walter Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office , where he pursued for many years a sort of drudgery scarcely above that of a copying clerk . His daily dull routine made his evenings , which were his own , all the more sweet ; and he generally devoted them to reading and study . He himself attributed to his prosaic office discipline that habit of steady , sober diligence , in which mere literary men are so often found wanting . As a copying clerk he was allowed 3d. for every page containing a certain number of words ; and he sometimes , by extra work , was able to copy as many as 120 pages in twenty-four hours , thus earning some 30s. ; out of which he would occasionally purchase an odd volume , otherwise beyond his means . During his after-life Scott was wont to pride himself upon being a man of business , and he averred , in contradiction to what he called the cant of sonneteers , that there was no necessary connection between genius and an aversion or contempt for the common duties of life . On the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every day in any matter-of-fact occupation was good for the higher faculties themselves in the upshot . While afterwards acting as clerk to the Court of Session in Edinburgh , he performed his literary work chiefly before breakfast , attending the court during the day , where he authenticated registered deeds and writings of various kinds . On the whole , says Lockhart , " it forms one of the most remarkable features in his history , that throughout the most active period of his literary career , he must have devoted a large proportion of his hours , during half at least of every year , to the conscientious discharge of professional duties . " It was a principle of action which he laid down for himself , that he must earn his living by business , and not by literature . On one occasion he said , " I determined that literature should be my staff , not my crutch , and that the profits of my literary labour , however convenient otherwise , should not , if I could help it , become necessary to my ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully cultivated of his habits , otherwise it had not been possible for him to get through so enormous an amount of literary labour . He made it a rule to answer every letter received by him on the same day , except where inquiry and deliberation were requisite . Nothing else could have enabled him to keep abreast with the flood of communications that poured in upon him and sometimes put his good nature to the severest test . It was his practice to rise by five o'clock , and light his own fire . He shaved and dressed with deliberation , and was seated at his desk by six o'clock , with his papers arranged before him in the most accurate order , his works of reference marshalled round him on the floor , while at least one favourite dog lay watching his eye , outside the line of books . Thus by the time the family assembled for breakfast , between nine and ten , he had done enough  --  to use his own words  --  to break the neck of the day 's work . But with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , the result of many years ' patient labour , Scott always spoke with the greatest diffidence of his own powers . On one occasion he said , " Throughout every part of my career I have felt pinched and hampered by my own ignorance . " Such is true wisdom and humility ; for the more a man really knows , the less conceited he will be . The student at Trinity College who went up to his professor to take leave of him because he had " finished his education , " was wisely rebuked by the professor 's reply , " Indeed ! I am only beginning mine . " The superficial person who has obtained a smattering of many things , but knows nothing well , may pride himself upon his gifts ; but the sage humbly confesses that " all he knows is , that he knows nothing , " or like Newton , that he has been only engaged in picking shells by the sea shore , while the great ocean of truth lies all unexplored before him . The lives of second-rate literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The late John Britton , author of ' The Beauties of England and Wales , ' and of many valuable architectural works , was born in a miserable cot in Kingston , Wiltshire . His father had been a baker and maltster , but was ruined in trade and became insane while Britton was yet a child . The boy received very little schooling , but a great deal of bad example , which happily did not corrupt him . He was early in life set to labour with an uncle , a tavern-keeper in Clerkenwell , under whom he bottled , corked , and binned wine for more than five years . His health failing him , his uncle turned him adrift in the world , with only two guineas , the fruits of his five years ' service , in his pocket . During the next seven years of his life he endured many vicissitudes and hardships . Yet he says , in his autobiography , " in my poor and obscure lodgings , at eighteenpence a week , I indulged in study , and often read in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford a fire . " Travelling on foot to Bath , he there obtained an engagement as a cellarman , but shortly after we find him back in the metropolis again almost penniless , shoeless , and shirtless . He succeeded , however , in obtaining employment as a cellarman at the London Tavern , where it was his duty to be in the cellar from seven in the morning until eleven at night . His health broke down under this confinement in the dark , added to the heavy work ; and he then engaged himself , at fifteen shillings a week , to an attorney ,  --  for he had been diligently cultivating the art of writing during the few spare minutes that he could call his own . While in this employment , he devoted his leisure principally to perambulating the bookstalls , where he read books by snatches which he could not buy , and thus picked up a good deal of odd knowledge . Then he shifted to another office , at the advanced wages of twenty shillings a week , still reading and studying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he published under the title of ' The Enterprising Adventures of Pizarro ; ' and from that time until his death , during a period of about fifty-five years , Britton was occupied in laborious literary occupation . The number of his published works is not fewer than eighty-seven ; the most important being ' The Cathedral Antiquities of England , ' in fourteen volumes , a truly magnificent work ; itself the best monument of John Britton 's indefatigable industry . London , the landscape gardener , was a man of somewhat similar character , possessed of an extraordinary working power . The son of a farmer near Edinburgh , he was early inured to work . His skill in drawing plans and making sketches of scenery induced his father to train him for a landscape gardener . During his apprenticeship he sat up two whole nights every week to study ; yet he worked harder during the day than any labourer . In the course of his night studies he learnt French , and before he was eighteen he translated a life of Abelard for an Encyclopaedia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when only twenty , while working as a gardener in England , he wrote down in his note-book , " I am now twenty years of age , and perhaps a third part of my life has passed away , and yet what have I done to benefit my fellow men ? " an unusual reflection for a youth of only twenty . From French he proceeded to learn German , and rapidly mastered that language . Having taken a large farm , for the purpose of introducing Scotch improvements in the art of agriculture , he shortly succeeded in realising a considerable income . The continent being thrown open at the end of the war , he travelled abroad for the purpose of inquiring into the system of gardening and agriculture in other countries . He twice repeated his journeys , and the results were published in his Encyclopaedias , which are among the most remarkable works of their kind ,  --  distinguished for the immense mass of useful matter which they contain , collected by an amount of industry and labour which has rarely been equalled . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those which we have cited . His father was a hard-working labourer of the parish of St. Austell , in Cornwall . Though poor , he contrived to send his two sons to a penny-a-week school in the neighbourhood . Jabez , the elder , took delight in learning , and made great progress in his lessons ; but Samuel , the younger , was a dunce , notoriously given to mischief and playing truant . When about eight years old he was put to manual labour , earning three-halfpence a day as a buddle-boy at a tin mine . At ten he was apprenticed to a shoemaker , and while in this employment he endured much hardship ,  - -  living , as he used to say , " like a toad under a harrow . " He often thought of running away and becoming a pirate , or something of the sort , and he seems to have grown in recklessness as he grew in years . In robbing orchards he was usually a leader ; and , as he grew older , he delighted to take part in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his apprenticeship was out , he ran away , intending to enter on board a man-of-war ; but , sleeping in a hay-field at night cooled him a little , and he returned to his trade . Drew next removed to the neighbourhood of Plymouth to work at his shoemaking business , and while at Cawsand he won a prize for cudgel-playing , in which he seems to have been an adept . While living there , he had nearly lost his life in a smuggling exploit which he had joined , partly induced by the love of adventure , and partly by the love of gain , for his regular wages were not more than eight shillings a-week . One night , notice was given throughout Crafthole , that a smuggler was off the coast , ready to land her cargo ; on which the male population of the place  --  nearly all smugglers  --  made for the shore . One party remained on the rocks to make signals and dispose of the goods as they were landed ; and another manned the boats , Drew being of the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of the cargo had been landed , when the wind rose , with a heavy sea . The men in the boats , however , determined to persevere , and several trips were made between the smuggler , now standing farther out to sea , and the shore . One of the men in the boat in which Drew was , had his hat blown off by the wind , and in attempting to recover it , the boat was upset . Three of the men were immediately drowned ; the others clung to the boat for a time , but finding it drifting out to sea , they took to swimming . They were two miles from land , and the night was intensely dark . After being about three hours in the water , Drew reached a rock near the shore , with one or two others , where he remained benumbed with cold till morning , when he and his companions were discovered and taken off , more dead than alive . A keg of brandy from the cargo just landed was brought , the head knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid presented to the survivors ; and , shortly after , Drew was able to walk two miles through deep snow , to his lodgings . This was a very unpromising beginning of a life ; and yet this same Drew , scapegrace , orchard-robber , shoemaker , cudgel-player , and smuggler , outlived the recklessness of his youth and became distinguished as a minister of the Gospel and a writer of good books . Happily , before it was too late , the energy which characterised him was turned into a more healthy direction , and rendered him as eminent in usefulness as he had before been in wickedness . His father again took him back to St. Austell , and found employment for him as a journeyman shoemaker . Perhaps his recent escape from death had tended to make the young man serious , as we shortly find him attracted by the forcible preaching of Dr. Adam Clarke , a minister of the Wesleyan Methodists . His brother having died about the same time , the impression of seriousness was deepened ; and thenceforward he was an altered man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had almost forgotten how to read and write ; and even after several years ' practice , a friend compared his writing to the traces of a spider dipped in ink set to crawl upon paper . Speaking of himself , about that time , Drew afterwards said , " The more I read , the more I felt my own ignorance ; and the more I felt my ignorance , the more invincible became my energy to surmount it . Every leisure moment was now employed in reading one thing or another . Having to support myself by manual labour , my time for reading was but little , and to overcome this disadvantage , my usual method was to place a book before me while at meat , and at every repast I read five or six pages . " The perusal of Locke 's ' Essay on the Understanding ' gave the first metaphysical turn to his mind . " It awakened me from my stupor , " said he , " and induced me to form a resolution to abandon the grovelling views which I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own account , with a capital of a few shillings ; but his character for steadiness was such that a neighbouring miller offered him a loan , which was accepted , and , success attending his industry , the debt was repaid at the end of a year . He started with a determination to " owe no man anything , " and he held to it in the midst of many privations . Often he went to bed supperless , to avoid rising in debt . His ambition was to achieve independence by industry and economy , and in this he gradually succeeded . In the midst of incessant labour , he sedulously strove to improve his mind , studying astronomy , history , and metaphysics . He was induced to pursue the latter study chiefly because it required fewer books to consult than either of the others . " It appeared to be a thorny path , " he said , " but I determined , nevertheless , to enter , and accordingly began to tread it . " Added to his labours in shoemaking and metaphysics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took an eager interest in politics , and his shop became a favourite resort with the village politicians . And when they did not come to him , he went to them to talk over public affairs . This so encroached upon his time that he found it necessary sometimes to work until midnight to make up for the hours lost during the day . His political fervour become the talk of the village . While busy one night hammering away at a shoe-sole , a little boy , seeing a light in the shop , put his mouth to the keyhole of the door , and called out in a shrill pipe , " Shoemaker ! shoe-maker ! work by night and run about by day ! " A friend , to whom Drew afterwards told the story , asked , " And did not you run after the boy , and strap him ? " " No , no , " was the reply ; " had a pistol been fired off at my ear , I could not have been more dismayed or confounded . I dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , true ! but you shall never have that to say of me again . ' To me that cry was as the voice of God , and it has been a word in season throughout my life . I learnt from it not to leave till to-morrow the work of to-day , or to idle when I ought to be working . " From that moment Drew dropped politics , and stuck to his work , reading and studying in his spare hours : but he never allowed the latter pursuit to interfere with his business , though it frequently broke in upon his rest . He married , and thought of emigrating to America ; but he remained working on . His literary taste first took the direction of poetical composition ; and from some of the fragments which have been preserved , it appears that his speculations as to the immateriality and immortality of the soul had their origin in these poetical musings . His study was the kitchen , where his wife 's bellows served him for a desk ; and he wrote amidst the cries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reason ' having appeared about this time and excited much interest , he composed a pamphlet in refutation of its arguments , which was published . He used afterwards to say that it was the ' Age of Reason ' that made him an author . Various pamphlets from his pen shortly appeared in rapid succession , and a few years later , while still working at shoemaking , he wrote and published his admirable ' Essay on the Immateriality and Immortality of the Human Soul , ' which he sold for twenty pounds , a great sum in his estimation at the time . The book went through many editions , and is still prized . Drew was in no wise puffed up by his success , as many young authors are , but , long after he had become celebrated as a writer , used to be seen sweeping the street before his door , or helping his apprentices to carry in the winter 's coals . Nor could he , for some time , bring himself to regard literature as a profession to live by . His first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , and to put into the " lottery of literary success , " as he termed it , only the surplus of his time . At length , however , he devoted himself wholly to literature , more particularly in connection with the Wesleyan body ; editing one of their magazines , and superintending the publication of several of their denominational works . He also wrote in the ' Eclectic Review , ' and compiled and published a valuable history of his native county , Cornwall , with numerous other works . Towards the close of his career , he said of himself ,  --  " Raised from one of the lowest stations in society , I have endeavoured through life to bring my family into a state of respectability , by honest industry , frugality , and a high regard for my moral character . Divine providence has smiled on my exertions , and crowned my wishes with success . " The late Joseph Hume pursued a very different career , but worked in an equally persevering spirit . He was a man of moderate parts , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life was " Perseverance , " and well , he acted up to it . His father dying while he was a mere child , his mother opened a small shop in Montrose , and toiled hard to maintain her family and bring them up respectably . Joseph she put apprentice to a surgeon , and educated for the medical profession . Having got his diploma , he made several voyages to India as ship 's surgeon , 19 and afterwards obtained a cadetship in the Company 's service . None worked harder , or lived more temperately , than he did , and , securing the confidence of his superiors , who found him a capable man in the performance of his duty , they gradually promoted him to higher offices . In 1803 he was with the division of the army under General Powell , in the Mahratta war ; and the interpreter having died , Hume , who had meanwhile studied and mastered the native languages , was appointed in his stead . He was next made chief of the medical staff . But as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he undertook in addition the offices of paymaster and post-master , and filled them satisfactorily . He also contracted to supply the commissariat , which he did with advantage to the army and profit to himself . After about ten years ' unremitting labour , he returned to England with a competency ; and one of his first acts was to make provision for the poorer members of his family . But Joseph Hume was not a man to enjoy the fruits of his industry in idleness . Work and occupation had become necessary for his comfort and happiness . To make himself fully acquainted with the actual state of his own country , and the condition of the people , he visited every town in the kingdom which then enjoyed any degree of manufacturing celebrity . He afterwards travelled abroad for the purpose of obtaining a knowledge of foreign states . Returned to England , he entered Parliament in 1812 , and continued a member of that assembly , with a short interruption , for a period of about thirty-four years . His first recorded speech was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honourable career he took an active and earnest interest in that and all other questions calculated to elevate and improve the condition of the people  - -  criminal reform , savings-banks , free trade , economy and retrenchment , extended representation , and such like measures , all of which he indefatigably promoted . Whatever subject he undertook , he worked at with all his might . He was not a good speaker , but what he said was believed to proceed from the lips of an honest , single-minded , accurate man . If ridicule , as Shaftesbury says , be the test of truth , Joseph Hume stood the test well . No man was more laughed at , but there he stood perpetually , and literally , " at his post . " He was usually beaten on a division , but the influence which he exercised was nevertheless felt , and many important financial improvements were effected by him even with the vote directly against him . The amount of hard work which he contrived to get through was something extraordinary . He rose at six , wrote letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast , he received persons on business , sometimes as many as twenty in a morning . The House rarely assembled without him , and though the debate might be prolonged to two or three o'clock in the morning , his name was seldom found absent from the division . In short , to perform the work which he did , extending over so long a period , in the face of so many Administrations , week after week , year after year ,  --  to be outvoted , beaten , laughed at , standing on many occasions almost alone ,  --  to persevere in the face of every discouragement , preserving his temper unruffled , never relaxing in his energy or his hope , and living to see the greater number of his measures adopted with acclamation , must be regarded as one of the most remarkable illustrations of the power of human perseverance that biography can exhibit . CHAPTER V  --  HELPS AND OPPORTUNITIES  --  SCIENTIFIC PURSUITS " Neither the naked hand , nor the understanding , left to itself , can do much ; the work is accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not less for the understanding than the hand . "  - -  Bacon . " Opportunity has hair in front , behind she is bald ; if you seize her by the forelock you may hold her , but , if suffered to escape , not Jupiter himself can catch her again . "  --  From the Latin . Accident does very little towards the production of any great result in life . Though sometimes what is called " a happy hit " may be made by a bold venture , the common highway of steady industry and application is the only safe road to travel . It is said of the landscape painter Wilson , that when he had nearly finished a picture in a tame , correct manner , he would step back from it , his pencil fixed at the end of a long stick , and after gazing earnestly on the work , he would suddenly walk up and by a few bold touches give a brilliant finish to the painting . But it will not do for every one who would produce an effect , to throw his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . The capability of putting in these last vital touches is acquired only by the labour of a life ; and the probability is , that the artist who has not carefully trained himself beforehand , in attempting to produce a brilliant effect at a dash , will only produce a blotch . Sedulous attention and painstaking industry always mark the true worker . The greatest men are not those who " despise the day of small things , " but those who improve them the most carefully . Michael Angelo was one day explaining to a visitor at his studio , what he had been doing at a statue since his previous visit . " I have retouched this part  --  polished that  --  softened this feature  - -  brought out that muscle  --  given some expression to this lip , and more energy to that limb . " " But these are trifles , " remarked the visitor . " It may be so , " replied the sculptor , " but recollect that trifles make perfection , and perfection is no trifle . " So it was said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conduct was , that " whatever was worth doing at all was worth doing well ; " and when asked , late in life , by his friend Vigneul de Marville , by what means he had gained so high a reputation among the painters of Italy , Poussin emphatically answered , " Because I have neglected nothing . " Although there are discoveries which are said to have been made by accident , if carefully inquired into , it will be found that there has really been very little that was accidental about them . For the most part , these so-called accidents have only been opportunities , carefully improved by genius . The fall of the apple at Newton 's feet has often been quoted in proof of the accidental character of some discoveries . But Newton 's whole mind had already been devoted for years to the laborious and patient investigation of the subject of gravitation ; and the circumstance of the apple falling before his eyes was suddenly apprehended only as genius could apprehend it , and served to flash upon him the brilliant discovery then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliantly-coloured soap-bubbles blown from a common tobacco pipe -- though " trifles light as air " in most eyes  --  suggested to Dr. Young his beautiful theory of " interferences , " and led to his discovery relating to the diffraction of light . Although great men are popularly supposed only to deal with great things , men such as Newton and Young were ready to detect the significance of the most familiar and simple facts ; their greatness consisting mainly in their wise interpretation of them . The difference between men consists , in a great measure , in the intelligence of their observation . The Russian proverb says of the non-observant man , " He goes through the forest and sees no firewood . " " The wise man 's eyes are in his head , " says Solomon , " but the fool walketh in darkness . " " Sir , " said Johnson , on one occasion , to a fine gentleman just returned from Italy , " some men will learn more in the Hampstead stage than others in the tour of Europe . " It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unthinking gazers observe nothing , men of intelligent vision penetrate into the very fibre of the phenomena presented to them , attentively noting differences , making comparisons , and recognizing their underlying idea . Many before Galileo had seen a suspended weight swing before their eyes with a measured beat ; but he was the first to detect the value of the fact . One of the vergers in the cathedral at Pisa , after replenishing with oil a lamp which hung from the roof , left it swinging to and fro ; and Galileo , then a youth of only eighteen , noting it attentively , conceived the idea of applying it to the measurement of time . Fifty years of study and labour , however , elapsed , before he completed the invention of his Pendulum ,  --  the importance of which , in the measurement of time and in astronomical calculations , can scarcely be overrated . In like manner , Galileo , having casually heard that one Lippershey , a Dutch spectacle-maker , had presented to Count Maurice of Nassau an instrument by means of which distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of such a phenomenon , which led to the invention of the telescope , and proved the beginning of the modern science of astronomy . Discoveries such as these could never have been made by a negligent observer , or by a mere passive listener . While Captain ( afterwards Sir Samuel ) Brown was occupied in studying the construction of bridges , with the view of contriving one of a cheap description to be thrown across the Tweed , near which he lived , he was walking in his garden one dewy autumn morning , when he saw a tiny spider 's net suspended across his path . The idea immediately occurred to him , that a bridge of iron ropes or chains might be constructed in like manner , and the result was the invention of his Suspension Bridge . So James Watt , when consulted about the mode of carrying water by pipes under the Clyde , along the unequal bed of the river , turned his attention one day to the shell of a lobster presented at table ; and from that model he invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found effectually to answer the purpose . Sir Isambert Brunel took his first lessons in forming the Thames Tunnel from the tiny shipworm : he saw how the little creature perforated the wood with its well-armed head , first in one direction and then in another , till the archway was complete , and then daubed over the roof and sides with a kind of varnish ; and by copying this work exactly on a large scale , Brunel was at length enabled to construct his shield and accomplish his great engineering work . It is the intelligent eye of the careful observer which gives these apparently trivial phenomena their value . So trifling a matter as the sight of seaweed floating past his ship , enabled Columbus to quell the mutiny which arose amongst his sailors at not discovering land , and to assure them that the eagerly sought New World was not far off . There is nothing so small that it should remain forgotten ; and no fact , however trivial , but may prove useful in some way or other if carefully interpreted . Who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " had been built up by tiny insects  --  detected only by the help of the microscope  --  of the same order of creatures that have gemmed the sea with islands of coral ! And who that contemplates such extraordinary results , arising from infinitely minute operations , will venture to question the power of little things ? It is the close observation of little things which is the secret of success in business , in art , in science , and in every pursuit in life . Human knowledge is but an accumulation of small facts , made by successive generations of men , the little bits of knowledge and experience carefully treasured up by them growing at length into a mighty pyramid . Though many of these facts and observations seemed in the first instance to have but slight significance , they are all found to have their eventual uses , and to fit into their proper places . Even many speculations seemingly remote , turn out to be the basis of results the most obviously practical . In the case of the conic sections discovered by Apollonius Pergaeus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of astronomy  --  a science which enables the modern navigator to steer his way through unknown seas and traces for him in the heavens an unerring path to his appointed haven . And had not mathematicians toiled for so long , and , to uninstructed observers , apparently so fruitlessly , over the abstract relations of lines and surfaces , it is probable that but few of our mechanical inventions would have seen the light . When Franklin made his discovery of the identity of lightning and electricity , it was sneered at , and people asked , " Of what use is it ? " To which his reply was , " What is the use of a child ? It may become a man ! " When Galvani discovered that a frog 's leg twitched when placed in contact with different metals , it could scarcely have been imagined that so apparently insignificant a fact could have led to important results . Yet therein lay the germ of the Electric Telegraph , which binds the intelligence of continents together , and , probably before many years have elapsed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So too , little bits of stone and fossil , dug out of the earth , intelligently interpreted , have issued in the science of geology and the practical operations of mining , in which large capitals are invested and vast numbers of persons profitably employed . The gigantic machinery employed in pumping our mines , working our mills and manufactures , and driving our steam-ships and locomotives , in like manner depends for its supply of power upon so slight an agency as little drops of water expanded by heat ,  --  that familiar agency called steam , which we see issuing from that common tea-kettle spout , but which , when put up within an ingeniously contrived mechanism , displays a force equal to that of millions of horses , and contains a power to rebuke the waves and set even the hurricane at defiance . The same power at work within the bowels of the earth has been the cause of those volcanoes and earthquakes which have played so mighty a part in the history of the globe . It is said that the Marquis of Worcester 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , by the tight cover of a vessel containing hot water having been blown off before his eyes , when confined a prisoner in the Tower . He published the result of his observations in his ' Century of Inventions , ' which formed a sort of text-book for inquirers into the powers of steam for a time , until Savary , Newcomen , and others , applying it to practical purposes , brought the steam-engine to the state in which Watt found it when called upon to repair a model of Newcomen 's engine , which belonged to the University of Glasgow . This accidental circumstance was an opportunity for Watt , which he was not slow to improve ; and it was the labour of his life to bring the steam-engine to perfection . This art of seizing opportunities and turning even accidents to account , bending them to some purpose is a great secret of success . Dr. Johnson has defined genius to be " a mind of large general powers accidentally determined in some particular direction . " Men who are resolved to find a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they do not lie ready to their hand , they will make them . It is not those who have enjoyed the advantages of colleges , museums , and public galleries , that have accomplished the most for science and art ; nor have the greatest mechanics and inventors been trained in mechanics ' institutes . Necessity , oftener than facility , has been the mother of invention ; and the most prolific school of all has been the school of difficulty . Some of the very best workmen have had the most indifferent tools to work with . But it is not tools that make the workman , but the trained skill and perseverance of the man himself . Indeed it is proverbial that the bad workman never yet had a good tool . Some one asked Opie by what wonderful process he mixed his colours . " I mix them with my brains , sir , " was his reply . It is the same with every workman who would excel . Ferguson made marvellous things  --  such as his wooden clock , that accurately measured the hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in everybody 's hand ; but then everybody is not a Ferguson . A pan of water and two thermometers were the tools by which Dr. Black discovered latent heat ; and a prism , a lens , and a sheet of pasteboard enabled Newton to unfold the composition of light and the origin of colours . An eminent foreign savant once called upon Dr. Wollaston , and requested to be shown over his laboratories in which science had been enriched by so many important discoveries , when the doctor took him into a little study , and , pointing to an old tea-tray on the table , containing a few watch-glasses , test papers , a small balance , and a blowpipe , said , " There is all the laboratory that I have ! " Stothard learnt the art of combining colours by closely studying butterflies ' wings : he would often say that no one knew what he owed to these tiny insects . A burnt stick and a barn door served Wilkie in lieu of pencil and canvas . Bewick first practised drawing on the cottage walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketches in chalk ; and Benjamin West made his first brushes out of the cat 's tail . Ferguson laid himself down in the fields at night in a blanket , and made a map of the heavenly bodies by means of a thread with small beads on it stretched between his eye and the stars . Franklin first robbed the thundercloud of its lightning by means of a kite made with two cross sticks and a silk handkerchief . Watt made his first model of the condensing steam-engine out of an old anatomist 's syringe , used to inject the arteries previous to dissection . Gifford worked his first problems in mathematics , when a cobbler 's apprentice , upon small scraps of leather , which he beat smooth for the purpose ; whilst Rittenhouse , the astronomer , first calculated eclipses on his plough handle . The most ordinary occasions will furnish a man with opportunities or suggestions for improvement , if he be but prompt to take advantage of them . Professor Lee was attracted to the study of Hebrew by finding a Bible in that tongue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repairs of the benches . He became possessed with a desire to read the book in the original , and , buying a cheap second-hand copy of a Hebrew grammar , he set to work and learnt the language for himself . As Edmund Stone said to the Duke of Argyle , in answer to his grace 's inquiry how he , a poor gardener 's boy , had contrived to be able to read Newton 's Principia in Latin , " One needs only to know the twenty-four letters of the alphabet in order to learn everything else that one wishes . " Application and perseverance , and the diligent improvement of opportunities , will do the rest . Sir Walter Scott found opportunities for self-improvement in every pursuit , and turned even accidents to account . Thus it was in the discharge of his functions as a writer 's apprentice that he first visited the Highlands , and formed those friendships among the surviving heroes of 1745 which served to lay the foundation of a large class of his works . Later in life , when employed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled by the kick of a horse , and confined for some time to his house ; but Scott was a sworn enemy to idleness , and he forthwith set his mind to work . In three days he had composed the first canto of ' The Lay of the Last Minstrel , ' which he shortly after finished ,  --  his first great original work . The attention of Dr. Priestley , the discoverer of so many gases , was accidentally drawn to the subject of chemistry through his living in the neighbourhood of a brewery . When visiting the place one day , he noted the peculiar appearances attending the extinction of lighted chips in the gas floating over the fermented liquor . He was forty years old at the time , and knew nothing of chemistry . He consulted books to ascertain the cause , but they told him little , for as yet nothing was known on the subject . Then he began to experiment , with some rude apparatus of his own contrivance . The curious results of his first experiments led to others , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About the same time , Scheele was obscurely working in the same direction in a remote Swedish village ; and he discovered several new gases , with no more effective apparatus at his command than a few apothecaries ' phials and pigs ' bladders . Sir Humphry Davy , when an apothecary 's apprentice , performed his first experiments with instruments of the rudest description . He extemporised the greater part of them himself , out of the motley materials which chance threw in his way ,  --  the pots and pans of the kitchen , and the phials and vessels of his master 's surgery . It happened that a French ship was wrecked off the Land 's End , and the surgeon escaped , bearing with him his case of instruments , amongst which was an old-fashioned glyster apparatus ; this article he presented to Davy , with whom he had become acquainted . The apothecary 's apprentice received it with great exultation , and forthwith employed it as a part of a pneumatic apparatus which he contrived , afterwards using it to perform the duties of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources of heat . In like manner Professor Faraday , Sir Humphry Davy 's scientific successor , made his first experiments in electricity by means of an old bottle , white he was still a working bookbinder . And it is a curious fact that Faraday was first attracted to the study of chemistry by hearing one of Sir Humphry Davy 's lectures on the subject at the Royal Institution . A gentleman , who was a member , calling one day at the shop where Faraday was employed in binding books , found him poring over the article " Electricity " in an Encyclopaedia placed in his hands to bind . The gentleman , having made inquiries , found that the young bookbinder was curious about such subjects , and gave him an order of admission to the Royal Institution , where he attended a course of four lectures delivered by Sir Humphry . He took notes of them , which he showed to the lecturer , who acknowledged their scientific accuracy , and was surprised when informed of the humble position of the reporter . Faraday then expressed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from which Sir Humphry at first endeavoured to dissuade him : but the young man persisting , he was at length taken into the Royal Institution as an assistant ; and eventually the mantle of the brilliant apothecary 's boy fell upon the worthy shoulders of the equally brilliant bookbinder 's apprentice . The words which Davy entered in his note-book , when about twenty years of age , working in Dr. Beddoes ' laboratory at Bristol , were eminently characteristic of him : " I have neither riches , nor power , nor birth to recommend me ; yet if I live , I trust I shall not be of less service to mankind and my friends , than if I had been born with all these advantages . " Davy possessed the capability , as Faraday does , of devoting the whole power of his mind to the practical and experimental investigation of a subject in all its bearings ; and such a mind will rarely fail , by dint of mere industry and patient thinking , in producing results of the highest order . Coleridge said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , which enables him to seize on and analyze all questions , pushing them to their legitimate consequences . Every subject in Davy 's mind has the principle of vitality . Living thoughts spring up like turf under his feet . " Davy , on his part , said of Coleridge , whose abilities he greatly admired , " With the most exalted genius , enlarged views , sensitive heart , and enlightened mind , he will be the victim of a want of order , precision , and regularity . " The great Cuvier was a singularly accurate , careful , and industrious observer . When a boy , he was attracted to the subject of natural history by the sight of a volume of Buffon which accidentally fell in his way . He at once proceeded to copy the drawings , and to colour them after the descriptions given in the text . While still at school , one of his teachers made him a present of ' Linnaeus 's System of Nature ; ' and for more than ten years this constituted his library of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutor in a family residing near Fecamp , in Normandy . Living close to the sea-shore , he was brought face to face with the wonders of marine life . Strolling along the sands one day , he observed a stranded cuttlefish . He was attracted by the curious object , took it home to dissect , and thus began the study of the molluscae , in the pursuit of which he achieved so distinguished a reputation . He had no books to refer to , excepting only the great book of Nature which lay open before him . The study of the novel and interesting objects which it daily presented to his eyes made a much deeper impression on his mind than any written or engraved descriptions could possibly have done . Three years thus passed , during which he compared the living species of marine animals with the fossil remains found in the neighbourhood , dissected the specimens of marine life that came under his notice , and , by careful observation , prepared the way for a complete reform in the classification of the animal kingdom . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who wrote to Jussieu and other friends in Paris on the subject of the young naturalist 's inquiries , in terms of such high commendation , that Cuvier was requested to send some of his papers to the Society of Natural History ; and he was shortly after appointed assistant-superintendent at the Jardin des Plantes . In the letter written by Teissier to Jussieu , introducing the young naturalist to his notice , he said , " You remember that it was I who gave Delambre to the Academy in another branch of science : this also will be a Delambre . " We need scarcely add that the prediction of Teissier was more than fulfilled . It is not accident , then , that helps a man in the world so much as purpose and persistent industry . To the feeble , the sluggish and purposeless , the happiest accidents avail nothing ,  --  they pass them by , seeing no meaning in them . But it is astonishing how much can be accomplished if we are prompt to seize and improve the opportunities for action and effort which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanics while working at his trade of a mathematical-instrument maker , at the same time that he was learning German from a Swiss dyer . Stephenson taught himself arithmetic and mensuration while working as an engineman during the night shifts ; and when he could snatch a few moments in the intervals allowed for meals during the day , he worked his sums with a bit of chalk upon the sides of the colliery waggons . Dalton 's industry was the habit of his life . He began from his boyhood , for he taught a little village-school when he was only about twelve years old ,  --  keeping the school in winter , and working upon his father 's farm in summer . He would sometimes urge himself and companions to study by the stimulus of a bet , though bred a Quaker ; and on one occasion , by his satisfactory solution of a problem , he won as much as enabled him to buy a winter 's store of candles . He continued his meteorological observations until a day or two before he died ,  --  having made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . With perseverance , the very odds and ends of time may be worked up into results of the greatest value . An hour in every day withdrawn from frivolous pursuits would , if profitably employed , enable a person of ordinary capacity to go far towards mastering a science . It would make an ignorant man a well-informed one in less than ten years . Time should not be allowed to pass without yielding fruits , in the form of something learnt worthy of being known , some good principle cultivated , or some good habit strengthened . Dr. Mason Good translated Lucretius while riding in his carriage in the streets of London , going the round of his patients . Dr. Darwin composed nearly all his works in the same way while driving about in his " sulky " from house to house in the country ,  --  writing down his thoughts on little scraps of paper , which he carried about with him for the purpose . Hale wrote his ' Contemplations ' while travelling on circuit . Dr. Burney learnt French and Italian while travelling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his profession . Kirke White learnt Greek while walking to and from a lawyer 's office ; and we personally know a man of eminent position who learnt Latin and French while going messages as an errand-boy in the streets of Manchester . Daguesseau , one of the great Chancellors of France , by carefully working up his odd bits of time , wrote a bulky and able volume in the successive intervals of waiting for dinner , and Madame de Genlis composed several of her charming volumes while waiting for the princess to whom she gave her daily lessons . Elihu Burritt attributed his first success in self-improvement , not to genius , which he disclaimed , but simply to the careful employment of those invaluable fragments of time , called " odd moments . " While working and earning his living as a blacksmith , he mastered some eighteen ancient and modern languages , and twenty-two European dialects .

" Melancthon noted down the time lost by him , that he might thereby reanimate his industry , and not lose an hour . An Italian scholar put over his door an inscription intimating that whosoever remained there should join in his labours . " We are afraid , " said some visitors to Baxter , " that we break in upon your time . " " To be sure you do , " replied the disturbed and blunt divine .

Hale studied for many years at the rate of sixteen hours a day , and when wearied with the study of the law , he would recreate himself with philosophy and the study of the mathematics . Hume wrote thirteen hours a day while preparing his ' History of England . ' Montesquieu , speaking of one part of his writings , said to a friend , " You will read it in a few hours ; but I assure you it has cost me so much labour that it has whitened my hair . " The practice of writing down thoughts and facts for the purpose of holding them fast and preventing their escape into the dim region of forgetfulness , has been much resorted to by thoughtful and studious men . Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set down for use . " Erskine made great extracts from Burke ; and Eldon copied Coke upon Littleton twice over with his own hand , so that the book became , as it were , part of his own mind . The late Dr. Pye Smith , when apprenticed to his father as a bookbinder , was accustomed to make copious memoranda of all the books he read , with extracts and criticisms . This indomitable industry in collecting materials distinguished him through life , his biographer describing him as " always at work , always in advance , always accumulating . " These note-books afterwards proved , like Richter 's " quarries , " the great storehouse from which he drew his illustrations . The same practice characterized the eminent John Hunter , who adopted it for the purpose of supplying the defects of memory ; and he was accustomed thus to illustrate the advantages which one derives from putting one 's thoughts in writing : " It resembles , " he said , " a tradesman taking stock , without which he never knows either what he possesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation was so keen that Abernethy was accustomed to speak of him as " the Argus-eyed "  --  furnished an illustrious example of the power of patient industry . He received little or no education till he was about twenty years of age , and it was with difficulty that he acquired the arts of reading and writing . He worked for some years as a common carpenter at Glasgow , after which he joined his brother William , who had settled in London as a lecturer and anatomical demonstrator . John entered his dissecting-room as an assistant , but soon shot ahead of his brother , partly by virtue of his great natural ability , but mainly by reason of his patient application and indefatigable industry . He was one of the first in this country to devote himself assiduously to the study of comparative anatomy , and the objects he dissected and collected took the eminent Professor Owen no less than ten years to arrange . The collection contains some twenty thousand specimens , and is the most precious treasure of the kind that has ever been accumulated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every morning from sunrise until eight o'clock in his museum ; and throughout the day he carried on his extensive private practice , performed his laborious duties as surgeon to St. George 's Hospital and deputy surgeon-general to the army ; delivered lectures to students , and superintended a school of practical anatomy at his own house ; finding leisure , amidst all , for elaborate experiments on the animal economy , and the composition of various works of great scientific importance . To find time for this gigantic amount of work , he allowed himself only four hours of sleep at night , and an hour after dinner . When once asked what method he had adopted to insure success in his undertakings , he replied , " My rule is , deliberately to consider , before I commence , whether the thing be practicable . If it be not practicable , I do not attempt it . If it be practicable , I can accomplish it if I give sufficient pains to it ; and having begun , I never stop till the thing is done . To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal of his time in collecting definite facts respecting matters which , before his day , were regarded as exceedingly trivial . Thus it was supposed by many of his contemporaries that he was only wasting his time and thought in studying so carefully as he did the growth of a deer 's horn . But Hunter was impressed with the conviction that no accurate knowledge of scientific facts is without its value . By the study referred to , he learnt how arteries accommodate themselves to circumstances , and enlarge as occasion requires ; and the knowledge thus acquired emboldened him , in a case of aneurism in a branch artery , to tie the main trunk where no surgeon before him had dared to tie it , and the life of his patient was saved . Like many original men , he worked for a long time as it were underground , digging and laying foundations . He was a solitary and self-reliant genius , holding on his course without the solace of sympathy or approbation ,  --  for but few of his contemporaries perceived the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did not fail in securing his best reward  --  that which depends less upon others than upon one 's self  --  the approval of conscience , which in a right-minded man invariably follows the honest and energetic performance of duty . Ambrose Pare , the great French surgeon , was another illustrious instance of close observation , patient application , and indefatigable perseverance . He was the son of a barber at Laval , in Maine , where he was born in 1509 . His parents were too poor to send him to school , but they placed him as foot-boy with the cure of the village , hoping that under that learned man he might pick up an education for himself . But the cure kept him so busily employed in grooming his mule and in other menial offices that the boy found no time for learning . While in his service , it happened that the celebrated lithotomist , Cotot , came to Laval to operate on one of the cure 's ecclesiastical brethren . Pare was present at the operation , and was so much interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time formed the determination of devoting himself to the art of surgery . Leaving the cure 's household service , Pare apprenticed himself to a barber-surgeon named Vialot , under whom he learnt to let blood , draw teeth , and perform the minor operations . After four years ' experience of this kind , he went to Paris to study at the school of anatomy and surgery , meanwhile maintaining himself by his trade of a barber . He afterwards succeeded in obtaining an appointment as assistant at the Hotel Dieu , where his conduct was so exemplary , and his progress so marked , that the chief surgeon , Goupil , entrusted him with the charge of the patients whom he could not himself attend to . After the usual course of instruction , Pare was admitted a master barber-surgeon , and shortly after was appointed to a charge with the French army under Montmorenci in Piedmont . Pare was not a man to follow in the ordinary ruts of his profession , but brought the resources of an ardent and original mind to bear upon his daily work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their befitting remedies . Before his time the wounded suffered much more at the hands of their surgeons than they did at those of their enemies . To stop bleeding from gunshot wounds , the barbarous expedient was resorted to of dressing them with boiling oil . Haemorrhage was also stopped by searing the wounds with a red-hot iron ; and when amputation was necessary , it was performed with a red-hot knife . At first Pare treated wounds according to the approved methods ; but , fortunately , on one occasion , running short of boiling oil , he substituted a mild and emollient application . He was in great fear all night lest he should have done wrong in adopting this treatment ; but was greatly relieved next morning on finding his patients comparatively comfortable , while those whose wounds had been treated in the usual way were writhing in torment . Such was the casual origin of one of Pare 's greatest improvements in the treatment of gun-shot wounds ; and he proceeded to adopt the emollient treatment in all future cases . Another still more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop haemorrhage , instead of the actual cautery . Pare , however , met with the usual fate of innovators and reformers . His practice was denounced by his surgical brethren as dangerous , unprofessional , and empirical ; and the older surgeons banded themselves together to resist its adoption . They reproached him for his want of education , more especially for his ignorance of Latin and Greek ; and they assailed him with quotations from ancient writers , which he was unable either to verify or refute . But the best answer to his assailants was the success of his practice . The wounded soldiers called out everywhere for Pare , and he was always at their service : he tended them carefully and affectionately ; and he usually took leave of them with the words , " I have dressed you ; may God cure you . " After three years ' active service as army-surgeon , Pare returned to Paris with such a reputation that he was at once appointed surgeon in ordinary to the King . When Metz was besieged by the Spanish army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the number of wounded was very great . The surgeons were few and incompetent , and probably slew more by their bad treatment than the Spaniards did by the sword . The Duke of Guise , who commanded the garrison , wrote to the King imploring him to send Pare to his help . The courageous surgeon at once set out , and , after braving many dangers ( to use his own words , " d'estre pendu , estrangle ou mis en pieces " ) , he succeeded in passing the enemy 's lines , and entered Metz in safety . The Duke , the generals , and the captains gave him an affectionate welcome ; while the soldiers , when they heard of his arrival , cried , " We no longer fear dying of our wounds ; our friend is among us . " In the following year Pare was in like manner with the besieged in the town of Hesdin , which shortly fell before the Duke of Savoy , and he was taken prisoner . But having succeeded in curing one of the enemy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without ransom , and returned in safety to Paris . The rest of his life was occupied in study , in self-improvement , in piety , and in good deeds . Urged by some of the most learned among his contemporaries , he placed on record the results of his surgical experience , in twenty-eight books , which were published by him at different times . His writings are valuable and remarkable chiefly on account of the great number of facts and cases contained in them , and the care with which he avoids giving any directions resting merely upon theory unsupported by observation . Pare continued , though a Protestant , to hold the office of surgeon in ordinary to the King ; and during the Massacre of St. Bartholomew he owed his life to the personal friendship of Charles IX. , whom he had on one occasion saved from the dangerous effects of a wound inflicted by a clumsy surgeon in performing the operation of venesection . Brantome , in his ' Memoires , ' thus speaks of the King 's rescue of Pare on the night of Saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain during the night in his chamber and wardrobe-room , commanding him not to stir , and saying that it was not reasonable that a man who had preserved the lives of so many people should himself be massacred . " Thus Pare escaped the horrors of that fearful night , which he survived for many years , and was permitted to die in peace , full of age and honours . Harvey was as indefatigable a labourer as any we have named . He spent not less than eight long years of investigation and research before he published his views of the circulation of the blood . He repeated and verified his experiments again and again , probably anticipating the opposition he would have to encounter from the profession on making known his discovery . The tract in which he at length announced his views , was a most modest one ,  --  but simple , perspicuous , and conclusive . It was nevertheless received with ridicule , as the utterance of a crack-brained impostor . For some time , he did not make a single convert , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question the revered authority of the ancients ; and it was even averred that his views were calculated to subvert the authority of the Scriptures and undermine the very foundations of morality and religion . His little practice fell away , and he was left almost without a friend . This lasted for some years , until the great truth , held fast by Harvey amidst all his adversity , and which had dropped into many thoughtful minds , gradually ripened by further observation , and after a period of about twenty-five years , it became generally recognised as an established scientific truth . The difficulties encountered by Dr. Jenner in promulgating and establishing his discovery of vaccination as a preventive of small-pox , were even greater than those of Harvey . Many , before him , had witnessed the cow-pox , and had heard of the report current among the milkmaids in Gloucestershire , that whoever had taken that disease was secure against small-pox . It was a trifling , vulgar rumour , supposed to have no significance whatever ; and no one had thought it worthy of investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenner . He was a youth , pursuing his studies at Sodbury , when his attention was arrested by the casual observation made by a country girl who came to his master 's shop for advice . The small-pox was mentioned , when the girl said , " I ca n't take that disease , for I have had cow-pox . " The observation immediately riveted Jenner 's attention , and he forthwith set about inquiring and making observations on the subject . His professional friends , to whom he mentioned his views as to the prophylactic virtues of cow-pox , laughed at him , and even threatened to expel him from their society , if he persisted in harassing them with the subject . In London he was so fortunate as to study under John Hunter , to whom he communicated his views . The advice of the great anatomist was thoroughly characteristic : " Do n't think , but TRY ; be patient , be accurate . " Jenner 's courage was supported by the advice , which conveyed to him the true art of philosophical investigation . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make observations and experiments , which he continued to pursue for a period of twenty years . His faith in his discovery was so implicit that he vaccinated his own son on three several occasions . At length he published his views in a quarto of about seventy pages , in which he gave the details of twenty-three cases of successful vaccination of individuals , to whom it was found afterwards impossible to communicate the small-pox either by contagion or inoculation . It was in 1798 that this treatise was published ; though he had been working out his ideas since the year 1775 , when they had begun to assume a definite form . How was the discovery received ? First with indifference , then with active hostility . Jenner proceeded to London to exhibit to the profession the process of vaccination and its results ; but not a single medical man could be induced to make trial of it , and after fruitlessly waiting for nearly three months , he returned to his native village . He was even caricatured and abused for his attempt to " bestialize " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter from the cow 's udder . Vaccination was denounced from the pulpit as " diabolical . " It was averred that vaccinated children became " ox-faced , " that abscesses broke out to " indicate sprouting horns , " and that the countenance was gradually " transmuted into the visage of a cow , the voice into the bellowing of bulls . " Vaccination , however , was a truth , and notwithstanding the violence of the opposition , belief in it spread slowly . In one village , where a gentleman tried to introduce the practice , the first persons who permitted themselves to be vaccinated were absolutely pelted and driven into their houses if they appeared out of doors . Two ladies of title  --  Lady Ducie and the Countess of Berkeley  --  to their honour be it remembered  --  had the courage to vaccinate their children ; and the prejudices of the day were at once broken through . The medical profession gradually came round , and there were several who even sought to rob Dr. Jenner of the merit of the discovery , when its importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphed , and he was publicly honoured and rewarded . In his prosperity he was as modest as he had been in his obscurity . He was invited to settle in London , and told that he might command a practice of 10,000l. a year . But his answer was , " No ! In the morning of my days I have sought the sequestered and lowly paths of life  --  the valley , and not the mountain ,  --  and now , in the evening of my days , it is not meet for me to hold myself up as an object for fortune and for fame . " During Jenner 's own life-time the practice of vaccination became adopted all over the civilized world ; and when he died , his title as a Benefactor of his kind was recognised far and wide . Cuvier has said , " If vaccine were the only discovery of the epoch , it would serve to render it illustrious for ever ; yet it knocked twenty times in vain at the doors of the Academies . " Not less patient , resolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his discoveries relating to the nervous system . Previous to his time , the most confused notions prevailed as to the functions of the nerves , and this branch of study was little more advanced than it had been in the times of Democritus and Anaxagoras three thousand years before . Sir Charles Bell , in the valuable series of papers the publication of which was commenced in 1821 , took an entirely original view of the subject , based upon a long series of careful , accurate , and oft-repeated experiments . Elaborately tracing the development of the nervous system up from the lowest order of animated being , to man  --  the lord of the animal kingdom ,  --  he displayed it , to use his own words , " as plainly as if it were written in our mother-tongue . " His discovery consisted in the fact , that the spinal nerves are double in their function , and arise by double roots from the spinal marrow ,  --  volition being conveyed by that part of the nerves springing from the one root , and sensation by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Bell for a period of forty years , when , in 1840 , he laid his last paper before the Royal Society . As in the cases of Harvey and Jenner , when he had lived down the ridicule and opposition with which his views were first received , and their truth came to be recognised , numerous claims for priority in making the discovery were set up at home and abroad . Like them , too , he lost practice by the publication of his papers ; and he left it on record that , after every step in his discovery , he was obliged to work harder than ever to preserve his reputation as a practitioner . The great merits of Sir Charles Bell were , however , at length fully recognised ; and Cuvier himself , when on his death-bed , finding his face distorted and drawn to one side , pointed out the symptom to his attendants as a proof of the correctness of Sir Charles Bell 's theory . An equally devoted pursuer of the same branch of science was the late Dr. Marshall Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hunter , Jenner , and Bell . During the whole course of his long and useful life he was a most careful and minute observer ; and no fact , however apparently insignificant , escaped his attention . His important discovery of the diastaltic nervous system , by which his name will long be known amongst scientific men , originated in an exceedingly simple circumstance . When investigating the pneumonic circulation in the Triton , the decapitated object lay upon the table ; and on separating the tail and accidentally pricking the external integument , he observed that it moved with energy , and became contorted into various forms . He had not touched a muscle or a muscular nerve ; what then was the nature of these movements ? The same phenomena had probably been often observed before , but Dr. Hall was the first to apply himself perseveringly to the investigation of their causes ; and he exclaimed on the occasion , " I will never rest satisfied until I have found all this out , and made it clear . " His attention to the subject was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of his life he devoted not less than 25,000 hours to its experimental and chemical investigation . He was at the same time carrying on an extensive private practice , and officiating as lecturer at St. Thomas 's Hospital and other Medical Schools . It will scarcely be credited that the paper in which he embodied his discovery was rejected by the Royal Society , and was only accepted after the lapse of seventeen years , when the truth of his views had become acknowledged by scientific men both at home and abroad . The life of Sir William Herschel affords another remarkable illustration of the force of perseverance in another branch of science . His father was a poor German musician , who brought up his four sons to the same calling . William came over to England to seek his fortune , and he joined the band of the Durham Militia , in which he played the oboe . The regiment was lying at Doncaster , where Dr. Miller first became acquainted with Herschel , having heard him perform a solo on the violin in a surprising manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was so pleased with him , that he urged him to leave the militia and take up his residence at his house for a time . Herschel did so , and while at Doncaster was principally occupied in violin-playing at concerts , availing himself of the advantages of Dr. Miller 's library to study at his leisure hours . A new organ having been built for the parish church of Halifax , an organist was advertised for , on which Herschel applied for the office , and was selected . Leading the wandering life of an artist , he was next attracted to Bath , where he played in the Pump-room band , and also officiated as organist in the Octagon chapel . Some recent discoveries in astronomy having arrested his mind , and awakened in him a powerful spirit of curiosity , he sought and obtained from a friend the loan of a two-foot Gregorian telescope . So fascinated was the poor musician by the science , that he even thought of purchasing a telescope , but the price asked by the London optician was so alarming , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reflecting telescope is , and the skill which is required to prepare the concave metallic speculum which forms the most important part of the apparatus , will be able to form some idea of the difficulty of this undertaking . Nevertheless , Herschel succeeded , after long and painful labour , in completing a five-foot reflector , with which he had the gratification of observing the ring and satellites of Saturn . Not satisfied with his triumph , he proceeded to make other instruments in succession , of seven , ten , and even twenty feet . In constructing the seven-foot reflector , he finished no fewer than two hundred specula before he produced one that would bear any power that was applied to it ,  --  a striking instance of the persevering laboriousness of the man . While gauging the heavens with his instruments , he continued patiently to earn his bread by piping to the fashionable frequenters of the Pump-room . So eager was he in his astronomical observations , that he would steal away from the room during an interval of the performance , give a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oboe . Thus working away , Herschel discovered the Georgium Sidus , the orbit and rate of motion of which he carefully calculated , and sent the result to the Royal Society ; when the humble oboe player found himself at once elevated from obscurity to fame . He was shortly after appointed Astronomer Royal , and by the kindness of George III . was placed in a position of honourable competency for life . He bore his honours with the same meekness and humility which had distinguished him in the days of his obscurity . So gentle and patient , and withal so distinguished and successful a follower of science under difficulties , perhaps can not be found in the entire history of biography . The career of William Smith , the father of English geology , though perhaps less known , is not less interesting and instructive as an example of patient and laborious effort , and the diligent cultivation of opportunities . He was born in 1769 , the son of a yeoman farmer at Churchill , in Oxfordshire . His father dying when he was but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village school , and even that was to a considerable extent interfered with by his wandering and somewhat idle habits as a boy . His mother having married a second time , he was taken in charge by an uncle , also a farmer , by whom he was brought up . Though the uncle was by no means pleased with the boy 's love of wandering about , collecting " poundstones , " " pundips , " and other stony curiosities which lay scattered about the adjoining land , he yet enabled him to purchase a few of the necessary books wherewith to instruct himself in the rudiments of geometry and surveying ; for the boy was already destined for the business of a land-surveyor . One of his marked characteristics , even as a youth , was the accuracy and keenness of his observation ; and what he once clearly saw he never forgot . He began to draw , attempted to colour , and practised the arts of mensuration and surveying , all without regular instruction ; and by his efforts in self-culture , he shortly became so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local surveyor of ability in the neighbourhood . In carrying on his business he was constantly under the necessity of traversing Oxfordshire and the adjoining counties . One of the first things he seriously pondered over , was the position of the various soils and strata that came under his notice on the lands which he surveyed or travelled over ; more especially the position of the red earth in regard to the lias and superincumbent rocks . The surveys of numerous collieries which he was called upon to make , gave him further experience ; and already , when only twenty-three years of age , he contemplated making a model of the strata of the earth . While engaged in levelling for a proposed canal in Gloucestershire , the idea of a general law occurred to him relating to the strata of that district . He conceived that the strata lying above the coal were not laid horizontally , but inclined , and in one direction , towards the east ; resembling , on a large scale , " the ordinary appearance of superposed slices of bread and butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed by observations of the strata in two parallel valleys , the " red ground , " " lias , " and " freestone " or " oolite , " being found to come down in an eastern direction , and to sink below the level , yielding place to the next in succession . He was shortly enabled to verify the truth of his views on a larger scale , having been appointed to examine personally into the management of canals in England and Wales . During his journeys , which extended from Bath to Newcastle-on-Tyne , returning by Shropshire and Wales , his keen eyes were never idle for a moment . He rapidly noted the aspect and structure of the country through which he passed with his companions , treasuring up his observations for future use . His geologic vision was so acute , that though the road along which he passed from York to Newcastle in the post chaise was from five to fifteen miles distant from the hills of chalk and oolite on the east , he was satisfied as to their nature , by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface in relation to the lias and " red ground " occasionally seen on the road . The general results of his observation seem to have been these . He noted that the rocky masses of country in the western parts of England generally inclined to the east and south-east ; that the red sandstones and marls above the coal measures passed beneath the lias , clay , and limestone , that these again passed beneath the sands , yellow limestones and clays , forming the table-land of the Cotswold Hills , while these in turn passed beneath the great chalk deposits occupying the eastern parts of England . He further observed , that each layer of clay , sand , and limestone held its own peculiar classes of fossils ; and pondering much on these things , he at length came to the then unheard-of conclusion , that each distinct deposit of marine animals , in these several strata , indicated a distinct sea-bottom , and that each layer of clay , sand , chalk , and stone , marked a distinct epoch of time in the history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he could talk and think of nothing else . At canal boards , at sheep-shearings , at county meetings , and at agricultural associations , ' Strata Smith , ' as he came to be called , was always running over with the subject that possessed him . He had indeed made a great discovery , though he was as yet a man utterly unknown in the scientific world . He proceeded to project a map of the stratification of England ; but was for some time deterred from proceeding with it , being fully occupied in carrying out the works of the Somersetshire coal canal , which engaged him for a period of about six years . He continued , nevertheless , to be unremitting in his observation of facts ; and he became so expert in apprehending the internal structure of a district and detecting the lie of the strata from its external configuration , that he was often consulted respecting the drainage of extensive tracts of land , in which , guided by his geological knowledge , he proved remarkably successful , and acquired an extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of fossils belonging to the Rev. Samuel Richardson , at Bath , Smith astonished his friend by suddenly disarranging his classification , and re-arranging the fossils in their stratigraphical order , saying  --  " These came from the blue lias , these from the over-lying sand and freestone , these from the fuller 's earth , and these from the Bath building stone . " A new light flashed upon Mr. Richardson 's mind , and he shortly became a convert to and believer in William Smith 's doctrine . The geologists of the day were not , however , so easily convinced ; and it was scarcely to be tolerated that an unknown land-surveyor should pretend to teach them the science of geology . But William Smith had an eye and mind to penetrate deep beneath the skin of the earth ; he saw its very fibre and skeleton , and , as it were , divined its organization . His knowledge of the strata in the neighbourhood of Bath was so accurate , that one evening , when dining at the house of the Rev. Joseph Townsend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their order of succession in descending order , twenty-three in number , commencing with the chalk and descending in continuous series down to the coal , below which the strata were not then sufficiently determined . To this was added a list of the more remarkable fossils which had been gathered in the several layers of rock . This was printed and extensively circulated in 1801 . He next determined to trace out the strata through districts as remote from Bath as his means would enable him to reach . For years he journeyed to and fro , sometimes on foot , sometimes on horseback , riding on the tops of stage coaches , often making up by night-travelling the time he had lost by day , so as not to fail in his ordinary business engagements . When he was professionally called away to any distance from home  --  as , for instance , when travelling from Bath to Holkham , in Norfolk , to direct the irrigation and drainage of Mr. Coke 's land in that county  --  he rode on horseback , making frequent detours from the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traversed . For several years he was thus engaged in his journeys to distant quarters in England and Ireland , to the extent of upwards of ten thousand miles yearly ; and it was amidst this incessant and laborious travelling , that he contrived to commit to paper his fast-growing generalizations on what he rightly regarded as a new science . No observation , howsoever trivial it might appear , was neglected , and no opportunity of collecting fresh facts was overlooked . Whenever he could , he possessed himself of records of borings , natural and artificial sections , drew them to a constant scale of eight yards to the inch , and coloured them up . Of his keenness of observation take the following illustration . When making one of his geological excursions about the country near Woburn , as he was drawing near to the foot of the Dunstable chalk hills , he observed to his companion , " If there be any broken ground about the foot of these hills , we may find SHARK 'S TEETH ; " and they had not proceeded far , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new fence-ditch . As he afterwards said of himself , " The habit of observation crept on me , gained a settlement in my mind , became a constant associate of my life , and started up in activity at the first thought of a journey ; so that I generally went off well prepared with maps , and sometimes with contemplations on its objects , or on those on the road , reduced to writing before it commenced . My mind was , therefore , like the canvas of a painter , well prepared for the first and best impressions . " Notwithstanding his courageous and indefatigable industry , many circumstances contributed to prevent the promised publication of William Smith 's ' Map of the Strata of England and Wales , ' and it was not until 1814 that he was enabled , by the assistance of some friends , to give to the world the fruits of his twenty years ' incessant labour . To prosecute his inquiries , and collect the extensive series of facts and observations requisite for his purpose , he had to expend the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he even sold off his small property to provide the means of visiting remoter parts of the island . Meanwhile he had entered on a quarrying speculation near Bath , which proved unsuccessful , and he was under the necessity of selling his geological collection ( which was purchased by the British Museum ) , his furniture and library , reserving only his papers , maps , and sections , which were useless save to himself . He bore his losses and misfortunes with exemplary fortitude ; and amidst all , he went on working with cheerful courage and untiring patience . He died at Northampton , in August , 1839 , while on his way to attend the meeting of the British Association at Birmingham . It is difficult to speak in terms of too high praise of the first geological map of England , which we owe to the industry of this courageous man of science . An accomplished writer says of it , " It was a work so masterly in conception and so correct in general outline , that in principle it served as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Islands , but for geological maps of all other parts of the world , wherever they have been undertaken . In the apartments of the Geological Society Smith 's map may yet be seen  --  a great historical document , old and worn , calling for renewal of its faded tints . Let any one conversant with the subject compare it with later works on a similar scale , and he will find that in all essential features it will not suffer by the comparison  --  the intricate anatomy of the Silurian rocks of Wales and the north of England by Murchison and Sedgwick being the chief additions made to his great generalizations . " 20 The genius of the Oxfordshire surveyor did not fail to be duly recognised and honoured by men of science during his lifetime . In 1831 the Geological Society of London awarded to him the Wollaston medal , " in consideration of his being a great original discoverer in English geology , and especially for his being the first in this country to discover and to teach the identification of strata , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " William Smith , in his simple , earnest way , gained for himself a name as lasting as the science he loved so well . To use the words of the writer above quoted , " Till the manner as well as the fact of the first appearance of successive forms of life shall be solved , it is not easy to surmise how any discovery can be made in geology equal in value to that which we owe to the genius of William Smith . " Hugh Miller was a man of like observant faculties , who studied literature as well as science with zeal and success . The book in which he has told the story of his life , ( ' My Schools and Schoolmasters ' ) , is extremely interesting , and calculated to be eminently useful . It is the history of the formation of a truly noble character in the humblest condition of life ; and inculcates most powerfully the lessons of self-help , self-respect , and self-dependence . While Hugh was but a child , his father , who was a sailor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his widowed mother . He had a school training after a sort , but his best teachers were the boys with whom he played , the men amongst whom he worked , the friends and relatives with whom he lived . He read much and miscellaneously , and picked up odd sorts of knowledge from many quarters ,  --  from workmen , carpenters , fishermen and sailors , and above all , from the old boulders strewed along the shores of the Cromarty Frith . With a big hammer which had belonged to his great-grandfather , an old buccaneer , the boy went about chipping the stones , and accumulating specimens of mica , porphyry , garnet , and such like . Sometimes he had a day in the woods , and there , too , the boy 's attention was excited by the peculiar geological curiosities which came in his way . While searching among the rocks on the beach , he was sometimes asked , in irony , by the farm servants who came to load their carts with sea-weed , whether he " was gettin ' siller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never to be able to answer in the affirmative . When of a suitable age he was apprenticed to the trade of his choice  --  that of a working stonemason ; and he began his labouring career in a quarry looking out upon the Cromarty Frith . This quarry proved one of his best schools . The remarkable geological formations which it displayed awakened his curiosity . The bar of deep-red stone beneath , and the bar of pale-red clay above , were noted by the young quarryman , who even in such unpromising subjects found matter for observation and reflection . Where other men saw nothing , he detected analogies , differences , and peculiarities , which set him a-thinking . He simply kept his eyes and his mind open ; was sober , diligent , and persevering ; and this was the secret of his intellectual growth . His curiosity was excited and kept alive by the curious organic remains , principally of old and extinct species of fishes , ferns , and ammonites , which were revealed along the coast by the washings of the waves , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He never lost sight of the subject ; but went on accumulating observations and comparing formations , until at length , many years afterwards , when no longer a working mason , he gave to the world his highly interesting work on the Old Red Sandstone , which at once established his reputation as a scientific geologist . But this work was the fruit of long years of patient observation and research . As he modestly states in his autobiography , " the only merit to which I lay claim in the case is that of patient research -- a merit in which whoever wills may rival or surpass me ; and this humble faculty of patience , when rightly developed , may lead to more extraordinary developments of idea than even genius itself . " The late John Brown , the eminent English geologist , was , like Miller , a stonemason in his early life , serving an apprenticeship to the trade at Colchester , and afterwards working as a journeyman mason at Norwich . He began business as a builder on his own account at Colchester , where by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while working at his trade that his attention was first drawn to the study of fossils and shells ; and he proceeded to make a collection of them , which afterwards grew into one of the finest in England . His researches along the coasts of Essex , Kent , and Sussex brought to light some magnificent remains of the elephant and rhinoceros , the most valuable of which were presented by him to the British Museum . During the last few years of his life he devoted considerable attention to the study of the Foraminifera in chalk , respecting which he made several interesting discoveries . His life was useful , happy , and honoured ; and he died at Stanway , in Essex , in November 1859 , at the ripe age of eighty years . Not long ago , Sir Roderick Murchison discovered at Thurso , in the far north of Scotland , a profound geologist , in the person of a baker there , named Robert Dick . When Sir Roderick called upon him at the bakehouse in which he baked and earned his bread , Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board , the geographical features and geological phenomena of his native county , pointing out the imperfections in the existing maps , which he had ascertained by travelling over the country in his leisure hours . On further inquiry , Sir Roderick ascertained that the humble individual before him was not only a capital baker and geologist , but a first-rate botanist . " I found , " said the President of the Geographical Society , " to my great humiliation that the baker knew infinitely more of botanical science , ay , ten times more , than I did ; and that there were only some twenty or thirty specimens of flowers which he had not collected . Some he had obtained as presents , some he had purchased , but the greater portion had been accumulated by his industry , in his native county of Caithness ; and the specimens were all arranged in the most beautiful order , with their scientific names affixed . " Sir Roderick Murchison himself is an illustrious follower of these and kindred branches of science . A writer in the ' Quarterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who , having passed the early part of his life as a soldier , never having had the advantage , or disadvantage as the case might have been , of a scientific training , instead of remaining a fox-hunting country gentleman , has succeeded by his own native vigour and sagacity , untiring industry and zeal , in making for himself a scientific reputation that is as wide as it is likely to be lasting . He took first of all an unexplored and difficult district at home , and , by the labour of many years , examined its rock-formations , classed them in natural groups , assigned to each its characteristic assemblage of fossils , and was the first to decipher two great chapters in the world 's geological history , which must always henceforth carry his name on their title-page . Not only so , but he applied the knowledge thus acquired to the dissection of large districts , both at home and abroad , so as to become the geological discoverer of great countries which had formerly been ' terrae incognitae . ' " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefatigable labours in many branches of knowledge have contributed to render him among the most accomplished and complete of scientific men . CHAPTER VI  --  WORKERS IN ART " If what shone afar so grand , Turn to nothing in thy hand , On again ; the virtue lies In struggle , not the prize . "  --  R. M. Milnes . " Excelle , et tu vivras. "  --  Joubert . Excellence in art , as in everything else , can only be achieved by dint of painstaking labour . There is nothing less accidental than the painting of a fine picture or the chiselling of a noble statue . Every skilled touch of the artist 's brush or chisel , though guided by genius , is the product of unremitting study . Sir Joshua Reynolds was such a believer in the force of industry , that he held that artistic excellence , " however expressed by genius , taste , or the gift of heaven , may be acquired . " Writing to Barry he said , " Whoever is resolved to excel in painting , or indeed any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon that one object from the moment that he rises till he goes to bed . " And on another occasion he said , " Those who are resolved to excel must go to their work , willing or unwilling , morning , noon , and night : they will find it no play , but very hard labour . " But although diligent application is no doubt absolutely necessary for the achievement of the highest distinction in art , it is equally true that without the inborn genius , no amount of mere industry , however well applied , will make an artist . The gift comes by nature , but is perfected by self-culture , which is of more avail than all the imparted education of the schools . Some of the greatest artists have had to force their way upward in the face of poverty and manifold obstructions . Illustrious instances will at once flash upon the reader 's mind . Claude Lorraine , the pastrycook ; Tintoretto , the dyer ; the two Caravaggios , the one a colour-grinder , the other a mortar-carrier at the Vatican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the peasant boy ; Zingaro , the gipsy ; Cavedone , turned out of doors to beg by his father ; Canova , the stone-cutter ; these , and many other well-known artists , succeeded in achieving distinction by severe study and labour , under circumstances the most adverse . Nor have the most distinguished artists of our own country been born in a position of life more than ordinarily favourable to the culture of artistic genius . Gainsborough and Bacon were the sons of cloth-workers ; Barry was an Irish sailor boy , and Maclise a banker 's apprentice at Cork ; Opie and Romney , like Inigo Jones , were carpenters ; West was the son of a small Quaker farmer in Pennsylvania ; Northcote was a watchmaker , Jackson a tailor , and Etty a printer ; Reynolds , Wilson , and Wilkie , were the sons of clergymen ; Lawrence was the son of a publican , and Turner of a barber . Several of our painters , it is true , originally had some connection with art , though in a very humble way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Bird , who ornamented tea-trays ; Martin , who was a coach-painter ; Wright and Gilpin , who were ship-painters ; Chantrey , who was a carver and gilder ; and David Cox , Stanfield , and Roberts , who were scene-painters . It was not by luck or accident that these men achieved distinction , but by sheer industry and hard work . Though some achieved wealth , yet this was rarely , if ever , the ruling motive . Indeed , no mere love of money could sustain the efforts of the artist in his early career of self-denial and application . The pleasure of the pursuit has always been its best reward ; the wealth which followed but an accident . Many noble-minded artists have preferred following the bent of their genius , to chaffering with the public for terms . Spagnoletto verified in his life the beautiful fiction of Xenophon , and after he had acquired the means of luxury , preferred withdrawing himself from their influence , and voluntarily returned to poverty and labour . When Michael Angelo was asked his opinion respecting a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit , he said , " I think that he will be a poor fellow so long as he shows such an extreme eagerness to become rich . " Like Sir Joshua Reynolds , Michael Angelo was a great believer in the force of labour ; and he held that there was nothing which the imagination conceived , that could not be embodied in marble , if the hand were made vigorously to obey the mind . He was himself one of the most indefatigable of workers ; and he attributed his power of studying for a greater number of hours than most of his contemporaries , to his spare habits of living . A little bread and wine was all he required for the chief part of the day when employed at his work ; and very frequently he rose in the middle of the night to resume his labours . On these occasions , it was his practice to fix the candle , by the light of which he chiselled , on the summit of a paste-board cap which he wore . Sometimes he was too wearied to undress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring to his work so soon as refreshed by sleep . He had a favourite device of an old man in a go-cart , with an hour-glass upon it bearing the inscription , Ancora imparo ! Still I am learning . Titian , also , was an indefatigable worker . His celebrated " Pietro Martire " was eight years in hand , and his " Last Supper " seven . In his letter to Charles V. he said , " I send your Majesty the ' Last Supper ' after working at it almost daily for seven years  --  dopo sette anni lavorandovi quasi continuamente . " Few think of the patient labour and long training involved in the greatest works of the artist . They seem easy and quickly accomplished , yet with how great difficulty has this ease been acquired . " You charge me fifty sequins , " said the Venetian nobleman to the sculptor , " for a bust that cost you only ten days ' labour . " " You forget , " said the artist , " that I have been thirty years learning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Domenichino was blamed for his slowness in finishing a picture which was bespoken , he made answer , " I am continually painting it within myself . " It was eminently characteristic of the industry of the late Sir Augustus Callcott , that he made not fewer than forty separate sketches in the composition of his famous picture of " Rochester . " This constant repetition is one of the main conditions of success in art , as in life itself . No matter how generous nature has been in bestowing the gift of genius , the pursuit of art is nevertheless a long and continuous labour . Many artists have been precocious , but without diligence their precocity would have come to nothing . The anecdote related of West is well known . When only seven years old , struck with the beauty of the sleeping infant of his eldest sister whilst watching by its cradle , he ran to seek some paper and forthwith drew its portrait in red and black ink . The little incident revealed the artist in him , and it was found impossible to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater painter , had he not been injured by too early success : his fame , though great , was not purchased by study , trials , and difficulties , and it has not been enduring . Richard Wilson , when a mere child , indulged himself with tracing figures of men and animals on the walls of his father 's house , with a burnt stick . He first directed his attention to portrait painting ; but when in Italy , calling one day at the house of Zucarelli , and growing weary with waiting , he began painting the scene on which his friend 's chamber window looked . When Zucarelli arrived , he was so charmed with the picture , that he asked if Wilson had not studied landscape , to which he replied that he had not . " Then , I advise you , " said the other , " to try ; for you are sure of great success . " Wilson adopted the advice , studied and worked hard , and became our first great English landscape painter . Sir Joshua Reynolds , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in drawing , for which his father was accustomed to rebuke him . The boy was destined for the profession of physic , but his strong instinct for art could not be repressed , and he became a painter . Gainsborough went sketching , when a schoolboy , in the woods of Sudbury ; and at twelve he was a confirmed artist : he was a keen observer and a hard worker ,  --  no picturesque feature of any scene he had once looked upon , escaping his diligent pencil . William Blake , a hosier 's son , employed himself in drawing designs on the backs of his father 's shop-bills , and making sketches on the counter . Edward Bird , when a child only three or four years old , would mount a chair and draw figures on the walls , which he called French and English soldiers . A box of colours was purchased for him , and his father , desirous of turning his love of art to account , put him apprentice to a maker of tea-trays ! Out of this trade he gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank of a Royal Academician . Hogarth , though a very dull boy at his lessons , took pleasure in making drawings of the letters of the alphabet , and his school exercises were more remarkable for the ornaments with which he embellished them , than for the matter of the exercises themselves . In the latter respect he was beaten by all the blockheads of the school , but in his adornments he stood alone . His father put him apprentice to a silversmith , where he learnt to draw , and also to engrave spoons and forks with crests and ciphers . From silver-chasing , he went on to teach himself engraving on copper , principally griffins and monsters of heraldry , in the course of which practice he became ambitious to delineate the varieties of human character . The singular excellence which he reached in this art , was mainly the result of careful observation and study . He had the gift , which he sedulously cultivated , of committing to memory the precise features of any remarkable face , and afterwards reproducing them on paper ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way , he would make a sketch of it on the spot , upon his thumb-nail , and carry it home to expand at his leisure . Everything fantastical and original had a powerful attraction for him , and he wandered into many out-of-the-way places for the purpose of meeting with character . By this careful storing of his mind , he was afterwards enabled to crowd an immense amount of thought and treasured observation into his works . Hence it is that Hogarth 's pictures are so truthful a memorial of the character , the manners , and even the very thoughts of the times in which he lived . True painting , he himself observed , can only be learnt in one school , and that is kept by Nature . But he was not a highly cultivated man , except in his own walk . His school education had been of the slenderest kind , scarcely even perfecting him in the art of spelling ; his self-culture did the rest . For a long time he was in very straitened circumstances , but nevertheless worked on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrived to live within his small means , and he boasted , with becoming pride , that he was " a punctual paymaster . " When he had conquered all his difficulties and become a famous and thriving man , he loved to dwell upon his early labours and privations , and to fight over again the battle which ended so honourably to him as a man and so gloriously as an artist . " I remember the time , " said he on one occasion , " when I have gone moping into the city with scarce a shilling , but as soon as I have received ten guineas there for a plate , I have returned home , put on my sword , and sallied out with all the confidence of a man who had thousands in his pockets . " " Industry and perseverance " was the motto of the sculptor Banks , which he acted on himself , and strongly recommended to others . His well-known kindness induced many aspiring youths to call upon him and ask for his advice and assistance ; and it is related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him with this object , but the servant , angry at the loud knock he had given , scolded him , and was about sending him away , when Banks overhearing her , himself went out . The little boy stood at the door with some drawings in his hand . " What do you want with me ? " asked the sculptor . " I want , sir , if you please , to be admitted to draw at the Academy . " Banks explained that he himself could not procure his admission , but he asked to look at the boy 's drawings . Examining them , he said , " Time enough for the Academy , my little man ! go home  --  mind your schooling  --  try to make a better drawing of the Apollo  --  and in a month come again and let me see it . " The boy went home  --  sketched and worked with redoubled diligence  --  and , at the end of the month , called again on the sculptor . The drawing was better ; but again Banks sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a week the boy was again at his door , his drawing much improved ; and Banks bid him be of good cheer , for if spared he would distinguish himself . The boy was Mulready ; and the sculptor 's augury was amply fulfilled . The fame of Claude Lorraine is partly explained by his indefatigable industry . Born at Champagne , in Lorraine , of poor parents , he was first apprenticed to a pastrycook . His brother , who was a wood-carver , afterwards took him into his shop to learn that trade . Having there shown indications of artistic skill , a travelling dealer persuaded the brother to allow Claude to accompany him to Italy . He assented , and the young man reached Rome , where he was shortly after engaged by Agostino Tassi , the landscape painter , as his house-servant . In that capacity Claude first learnt landscape painting , and in course of time he began to produce pictures . We next find him making the tour of Italy , France , and Germany , occasionally resting by the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to Rome he found an increasing demand for his works , and his reputation at length became European . He was unwearied in the study of nature in her various aspects . It was his practice to spend a great part of his time in closely copying buildings , bits of ground , trees , leaves , and such like , which he finished in detail , keeping the drawings by him in store for the purpose of introducing them in his studied landscapes . He also gave close attention to the sky , watching it for whole days from morning till night , and noting the various changes occasioned by the passing clouds and the increasing and waning light . By this constant practice he acquired , although it is said very slowly , such a mastery of hand and eye as eventually secured for him the first rank among landscape painters . Turner , who has been styled " the English Claude , " pursued a career of like laborious industry . He was destined by his father for his own trade of a barber , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the boy had made of a coat of arms on a silver salver having attracted the notice of a customer whom his father was shaving , the latter was urged to allow his son to follow his bias , and he was eventually permitted to follow art as a profession . Like all young artists , Turner had many difficulties to encounter , and they were all the greater that his circumstances were so straitened . But he was always willing to work , and to take pains with his work , no matter how humble it might be . He was glad to hire himself out at half-a-crown a night to wash in skies in Indian ink upon other people 's drawings , getting his supper into the bargain . Thus he earned money and acquired expertness . Then he took to illustrating guide-books , almanacs , and any sort of books that wanted cheap frontispieces . " What could I have done better ? " said he afterwards ; " it was first-rate practice . " He did everything carefully and conscientiously , never slurring over his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning as well as living ; always doing his best , and never leaving a drawing without having made a step in advance upon his previous work . A man who thus laboured was sure to do much ; and his growth in power and grasp of thought was , to use Ruskin 's words , " as steady as the increasing light of sunrise . " But Turner 's genius needs no panegyric ; his best monument is the noble gallery of pictures bequeathed by him to the nation , which will ever be the most lasting memorial of his fame . To reach Rome , the capital of the fine arts , is usually the highest ambition of the art student . But the journey to Rome is costly , and the student is often poor . With a will resolute to overcome difficulties , Rome may however at last be reached . Thus Francois Perrier , an early French painter , in his eager desire to visit the Eternal City , consented to act as guide to a blind vagrant . After long wanderings he reached the Vatican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed by Jacques Callot in his determination to visit Rome . Though opposed by his father in his wish to be an artist , the boy would not be baulked , but fled from home to make his way to Italy . Having set out without means , he was soon reduced to great straits ; but falling in with a band of gipsies , he joined their company , and wandered about with them from one fair to another , sharing in their numerous adventures . During this remarkable journey Callot picked up much of that extraordinary knowledge of figure , feature , and character which he afterwards reproduced , sometimes in such exaggerated forms , in his wonderful engravings . When Callot at length reached Florence , a gentleman , pleased with his ingenious ardour , placed him with an artist to study ; but he was not satisfied to stop short of Rome , and we find him shortly on his way thither . At Rome he made the acquaintance of Porigi and Thomassin , who , on seeing his crayon sketches , predicted for him a brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's family having accidentally encountered him , took steps to compel the fugitive to return home . By this time he had acquired such a love of wandering that he could not rest ; so he ran away a second time , and a second time he was brought back by his elder brother , who caught him at Turin . At last the father , seeing resistance was in vain , gave his reluctant consent to Callot 's prosecuting his studies at Rome . Thither he went accordingly ; and this time he remained , diligently studying design and engraving for several years , under competent masters . On his way back to France , he was encouraged by Cosmo II . to remain at Florence , where he studied and worked for several years more . On the death of his patron he returned to his family at Nancy , where , by the use of his burin and needle , he shortly acquired both wealth and fame . When Nancy was taken by siege during the civil wars , Callot was requested by Richelieu to make a design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not commemorate the disaster which had befallen his native place , and he refused point-blank . Richelieu could not shake his resolution , and threw him into prison . There Callot met with some of his old friends the gipsies , who had relieved his wants on his first journey to Rome . When Louis XIII . heard of his imprisonment , he not only released him , but offered to grant him any favour he might ask . Callot immediately requested that his old companions , the gipsies , might be set free and permitted to beg in Paris without molestation . This odd request was granted on condition that Callot should engrave their portraits , and hence his curious book of engravings entitled " The Beggars . " Louis is said to have offered Callot a pension of 3000 livres provided he would not leave Paris ; but the artist was now too much of a Bohemian , and prized his liberty too highly to permit him to accept it ; and he returned to Nancy , where he worked till his death . His industry may be inferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he left not fewer than 1600 . He was especially fond of grotesque subjects , which he treated with great skill ; his free etchings , touched with the graver , being executed with especial delicacy and wonderful minuteness . Still more romantic and adventurous was the career of Benvenuto Cellini , the marvellous gold worker , painter , sculptor , engraver , engineer , and author . His life , as told by himself , is one of the most extraordinary autobiographies ever written . Giovanni Cellini , his father , was one of the Court musicians to Lorenzo de Medici at Florence ; and his highest ambition concerning his son Benvenuto was that he should become an expert player on the flute . But Giovanni having lost his appointment , found it necessary to send his son to learn some trade , and he was apprenticed to a goldsmith . The boy had already displayed a love of drawing and of art ; and , applying himself to his business , he soon became a dexterous workman . Having got mixed up in a quarrel with some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during which period he worked with a goldsmith at Sienna , gaining further experience in jewellery and gold-working . His father still insisting on his becoming a flute-player , Benvenuto continued to practise on the instrument , though he detested it . His chief pleasure was in art , which he pursued with enthusiasm . Returning to Florence , he carefully studied the designs of Leonardo da Vinci and Michael Angelo ; and , still further to improve himself in gold-working , he went on foot to Rome , where he met with a variety of adventures . He returned to Florence with the reputation of being a most expert worker in the precious metals , and his skill was soon in great request . But being of an irascible temper , he was constantly getting into scrapes , and was frequently under the necessity of flying for his life . Thus he fled from Florence in the disguise of a friar , again taking refuge at Sienna , and afterwards at Rome . During his second residence in Rome , Cellini met with extensive patronage , and he was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goldsmith and musician . He was constantly studying and improving himself by acquaintance with the works of the best masters . He mounted jewels , finished enamels , engraved seals , and designed and executed works in gold , silver , and bronze , in such a style as to excel all other artists . Whenever he heard of a goldsmith who was famous in any particular branch , he immediately determined to surpass him . Thus it was that he rivalled the medals of one , the enamels of another , and the jewellery of a third ; in fact , there was not a branch of his business that he did not feel impelled to excel in . Working in this spirit , it is not so wonderful that Cellini should have been able to accomplish so much . He was a man of indefatigable activity , and was constantly on the move . At one time we find him at Florence , at another at Rome ; then he is at Mantua , at Rome , at Naples , and back to Florence again ; then at Venice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on horseback . He could not carry much luggage with him ; so , wherever he went , he usually began by making his own tools . He not only designed his works , but executed them himself ,  --  hammered and carved , and cast and shaped them with his own hands . Indeed , his works have the impress of genius so clearly stamped upon them , that they could never have been designed by one person , and executed by another . The humblest article  --  a buckle for a lady 's girdle , a seal , a locket , a brooch , a ring , or a button  --  became in his hands a beautiful work of art . Cellini was remarkable for his readiness and dexterity in handicraft . One day a surgeon entered the shop of Raffaello del Moro , the goldsmith , to perform an operation on his daughter 's hand . On looking at the surgeon 's instruments , Cellini , who was present , found them rude and clumsy , as they usually were in those days , and he asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of an hour . He then ran to his shop , and taking a piece of the finest steel , wrought out of it a beautifully finished knife , with which the operation was successfully performed . Among the statues executed by Cellini , the most important are the silver figure of Jupiter , executed at Paris for Francis I. , and the Perseus , executed in bronze for the Grand Duke Cosmo of Florence . He also executed statues in marble of Apollo , Hyacinthus , Narcissus , and Neptune . The extraordinary incidents connected with the casting of the Perseus were peculiarly illustrative of the remarkable character of the man . The Grand Duke having expressed a decided opinion that the model , when shown to him in wax , could not possibly be cast in bronze , Cellini was immediately stimulated by the predicted impossibility , not only to attempt , but to do it . He first made the clay model , baked it , and covered it with wax , which he shaped into the perfect form of a statue . Then coating the wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering , during which the wax dissolved and escaped , leaving the space between the two layers for the reception of the metal . To avoid disturbance , the latter process was conducted in a pit dug immediately under the furnace , from which the liquid metal was to be introduced by pipes and apertures into the mould prepared for it . Cellini had purchased and laid in several loads of pine-wood , in anticipation of the process of casting , which now began . The furnace was filled with pieces of brass and bronze , and the fire was lit . The resinous pine-wood was soon in such a furious blaze , that the shop took fire , and part of the roof was burnt ; while at the same time the wind blowing and the rain filling on the furnace , kept down the heat , and prevented the metals from melting . For hours Cellini struggled to keep up the heat , continually throwing in more wood , until at length he became so exhausted and ill , that he feared he should die before the statue could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistants the pouring in of the metal when melted , and betook himself to his bed . While those about him were condoling with him in his distress , a workman suddenly entered the room , lamenting that " Poor Benvenuto 's work was irretrievably spoiled ! " On hearing this , Cellini immediately sprang from his bed and rushed to the workshop , where he found the fire so much gone down that the metal had again become hard . Sending across to a neighbour for a load of young oak which had been more than a year in drying , he soon had the fire blazing again and the metal melting and glittering . The wind was , however , still blowing with fury , and the rain falling heavily ; so , to protect himself , Cellini had some tables with pieces of tapestry and old clothes brought to him , behind which he went on hurling the wood into the furnace . A mass of pewter was thrown in upon the other metal , and by stirring , sometimes with iron and sometimes with long poles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the trying moment was close at hand , a terrible noise as of a thunderbolt was heard , and a glittering of fire flashed before Cellini 's eyes . The cover of the furnace had burst , and the metal began to flow ! Finding that it did not run with the proper velocity , Cellini rushed into the kitchen , bore away every piece of copper and pewter that it contained  --  some two hundred porringers , dishes , and kettles of different kinds  --  and threw them into the furnace . Then at length the metal flowed freely , and thus the splendid statue of Perseus was cast . The divine fury of genius in which Cellini rushed to his kitchen and stripped it of its utensils for the purposes of his furnace , will remind the reader of the like act of Pallissy in breaking up his furniture for the purpose of baking his earthenware . Excepting , however , in their enthusiasm , no two men could be less alike in character . Cellini was an Ishmael against whom , according to his own account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his extraordinary skill as a workman , and his genius as an artist , there can not be two opinions . Much less turbulent was the career of Nicolas Poussin , a man as pure and elevated in his ideas of art as he was in his daily life , and distinguished alike for his vigour of intellect , his rectitude of character , and his noble simplicity . He was born in a very humble station , at Andeleys , near Rouen , where his father kept a small school . The boy had the benefit of his parent 's instruction , such as it was , but of that he is said to have been somewhat negligent , preferring to spend his time in covering his lesson-books and his slate with drawings . A country painter , much pleased with his sketches , besought his parents not to thwart him in his tastes . The painter agreed to give Poussin lessons , and he soon made such progress that his master had nothing more to teach him . Becoming restless , and desirous of further improving himself , Poussin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , painting signboards on his way for a maintenance . At Paris a new world of art opened before him , exciting his wonder and stimulating his emulation . He worked diligently in many studios , drawing , copying , and painting pictures . After a time , he resolved , if possible , to visit Rome , and set out on his journey ; but he only succeeded in getting as far as Florence , and again returned to Paris . A second attempt which he made to reach Rome was even less successful ; for this time he only got as far as Lyons . He was , nevertheless , careful to take advantage of all opportunities for improvement which came in his way , and continued as sedulous as before in studying and working . Thus twelve years passed , years of obscurity and toil , of failures and disappointments , and probably of privations . At length Poussin succeeded in reaching Rome . There he diligently studied the old masters , and especially the ancient statues , with whose perfection he was greatly impressed . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor as himself , and assisted him in modelling figures after the antique . With him he carefully measured some of the most celebrated statues in Rome , more particularly the ' Antinous : ' and it is supposed that this practice exercised considerable influence on the formation of his future style . At the same time he studied anatomy , practised drawing from the life , and made a great store of sketches of postures and attitudes of people whom he met , carefully reading at his leisure such standard books on art as he could borrow from his friends . During all this time he remained very poor , satisfied to be continually improving himself . He was glad to sell his pictures for whatever they would bring . One , of a prophet , he sold for eight livres ; and another , the ' Plague of the Philistines , ' he sold for 60 crowns  --  a picture afterwards bought by Cardinal de Richelieu for a thousand . To add to his troubles , he was stricken by a cruel malady , during the helplessness occasioned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this gentleman Poussin afterwards painted the ' Rest in the Desert , ' a fine picture , which far more than repaid the advances made during his illness . The brave man went on toiling and learning through suffering . Still aiming at higher things , he went to Florence and Venice , enlarging the range of his studies . The fruits of his conscientious labour at length appeared in the series of great pictures which he now began to produce ,  --  his ' Death of Germanicus , ' followed by ' Extreme Unction , ' the ' Testament of Eudamidas , ' the ' Manna , ' and the ' Abduction of the Sabines . ' The reputation of Poussin , however , grew but slowly . He was of a retiring disposition and shunned society . People gave him credit for being a thinker much more than a painter . When not actually employed in painting , he took long solitary walks in the country , meditating the designs of future pictures . One of his few friends while at Rome was Claude Lorraine , with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of La Trinite-du-Mont , conversing about art and antiquarianism . The monotony and the quiet of Rome were suited to his taste , and , provided he could earn a moderate living by his brush , he had no wish to leave it . But his fame now extended beyond Rome , and repeated invitations were sent him to return to Paris . He was offered the appointment of principal painter to the King . At first he hesitated ; quoted the Italian proverb , Chi sta bene non si muove ; said he had lived fifteen years in Rome , married a wife there , and looked forward to dying and being buried there . Urged again , he consented , and returned to Paris . But his appearance there awakened much professional jealousy , and he soon wished himself back in Rome again . While in Paris he painted some of his greatest works  --  his ' Saint Xavier , ' the ' Baptism , ' and the ' Last Supper . ' He was kept constantly at work . At first he did whatever he was asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more particularly a Bible and a Virgil , cartoons for the Louvre , and designs for tapestry ; but at length he expostulated : - " It is impossible for me , " he said to M. de Chanteloup , " to work at the same time at frontispieces for books , at a Virgin , at a picture of the Congregation of St. Louis , at the various designs for the gallery , and , finally , at designs for the royal tapestry . I have only one pair of hands and a feeble head , and can neither be helped nor can my labours be lightened by another . " Annoyed by the enemies his success had provoked and whom he was unable to conciliate , he determined , at the end of less than two years ' labour in Paris , to return to Rome . Again settled there in his humble dwelling on Mont Pincio , he employed himself diligently in the practice of his art during the remaining years of his life , living in great simplicity and privacy . Though suffering much from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always striving after excellence . " In growing old , " he said , " I feel myself becoming more and more inflamed with the desire of surpassing myself and reaching the highest degree of perfection . " Thus toiling , struggling , and suffering , Poussin spent his later years . He had no children ; his wife died before him ; all his friends were gone : so that in his old age he was left absolutely alone in Rome , so full of tombs , and died there in 1665 , bequeathing to his relatives at Andeleys the savings of his life , amounting to about 1000 crowns ; and leaving behind him , as a legacy to his race , the great works of his genius . The career of Ary Scheffer furnishes one of the best examples in modern times of a like high-minded devotion to art . Born at Dordrecht , the son of a German artist , he early manifested an aptitude for drawing and painting , which his parents encouraged . His father dying while he was still young , his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the family to Paris , in order that her son might obtain the best opportunities for instruction . There young Scheffer was placed with Guerin the painter . But his mother 's means were too limited to permit him to devote himself exclusively to study . She had sold the few jewels she possessed , and refused herself every indulgence , in order to forward the instruction of her other children . Under such circumstances , it was natural that Ary should wish to help her ; and by the time he was eighteen years of age he began to paint small pictures of simple subjects , which met with a ready sale at moderate prices . He also practised portrait painting , at the same time gathering experience and earning honest money . He gradually improved in drawing , colouring , and composition . The ' Baptism ' marked a new epoch in his career , and from that point he went on advancing , until his fame culminated in his pictures illustrative of ' Faust , ' his ' Francisca de Rimini , ' ' Christ the Consoler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monica and St. Augustin , ' and many other noble works . " The amount of labour , thought , and attention , " says Mrs. Grote , " which Scheffer brought to the production of the ' Francisca , ' must have been enormous . In truth , his technical education having been so imperfect , he was forced to climb the steep of art by drawing upon his own resources , and thus , whilst his hand was at work , his mind was engaged in meditation . He had to try various processes of handling , and experiments in colouring ; to paint and repaint , with tedious and unremitting assiduity . But Nature had endowed him with that which proved in some sort an equivalent for shortcomings of a professional kind . His own elevation of character , and his profound sensibility , aided him in acting upon the feelings of others through the medium of the pencil . " 21 One of the artists whom Scheffer most admired was Flaxman ; and he once said to a friend , " If I have unconsciously borrowed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' it must have been from something I had seen among Flaxman 's drawings . " John Flaxman was the son of a humble seller of plaster casts in New Street , Covent Garden . When a child , he was such an invalid that it was his custom to sit behind his father 's shop counter propped by pillows , amusing himself with drawing and reading . A benevolent clergyman , the Rev. Mr. Matthews , calling at the shop one day , saw the boy trying to read a book , and on inquiring what it was , found it to be a Cornelius Nepos , which his father had picked up for a few pence at a bookstall . The gentleman , after some conversation with the boy , said that was not the proper book for him to read , but that he would bring him one . The next day he called with translations of Homer and ' Don Quixote , ' which the boy proceeded to read with great avidity . His mind was soon filled with the heroism which breathed through the pages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Achilleses about him , ranged along the shop shelves , the ambition took possession of him , that he too would design and embody in poetic forms those majestic heroes . Like all youthful efforts , his first designs were crude . The proud father one day showed some of them to Roubilliac the sculptor , who turned from them with a contemptuous " pshaw ! " But the boy had the right stuff in him ; he had industry and patience ; and he continued to labour incessantly at his books and drawings . He then tried his young powers in modelling figures in plaster of Paris , wax , and clay . Some of these early works are still preserved , not because of their merit , but because they are curious as the first healthy efforts of patient genius . It was long before the boy could walk , and he only learnt to do so by hobbling along upon crutches . At length he became strong enough to walk without them . The kind Mr. Matthews invited him to his house , where his wife explained Homer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his self-culture  --  giving him lessons in Greek and Latin , the study of which he prosecuted at home . By dint of patience and perseverance , his drawing improved so much that he obtained a commission from a lady , to execute six original drawings in black chalk of subjects in Homer . His first commission ! What an event in the artist 's life ! A surgeon 's first fee , a lawyer 's first retainer , a legislator 's first speech , a singer 's first appearance behind the foot-lights , an author 's first book , are not any of them more full of interest to the aspirant for fame than the artist 's first commission . The boy at once proceeded to execute the order , and he was both well praised and well paid for his work . At fifteen Flaxman entered a pupil at the Royal Academy . Notwithstanding his retiring disposition , he soon became known among the students , and great things were expected of him . Nor were their expectations disappointed : in his fifteenth year he gained the silver prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold one . Everybody prophesied that he would carry off the medal , for there was none who surpassed him in ability and industry . Yet he lost it , and the gold medal was adjudged to a pupil who was not afterwards heard of . This failure on the part of the youth was really of service to him ; for defeats do not long cast down the resolute-hearted , but only serve to call forth their real powers . " Give me time , " said he to his father , " and I will yet produce works that the Academy will be proud to recognise . " He redoubled his efforts , spared no pains , designed and modelled incessantly , and made steady if not rapid progress . But meanwhile poverty threatened his father 's household ; the plaster-cast trade yielded a very bare living ; and young Flaxman , with resolute self-denial , curtailed his hours of study , and devoted himself to helping his father in the humble details of his business . He laid aside his Homer to take up the plaster-trowel . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade so that his father 's family might be supported , and the wolf kept from the door . To this drudgery of his art he served a long apprenticeship ; but it did him good . It familiarised him with steady work , and cultivated in him the spirit of patience . The discipline may have been hard , but it was wholesome . Happily , young Flaxman 's skill in design had reached the knowledge of Josiah Wedgwood , who sought him out for the purpose of employing him to design improved patterns of china and earthenware . It may seem a humble department of art for such a genius as Flaxman to work in ; but it really was not so . An artist may be labouring truly in his vocation while designing a common teapot or water-jug . Articles in daily use amongst the people , which are before their eyes at every meal , may be made the vehicles of education to all , and minister to their highest culture . The most ambitious artist way thus confer a greater practical benefit on his countrymen than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of pounds to be placed in some wealthy man 's gallery where it is hidden away from public sight . Before Wedgwood 's time the designs which figured upon our china and stoneware were hideous both in drawing and execution , and he determined to improve both . Flaxman did his best to carry out the manufacturer 's views . He supplied him from time to time with models and designs of various pieces of earthenware , the subjects of which were principally from ancient verse and history . Many of them are still in existence , and some are equal in beauty and simplicity to his after designs for marble . The celebrated Etruscan vases , specimens of which were to be found in public museums and in the cabinets of the curious , furnished him with the best examples of form , and these he embellished with his own elegant devices . Stuart 's ' Athens , ' then recently published , furnished him with specimens of the purest-shaped Greek utensils ; of these he adopted the best , and worked them into new shapes of elegance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great work  --  no less than the promotion of popular education ; and he was proud , in after life , to allude to his early labours in this walk , by which he was enabled at the same time to cultivate his love of the beautiful , to diffuse a taste for art among the people , and to replenish his own purse , while he promoted the prosperity of his friend and benefactor . At length , in the year 1782 , when twenty-seven years of age , he quitted his father 's roof and rented a small house and studio in Wardour Street , Soho ; and what was more , he married  --  Ann Denman was the name of his wife  --  and a cheerful , bright-souled , noble woman she was . He believed that in marrying her he should be able to work with an intenser spirit ; for , like him , she had a taste for poetry and art ; and besides was an enthusiastic admirer of her husband 's genius . Yet when Sir Joshua Reynolds  --  himself a bachelor  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " So , Flaxman , I am told you are married ; if so , sir , I tell you you are ruined for an artist . " Flaxman went straight home , sat down beside his wife , took her hand in his , and said , " Ann , I am ruined for an artist . " " How so , John ? How has it happened ? and who has done it ? " " It happened , " he replied , " in the church , and Ann Denman has done it . " He then told her of Sir Joshua 's remark  - -  whose opinion was well known , and had often been expressed , that if students would excel they must bring the whole powers of their mind to bear upon their art , from the moment they rose until they went to bed ; and also , that no man could be a GREAT artist unless he studied the grand works of Raffaelle , Michael Angelo , and others , at Rome and Florence . " And I , " said Flaxman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would be a great artist . " " And a great artist you shall be , " said his wife , " and visit Rome too , if that be really necessary to make you great . " " But how ? " asked Flaxman . " WORK AND ECONOMISE , " rejoined the brave wife ; " I will never have it said that Ann Denman ruined John Flaxman for an artist . " And so it was determined by the pair that the journey to Rome was to be made when their means would admit . " I will go to Rome , " said Flaxman , " and show the President that wedlock is for a man 's good rather than his harm ; and you , Ann , shall accompany me . " Patiently and happily the affectionate couple plodded on during five years in their humble little home in Wardour Street , always with the long journey to Rome before them . It was never lost sight of for a moment , and not a penny was uselessly spent that could be saved towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one about their project ; solicited no aid from the Academy ; but trusted only to their own patient labour and love to pursue and achieve their object . During this time Flaxman exhibited very few works . He could not afford marble to experiment in original designs ; but he obtained frequent commissions for monuments , by the profits of which he maintained himself . He still worked for Wedgwood , who was a prompt paymaster ; and , on the whole , he was thriving , happy , and hopeful . His local respectability was even such as to bring local honours and local work upon him ; for he was elected by the ratepayers to collect the watch-rate for the Parish of St. Anne , when he might be seen going about with an ink-bottle suspended from his button-hole , collecting the money . At length Flaxman and his wife having accumulated a sufficient store of savings , set out for Rome . Arrived there , he applied himself diligently to study , maintaining himself , like other poor artists , by making copies from the antique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it was then that he composed his beautiful designs illustrative of Homer , AEschylus , and Dante . The price paid for them was moderate  --  only fifteen shillings a-piece ; but Flaxman worked for art as well as money ; and the beauty of the designs brought him other friends and patrons . He executed Cupid and Aurora for the munificent Thomas Hope , and the Fury of Athamas for the Earl of Bristol . He then prepared to return to England , his taste improved and cultivated by careful study ; but before he left Italy , the Academies of Florence and Carrara recognised his merit by electing him a member . His fame had preceded him to London , where he soon found abundant employment . While at Rome he had been commissioned to execute his famous monument in memory of Lord Mansfield , and it was erected in the north transept of Westminster Abbey shortly after his return . It stands there in majestic grandeur , a monument to the genius of Flaxman himself  --  calm , simple , and severe . No wonder that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fame , exclaimed when he saw it , " This little man cuts us all out ! " When the members of the Royal Academy heard of Flaxman 's return , and especially when they had an opportunity of seeing and admiring his portrait-statue of Mansfield , they were eager to have him enrolled among their number . He allowed his name to be proposed in the candidates ' list of associates , and was immediately elected . Shortly after , he appeared in an entirely new character . The little boy who had begun his studies behind the plaster-cast-seller 's shop-counter in New Street , Covent Garden , was now a man of high intellect and recognised supremacy in art , to instruct students , in the character of Professor of Sculpture to the Royal Academy ! And no man better deserved to fill that distinguished office ; for none is so able to instruct others as he who , for himself and by his own efforts , has learnt to grapple with and overcome difficulties . After a long , peaceful , and happy life , Flaxman found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of his affectionate wife Ann , was a severe shock to him ; but he survived her several years , during which he executed his celebrated " Shield of Achilles , " and his noble " Archangel Michael vanquishing Satan , " - - perhaps his two greatest works . Chantrey was a more robust man ;  --  somewhat rough , but hearty in his demeanour ; proud of his successful struggle with the difficulties which beset him in early life ; and , above all , proud of his independence . He was born a poor man 's child , at Norton , near Sheffield . His father dying when he was a mere boy , his mother married again . Young Chantrey used to drive an ass laden with milk-cans across its back into the neighbouring town of Sheffield , and there serve his mother 's customers with milk . Such was the humble beginning of his industrial career ; and it was by his own strength that he rose from that position , and achieved the highest eminence as an artist . Not taking kindly to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first placed with a grocer in Sheffield . The business was very distasteful to him ; but , passing a carver 's shop window one day , his eye was attracted by the glittering articles it contained , and , charmed with the idea of being a carver , he begged to be released from the grocery business with that object . His friends consented , and he was bound apprentice to the carver and gilder for seven years . His new master , besides being a carver in wood , was also a dealer in prints and plaster models ; and Chantrey at once set about imitating both , studying with great industry and energy . All his spare hours were devoted to drawing , modelling , and self-improvement , and he often carried his labours far into the night . Before his apprenticeship was out  --  at the ace of twenty-one  --  he paid over to his master the whole wealth which he was able to muster  --  a sum of 50l.  --  to cancel his indentures , determined to devote himself to the career of an artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , and with characteristic good sense , sought employment as an assistant carver , studying painting and modelling at his bye-hours . Among the jobs on which he was first employed as a journeyman carver , was the decoration of the dining-room of Mr. Rogers , the poet  --  a room in which he was in after years a welcome visitor ; and he usually took pleasure in pointing out his early handywork to the guests whom he met at his friend 's table . Returning to Sheffield on a professional visit , he advertised himself in the local papers as a painter of portraits in crayons and miniatures , and also in oil . For his first crayon portrait he was paid a guinea by a cutler ; and for a portrait in oil , a confectioner paid him as much as 5l. and a pair of top boots ! Chantrey was soon in London again to study at the Royal Academy ; and next time he returned to Sheffield he advertised himself as ready to model plaster busts of his townsmen , as well as paint portraits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a deceased vicar of the town , and executed it to the general satisfaction . When in London he used a room over a stable as a studio , and there he modelled his first original work for exhibition . It was a gigantic head of Satan . Towards the close of Chantrey 's life , a friend passing through his studio was struck by this model lying in a corner . " That head , " said the sculptor , " was the first thing that I did after I came to London . I worked at it in a garret with a paper cap on my head ; and as I could then afford only one candle , I stuck that one in my cap that it might move along with me , and give me light whichever way I turned . " Flaxman saw and admired this head at the Academy Exhibition , and recommended Chantrey for the execution of the busts of four admirals , required for the Naval Asylum at Greenwich . This commission led to others , and painting was given up . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his modelling . His famous head of Horne Tooke was such a success that , according to his own account , it brought him commissions amounting to 12,000l . Chantrey had now succeeded , but he had worked hard , and fairly earned his good fortune . He was selected from amongst sixteen competitors to execute the statue of George III . for the city of London . A few years later , he produced the exquisite monument of the Sleeping Children , now in Lichfield Cathedral ,  --  a work of great tenderness and beauty ; and thenceforward his career was one of increasing honour , fame , and prosperity . His patience , industry , and steady perseverance were the means by which he achieved his greatness . Nature endowed him with genius , and his sound sense enabled him to employ the precious gift as a blessing . He was prudent and shrewd , like the men amongst whom he was born ; the pocket-book which accompanied him on his Italian tour containing mingled notes on art , records of daily expenses , and the current prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his finest subjects great by the mere force of simplicity . His statue of Watt , in Handsworth church , seems to us the very consummation of art ; yet it is perfectly artless and simple . His generosity to brother artists in need was splendid , but quiet and unostentatious . He left the principal part of his fortune to the Royal Academy for the promotion of British art . The same honest and persistent industry was throughout distinctive of the career of David Wilkie . The son of a Scotch minister , he gave early indications of an artistic turn ; and though he was a negligent and inapt scholar , he was a sedulous drawer of faces and figures . A silent boy , he already displayed that quiet concentrated energy of character which distinguished him through life . He was always on the look-out for an opportunity to draw ,  - -  and the walls of the manse , or the smooth sand by the river side , were alike convenient for his purpose . Any sort of tool would serve him ; like Giotto , he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any smooth stone , and the subject for a picture in every ragged mendicant he met . When he visited a house , he generally left his mark on the walls as an indication of his presence , sometimes to the disgust of cleanly housewives . In short , notwithstanding the aversion of his father , the minister , to the " sinful " profession of painting , Wilkie 's strong propensity was not to be thwarted , and he became an artist , working his way manfully up the steep of difficulty . Though rejected on his first application as a candidate for admission to the Scottish Academy , at Edinburgh , on account of the rudeness and inaccuracy of his introductory specimens , he persevered in producing better , until he was admitted . But his progress was slow . He applied himself diligently to the drawing of the human figure , and held on with the determination to succeed , as if with a resolute confidence in the result . He displayed none of the eccentric humour and fitful application of many youths who conceive themselves geniuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an extent that he himself was afterwards accustomed to attribute his success to his dogged perseverance rather than to any higher innate power . " The single element , " he said , " in all the progressive movements of my pencil was persevering industry . " At Edinburgh he gained a few premiums , thought of turning his attention to portrait painting , with a view to its higher and more certain remuneration , but eventually went boldly into the line in which he earned his fame ,  - -  and painted his Pitlessie Fair . What was bolder still , he determined to proceed to London , on account of its presenting so much wider a field for study and work ; and the poor Scotch lad arrived in town , and painted his Village Politicians while living in a humble lodging on eighteen shillings a week . Notwithstanding the success of this picture , and the commissions which followed it , Wilkie long continued poor . The prices which his works realized were not great , for he bestowed upon them so much time and labour , that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carefully studied and elaborated beforehand ; nothing was struck off at a heat ; many occupied him for years  --  touching , retouching , and improving them until they finally passed out of his hands . As with Reynolds , his motto was " Work ! work ! work ! " and , like him , he expressed great dislike for talking artists . Talkers may sow , but the silent reap . " Let us be DOING something , " was his oblique mode of rebuking the loquacious and admonishing the idle . He once related to his friend Constable that when he studied at the Scottish Academy , Graham , the master of it , was accustomed to say to the students , in the words of Reynolds , " If you have genius , industry will improve it ; if you have none , industry will supply its place . " " So , " said Wilkie , " I was determined to be very industrious , for I knew I had no genius . " He also told Constable that when Linnell and Burnett , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always contrived to get as close to them as he could to hear all they said , " for , " said he , " they know a great deal , and I know very little . " This was said with perfect sincerity , for Wilkie was habitually modest . One of the first things that he did with the sum of thirty pounds which he obtained from Lord Mansfield for his Village Politicians , was to buy a present  --  of bonnets , shawls , and dresses  --  for his mother and sister at home , though but little able to afford it at the time . Wilkie 's early poverty had trained him in habits of strict economy , which were , however , consistent with a noble liberality , as appears from sundry passages in the Autobiography of Abraham Raimbach the engraver . William Etty was another notable instance of unflagging industry and indomitable perseverance in art . His father was a ginger-bread and spicemaker at York , and his mother  --  a woman of considerable force and originality of character  --  was the daughter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , covering walls , floors , and tables with specimens of his skill ; his first crayon being a farthing 's worth of chalk , and this giving place to a piece of coal or a bit of charred stick . His mother , knowing nothing of art , put the boy apprentice to a trade  --  that of a printer . But in his leisure hours he went on with the practice of drawing ; and when his time was out he determined to follow his bent  --  he would be a painter and nothing else . Fortunately his uncle and elder brother were able and willing to help him on in his new career , and they provided him with the means of entering as pupil at the Royal Academy . We observe , from Leslie 's Autobiography , that Etty was looked upon by his fellow students as a worthy but dull , plodding person , who would never distinguish himself . But he had in him the divine faculty of work , and diligently plodded his way upward to eminence in the highest walks of art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their courage and endurance to the utmost before they succeeded . What number may have sunk under them we can never know . Martin encountered difficulties in the course of his career such as perhaps fall to the lot of few . More than once he found himself on the verge of starvation while engaged on his first great picture . It is related of him that on one occasion he found himself reduced to his last shilling  --  a BRIGHT shilling  --  which he had kept because of its very brightness , but at length he found it necessary to exchange it for bread . He went to a baker 's shop , bought a loaf , and was taking it away , when the baker snatched it from him , and tossed back the shilling to the starving painter . The bright shilling had failed him in his hour of need  --  it was a bad one ! Returning to his lodgings , he rummaged his trunk for some remaining crust to satisfy his hunger . Upheld throughout by the victorious power of enthusiasm , he pursued his design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and to wait ; and when , a few days after , he found an opportunity to exhibit his picture , he was from that time famous . Like many other great artists , his life proves that , in despite of outward circumstances , genius , aided by industry , will be its own protector , and that fame , though she comes late , will never ultimately refuse her favours to real merit The most careful discipline and training after academic methods will fail in making an artist , unless he himself take an active part in the work . Like every highly cultivated man , he must be mainly self-educated . When Pugin , who was brought up in his father 's office , had learnt all that he could learn of architecture according to the usual formulas , he still found that he had learned but little ; and that he must begin at the beginning , and pass through the discipline of labour . Young Pugin accordingly hired himself out as a common carpenter at Covent Garden Theatre  --  first working under the stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thus acquired a familiarity with work , and cultivated an architectural taste , to which the diversity of the mechanical employment about a large operatic establishment is peculiarly favourable . When the theatre closed for the season , he worked a sailing-ship between London and some of the French ports , carrying on at the same time a profitable trade . At every opportunity he would land and make drawings of any old building , and especially of any ecclesiastical structure which fell in his way . Afterwards he would make special journeys to the Continent for the same purpose , and returned home laden with drawings . Thus he plodded and laboured on , making sure of the excellence and distinction which he eventually achieved . A similar illustration of plodding industry in the same walk is presented in the career of George Kemp , the architect of the beautiful Scott Monument at Edinburgh . He was the son of a poor shepherd , who pursued his calling on the southern slope of the Pentland Hills . Amidst that pastoral solitude the boy had no opportunity of enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that in his tenth year he was sent on a message to Roslin , by the farmer for whom his father herded sheep , and the sight of the beautiful castle and chapel there seems to have made a vivid and enduring impression on his mind . Probably to enable him to indulge his love of architectural construction , the boy besought his father to let him be a joiner ; and he was accordingly put apprentice to a neighbouring village carpenter . Having served his time , he went to Galashiels to seek work . As he was plodding along the valley of the Tweed with his tools upon his back , a carriage overtook him near Elibank Tower ; and the coachman , doubtless at the suggestion of his master , who was seated inside , having asked the youth how far he had to walk , and learning that he was on his way to Galashiels , invited him to mount the box beside him , and thus to ride thither . It turned out that the kindly gentleman inside was no other than Sir Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Selkirkshire . Whilst working at Galashiels , Kemp had frequent opportunities of visiting Melrose , Dryburgh , and Jedburgh Abbeys , which he studied carefully . Inspired by his love of architecture , he worked his way as a carpenter over the greater part of the north of England , never omitting an opportunity of inspecting and making sketches of any fine Gothic building . On one occasion , when working in Lancashire , he walked fifty miles to York , spent a week in carefully examining the Minster , and returned in like manner on foot . We next find him in Glasgow , where he remained four years , studying the fine cathedral there during his spare time . He returned to England again , this time working his way further south ; studying Canterbury , Winchester , Tintern , and other well-known structures . In 1824 he formed the design of travelling over Europe with the same object , supporting himself by his trade . Reaching Boulogne , he proceeded by Abbeville and Beauvais to Paris , spending a few weeks making drawings and studies at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knowledge of mill-work , readily secured him employment wherever he went ; and he usually chose the site of his employment in the neighbourhood of some fine old Gothic structure , in studying which he occupied his leisure . After a year 's working , travel , and study abroad , he returned to Scotland . He continued his studies , and became a proficient in drawing and perspective : Melrose was his favourite ruin ; and he produced several elaborate drawings of the building , one of which , exhibiting it in a " restored " state , was afterwards engraved . He also obtained employment as a modeller of architectural designs ; and made drawings for a work begun by an Edinburgh engraver , after the plan of Britton 's ' Cathedral Antiquities . ' This was a task congenial to his tastes , and he laboured at it with an enthusiasm which ensured its rapid advance ; walking on foot for the purpose over half Scotland , and living as an ordinary mechanic , whilst executing drawings which would have done credit to the best masters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , the publication was however stopped , and Kemp sought other employment . Few knew of the genius of this man  - -  for he was exceedingly taciturn and habitually modest  --  when the Committee of the Scott Monument offered a prize for the best design . The competitors were numerous  --  including some of the greatest names in classical architecture ; but the design unanimously selected was that of George Kemp , who was working at Kilwinning Abbey in Ayrshire , many miles off , when the letter reached him intimating the decision of the committee . Poor Kemp ! Shortly after this event he met an untimely death , and did not live to see the first result of his indefatigable industry and self-culture embodied in stone ,  --  one of the most beautiful and appropriate memorials ever erected to literary genius . John Gibson was another artist full of a genuine enthusiasm and love for his art , which placed him high above those sordid temptations which urge meaner natures to make time the measure of profit . He was born at Gyffn , near Conway , in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed indications of his talent by the carvings in wood which he made by means of a common pocket knife ; and his father , noting the direction of his talent , sent him to Liverpool and bound him apprentice to a cabinet-maker and wood-carver . He rapidly improved at his trade , and some of his carvings were much admired . He was thus naturally led to sculpture , and when eighteen years old he modelled a small figure of Time in wax , which attracted considerable notice . The Messrs . Franceys , sculptors , of Liverpool , having purchased the boy 's indentures , took him as their apprentice for six years , during which his genius displayed itself in many original works . From thence he proceeded to London , and afterwards to Rome ; and his fame became European . Robert Thorburn , the Royal Academician , like John Gibson , was born of poor parents . His father was a shoe-maker at Dumfries . Besides Robert there were two other sons ; one of whom is a skilful carver in wood . One day a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a mere boy , engaged in drawing upon a stool which served him for a table . She examined his work , and observing his abilities , interested herself in obtaining for him some employment in drawing , and enlisted in his behalf the services of others who could assist him in prosecuting the study of art . The boy was diligent , pains-taking , staid , and silent , mixing little with his companions , and forming but few intimacies . About the year 1830 , some gentlemen of the town provided him with the means of proceeding to Edinburgh , where he was admitted a student at the Scottish Academy . There he had the advantage of studying under competent masters , and the progress which he made was rapid . From Edinburgh he removed to London , where , we understand , he had the advantage of being introduced to notice under the patronage of the Duke of Buccleuch . We need scarcely say , however , that of whatever use patronage may have been to Thorburn in giving him an introduction to the best circles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist that he unquestionably is , without native genius and diligent application . Noel Paton , the well-known painter , began his artistic career at Dunfermline and Paisley , as a drawer of patterns for table-cloths and muslin embroidered by hand ; meanwhile working diligently at higher subjects , including the drawing of the human figure . He was , like Turner , ready to turn his hand to any kind of work , and in 1840 , when a mere youth , we find him engaged , among his other labours , in illustrating the ' Renfrewshire Annual . ' He worked his way step by step , slowly yet surely ; but he remained unknown until the exhibition of the prize cartoons painted for the houses of Parliament , when his picture of the Spirit of Religion ( for which he obtained one of the first prizes ) revealed him to the world as a genuine artist ; and the works which he has since exhibited  --  such as the ' Reconciliation of Oberon and Titania , ' ' Home , ' and ' The bluidy Tryste '  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another striking exemplification of perseverance and industry in the cultivation of art in humble life is presented in the career of James Sharples , a working blacksmith at Blackburn . He was born at Wakefield in Yorkshire , in 1825 , one of a family of thirteen children . His father was a working ironfounder , and removed to Bury to follow his business . The boys received no school education , but were all sent to work as soon as they were able ; and at about ten James was placed in a foundry , where he was employed for about two years as smithy-boy . After that he was sent into the engine-shop where his father worked as engine-smith . The boy 's employment was to heat and carry rivets for the boiler-makers . Though his hours of labour were very long  --  often from six in the morning until eight at night  --  his father contrived to give him some little teaching after working hours ; and it was thus that he partially learned his letters . An incident occurred in the course of his employment among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn drawing . He had occasionally been employed by the foreman to hold the chalked line with which he made the designs of boilers upon the floor of the workshop ; and on such occasions the foreman was accustomed to hold the line , and direct the boy to make the necessary dimensions . James soon became so expert at this as to be of considerable service to the foreman ; and at his leisure hours at home his great delight was to practise drawing designs of boilers upon his mother 's floor . On one occasion , when a female relative was expected from Manchester to pay the family a visit , and the house had been made as decent as possible for her reception , the boy , on coming in from the foundry in the evening , began his usual operations upon the floor . He had proceeded some way with his design of a large boiler in chalk , when his mother arrived with the visitor , and to her dismay found the boy unwashed and the floor chalked all over . The relative , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , praised his design , and recommended his mother to provide " the little sweep , " as she called him , with paper and pencils . Encouraged by his elder brother , he began to practise figure and landscape drawing , making copies of lithographs , but as yet without any knowledge of the rules of perspective and the principles of light and shade . He worked on , however , and gradually acquired expertness in copying . At sixteen , he entered the Bury Mechanic 's Institution in order to attend the drawing class , taught by an amateur who followed the trade of a barber . There he had a lesson a week during three months . The teacher recommended him to obtain from the library Burnet 's ' Practical Treatise on Painting ; ' but as he could not yet read with ease , he was under the necessity of getting his mother , and sometimes his elder brother , to read passages from the book for him while he sat by and listened . Feeling hampered by his ignorance of the art of reading , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ceased attending the drawing class at the Institute after the first quarter , and devoted himself to learning reading and writing at home . In this he soon succeeded ; and when he again entered the Institute and took out ' Burnet ' a second time , he was not only able to read it , but to make written extracts for further use . So ardently did he study the volume , that he used to rise at four o'clock in the morning to read it and copy out passages ; after which he went to the foundry at six , worked until six and sometimes eight in the evening ; and returned home to enter with fresh zest upon the study of Burnet , which he continued often until a late hour . Parts of his nights were also occupied in drawing and making copies of drawings . On one of these  --  a copy of Leonardo da Vinci 's " Last Supper "  --  he spent an entire night . He went to bed indeed , but his mind was so engrossed with the subject that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil . He next proceeded to try his hand at painting in oil , for which purpose he procured some canvas from a draper , stretched it on a frame , coated it over with white lead , and began painting on it with colours bought from a house-painter . But his work proved a total failure ; for the canvas was rough and knotty , and the paint would not dry . In his extremity he applied to his old teacher , the barber , from whom he first learnt that prepared canvas was to be had , and that there were colours and varnishes made for the special purpose of oil-painting . As soon therefore , as his means would allow , he bought a small stock of the necessary articles and began afresh ,  --  his amateur master showing him how to paint ; and the pupil succeeded so well that he excelled the master 's copy . His first picture was a copy from an engraving called " Sheep-shearing , " and was afterwards sold by him for half-a-crown . Aided by a shilling Guide to Oil-painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gradually acquired a better knowledge of his materials . He made his own easel and palette , palette-knife , and paint-chest ; he bought his paint , brushes , and canvas , as he could raise the money by working over-time . This was the slender fund which his parents consented to allow him for the purpose ; the burden of supporting a very large family precluding them from doing more . Often he would walk to Manchester and back in the evenings to buy two or three shillings ' worth of paint and canvas , returning almost at midnight , after his eighteen miles ' walk , sometimes wet through and completely exhausted , but borne up throughout by his inexhaustible hope and invincible determination . The further progress of the self-taught artist is best narrated in his own words , as communicated by him in a letter to the author : - " The next pictures I painted , " he says , " were a Landscape by Moonlight , a Fruitpiece , and one or two others ; after which I conceived the idea of painting ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , but had not attempted to embody the conception in a drawing . I now , however , made a sketch of the subject upon paper , and then proceeded to paint it on canvas . The picture simply represents the interior of a large workshop such as I have been accustomed to work in , although not of any particular shop . It is , therefore , to this extent , an original conception . Having made an outline of the subject , I found that , before I could proceed with it successfully , a knowledge of anatomy was indispensable to enable me accurately to delineate the muscles of the figures . My brother Peter came to my assistance at this juncture , and kindly purchased for me Flaxman 's ' Anatomical studies , '  --  a work altogether beyond my means at the time , for it cost twenty-four shillings . This book I looked upon as a great treasure , and I studied it laboriously , rising at three o'clock in the morning to draw after it , and occasionally getting my brother Peter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although I gradually improved myself by this practice , it was some time before I felt sufficient confidence to go on with my picture . I also felt hampered by my want of knowledge of perspective , which I endeavoured to remedy by carefully studying Brook Taylor 's ' Principles ; ' and shortly after I resumed my painting . While engaged in the study of perspective at home , I used to apply for and obtain leave to work at the heavier kinds of smith work at the foundry , and for this reason  --  the time required for heating the heaviest iron work is so much longer than that required for heating the lighter , that it enabled me to secure a number of spare minutes in the course of the day , which I carefully employed in making diagrams in perspective upon the sheet iron casing in front of the hearth at which I worked . " Thus assiduously working and studying , James Sharples steadily advanced in his knowledge of the principles of art , and acquired greater facility in its practice . Some eighteen months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his father , which attracted considerable notice in the town ; as also did the picture of " The Forge , " which he finished soon after . His success in portrait-painting obtained for him a commission from the foreman of the shop to paint a family group , and Sharples executed it so well that the foreman not only paid him the agreed price of eighteen pounds , but thirty shillings to boot . While engaged on this group he ceased to work at the foundry , and he had thoughts of giving up his trade altogether and devoting himself exclusively to painting . He proceeded to paint several pictures , amongst others a head of Christ , an original conception , life-size , and a view of Bury ; but not obtaining sufficient employment at portraits to occupy his time , or give him the prospect of a steady income , he had the good sense to resume his leather apron , and go on working at his honest trade of a blacksmith ; employing his leisure hours in engraving his picture of " The Forge , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the following circumstance . A Manchester picture-dealer , to whom he showed the painting , let drop the observation , that in the hands of a skilful engraver it would make a very good print . Sharples immediately conceived the idea of engraving it himself , though altogether ignorant of the art . The difficulties which he encountered and successfully overcame in carrying out his project are thus described by himself : - " I had seen an advertisement of a Sheffield steel-plate maker , giving a list of the prices at which he supplied plates of various sizes , and , fixing upon one of suitable dimensions , I remitted the amount , together with a small additional sum for which I requested him to send me a few engraving tools . I could not specify the articles wanted , for I did not then know anything about the process of engraving . However , there duly arrived with the plate three or four gravers and an etching needle ; the latter I spoiled before I knew its use . While working at the plate , the Amalgamated Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emblematical picture , for which I determined to compete , and I was so fortunate as to win the prize . Shortly after this I removed to Blackburn , where I obtained employment at Messrs . Yates ' , engineers , as an engine-smith ; and continued to employ my leisure time in drawing , painting , and engraving , as before . With the engraving I made but very slow progress , owing to the difficulties I experienced from not possessing proper tools . I then determined to try to make some that would suit my purpose , and after several failures I succeeded in making many that I have used in the course of my engraving . I was also greatly at a loss for want of a proper magnifying glass , and part of the plate was executed with no other assistance of this sort than what my father 's spectacles afforded , though I afterwards succeeded in obtaining a proper magnifier , which was of the utmost use to me . An incident occurred while I was engraving the plate , which had almost caused me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obliged to lay it aside for a considerable time , when other work pressed ; and in order to guard it against rust , I was accustomed to rub over the graven parts with oil . But on examining the plate after one of such intervals , I found that the oil had become a dark sticky substance extremely difficult to get out . I tried to pick it out with a needle , but found that it would almost take as much time as to engrave the parts afresh . I was in great despair at this , but at length hit upon the expedient of boiling it in water containing soda , and afterwards rubbing the engraved parts with a tooth-brush ; and to my delight found the plan succeeded perfectly . My greatest difficulties now over , patience and perseverance were all that were needed to bring my labours to a successful issue . I had neither advice nor assistance from any one in finishing the plate . If , therefore , the work possess any merit , I can claim it as my own ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be done by persevering industry and determination , it is all the honour I wish to lay claim to . " It would be beside our purpose to enter upon any criticism of " The Forge " as an engraving ; its merits having been already fully recognised by the art journals . The execution of the work occupied Sharples 's leisure evening hours during a period of five years ; and it was only when he took the plate to the printer that he for the first time saw an engraved plate produced by any other man . To this unvarnished picture of industry and genius , we add one other trait , and it is a domestic one . " I have been married seven years , " says he , " and during that time my greatest pleasure , after I have finished my daily labour at the foundry , has been to resume my pencil or graver , frequently until a late hour of the evening , my wife meanwhile sitting by my side and reading to me from some interesting book , "  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the genuine right-heartedness of this most interesting and deserving workman . The same industry and application which we have found to be necessary in order to acquire excellence in painting and sculpture , are equally required in the sister art of music  --  the one being the poetry of form and colour , the other of the sounds of nature . Handel was an indefatigable and constant worker ; he was never cast down by defeat , but his energy seemed to increase the more that adversity struck him . When a prey to his mortifications as an insolvent debtor , he did not give way for a moment , but in one year produced his ' Saul , ' ' Israel , ' the music for Dryden 's ' Ode , ' his ' Twelve Grand Concertos , ' and the opera of ' Jupiter in Argos , ' among the finest of his works . As his biographer says of him , " He braved everything , and , by his unaided self , accomplished the work of twelve men . " Haydn , speaking of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subject and pursuing it . " " Work , " said Mozart , " is my chief pleasure . " Beethoven 's favourite maxim was , " The barriers are not erected which can say to aspiring talents and industry , ' Thus far and no farther . ' " When Moscheles submitted his score of ' Fidelio ' for the pianoforte to Beethoven , the latter found written at the bottom of the last page , " Finis , with God 's help . " Beethoven immediately wrote underneath , " O man ! help thyself ! " This was the motto of his artistic life . John Sebastian Bach said of himself , " I was industrious ; whoever is equally sedulous , will be equally successful . " But there is no doubt that Bach was born with a passion for music , which formed the mainspring of his industry , and was the true secret of his success . When a mere youth , his elder brother , wishing to turn his abilities in another direction , destroyed a collection of studies which the young Sebastian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving the strong natural bent of the boy 's genius . Of Meyerbeer , Bayle thus wrote from Milan in 1820 : - " He is a man of some talent , but no genius ; he lives solitary , working fifteen hours a day at music . " Years passed , and Meyerbeer 's hard work fully brought out his genius , as displayed in his ' Roberto , ' ' Huguenots , ' ' Prophete , ' and other works , confessedly amongst the greatest operas which have been produced in modern times . Although musical composition is not an art in which Englishmen have as yet greatly distinguished themselves , their energies having for the most part taken other and more practical directions , we are not without native illustrations of the power of perseverance in this special pursuit . Arne was an upholsterer 's son , intended by his father for the legal profession ; but his love of music was so great , that he could not be withheld from pursuing it . While engaged in an attorney 's office , his means were very limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to borrow a livery and go into the gallery of the Opera , then appropriated to domestics . Unknown to his father he made great progress with the violin , and the first knowledge his father had of the circumstance was when accidentally calling at the house of a neighbouring gentleman , to his surprise and consternation he found his son playing the leading instrument with a party of musicians . This incident decided the fate of Arne . His father offered no further opposition to his wishes ; and the world thereby lost a lawyer , but gained a musician of much taste and delicacy of feeling , who added many valuable works to our stores of English music . The career of the late William Jackson , author of ' The Deliverance of Israel , ' an oratorio which has been successfully performed in the principal towns of his native county of York , furnishes an interesting illustration of the triumph of perseverance over difficulties in the pursuit of musical science . He was the son of a miller at Masham , a little town situated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorkshire . Musical taste seems to have been hereditary in the family , for his father played the fife in the band of the Masham Volunteers , and was a singer in the parish choir . His grandfather also was leading singer and ringer at Masham Church ; and one of the boy 's earliest musical treats was to be present at the bell pealing on Sunday mornings . During the service , his wonder was still more excited by the organist 's performance on the barrel-organ , the doors of which were thrown open behind to let the sound fully into the church , by which the stops , pipes , barrels , staples , keyboard , and jacks , were fully exposed , to the wonderment of the little boys sitting in the gallery behind , and to none more than our young musician . At eight years of age he began to play upon his father 's old fife , which , however , would not sound D ; but his mother remedied the difficulty by buying for him a one-keyed flute ; and shortly after , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four silver keys . As the boy made no progress with his " book learning , " being fonder of cricket , fives , and boxing , than of his school lessons  - -  the village schoolmaster giving him up as " a bad job "  --  his parents sent him off to a school at Pateley Bridge . While there he found congenial society in a club of village choral singers at Brighouse Gate , and with them he learnt the sol-fa-ing gamut on the old English plan . He was thus well drilled in the reading of music , in which he soon became a proficient . His progress astonished the club , and he returned home full of musical ambition . He now learnt to play upon his father 's old piano , but with little melodious result ; and he became eager to possess a finger-organ , but had no means of procuring one . About this time , a neighbouring parish clerk had purchased , for an insignificant sum , a small disabled barrel-organ , which had gone the circuit of the northern counties with a show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but failed ; at last he bethought him that he would try the skill of young Jackson , who had succeeded in making some alterations and improvements in the hand-organ of the parish church . He accordingly brought it to the lad 's house in a donkey cart , and in a short time the instrument was repaired , and played over its old tunes again , greatly to the owner 's satisfaction . The thought now haunted the youth that he could make a barrel-organ , and he determined to do so . His father and he set to work , and though without practice in carpentering , yet , by dint of hard labour and after many failures , they at last succeeded ; and an organ was constructed which played ten tunes very decently , and the instrument was generally regarded as a marvel in the neighbourhood . Young Jackson was now frequently sent for to repair old church organs , and to put new music upon the barrels which he added to them . All this he accomplished to the satisfaction of his employers , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adapting to it the keys of an old harpsichord . This he learnt to play upon ,  --  studying ' Callcott 's Thorough Bass ' in the evening , and working at his trade of a miller during the day ; occasionally also tramping about the country as a " cadger , " with an ass and a cart . During summer he worked in the fields , at turnip-time , hay-time , and harvest , but was never without the solace of music in his leisure evening hours . He next tried his hand at musical composition , and twelve of his anthems were shown to the late Mr. Camidge , of York , as " the production of a miller 's lad of fourteen . " Mr. Camidge was pleased with them , marked the objectionable passages , and returned them with the encouraging remark , that they did the youth great credit , and that he must " go on writing . " A village band having been set on foot at Masham , young Jackson joined it , and was ultimately appointed leader . He played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable practical knowledge of his art : he also composed numerous tunes for the band . A new finger-organ having been presented to the parish church , he was appointed the organist . He now gave up his employment as a journeyman miller , and commenced tallow-chandling , still employing his spare hours in the study of music . In 1839 he published his first anthem  --  ' For joy let fertile valleys sing ; ' and in the following year he gained the first prize from the Huddersfield Glee Club , for his ' Sisters of the Lea . ' His other anthem ' God be merciful to us , ' and the 103rd Psalm , written for a double chorus and orchestra , are well known . In the midst of these minor works , Jackson proceeded with the composition of his oratorio ,  --  ' The Deliverance of Israel from Babylon . ' His practice was , to jot down a sketch of the ideas as they presented themselves to his mind , and to write them out in score in the evenings , after he had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in parts , in the course of 1844-5 , and he published the last chorus on his twenty-ninth birthday . The work was exceedingly well received , and has been frequently performed with much success in the northern towns . Mr. Jackson eventually settled as a professor of music at Bradford , where he contributed in no small degree to the cultivation of the musical taste of that town and its neighbourhood . Some years since he had the honour of leading his fine company of Bradford choral singers before Her Majesty at Buckingham Palace ; on which occasion , as well as at the Crystal Palace , some choral pieces of his composition , were performed with great effect . 22 Such is a brief outline of the career of a self-taught musician , whose life affords but another illustration of the power of self-help , and the force of courage and industry in enabling a man to surmount and overcome early difficulties and obstructions of no ordinary kind . CHAPTER VII  --  INDUSTRY AND THE PEERAGE " He either fears his fate too much , Or his deserts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , To gain or lose it all . "  --  Marquis of Montrose . " He hath put down the mighty from their seats ; and exalted them of low degree . "  --  St. Luke . We have already referred to some illustrious Commoners raised from humble to elevated positions by the power of application and industry ; and we might point to even the Peerage itself as affording equally instructive examples . One reason why the Peerage of England has succeeded so well in holding its own , arises from the fact that , unlike the peerages of other countries , it has been fed , from time to time , by the best industrial blood of the country  --  the very " liver , heart , and brain of Britain . " Like the fabled Antaeus , it has been invigorated and refreshed by touching its mother earth , and mingling with that most ancient order of nobility  --  the working order . The blood of all men flows from equally remote sources ; and though some are unable to trace their line directly beyond their grandfathers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pedigree the great progenitors of the race , as Lord Chesterfield did when he wrote , " ADAM de Stanhope  --  EVE de Stanhope . " No class is ever long stationary . The mighty fall , and the humble are exalted . New families take the place of the old , who disappear among the ranks of the common people . Burke 's ' Vicissitudes of Families ' strikingly exhibit this rise and fall of families , and show that the misfortunes which overtake the rich and noble are greater in proportion than those which overwhelm the poor . This author points out that of the twenty-five barons selected to enforce the observance of Magna Charta , there is not now in the House of Peers a single male descendant . Civil wars and rebellions ruined many of the old nobility and dispersed their families . Yet their descendants in many cases survive , and are to be found among the ranks of the people . Fuller wrote in his ' Worthies , ' that " some who justly hold the surnames of Bohuns , Mortimers , and Plantagenets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thus Burke shows that two of the lineal descendants of the Earl of Kent , sixth son of Edward I. , were discovered in a butcher and a toll-gatherer ; that the great grandson of Margaret Plantagenet , daughter of the Duke of Clarance , sank to the condition of a cobbler at Newport , in Shropshire ; and that among the lineal descendants of the Duke of Gloucester , son of Edward III. , was the late sexton of St George 's , Hanover Square . It is understood that the lineal descendant of Simon de Montfort , England 's premier baron , is a saddler in Tooley Street . One of the descendants of the " Proud Percys , " a claimant of the title of Duke of Northumberland , was a Dublin trunk-maker ; and not many years since one of the claimants for the title of Earl of Perth presented himself in the person of a labourer in a Northumberland coal-pit . Hugh Miller , when working as a stone-mason near Edinburgh , was served by a hodman , who was one of the numerous claimants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish his claim being a missing marriage certificate ; and while the work was going on , the cry resounded from the walls many times in the day , of  --  " John , Yearl Crauford , bring us anither hod o'lime . " One of Oliver Cromwell 's great grandsons was a grocer on Snow Hill , and others of his descendants died in great poverty . Many barons of proud names and titles have perished , like the sloth , upon their family tree , after eating up all the leaves ; while others have been overtaken by adversities which they have been unable to retrieve , and sunk at last into poverty and obscurity . Such are the mutabilities of rank and fortune . The great bulk of our peerage is comparatively modern , so far as the titles go ; but it is not the less noble that it has been recruited to so large an extent from the ranks of honourable industry . In olden times , the wealth and commerce of London , conducted as it was by energetic and enterprising men , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cornwallis was founded by Thomas Cornwallis , the Cheapside merchant ; that of Essex by William Capel , the draper ; and that of Craven by William Craven , the merchant tailor . The modern Earl of Warwick is not descended from the " King-maker , " but from William Greville , the woolstapler ; whilst the modern dukes of Northumberland find their head , not in the Percies , but in Hugh Smithson , a respectable London apothecary . The founders of the families of Dartmouth , Radnor , Ducie , and Pomfret , were respectively a skinner , a silk manufacturer , a merchant tailor , and a Calais merchant ; whilst the founders of the peerages of Tankerville , Dormer , and Coventry , were mercers . The ancestors of Earl Romney , and Lord Dudley and Ward , were goldsmiths and jewellers ; and Lord Dacres was a banker in the reign of Charles I. , as Lord Overstone is in that of Queen Victoria . Edward Osborne , the founder of the Dukedom of Leeds , was apprentice to William Hewet , a rich clothworker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from drowning , by leaping into the Thames after her , and eventually married . Among other peerages founded by trade are those of Fitzwilliam , Leigh , Petre , Cowper , Darnley , Hill , and Carrington . The founders of the houses of Foley and Normanby were remarkable men in many respects , and , as furnishing striking examples of energy of character , the story of their lives is worthy of preservation . The father of Richard Foley , the founder of the family , was a small yeoman living in the neighbourhood of Stourbridge in the time of Charles I. That place was then the centre of the iron manufacture of the midland districts , and Richard was brought up to work at one of the branches of the trade  --  that of nail-making . He was thus a daily observer of the great labour and loss of time caused by the clumsy process then adopted for dividing the rods of iron in the manufacture of nails . It appeared that the Stourbridge nailers were gradually losing their trade in consequence of the importation of nails from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It became known that the Swedes were enabled to make their nails so much cheaper , by the use of splitting mills and machinery , which had completely superseded the laborious process of preparing the rods for nail-making then practised in England . Richard Foley , having ascertained this much , determined to make himself master of the new process . He suddenly disappeared from the neighbourhood of Stourbridge , and was not heard of for several years . No one knew whither he had gone , not even his own family ; for he had not informed them of his intention , lest he should fail . He had little or no money in his pocket , but contrived to get to Hull , where he engaged himself on board a ship bound for a Swedish port , and worked his passage there . The only article of property which he possessed was his fiddle , and on landing in Sweden he begged and fiddled his way to the Dannemora mines , near Upsala . He was a capital musician , as well as a pleasant fellow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the works , to every part of which he had access ; and he seized the opportunity thus afforded him of storing his mind with observations , and mastering , as he thought , the mechanism of iron splitting . After a continued stay for this purpose , he suddenly disappeared from amongst his kind friends the miners  --  no one knew whither . Returned to England , he communicated the results of his voyage to Mr. Knight and another person at Stourbridge , who had sufficient confidence in him to advance the requisite funds for the purpose of erecting buildings and machinery for splitting iron by the new process . But when set to work , to the great vexation and disappointment of all , and especially of Richard Foley , it was found that the machinery would not act  --  at all events it would not split the bars of iron . Again Foley disappeared . It was thought that shame and mortification at his failure had driven him away for ever . Not so ! Foley had determined to master this secret of iron-splitting , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Sweden , accompanied by his fiddle as before , and found his way to the iron works , where he was joyfully welcomed by the miners ; and , to make sure of their fiddler , they this time lodged him in the very splitting-mill itself . There was such an apparent absence of intelligence about the man , except in fiddle-playing , that the miners entertained no suspicions as to the object of their minstrel , whom they thus enabled to attain the very end and aim of his life . He now carefully examined the works , and soon discovered the cause of his failure . He made drawings or tracings of the machinery as well as he could , though this was a branch of art quite new to him ; and after remaining at the place long enough to enable him to verify his observations , and to impress the mechanical arrangements clearly and vividly on his mind , he again left the miners , reached a Swedish port , and took ship for England . A man of such purpose could not but succeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements , and the results were entirely successful . By his skill and his industry he soon laid the foundations of a large fortune , at the same time that he restored the business of an extensive district . He himself continued , during his life , to carry on his trade , aiding and encouraging all works of benevolence in his neighbourhood . He founded and endowed a school at Stourbridge ; and his son Thomas ( a great benefactor of Kidderminster ) , who was High Sheriff of Worcestershire in the time of " The Rump , " founded and endowed an hospital , still in existence , for the free education of children at Old Swinford . All the early Foleys were Puritans . Richard Baxter seems to have been on familiar and intimate terms with various members of the family , and makes frequent mention of them in his ' Life and Times . ' Thomas Foley , when appointed high sheriff of the county , requested Baxter to preach the customary sermon before him ; and Baxter in his ' Life ' speaks of him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men he ever had to do with magnified his great integrity and honesty , which were questioned by none . " The family was ennobled in the reign of Charles the Second . William Phipps , the founder of the Mulgrave or Normanby family , was a man quite as remarkable in his way as Richard Foley . His father was a gunsmith  --  a robust Englishman settled at Woolwich , in Maine , then forming part of our English colonies in America . He was born in 1651 , one of a family of not fewer than twenty-six children ( of whom twenty-one were sons ) , whose only fortune lay in their stout hearts and strong arms . William seems to have had a dash of the Danish-sea blood in his veins , and did not take kindly to the quiet life of a shepherd in which he spent his early years . By nature bold and adventurous , he longed to become a sailor and roam through the world . He sought to join some ship ; but not being able to find one , he apprenticed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , acquiring the arts of reading and writing during his leisure hours . Having completed his apprenticeship and removed to Boston , he wooed and married a widow of some means , after which he set up a little shipbuilding yard of his own , built a ship , and , putting to sea in her , he engaged in the lumber trade , which he carried on in a plodding and laborious way for the space of about ten years . It happened that one day , whilst passing through the crooked streets of old Boston , he overheard some sailors talking to each other of a wreck which had just taken place off the Bahamas ; that of a Spanish ship , supposed to have much money on board . His adventurous spirit was at once kindled , and getting together a likely crew without loss of time , he set sail for the Bahamas . The wreck being well in-shore , he easily found it , and succeeded in recovering a great deal of its cargo , but very little money ; and the result was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been such , however , as to stimulate his enterprising spirit ; and when he was told of another and far more richly laden vessel which had been wrecked near Port de la Plata more than half a century before , he forthwith formed the resolution of raising the wreck , or at all events of fishing up the treasure . Being too poor , however , to undertake such an enterprise without powerful help , he set sail for England in the hope that he might there obtain it . The fame of his success in raising the wreck off the Bahamas had already preceded him . He applied direct to the Government . By his urgent enthusiasm , he succeeded in overcoming the usual inertia of official minds ; and Charles II . eventually placed at his disposal the " Rose Algier , " a ship of eighteen guns and ninety-five men , appointing him to the chief command . Phipps then set sail to find the Spanish ship and fish up the treasure . He reached the coast of Hispaniola in safety ; but how to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wreck was more than fifty years old ; and Phipps had only the traditionary rumours of the event to work upon . There was a wide coast to explore , and an outspread ocean without any trace whatever of the argosy which lay somewhere at its bottom . But the man was stout in heart and full of hope . He set his seamen to work to drag along the coast , and for weeks they went on fishing up sea-weed , shingle , and bits of rock . No occupation could be more trying to seamen , and they began to grumble one to another , and to whisper that the man in command had brought them on a fool 's errand . At length the murmurers gained head , and the men broke into open mutiny . A body of them rushed one day on to the quarter-deck , and demanded that the voyage should be relinquished . Phipps , however , was not a man to be intimidated ; he seized the ringleaders , and sent the others back to their duty . It became necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of repairs ; and , to lighten her , the chief part of the stores was landed . Discontent still increasing amongst the crew , a new plot was laid amongst the men on shore to seize the ship , throw Phipps overboard , and start on a piratical cruize against the Spaniards in the South Seas . But it was necessary to secure the services of the chief ship carpenter , who was consequently made privy to the pilot . This man proved faithful , and at once told the captain of his danger . Summoning about him those whom he knew to be loyal , Phipps had the ship 's guns loaded which commanded the shore , and ordered the bridge communicating with the vessel to be drawn up . When the mutineers made their appearance , the captain hailed them , and told the men he would fire upon them if they approached the stores ( still on land ) ,  --  when they drew back ; on which Phipps had the stores reshipped under cover of his guns . The mutineers , fearful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and implored to be permitted to return to their duty . The request was granted , and suitable precautions were taken against future mischief . Phipps , however , took the first opportunity of landing the mutinous part of the crew , and engaging other men in their places ; but , by the time that he could again proceed actively with his explorations , he found it absolutely necessary to proceed to England for the purpose of repairing the ship . He had now , however , gained more precise information as to the spot where the Spanish treasure ship had sunk ; and , though as yet baffled , he was more confident than ever of the eventual success of his enterprise . Returned to London , Phipps reported the result of his voyage to the Admiralty , who professed to be pleased with his exertions ; but he had been unsuccessful , and they would not entrust him with another king 's ship . James II . was now on the throne , and the Government was in trouble ; so Phipps and his golden project appealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the requisite means by a public subscription . At first he was laughed at ; but his ceaseless importunity at length prevailed , and after four years ' dinning of his project into the ears of the great and influential  --  during which time he lived in poverty  --  he at length succeeded . A company was formed in twenty shares , the Duke of Albermarle , son of General Monk , taking the chief interest in it , and subscribing the principal part of the necessary fund for the prosecution of the enterprise . Like Foley , Phipps proved more fortunate in his second voyage than in his first . The ship arrived without accident at Port de la Plata , in the neighbourhood of the reef of rocks supposed to have been the scene of the wreck . His first object was to build a stout boat capable of carrying eight or ten oars , in constructing which Phipps used the adze himself . It is also said that he constructed a machine for the purpose of exploring the bottom of the sea similar to what is now known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to in books , but Phipps knew little of books , and may be said to have re-invented the apparatus for his own use . He also engaged Indian divers , whose feats of diving for pearls , and in submarine operations , were very remarkable . The tender and boat having been taken to the reef , the men were set to work , the diving bell was sunk , and the various modes of dragging the bottom of the sea were employed continuously for many weeks , but without any prospect of success . Phipps , however , held on valiantly , hoping almost against hope . At length , one day , a sailor , looking over the boat 's side down into the clear water , observed a curious sea-plant growing in what appeared to be a crevice of the rock ; and he called upon an Indian diver to go down and fetch it for him . On the red man coming up with the weed , he reported that a number of ships guns were lying in the same place . The intelligence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it proved to be correct . Search was made , and presently a diver came up with a solid bar of silver in his arms . When Phipps was shown it , he exclaimed , " Thanks be to God ! we are all made men . " Diving bell and divers now went to work with a will , and in a few days , treasure was brought up to the value of about 300,000 pounds , with which Phipps set sail for England . On his arrival , it was urged upon the king that he should seize the ship and its cargo , under the pretence that Phipps , when soliciting his Majesty 's permission , had not given accurate information respecting the business . But the king replied , that he knew Phipps to be an honest man , and that he and his friends should divide the whole treasure amongst them , even though he had returned with double the value . Phipps 's share was about 20,000 pounds , and the king , to show his approval of his energy and honesty in conducting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was also made High Sheriff of New England ; and during the time he held the office , he did valiant service for the mother country and the colonists against the French , by expeditions against Port Royal and Quebec . He also held the post of Governor of Massachusetts , from which he returned to England , and died in London in 1695 . Phipps throughout the latter part of his career , was not ashamed to allude to the lowness of his origin , and it was matter of honest pride to him that he had risen from the condition of common ship carpenter to the honours of knighthood and the government of a province . When perplexed with public business , he would often declare that it would be easier for him to go back to his broad axe again . He left behind him a character for probity , honesty , patriotism , and courage , which is certainly not the least noble inheritance of the house of Normanby . William Petty , the founder of the house of Lansdowne , was a man of like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son of a clothier in humble circumstances , at Romsey , in Hampshire , where he was born in 1623 . In his boyhood he obtained a tolerable education at the grammar school of his native town ; after which he determined to improve himself by study at the University of Caen , in Normandy . Whilst there he contrived to support himself unassisted by his father , carrying on a sort of small pedler 's trade with " a little stock of merchandise . " Returning to England , he had himself bound apprentice to a sea captain , who " drubbed him with a rope 's end " for the badness of his sight . He left the navy in disgust , taking to the study of medicine . When at Paris he engaged in dissection , during which time he also drew diagrams for Hobbes , who was then writing his treatise on Optics . He was reduced to such poverty that he subsisted for two or three weeks entirely on walnuts . But again he began to trade in a small way , turning an honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England with money in his pocket . Being of an ingenious mechanical turn , we find him taking out a patent for a letter-copying machine . He began to write upon the arts and sciences , and practised chemistry and physic with such success that his reputation shortly became considerable . Associating with men of science , the project of forming a Society for its prosecution was discussed , and the first meetings of the infant Royal Society were held at his lodgings . At Oxford he acted for a time as deputy to the anatomical professor there , who had a great repugnance to dissection . In 1652 his industry was rewarded by the appointment of physician to the army in Ireland , whither he went ; and whilst there he was the medical attendant of three successive lords-lieutenant , Lambert , Fleetwood , and Henry Cromwell . Large grants of forfeited land having been awarded to the Puritan soldiery , Petty observed that the lands were very inaccurately measured ; and in the midst of his many avocations he undertook to do the work himself . His appointments became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envious with corruption , and removed from them all ; but he was again taken into favour at the Restoration . Petty was a most indefatigable contriver , inventor , and organizer of industry . One of his inventions was a double-bottomed ship , to sail against wind and tide . He published treatises on dyeing , on naval philosophy , on woollen cloth manufacture , on political arithmetic , and many other subjects . He founded iron works , opened lead mines , and commenced a pilchard fishery and a timber trade ; in the midst of which he found time to take part in the discussions of the Royal Society , to which he largely contributed . He left an ample fortune to his sons , the eldest of whom was created Baron Shelburne . His will was a curious document , singularly illustrative of his character ; containing a detail of the principal events of his life , and the gradual advancement of his fortune . His sentiments on pauperism are characteristic : " As for legacies for the poor , " said he , " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , I give them nothing ; as for impotents by the hand of God , the public ought to maintain them ; as for those who have been bred to no calling nor estate , they should be put upon their kindred ; " . . . " wherefore I am contented that I have assisted all my poor relations , and put many into a way of getting their own bread ; have laboured in public works ; and by inventions have sought out real objects of charity ; and I do hereby conjure all who partake of my estate , from time to time , to do the same at their peril . Nevertheless to answer custom , and to take the surer side , I give 20l. to the most wanting of the parish wherein I die .

Their patent of nobility was virtually secured by Jedediah Strutt in 1758 , when he invented his machine for making ribbed stockings , and thereby laid the foundations of a fortune which the subsequent bearers of the name have largely increased and nobly employed . The father of Jedediah was a farmer and malster , who did but little for the education of his children ; yet they all prospered . Jedediah was the second son , and when a boy assisted his father in the work of the farm . At an early age he exhibited a taste for mechanics , and introduced several improvements in the rude agricultural implements of the period . On the death of his uncle he succeeded to a farm at Blackwall , near Normanton , long in the tenancy of the family , and shortly after he married Miss Wollatt , the daughter of a Derby hosier . Having learned from his wife 's brother that various unsuccessful attempts had been made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view to effect what others had failed in accomplishing . He accordingly obtained a stocking-frame , and after mastering its construction and mode of action , he proceeded to introduce new combinations , by means of which he succeeded in effecting a variation in the plain looped-work of the frame , and was thereby enabled to turn out " ribbed " hosiery . Having secured a patent for the improved machine , he removed to Derby , and there entered largely on the manufacture of ribbed-stockings , in which he was very successful . He afterwards joined Arkwright , of the merits of whose invention he fully satisfied himself , and found the means of securing his patent , as well as erecting a large cotton-mill at Cranford , in Derbyshire . After the expiry of the partnership with Arkwright , the Strutts erected extensive cotton-mills at Milford , near Belper , which worthily gives its title to the present head of the family . The sons of the founder were , like their father , distinguished for their mechanical ability . Thus William Strutt , the eldest , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which was only prevented by the mechanical skill of that day being unequal to its manufacture . Edward , the son of William , was a man of eminent mechanical genius , having early discovered the principle of suspension-wheels for carriages : he had a wheelbarrow and two carts made on the principle , which were used on his farm near Belper . It may be added that the Strutts have throughout been distinguished for their noble employment of the wealth which their industry and skill have brought them ; that they have sought in all ways to improve the moral and social condition of the work-people in their employment ; and that they have been liberal donors in every good cause  --  of which the presentation , by Mr. Joseph Strutt , of the beautiful park or Arboretum at Derby , as a gift to the townspeople for ever , affords only one of many illustrations . The concluding words of the short address which he delivered on presenting this valuable gift are worthy of being quoted and remembered : - " As the sun has shone brightly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to employ a portion of the fortune I possess in promoting the welfare of those amongst whom I live , and by whose industry I have been aided in its organisation . " No less industry and energy have been displayed by the many brave men , both in present and past times , who have earned the peerage by their valour on land and at sea . Not to mention the older feudal lords , whose tenure depended upon military service , and who so often led the van of the English armies in great national encounters , we may point to Nelson , St. Vincent , and Lyons  --  to Wellington , Hill , Hardinge , Clyde , and many more in recent times , who have nobly earned their rank by their distinguished services . But plodding industry has far oftener worked its way to the peerage by the honourable pursuit of the legal profession , than by any other . No fewer than seventy British peerages , including two dukedoms , have been founded by successful lawyers . Mansfield and Erskine were , it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank God that out of his own family he did not know a lord . 23 The others were , for the most part , the sons of attorneys , grocers , clergymen , merchants , and hardworking members of the middle class . Out of this profession have sprung the peerages of Howard and Cavendish , the first peers of both families having been judges ; those of Aylesford , Ellenborough , Guildford , Shaftesbury , Hardwicke , Cardigan , Clarendon , Camden , Ellesmere , Rosslyn ; and others nearer our own day , such as Tenterden , Eldon , Brougham , Denman , Truro , Lyndhurst , St. Leonards , Cranworth , Campbell , and Chelmsford . Lord Lyndhurst 's father was a portrait painter , and that of St. Leonards a perfumer and hairdresser in Burlington Street . Young Edward Sugden was originally an errand-boy in the office of the late Mr. Groom , of Henrietta Street , Cavendish Square , a certificated conveyancer ; and it was there that the future Lord Chancellor of Ireland obtained his first notions of law . The origin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor was he ashamed of it ; for he felt that the industry , study , and application , by means of which he achieved his eminent position , were entirely due to himself . It is related of him , that on one occasion he took his son Charles to a little shed , then standing opposite the western front of Canterbury Cathedral , and pointing it out to him , said , " Charles , you see this little shop ; I have brought you here on purpose to show it you . In that shop your grandfather used to shave for a penny : that is the proudest reflection of my life . " When a boy , Lord Tenterden was a singer in the Cathedral , and it is a curious circumstance that his destination in life was changed by a disappointment . When he and Mr. Justice Richards were going the Home Circuit together , they went to service in the cathedral ; and on Richards commending the voice of a singing man in the choir , Lord Tenterden said , " Ah ! that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this town , we were candidates for a chorister 's place , and he obtained it . " Not less remarkable was the rise to the same distinguished office of Lord Chief Justice , of the rugged Kenyon and the robust Ellenborough ; nor was he a less notable man who recently held the same office  --  the astute Lord Campbell , late Lord Chancellor of England , son of a parish minister in Fifeshire . For many years he worked hard as a reporter for the press , while diligently preparing himself for the practice of his profession . It is said of him , that at the beginning of his career , he was accustomed to walk from county town to county town when on circuit , being as yet too poor to afford the luxury of posting . But step by step he rose slowly but surely to that eminence and distinction which ever follow a career of industry honourably and energetically pursued , in the legal , as in every other profession . There have been other illustrious instances of Lords Chancellors who have plodded up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . The career of the late Lord Eldon is perhaps one of the most remarkable examples . He was the son of a Newcastle coal-fitter ; a mischievous rather than a studious boy ; a great scapegrace at school , and the subject of many terrible thrashings , - - for orchard-robbing was one of the favourite exploits of the future Lord Chancellor . His father first thought of putting him apprentice to a grocer , and afterwards had almost made up his mind to bring him up to his own trade of a coal-fitter . But by this time his eldest son William ( afterwards Lord Stowell ) who had gained a scholarship at Oxford , wrote to his father , " Send Jack up to me , I can do better for him . " John was sent up to Oxford accordingly , where , by his brother 's influence and his own application , he succeeded in obtaining a fellowship . But when at home during the vacation , he was so unfortunate  --  or rather so fortunate , as the issue proved  --  as to fall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride , he married , and as his friends thought , ruined himself for life . He had neither house nor home when he married , and had not yet earned a penny . He lost his fellowship , and at the same time shut himself out from preferment in the Church , for which he had been destined . He accordingly turned his attention to the study of the law . To a friend he wrote , " I have married rashly ; but it is my determination to work hard to provide for the woman I love . " John Scott came up to London , and took a small house in Cursitor Lane , where he settled down to the study of the law . He worked with great diligence and resolution ; rising at four every morning and studying till late at night , binding a wet towel round his head to keep himself awake . Too poor to study under a special pleader , he copied out three folio volumes from a manuscript collection of precedents . Long after , when Lord Chancellor , passing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Here was my first perch : many a time do I recollect coming down this street with sixpence in my hand to buy sprats for supper . " When at length called to the bar , he waited long for employment . His first year 's earnings amounted to only nine shillings . For four years he assiduously attended the London Courts and the Northern Circuit , with little better success . Even in his native town , he seldom had other than pauper cases to defend . The results were indeed so discouraging , that he had almost determined to relinquish his chance of London business , and settle down in some provincial town as a country barrister . His brother William wrote home , " Business is dull with poor Jack , very dull indeed ! " But as he had escaped being a grocer , a coal-fitter , and a country parson so did he also escape being a country lawyer . An opportunity at length occurred which enabled John Scott to exhibit the large legal knowledge which he had so laboriously acquired . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal point against the wishes both of the attorney and client who employed him . The Master of the Rolls decided against him , but on an appeal to the House of Lords , Lord Thurlow reversed the decision on the very point that Scott had urged . On leaving the House that day , a solicitor tapped him on the shoulder and said , " Young man , your bread and butter 's cut for life . " And the prophecy proved a true one . Lord Mansfield used to say that he knew no interval between no business and 3000l. a-year , and Scott might have told the same story ; for so rapid was his progress , that in 1783 , when only thirty-two , he was appointed King 's Counsel , was at the head of the Northern Circuit , and sat in Parliament for the borough of Weobley . It was in the dull but unflinching drudgery of the early part of his career that he laid the foundation of his future success . He won his spurs by perseverance , knowledge , and ability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of solicitor and attorney-general , and rose steadily upwards to the highest office that the Crown had to bestow  --  that of Lord Chancellor of England , which he held for a quarter of a century . Henry Bickersteth was the son of a surgeon at Kirkby Lonsdale , in Westmoreland , and was himself educated to that profession . As a student at Edinburgh , he distinguished himself by the steadiness with which he worked , and the application which he devoted to the science of medicine . Returned to Kirkby Lonsdale , he took an active part in his father 's practice ; but he had no liking for the profession , and grew discontented with the obscurity of a country town . He went on , nevertheless , diligently improving himself , and engaged on speculations in the higher branches of physiology . In conformity with his own wish , his father consented to send him to Cambridge , where it was his intention to take a medical degree with the view of practising in the metropolis . Close application to his studies , however , threw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strength he accepted the appointment of travelling physician to Lord Oxford .
