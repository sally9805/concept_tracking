Boker , George H. ( George Henry ) , 1823-1890 : THE GRAVE . A SONNET. from Poems , in The dew-drop ( 1852 ) Thou small square portal of eternity , Why on thy threshold will my spirit start ? Why to the inner temple of my heart Rushes the frightened blood tumultuously ? No horrors in thy tranquil depths I see ; Myriads in gloomy state this way depart , Till Time looks wearied on Death 's pageantry ; Yet , mystic Grave , use takes no awe from thee . Why should it be , that man his galling cares Beside thy lintel so reluctant throws ?  --  Why for his fetters grieves , why hugs his woes , When thoughtful Faith within that portal bears A torch which , flashing through the murky airs , On beckoning Hope a steady radiance throws ? Boker , George H. ( George Henry ) , 1823-1890 : TO HOPE . A SONNET. from Poems , in The dew-drop ( 1852 ) Thou art no exhalation of the brain , Raising mid foggy doubts thy phantom light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For ever distant , yet for ever bright : O no ! thy luring rays ne'er shine in vain Athwart the shadows of uncertain night  --  Thou proud incentive to heroic gain , That waken'st from despair the spirit 's might , And from defeat excit'st to victory ! Though , star-like , thou retreat'st as we advance , And from our eager grasp wilt ever flee ; Yet , star-like , guid'st thou , with unchanging glance , In glory streaming towards eternity , To cast a light beyond the grave 's expanse .
