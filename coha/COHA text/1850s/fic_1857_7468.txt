THREE SONNETS . " I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness . " Larcom , Lucy , 1824-1893 : I. " I shall be satisfied ! " The chaffy taste from Poems , in The ladies ' wreath and Parlor Annual 1857 ? " I shall be satisfied ! " The chaffy taste Of Dead Sea apples me hath sickened long . Sweet drops from Siloa 's fountain on my tongue Have turned to bitter ; for , in feverish haste I 've drained the Circean bowl beside it placed ; To that mixed draught no healing could belong . Seeking my soul 's ideal , all the throng Of showy phantoms I have wildly chased , To find them pallid ghosts beneath their paint . From earthy shallows gladly now I glide To shores where Truth and Beauty know no taint ; Where dross shall be exchanged for silver tried ; Where substance shall replace these shadows faint , And this in-burning thirst be satisfied . Larcom , Lucy , 1824-1893 : II . " When I awake . " In truth , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies ' wreath and Parlor Annual 1857 ? " When I awake . " In truth , ' t is like a dream , All that hath passed before these eyes of sense ; Yet Love , thy dearer name , Omnipotence , Hath pierced the veil with many a golden beam , Else , dark and wearisome the night would seem . The dawn of heaven  --  in radiance pouring thence , Vain dreams will hide their candles of pretence . I have been sleeping . How shall I redeem Those earthly hours bestowed for heavenly deeds  --  These rusting talents from my bosom bring ? No longer will I lie in flowery meads . I will awake and follow Thee , my King ; That , when my death-sealed ear the archangel heeds , I , blest , may join the saints ' awakening . Larcom , Lucy , 1824-1893 : III . Blest " with thy likeness ! " This is all my prayer from Poems , in The ladies ' wreath and Parlor Annual 1857 ? Blest " with thy likeness ! " This is all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Seeing thee , shall I love thee , Father , Friend , And , loving thee , shall thy pure image bear . When I the white robes of the ransomed wear , And in thy Perfect Presence humbly bend , Thy owning smile to my heart 's brim will send A well of joy thenceforth unfailing there . Thy likeness , Thine , Immortal Purity , No sensual blemish evermore will hide . All worlds shall but reflect thy light to me ; My soul , by gazing on thee , glorified , Serenely from its depths shall mirror Thee , And then , O God ! I shall be satisfied ! Part II . Larcom , Lucy , 1824-1893 : EXPOSTULATION. from Poems , in The ladies ' wreath and Parlor Annual 1857 ? Why do we sigh in June , " The roses will not stay ; The summer winds too soon Will bear their bloom away . " Why let the thought of death Creep , worm-like , through the flower ? Far better in its breath Embalm the passing hour . Why chide the sultry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when dusty ways Do chafe our aching feet ? The orchards ripen fast Beneath the dogday rain , And August beams at last To gold will turn the grain . Why , thinking of the dead , Should earth seem drear as night ? What gardener , sowing seed , Would mourn it , out of sight ? Why , looking onward , see Our years o'ergrown with ills ? Faith conquers destiny ; It is despair that kills . Why weakly dread to live ? Why darkly fear to die ? Each hour to truth we give , Writes our eternity . If love inspire our song , And duty strike the tune , Life can not be too long ; Death can not come too soon . Larcom , Lucy , 1824-1893 : TO MY THOUGHTS . from Poems , in The ladies ' wreath and Parlor Annual 1857 ? Come , groping thoughts , come home ! Why burrow ' neath the loam Like moles , with lowest toil of lower things ? Leave grovelling unto brutes unblest with wings ! Ye , made to soar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden plumage mars ; And ye are stifling with the heavy clod Your songs that grew from the dear name of God . Come home , vain thoughts , come home ! The wild waves ' beaded foam Makes the sea beautiful in its unrest ; But ' mid the billows ye can weave no nest . Light waifs of Fancy will ye ever be , Borne here and there across a gleaming sea ? The ark is open ; let the weary dove Alight upon the outstretched hand of Love . Come , dizzy thoughts , come home ! Beyond the sky 's great dome , Vaster than vision , save the Rearer 's eye , It is in vain for motes like you to fly . Bring home this message from your flight once more , That there are heights to which ye can not soar . Faint with your wanderings through the lonely sphere , Take humbly Life 's neglected crumbs for cheer . Come home , tired thoughts , come home ! Ye need no longer roam . Your flutterings in one shelter may be stilled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build . The Cross  --  firm root , upspreading to a Tree , With boughs that overarch eternity . Oh , vagrant thoughts ! deceived , bewildered long , Rest in this shade , and sing your grateful song ! Larcom , Lucy , 1824-1893 : THE MULLEN . from Poems , in The ladies ' wreath and Parlor Annual 1857 ? I can not understand , Rough plant of Yankee-land , Why voices sullen Always should speak of thee Slighting and scornfully Though they no beauty see In the low Mullen . Truly , thy chance is small , Coming when blossoms all  --  Harebells and roses  --  Dance in the summer air , Spreading sweet odors there ! Who 'd for the Mullen care , ' Mong brighter posies ? Yet why should we expect To see each blossom decked Like a king 's daughter ? Thou art a patient one Whose daily work is done Faithfully , seeking none , Since none have sought her . In some old , stubborn field , That will no harvest yield , Tak'st thou thy dwelling  --  Or to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a mighty Hand Cheerfully telling . Flirts have thy symbol told , As of a beldame old Wrapped up in flannels , Peering with jaundiced eye Into June 's rosy sky ; O'erlooking , stiff and dry , August 's bare channels . Yet hast thou sturdier worth Than a frail May-day birth , Dying in Summer ; Thy leaves in snow we find , As a testator kind Leaveth warm clothes behind For the next comer . And though unprized at home , If o'er the sea thou roam , Hence torn asunder ; Florists European Thee with due honor scan , " Velvet American , " Shown for a wonder . Well , ' t is the same old law Hinted in many a saw All the world over ; Prophets at home denied ; Plain truth at beauty 's side Men evermore deride ; Leave her no lover . Still the straight Mullen-stalk , Priest of our daily walk , Gives us plain preaching :  --  " Live not for passing eyes While earth a beggar lies , And light is in the skies !
