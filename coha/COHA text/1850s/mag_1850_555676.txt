EDWARD FITZGERALD . " I HAVE been reading a good deal , but not much in the way of knowledge . " So the future translator of Omar Khayy*m wrote to a friend in 1832 , being then twenty-three years old , and two years out of the University . The words may be taken as fairly descriptive of the remaining fifty years of his life . He was always reading something , but not with an eye to rank or scholarship . His old friends and schoolfellows one after another stepped into high place . Tennyson , Thackeray , and Carlyle were names on every tongue ; Spedding , less talked about , was deep in a magnum opus ; Thompson , Donne , Peacock , Allen , and Cowell held positions of honor in church or college ; but FitzGerald had buried himself of set purpose in an insignificant , out-of-the-way Suffolk village , and , by his own account of himself , was dozing away his years in " visionary inactivity , " - in " the enjoyment of old childish habits and sympathies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it now appears , he was living his own life ; and perhaps not less truly than the foremost of them he was to come into lasting renown . Such are the " diversities of operations , " through which the spirit of man develops and discloses itself . FitzGerald came of an eccentric family . " We are all mad , " he wrote ; and his own share of the ancestral inheritance - mostly of an amiable and amusing sort - early made itself evident . While he was at Cambridge his mother drove up to the college gate in her coach and four , and sent for him to come down and see her ; but he could not go , - his only pair of shoes was at the cobbler 's . The Suffolk friend , from whom we have this anecdote , adds that to the last FitzGerald was perfectly careless of dress . " I can see him now , " he says , " walk ing down into Woodbridge , with an old Inverness cape , a double-breasted flowered satin waistcoat , slippers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied over his hat . " It was odd , no doubt , that a gentleman should dress in so unconventional a manner ; but it was much odder that he should write to Mrs. Kemble a fortnight after the death of his brother , in 1879 : " I say but little of my brother 's death . We were very good friends , of very different ways of thinking ; I had not been within side his lawn gates ( three miles off ) these dozen years ( no fault of his ) , and I did not enter them at his funeral - which you will very likely - and properly - think wrong . " Only an eccentric man could have had occasion to say that ; and surely none but a very eccentric man would have said it . After leaving the University - at which , by the way , he barely obtained his degree - he went to Paris ( where he had spent part of his boyhood ) , but stayed only a month or two ; and on his return , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell Thackeray that he is never to invite me to his house , as I intend never to go . " He would rather go there than anywhere else , to be sure ; but he has got " all sorts of Utopian ideas " about society into his head , and is " going to become a great bear . " In another man 's mouth this might have been merely the expression of a passing whim ; but whether FitzGerald meant the words seriously or not , they were pretty accurately fulfilled . His friends were of the noblest and truest , and his affection for them was of the warmest and stanchest , no man 's more so ; but he chose to live apart . " Why , sir , " said Doctor Johnson to Boswell , " you find no man , at all intellectual , who is willing to leave London . // No , sir , when a man is tired of London , he is tired of life ; for there is in London all that life can afford . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can talk twice as much in London as anywhere else , " he remarked , with true Boswellian simplicity . Possibly FitzGerald was less " intellectual " than the great luminary and his satellite ; or perhaps his intellectuality , such as it was , ran less exclusively to talk.1 At all events , he hated London as a place of residence ; and even when he paid it a visit he was always in such feverish and ludicrous haste to get away that he was sure to leave his calls and errands no more than half done . " I long to spread wing and fly into the kind clear air of the country , " he writes on one occasion of this sort . " I see nobody in the streets half so handsome as Mr. Reynolds of ' our parish . . . . A great city is a deadly plague . . . . I get radishes to eat for breakfast of a morning ; with them comes a savor of earth that brings all the delicious gardens of the world back into one 's soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the mouth of a man of social position , University training , and independent fortune , - who had lived in Paris , and was only thirtyfive years old , - language like this bespeaks a born rustic and recluse , not to say a philosopher . And such FitzGeraid was . Not that he craved a life in the wilderness ( being neither a John the Baptist nor a Rend ) , or had any extraordinary appreciation of the beauties of nature , so called . There was little of Wordsworth or of Thoreau in his composition , or , if there was , it seldom found expression ; but he detested crowds , was ill at ease in society , and having a bent toward homely solitude , was independent enough to follow it . It must seem queer to his old friends , he knew , but he preferred to " poke about in the country , " 1 " Mr. Johnson , indeed , as he was a very talking man himself , had an idea that nothing using his books , as ladies do their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of his days , a day of " glorious sunshine : " - " All the morning I read about Nero in Tacitus* lying at full length on a bench in the garden : a nightingale singing , and some red anemones eyeing the sun manfully not far off . A funny mixture all this : Nero , and the delicacy of spring ; all very human , however . Then at half past one lunch on Cambridge cream cheese ; then a ride over hill and dale : then spudding up some weeds from the grass : and then coming in , I sit down to write to you , my sister winding red worsted from the back of a chair , and the most delightful little girl in the world chattering incessantly . So runs the world away . You think I live in epicurean ease : but this happens to be a jolly day : one is n't always well , or tolerably good , the weather is not always clear , nor nightingales singing , nor Tacitus full of pleasant atrocity . But such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good end of it . " Sometimes , it must be owned , he seemed not quite to approve of his own choice . " Men ought to have an ambition to stir and travel , and fill their heads and senses . " So he says once , in an unusual mood of something like penitence . Even then , however , he concludes , characteristically , " but so it is . " There speaks the real FitzGerald . He is what he is , what he was made : a man without ambition ; a man incapable , from first to last , of taking himself seriously . He could never have said , as Tennyson did in his youth , and in effect for all his life , " I mean to be famous . " If FitzGerald meant to be anything , - which is doubtful , - he meant to be obscure . The wonder of it all is that his life was beautiful , his spirit sweet , and his posthumous reward celebrity . He had little or none of the melanpromoted happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choly which so generally accompanies the union of exceptional powers with an enfeebled will and a comparative intellectual sterility . For one thing , he seems to have been spared the persecution of friends . As he expected little of himself , so they expected little of him . Unlike most men of a kindred sort - men of whom Gray and Amiel may stand as typical examples - he was left to go his own gait . Nobody wrote to him week after week , chiding him for his indolence and entreating him to produce a masterpiece . Happy man that he was , his youth had held out no promise of such production , and so his subsequent course was not clouded by the shadow of a promise unfi*lfilled . If he was down in the country letting the moss grow over him , why , it was only " old Fitz , " from whom nobody had ever looked for anything very different . So Thackeray , Tennyson , and the rest seem to have thought . And so thought the man himself . Life was worth living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a good end of it ; " but it was hardly a thing to disquiet one 's self about . He set little value upon time or money , and correspondingly little upon his own gifts . There were always hours enough , and more than enough , for the nothings he had to do ; his income was sufficient ; if it declined , - as it did , - it was no matter , he had only to reduce his expenditures ; he never earned a penny , or considered the possibility of doing so ; and withal , he was not made to write anything himself , but to please himself with the writings of others . He was born of the school of Epicurus . His aim was to pass the time quietly ; pitching his desires low , never overmuch in earnest , taking things as they came , - " Crowning the present , doubting of the rest ; " " not a hero , not even a philosopher , but a quiet , humane , and prudent man ; " cultivating no enthusiasm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have been a consistent vegetarian . Like the master of his school - whom he seldom or never mentions , and of whom he perhaps as seldom thought- he subsisted mostly on bread , and drank wine sparingly . Such a diet gave him lightness of spirits , he said , - a better thing , surely , than any tickling of the palate . With his liking for the country - in which , again , he was at one with his unrecognized master - went a strong and persistent preference for the society of common people . For correspondents he had always scholars and men of note , the best of his time , and many of them ; for daily associates he chose a sailor , a village clergyman 's family , and an old woman or two . One of the greatest men he had ever known was his sailor , the captain of his yacht , - " my captain , " he calls him ; " a gentleman of nature 's grandest type , " " fit to be king df a kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sends word to Laurence , the portrait painter , " I came here a few days ago , for the benefit of my old doctor , the sea , and my captain 's company , which is as good . " One who knew him at the time of his intimacy with Bernard Barton , the Quaker poet ( fortunate Quaker , with Lamb and FitzGerald both writing letters to him ) , describes him as living in a little cottage at Boulge , a mile from the village , on the edge of his father 's park , with no companion save a parrot and a Skye terrier . Such domestic duties as he did not attend to with his own hands were performed by an " old-fashioned Suffolk woman . " It was at this period that FitzGerald - then thirty - three years old - wrote to Barton , " I believe I should like to live in a small house just outside a pleasant English town all the days of my life , making myself useful in a humble way , reading my books , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be added that few men have ever come nearer to realizing their own dream . // The Hall was mostly unoccupied in those days , though " the great lady " - FitzGerald 's mother - would be there once in a while , and " would drive about in a coach of four black horses . " So says the son of the village rector , who adds that FitzGerald " used to walk by himself , slowly , with a Skye terrier . " The rector 's son ( a grandson , by the bye , of the poet Crabbe ) was rather afraid of his " grave , middle - aged " neighbor . " He seemed a proud and very punctilious man . . . never very happy or light - hearted , though his conversation was most amusing sometimes . " On this last point we have also the testimony of his housekeeper , the " old-fashioned Suffolk woman " before mentioned . " So kind he was , " she says ; " not never one to make no obstacles . Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependents , indeed , speak of his kindness . A boy of the village , who was employed to read to_the him in the evening during his later years , told Mr. Groome 1 " how Mr. FitzGerald always gave him plenty of plum cake , and how they used to play piquet together . Only sometimes a tame mouse would come out and sit on the table , and then not a card must be dropped . " " A pretty picture , " Mr. Groome calls it . And so say we . As to the picture of FitzGerald 's manner of life taken as a whole , it will be thought " pretty " or not according to the prepossessions of the reader . To many it will seem in all respects amiable , a refreshment to read about . Why should a man not be what he was made to be ? If he likes the heat of battle , let him fight , so that he does it fairly and with those who enjoy the same game . If another man cares not to be strenuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure to himself and harm to nobody else , - why , the world is big enough ; let him be at liberty to sit in his corner and see the crowd go by . 1 Author of Two Suffolk Friends . " An hour we have , ' thou saidst . Ali , waste it well . ' " And after all , the idler may reach the goal as soon as some who hurry . The race ought to be his who has trained hardest and run hardest ; and it would be , perhaps , if the world were logically and properly governed ; but things being as they are , the experience of mankind seems to show a measure of truth in the old Hebrew paradox , " The race is not to the swift . " Whether it is or not , the question had no particular interest for FitzGerald . His thoughts were not of winning a prize . His temperament had put him out of the competition . Temperament is fatality ; and he was content to have it so . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the tide at its flow . " In his " predestined Plot of Dust and Soul " the vine of worldly prudence had never struck root . He was peculiar in other ways . He was constitutionally a skeptic . Many things which he had been taught to believe seemed to him insufficiently established ; improbable , if not incredible . The Master of Trinity wrote of him and of one of his dearest friends , " Two of the purest-living men among my intimates , FitzGerald and Spedding , were prisoners in Doubting Castle all their lives , or at least the last half of them . " The language is euphemistic . Some calamities are so deeply felt that it is natural to veil allusion to them under metaphor . His friends , the Master means to say , had lost their faith in the tenets of the English Church . " A great problem , " he pronounces jt . And such it surely was : that two such men - " pure-living men ! " - should doubt of matters which to so many bishops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But so it is . Some men seem to be born for unbelief ; and out of that number a few are so non-conformative , so perverse , or so honest as to live according to their lights . Concerning questions of this kind FitzGerald said little // either in public or private . An unheroic , peace-loving man , who wishes to slip through the world unnoticed , naturally keeps some thoughts to himself , growing them , to borrow Keats 's phrase , in " a philosophic back-garden . " He reasoned about them , it would seem , in a quiet spirit , patient , perhaps half indifferent , being happily free from any corroding curiosity as to the origin and destiny of things . In that regard Nature had been good to him . What could not be known , he could get on without knowing . Why wear out one 's teeth in champing an iron bit ? He spoke his mind , anonymously , in his translation of the Omar Khayyt*m quatrains , - which are perhaps rather more sk9ptical than the book of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut the lips of a man whom he thought a meddler . The rector of Woodbridge , we are told by Mr. Groome , called on FitzGerald to express his regret at never seeing him at church . We may surmise that the " regret " was expressed in a rather lofty and dogmatic tone , a tone not unnatural , surely , in the case of one clothed with supernatural authority . " Sir , " said FitzGerald , whose fondness for clergymen 's society was one of his marked characteristics , " you might have conceived that a man has not come to my years without thinking much of these things . I believe I may say that I have reflected on them fully as much as yourself . You need not repeat this visit . " His correspondence , by which mainly the world knows him , is full of interesting revelations . His whims and foibles , and his own gentle amusement over them ; . his bookish likes and dislikes , one as hearty as the other ; his affection for his friends , whose weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notwithstanding , frankness being almost always one of an odd man 's virtues ; his delight in the sea and in his garden ( " Do n't you love the oleander ? I rather worship mine , " he writes to Mrs. Kemble ) ; his pottering over translations from the Spanish , the Persian , and the Greek ( " all very well ; only very little affairs : " he feels " ashamed " when his friend Thompson inquires about them ) ; his music , wherein his taste was simple but difficult ( he played without technique and sang without a voice , loving to " recollect some of Fidelio on the pianoforte , " and counting it more enjoyable " to perform in one 's head one of Handel 's choruses " than to hear most Exeter Hall performances ) , - all these things , and many more , come out in his letters , which are never anything but letters , written to please his friends , - and himself , - with no thought of anything beyond that . In them we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no matter . He might do more with it , perhaps ; hut ciii bono ? At the end of his summer touring he writes : " A little Bedfordshire - a little Northamptonshire - a little more folding of the hands - the same faces - the same fields - the same thoughts occurring at the same turns of road - this is all I have to tell of ; nothing at all added - but the summer gone . My garden is covered with yellow and brown leaves ; and a man is digging up the garden beds before my window , and will plant some roots and bulbs for next year . My parsons come and smoke with me . " What age does the reader give to the author of this paragraph , so full of afternoon shadows ? He was thirty-five . But if he was an idle fellow , careful for nothing , poor in spirit , contented to be the hindmost , devil or no devil , " reading a little , dreaming a little , playing a little , smoking a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he was not without a kind of faith in his own capacity . He knew , or believed that he knew , what he was good for . " I am a man of taste , " he said more than once . If he could not write poetry , - taste being only " the feminine of genius , " - he knew it when he saw it . He read books with // his own eyes , not half so common or easy a trick as many would suppose . And having read a book in that unconventional way , it was by no means to be taken for granted that he would like it , though its author might be one of his dearest friends . And if he failed to like it , he seldom failed to say so . If he commended a book , - a new book , that is , - it was apt to be with a mixture of criticism . He cared little or nothing for flattery himself , and was magnanimous enough to assume ( an enormous assumption ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one friend sends another a book of his own writing , the best course for the second man is merely to acknowledge its receipt , unless he has some fault to indicate ! This he sets down quite simply as his belief and ordinary practice . It was the more comfortable way for both parties , he thought . Perhaps he thought , too , that it was the more conducive to habits of truthfulness . ( Others might conclude that its most immediate and permanent effect would be to discourage the circulation of authors ' copies . ) If he considered Mr. Lowell 's odes to lack wings , he told Mr. Lowell so . If his taste was offended by the style of the Moosehead Journal ( " too clever by half " ) ' he told Mr. Lowell of that also . Why not ? Great men did not resent truth-speaking , but were thankful for it . He was full of wonder and sorrow when he saw Tennyson - who had stopped at Woodbridge for a day to visit him , after a separation of twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennyson had lived an active life , like Scott and Shakespeare , he would have done more and talked about it less . He recalls Scott 's saying to Lockhart , " You know that I do n't care a curse about what I write ; " and he believed that it was not far otherwise with Shakespeare . " Even old Wordsworth , wrapt up in his mountain mists , and proud as he was , was above all this vain disquietude . " If a man is not greater than the greatest things he does , the less said about him and them the better . His work should drop from him like fruit from a tree . Henceforth let the world look after it , if it is worth looking after . The tree should have other business . To say that FitzGerald lived in accordance with his own doctrine in this regard is to say that he lived like a man of dignity and high self-respect , - like an old-fashioned man , - sometimes calJed a gentleman , - one is tempted to say : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote , or angle for a compliment , or whimper over a criticism . Old-fashioned he certainly was , - oldfashioned and conservative . He liked old books , old music , old places , old friends . The adjective is constantly on the point of his pen as a word of endearment : " old Alfred , " " old Thackeray , " " old Spedding " - " dear old Jem . " So , writing to Mrs. Kemble from the seacoast , he says , " Why it happens that I so often write to you from here , I scarce know ; only that one comes with few books , perhaps , and the sea somehow talks to one of old things ; " which was not an unhandsome tribute to an old friend , though the old friend was a woman . He was a " little Englander , " as the word is now . For a nation , as for an individual , great estates were , he thought , more a trouble than a blessing . " Once more I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading nation , like - the Dutch ! " Men of taste are naturally conservatives and moderates . Not that FitzGerald was too nice for the world he lived in . His carelessness about dress , his contentment with mean lodgings , and his liking for the plainest and homeliest service and companionship have already been touched upon . Even in the matter of reading , while he held pretty strictly to the classics ( not meaning the Greek and the Latin in particular ) , he cherished one bit of // freakishness : a great fondness for the Newgate Calendar ! " I do n't ever wish to see and hear these things tried ; but when they are in print , I like to sit in court then , and see the judges , counsel , prisoners , crowd ; hear the lawyers ' objections , the murmur in the court , etc . " So he writes to his friend Allen , at fiftysix . And the passion remained with him , as most things do that are part of a man 's life at fifty odd ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of a matter well understood among his friends : " I like , you know , a good murder ; but in its placeThe charge is prepared ; the lawyers are met - The judges all ranged , a terrible show . ' " * It may be that on this point he was not so very eccentric . Certainly our newspaper editors give the general public credit for having a reasonably good appetite for capital cases . And FitzGerald 's weakness - if it was a weakness - is curiously matched by what we are told of another eminent translator , the man to whom we owe our English Plato and Thucydides . A shy student , Mr. Tollemache says , happened to sit next to Jowett at dinner , and having hard work to maintain the conversation , as such men often had , in Jowett 's unresponsive company , stumbled upon the subject of murder . " To his surprise the Master rose to the bait , mentioned some eause.s bres , and dropped all formality . " Naturally the young Oxonian was surprised ; but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Master of Balliol better than he , the latter said , " If you can get Jowett to talk of murders , he will go off like a house on fire . " There is something of the savage ancestor in all of us . We are wrong , perhaps , to feel astonished that men of the cloister , studious men , never called upon to kill so much as a superfluous kitten , In a letter to his friend Pollock he says : " To-morrow I am going to one of my great treats , namely , the Assizes at Ipswich : where should find an agreeable excitement in a dramatic , second-hand tickling of certain half-dormant sensibilities . If it is ghastly good fun to read of murder in Scott or Dumas , why not in the Newgate Calendar ? Who knows how many tender-hearted , white-handed scholars would enjoy the spectacle of a prize fight , if only the amusement were a few shades more respectable in the public eye ? And how long is it since we saw college men falling over one another in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fever of anxiety lest he should be too late , and so be debarred from the unusual pleasure of killing and being killed ? No ! When FitzGerald called himself a man of taste , he did not mean to confess himself an intellectual prig , with a schoolmaster 's eye for petty failings and a super-refined disrelish for everything short of perfection . As for perfection , indeed , he did not much expect it , whether in human beings or in their works ; and when he found it , he did not always like it . He thought some other things were better . He preferred genius to art : that is to say , he enjoyed high qualities , though accompanied by defects , better than lower qualities cultivated to a state of flawlessness . " The grandest things , " he believed , " do not depend on delicate finish . " Thus in poetry he admired a score of B*ranger 's almost perfect songs , but would have given them all for a score of Burns 's couplets , stanzas , or single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burns had so much more genius , so much more inspiration . In the same way FitzGerald had little patience with some perfect novels , - with Miss Austen 's , to be more specific . They were perfect ; yes , he had no thought of denying that ; but they did not interest him . Even Trollope 's were more to his mind , with all their caricature and careI shall see little Voltaire Jervis , and old Parke , who I trust will have the gout , he bears it so Christianly. " // lessness . Miss Austen is " capital as far as she goes ; but she never goes out of the parlor . " " If Magnus Troil , or Jack Bunce , or even one of Fielding 's brutes , would but dash in upon the gentility and swear a round oath or two ! " Cowell , he adds , reads Miss Austen at night after his Sanskrit studies . " It . composes him , like gruel . " There is no doubt of it , FitzGerald was old-fashioned , especially as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wonderful and aggravating Clarissa Harlowe , " and he read Dickens . " A little Shakespeare  --  a cockney Shakespeare , if you will . . . a piece of pure genius . " So he breaks out after a chapter of Copperfiel4 . " I have been sunning myself in Dickens , " he says at another time . A pretty compliment that , for any man . It is good to hear his praise of Scott . Even those who can no longer abide that romancer themselves - for there are such , unaccountable as the fact may seem to happier men - may well feel a touch of warmth at FitzGerald 's fire . He read fiction - as he read everything else - for pleasure ; and in English no other fiction pleased him so much , taking the years together , as Sir Walter 's . In 1871 he has been reading The Pirate again . He knows it is not one of the best , but he is glad to find how much he likes it ; nay , that is below the mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " With all its faults , often mere carelessness , what a broad Shakespearean daylight over it all , and all with no effort . " He finished it with sadness , thinking he might never read it again . And as he was always reading Scott , and as often praising him , so he was always reading and praising Don Quixote . In 1867 he has been on his yacht . " I have had Don Quixote , Boccaccio , and my dear Sophocles ( once more ) for company on board : the first of these so delightful that I got to love the very dictionary in which I had to look out the words : yes , and often the same words over and over again . The book really seemed to me the most delightful of all books : Boccaccio delightfai too , but millions of miles behind ; in fact , a whole planet away . " In 1876 his mind is the same . " I have taken refuge from the Eastern Question in Boccaccio . I suppose one must read this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each fitting the subject like a glove . ' But there is nothing to come up to the Don and his Man . " Bookishness of this affectionate kind , constantly recurring , would be enough of itself to give the letters a welcome with all kindred souls ; for every reader loves to hear books praised at first hand in this hearty , honest , enthusiastic way , even though they be books that he has never read , and perhaps never expects to read . The happiness is contagious . FitzGerald 's relations with books ( with his books ) were those of a lover . He can never say all he feels about Virgil . Horace he is unable to care about , in spite of his good sense , elegance , and occasional force . " He never made my eyes wet as Virgil does . " When lie reads Comus and Lycidas , even at seventy , it is " with wonder and a sort of awe . " Surely be was a man of taste ; born to be an appreciator of other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taste , - or partly for that reason , - his praise , even in its warmest and most personal expression ( like the words just quoted about Virgil ) , has not only no taint of affectation , but no suggestion of sentimentality . With him , as with all healthy souls , feeling was a matter of moments ; it came in jets , not in a stream ; and its outgiving was always with a note of unconsciousness , of deep and absolute sincerity . His life , inward and outward , was pitched in a low key . He never complained , let what would happen ; he had too much of " old Ginar 's consolation " for that ( too much fatalism , that // is ) ; his own weaknesses , even , he took as they were ; why regret what was past mending ? but his prevailing mood was anything but rhapsodical . All the more effective , therefore , are the outbursts - frequent , but never more than a sentence or two together - in which he utters himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shelf . " The most striking instance of this affectionate absorption , this falling in love with a book , as one can not help calling it , occurred in the last decade of his life . In the summer of 1875 , when his health seemed to be failing , and he was beginning , as he said , to " smell the ground , " he suddenly became enamored of Madame de S*vign* . Till then , in spite of his favorite Sainte-Beuve , he had kept aloof from her , repelled by her perpetual harping on her daughter . Now he finds that " it is all genuine , and the same intense feeling expressed in a hundred natural yet graceful ways ; and beside all this such good sense , good feeling , humor , love of books and country life , as makes her certainly the queen of all letter-writers . " The next spring he wishes he had the " Go " in him ; he would visit his dear S6vign* 's Rochers , as he would Abbotsford and Stratford . The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most friends , has been his companion at the seashore . She now occupies Montaigne 's place , and worthily ; " she herself a lover of Montaigne , and with a spice of his free thought and speech in her . " He sometimes laments not having known her before ; but reflects that " perhaps such an acquaintance comes in best to cheer one toward the end . " Henceforward , year after year , in spring especially , he talks of the dear lady 's charms . " *y blessed S*vign6 , " " my dear old S6vign* , " he calls her ; " welcome as the flowers of May . " Like the best of Scott 's characters , she is real and present to him . " When my oracle last night was reading to me of Dandie Din VOL . LXXXVI. - NO. 517. 40 mont 's blessed visit to Bertram in Portanferry gaol , I said - I know it s Dandie , and I should n't be at all surprised to see him come into this room . ' No - no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scarce right to live so among shadows ; but after near seventy years so passed , que voulez-vous ? " One thinks of what Emerson said , that there is creative reading as well as creative writing . As is true of all readers , every kind of human capacity being limited , FitzGerald found many likely books lying mysteriously outside the range of his sympathies . He loved Longfellow ( and so " could not call him Mister " ) and admired Emerson ( with qualifications - " I do n't like the Humble Bee , and wo n't like the Humble Bee " ) ; and he delighted in Lowell ( the critical essays ) , and " rather loved " Holmes ; but he " could never take to that man of true genius , Hawthorne . " " I will have another shot , " he said . But it was useless . He confesses his failure to Professor Norton . " I feel sure the fault must be mine , as I feel about Goethe , who is yet a sealed book to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as poetry goes . " He supposes there is a screw loose in him on this point . Again he writes : " I have failed in another attempt at Gil Blas . I believe I see its easy grace , humor , etc . But it is ( like La Fontaine ) too thin a wine for me : all sparkling with little adventures , but no one to care about ; no color , no breadth , like my dear Don , whom I shall return to forthwith . " Happy reader , who could give so pretty a reason for the want of faith that was in him . If he lacked patience to write formal criticism , he had the neatest kind of knack at critical obiter dicta . Books were his best friends ; or , if that be too much to say , they were the ones that he liked best to have about him . As for human intimates* - well it is hard to know how to express it , but // he seemed , especially as he grew older , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write to them , not too often , lest they should be troubled about replying , - but he would never visit them ; and what is stranger , he cared little , nay , he almost dreaded , to have them visit him . His house he devoted to his nieces , for such part of the year as they chose to occupy it , reserving but one room to himself . This served for " parlor , bedroom and all , " he tells Mrs. Kemble ; " which I really prefer , as it reminds me of the cabin of my dear little ship - mine no more . " Still the house is large enough . If any of his friends , Tennyson , Spedding , Carlyle , Mr. Lowell , Mr. Norton , or who not , should happen to be in the neighborhood , he would be delighted , truly delighted , to see them ; but none of them must ever undertake the journey on purpose . He could n't render it worth their while , and it would really make him unhappy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no fear of their forgetting him . If they suffered , he suffered with them . If one of them died , he wrote of him in the tenderest and most poignant strain . In January , 1864 , all his letters are full of Thackeray , whose death had occurred on the day before Christmas . He sits " moping about him , " reading his books and the few of his letters that he has preserved . He writes to Laurence : " I am surprised almost to find how much I am thinking of him : so little as I had seen him for the last ten years ; not once for the last five . I had been told - by you , for one - that he was spoiled . I am glad therefore that I have scarce seen him since he was old Thackeray . ' I keep reading his Newcomes of nights , and as it were hear him saying so much 1 In connection with which it is good to remember that when Thackeray , not long before he died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had loved most , he replied , " Why , dear old Fitz , to be sure . " After Fitz of it ; and it seems to me as if he might be coming up my stairs , and about to come ( singing ) into my room , as in old Charlotte Street thirty years ago . " ' Hear him again as he writes of Spedding , the wisest man he has ever known , " a Socrates in life and in death , " who has been run over by a cab in London , and is dying at the hospital : " My dear old Spedding , though I have not seen him these twenty years and more , and probably should never see him again ; but he lives , his old self , in my heart of hearts ; and all I hear of him does but embellish the recollection of him , if it could be embellished ; for he is but the same that he was from a boy , all that is best in heart and head , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And when all is over , and Laurence sends him tidings of the event , this is his answer : " It was very , very good of you to think of writing to me at all on this occasion : much more , writing to me so fully , almost more fully than I dared at first to read : though all so delicately and as you always write . It is over ! I shall not write about it . He was all you say . " How perfect ! And how it goes to the quick ! Not for want of heart , surely , did such a man choose the companionship of books rather than of his fellows . He was born to be a solitary , or believed that he was ; at all events , it was too late now for him to be anything else . Whether nature or he had made his bed , it was made , and henceforth he must lie in it . " Twenty years ' solitude , " he says to Mrs. Kemble , " makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pollock , who has proposed to visit him , that he feels nervous at the prospect of meeting old friends , " after all these years . " He fears they will not find him in person what he is by Gerald 's death Tennyson wrote of him : " I had no truer friend : he was one of the kindliest of men , and I have never known one of so fine and delicate a wit . " // letter . Every recluse knows that trouble . With books it was another story . In their presence he felt no misgivings , no palsying diffidence . They would never expect of him what he could not render , nor find him altered from his old self . If he happened to be awkward or dull , as he often was , they would never know it . And really , with them on his shelves , and with his habit of living by himself , he did not need intellectual society , - just a few commonplace , kindly , more or less sensible bodies to speak with in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the day 's events , and to play cards with of an evening . He was one of the fortunates - or unfortunates - who have a " talent for dullness . " The word is his own . " I really do like to sit in this doleful place with a good fire , a cat and doo* o b n the rug , and an old woman in the kitchen . " He reveled in the pleasures of memory . He loved his friends as they were years ago , - " old Thackeray , " " old Jem , " " old Alfred , " - and only hoped they would love him in the same manner . So his letters are full of the books be has been reading , rather than of the people he has been talking with . But what of his own books , especially of the one that has made him famous ? About that , it must be said at once , the correspondence tells comparatively little . His Persian studies were only an episode in his life , interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like , for instance , his reading of Crabbe , and his long persisted in - never relinquished - attempt to secure for that Suffolk poet the honor rightfully belonging to l*im . Concerning that pious attempt , as concerning a possible republication of some of his translations from the Spanish and the Greek , he left directions with his literary executor ; but not a word about Omar Khayyam . The whole Persian business , indeed , if one may speak of it so , appears to have been largely a matter of friendship , or at least to have been begun as such . Cowell had become absorbed in that language , and enticed his old Spanish pupil to follow him . The first mention of the subject to be found in the published letters occurs in 1853 . FitzGerald has ordered Eastwick 's Gulistan : " for I believe I shall potter out so much Persian. ** Two months afterward he writes to Frederic Tennyson : " I amuse myself with poking out some Persian which E. Cowell would inaugurate me with . I go on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , and enables us to study a little together . " Friendly feeling has served the world many a good turn , but iarely a better one than this . Three or four years later comes the first reference to Omar . " Old Omar , " he says , " rings like true metal . " Now he is translating the quatrains , though he has little to say about them . He finds it amusing to " take what liberties he likes with these Persians , " who , he thinks , are not poets enough to frighten one from so doing . On a first of July he writes : " June over ! A thing I think of with Omar-like sorrow . " Then he is preparing to send some of the more innocent of the quatrains to Fraser 's Magazine , the editor of which has asked him for a contribution . He has begun to look upon Omar as rather more his property than Cowell 's . " He and I are more akin , are we not ? " he writes to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't feel with him in some respects as I do . " He is taking all pains , not for literalness , but to make the thing live . It must live ; if not with Omar 's life , why , then , with the translator 's . And live it did , and does , - " The rose of Iran on an English stock . " The Fraser story is well known , - a classical example of the rejection of a future classic . The editor took the manuscript , but kept it in its pigeonhole ( " Thou knowest not which shall prosper " being as true a text for editors as // for other men 1 ) , and at last FitzGerald asked it back , added something to *t , and printed it anonymously . This was in 1859 . He gave one copy to Cowell ( who " was naturally alarmed at it ; he being a very religious man " ) , one copy to George Borrow , and one - a good while afterward - to " old Donne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder , two hundred , more or less , he presented to Mr. Quaritch , who had printed them for him , and who worked them off upon his customers , as best he could , mostly at two cents apiece . In the course of the next few years three other editions were printed - all anonymously - for the sake of alterations and additions ( a man of taste is sure to be a patient reviser ) , but there is next to nothing about them in the letters . No one cares for such things , the translator says . He hardly knows why he prints them , only that he likes to make an end of the matter . So he writes to Cowell . As for the rest of his correspondents , they are more likely to be interested in other things , - his garden , his boat , his reading . By 1863 he is pretty well tired of everything Persian . " Oh dear , " he says to his teacher , " when I look at Homer , Dante and Virgil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly ! Do n't resent my saying so . Do n't they ? " An English masterpiece had been made , but neither the maker of it nor any one else had yet suspected the fact . The merits of the work seem to have been first publicly recognized in 1869 by Mr. Charles Eliot Norton , in an article contributed to the North American Review . " The work of a poet inspired by the work of a poet , " he pronounces it ; " not a copy , but a reproduction , not a translation , but the redelivery of a poetic inspiration . " " There is probably nothing in the mass of English translations or reproductions of the poetry of the East 1 " Sir , " said Doctor Johnson , " a fallible being will fail somewhere . " to be compared with this little volume in point of value as English poetry . In the strength of rhythmical structure , in force of expression , in musical modulation , and in mastery of language , the external character of the verse corresponds with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it displays . " It would be pleasant to know how appreciation of this kind , coming unexpectedly from a stranger over seas , affected the still anonymous , obscurity-loving translator ; but if he ever read it , or , having read it , said anything about it , the letters make no sign . He and his work were still comfortably obscure . His old friend Carlyle heard not a word about the matter till 1873 , when Professor Norton , who meanwhile had somehow discovered the name of the man he had been praising , mentioned the poem to him , and insisted upon giving him a copy . Carlyle , much pleased , at once wrote to FitzGerald a letter which was undoubtedly meant to be very kind and handsome , but which , read in the light of the present , sounds a little perfunctory , and even a bit patronizing . The translation , he says , is a " meritorious and successful performance . " We can almost fancy that we are listening to a good-natured but truthful man who feels it his duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fairly bright grammar school boy . It was all one to FitzGerald . Perhaps he thought the compliment as good as he deserved . He was getting old - as he had been doing for the last twentyfive years . Persian poetry was little or nothing to him now - " a ten years dream . " The fruit had dropped from the tree ; let the earth care for it . So he returns to his Crabbe , to Sainte-Beuve , to Madame de S6vign* , to Don Quixote , to Wesley 's Journal , and the rest . Such little time as he has to live , he will live quietly . And ten years afterward , when he died , - suddenly , as he had always // hoped , - some one put on his gravestone that most Omnaric of Scripture texts , " It is He that hath made us , and not we ourselves . " Perhaps the words were his own choosing . Certainly no others could have suited him so well . If he had been eccentric , idle , unambitious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he bad been what the Potter made him . " The Ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes , But Here or There as strikes the Player goes ; And He that tossed you down into the Field , He knows about it all - HE kuows - HE knows ! " Since his death his fame has increased mightily . All the world reads Omar Khayytlm andpraises FitzGerald . " His strange genius , so fitfully and coyly revealed , has given a new quality to English verse , almost all recent manifestations of which it pervades . " So says one of the later historians of our nineteenth century literature . And the man himself thought he had done nothing ! Truly the race is not to the swift . " Behold the Grace of Allah comes and goes As to Itself is good : and no one knows Which way it turns : in that mysterious Court Not he most finds who furthest travels for t , For one may crawl upon his knees Life-long , And yet may never reach , or all go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , and - the Door shut in his Face : Whereas Another , scarcely gone a Stride , And suddenly - Behold he is inside !
