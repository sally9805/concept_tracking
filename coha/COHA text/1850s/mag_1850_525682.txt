JOHN CALDWELL CALHOUN . To the City of Charleston , which has recently eahibited a magniEcert and impre*sive funeral pageant , in honor of the illustrious dead , this Memoir is respectfully dedicated . MEMOIR . TuE death of this illustrious citizen , long identified with the public service , and mourned with a depth of sorrow more general , more solemn , and more impressive , than has ever distinguished any statesman since the decease of Washington , renders the tribute of praise , at once an appropriate and first duty . The defesence which men of all classes pay to o're'st abili ties and incorruptihle integrity as a ti ibute due to a sense of the immortaltty of the soul aaA to the eminent supessoHiy of vii tue . When a life is found to b fall of cx hibitions of an exalted mind ud of de votion to principles of honor end mos al ity , men , irrespective of mere difference of opinion , award it , involuntarily , the highest homage of their good opinion . Envy itself , which always accompanies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame and misconstrues his motives , worn out in the contest , perishes on his grave and contemporaries , who are ever distrustful of success , and invidious in concessions to merit , are the first to hang willows over the bier of one , no longer capable of cx&amp;iting jealousy , or of triumphing in the race of life . It has been remarked , not unfrequently , with less of surprise than of disparagement , that Mr. Calhoun had a hold on the affections of the people of South Carolina , unequalled in the history of public men . This veneration for his person and opinions , has often been attributed to the predoaninence of a popular leader over the dependent , yielding mind of the public . This suppo sition is untrue . If asked to state the reason , which more than any other , caused the extraordinary popularity of this state*nian , we would say , it was his stainless honor and incorruptible good faith . Out of these virtues , incomparable as they were , grew his self denial , amidst the promptings of ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a We will not say that , in every instance , Mr. Calhoun saw the future with a perfectly true glance ; or that the objects at which he looked , invariably sent back into Isis orb of vision , a reflection entirely correct , not sometimes broken by the media intervening-not occasionally obscured by rather hastily formed conjecturesBut this we believe - He ever looked at things with honest intent -- with an anxious wish to ascertain the truth , and to avoid evil ; and he both honestly and boldly spoke out what he conceived of the mischiefs or advant.ages presented to his mind . Mr. Calhoun was not ambitious in the sense in which that term has been used with reference to his motives and acts . He was desirous , ardently desirous , of being known as the advocate of the solid truths of politics . For the vanities of the position of a statesman he never longed ; and , therefore , to obtain them , never conciliated or bargained . He fixed his mind on justice , on principle , on the essence of the mutual obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these he poured forth from the copious fountains of his intellect and his heart , the // most brilliant offerings , and most profound devotion . We are confident that for station and dignity , independently of the right and glory of the means by which attained , he eared nothing . " Sir , ** said he to the writer , while in Charleston , on the last journey he made to Washington , " The Presidency has not been in my thoughts for ten ye ' *rs . I would not take public office at the sacrifice of what is due to my own independence , or to my own opinions , still less by waving the most immaterial right to which my fellow-countrymen are entitled . " Mr. Calhoun 's whole life attests the sincerity and truth of this declaration . Like the great Halifax , so powerfully described by Macaulay , his public career shows the prominent fact , that , if ever lie did vary his opinions , the change was never from the weaker to the stronger side . Public sentiment may , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper to be done in a majority of instances ; but it is not always r : ( ght and certainly who withstands it , if he furnishes no evidence of his superiority in judgment , gives incontestable proof of his candor and firmness . From the niass of politicians delineated by history , posterity delights to distinguish those , who amidst great imputed defects of character , and many errors of mind , have still preserved their sentiments inviolate-who , though mingled with all the slanders of the times in which they lived ; and , notwithstanding , the temptations of place ; the corruptions of party , and the persecutions of opponents , have nobly maintained the truth , and resolutely spoken for the right . On the contrary , however successful they mae have been for the period of elevation , and during the exercise of the power of patronage , mankind with one accord , the impious seductions of the age removed , condemn the dishonorable acts of the Machiavels and Woolseys of every time and country . The world is constantly deploring , and yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the weaknesses and illusions of polities . Every revolution is based on a necessity for checking the corruptions of the dynasty preceding ; and yet , the succession falls into the debauchcries of the power existing before . A mild and virtuous leader , raised up for the occasion , possessed of faculties to command the public voice and concentrate its suffrage , 163 scarcely finds himself successful , before he discovers that he must be unjust . All that is violent in partizansliip must succeed to whatever is sacred in principle ; ability and honesty must be sacrificed to expediency , and the fortunate politician must practice guilt as if it were public virtue , and condemn integrity as if it were depravity . The country in which we live presents , it is true , exceptions ; but such have never been successful politicians . Public honors have fled from the statesman most worthy to wear them , and swelled the triumphs of those who have been dissolute in their public lives . When we asse. t that Mr. Calhoun was not one of this latter class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correctness of his views , considered as mere abstract political sentiment . Such a course would not only be disrespectful to those generous *iien who have entertained opposite opinions , and who have opened bosoms , long mailed in the armour of vigorous conflicts , and poured out from theta ma* nanim ous streams of eulogium and eloquence ; but would be unsuited to the solemnity of the occasion of this memoir . As the evil he has done , if any , must be buried with him , so should all recollection of the violent controversies of his day be alike consigned to the tomb . The storms and agitations of the various political questions in which he engaged , have , we hope , passed away ; and friends and enemies alike sorrowing-ahike relieved of prejudices and disarmed of resentments , amidst the dedeparting rays of the sun of his last day , may stand in harmony around his grave , and multiply the records of his memorable devotion to the public service . We do not intend to seek out for approbation or condemnation , any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , produced so much controversy , and in respect to which the people of the United States have been so divided . We seek to give a history of , rather than a criticism on , Mr. Calhoun 's participation in public events . We will not hold a scal&amp; by which to determine his consistency or his fluctuations , if guilty of any . The Tariff , the Bank of the United States , State Rights-on all of these , whatever his views , they were invariably entertained in good faith and frankly expressed . His host in- // veterate encmy* and who has not such , however pure ! will admit this . In political fame , it is not the character of the man 's opinions which is to he considered ; it is the honesty , the truthfulness of his conceptions and of his advocacy of them . We may not dwell too minutely on the nature of a measure proposed . The human mind is forced to view things through such various media , that we may well distrust its judgment . We are compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemning sentiments . But , on questions involving clear principles , we may generally express ourselves without reserve . In measures embracing interests and holding in issue the highest obligations , moral and political , we can decide without inflicting pain or exciting animosities . Of this nature shall be the incidents of Mr. Calhoun 's life , on which we shall hazard approbatory reflections . The circumstance which first brought Mr. Calhoun 's name before the country , was an Address and Resolution , made to the people of Abbeville District , South Carolina , on the occasion of the attack on the Chesapeake by the Leopard . That brutal violation of the laws of nations and of humanity kindled a flame in every part of the Union . His speech in support of war was a fearless exposition of the privileges of American seamen , and an indignant denunciation of the cowardly attack which had violated them , It placed him at once so high in public confidence that he was soon after voted into the State Legislature . There his brief service was distinguished by a masterly defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reviewed the prospects of the country , and predicted the difficulties in which Europe and the United States would soon be involved . He denounced the restrictive system proposed for the redress of our grievances , and pointed to a war with England as both expedient and inevitable . In order to prevent distraction in the Republican party , he proposed the name of Mr. John Langdon , of New Hampshire , for the Vice-Presidency , under Mr. Madison . In 1810 , Mr. Calhoun took his seat in the House of Representatives of the United States . The period was pregnant with portentous prospects . War raged over Europe . The Berlin and Milan decrees of France , and the British orders of council had divided the commerce of the world between these nations . The policy , so earnestly pressed on the consideration of the people of the Union , of Peace and NonInterference , it was not possible for the government to pursue , without abandoning every right dear to the citizen , and forfeiting every claim to the respect of foreign states . The navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and arrogant under the acknowledged title of mistress of the seas , she boldly boarded our vessels , and manned her ships from our crews . Apprehensions that our trade and commerce would sink under resistance , paralyzed for a time the resolution of our people . Embargoes and nonimportation acts were the favorite measures of resistance . At this juncture , Mr. Calhoun entered the arena . He took a prominent part in the efforts to enforce the necessity of immediate preparations for war . The defence of a Report from the Committee on Foreign Relations devolved on him . I-Ic met John Randolph , and Philip Bonlin Key , in the discussion , and placed the question of the propriety of war beyond controversy . His speech wrung laudatory approval from the cautious and capable Mr. Ritchie . He was compared to Hercules with his club ; he was likened in his moral sentiments to Fox ; and when South Carolina was congratulated , it was said that Virginia , full as she was of glorious intel- ' * lect , was not so rich but that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calhoun 's speech on the occasion is valuable , as disclosing striking truths , clothed in apt phrase " We are next told of the expenses of the war , and that the people will not pay taxes . Why not 3 Is it a want of means 3 What , with 1,000,000 tons of shipping ; a commerce of $100,000,000 annually ; manufactures yielding a yearly profit of $150,000,000 , and agriculture thrice that amount ; shall we , with such great resources , he told that the country wants ability to raLe and support 10,000 or 15,000 additional regulars 3 No : it has the ability , that is admitted ; but will it not have the disposition 3 Is not our course just and necessary 3 Shall we , then , utter this libel on the people 3 Where will proof he found of a fact so disgraceful 3 It is said , in the history of the country twelve or fifteen years ago . The case is not parallel . The ability of the // country is greatly increased since . The whiskey tax was unpopular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objection was not so much to the tax or its amount as the mode of collecting it . The people were startled by the ' host of officers , and their love of liberty shocked with the multiplicity of regulations . We , in the spirit of imitation , copied from the most oppressive part of the European laws on the subject of taxes , and imposed on a young and virtuous people the severe provisions made necessary by corruption and the long practice of evasion . If taxes should become necessary , I do not hesitate to say the people will pay cheerfully . It is for their government and their cause , and it would be their interest and duty to pay . But it may be , and I believe was said , that the people will not pay taxes , because the rights violated are not worth defending , or that the defence will cost more than the gain . Sir , I here enter my solemn protest against this low and calculating avarice ' entering this hall of legislation . It is only fit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat of power by its squalid aspect . Whenever it touches sovereign power , the nation is ruined . It is too short-sighted to defend itself . It is a compromising spirit , always ready to yield a part to save the residue . It is too timid to have in itself the laws of self-preservation . It is never safe but under the shield of honor . There is , sir , one principle necessary to make us a great people --   --  to produce , not the form , but real spirit of union , and that is to protect every citizen in the lawful pursuit of his business . He will then feel that he is backed by the government , that its arm is his arm . He then will rejoice in its increased strength and prosperity . Protection and patriotism are reciprocal . This is the way which has led nations to greatness . Sir , I am not versed in this calculating policy , and will not , therefore , pretend to estimate in dollars and cents the value of national independence . I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the slavery of our impressed seamen ; nor even the value of our shipping , commercial , and agricultural losses , under the orders in council and the British system of blockade . In thus expressing myself , I do not intend to condemn any prudent estimate of the means of a country before it enters on a war . That is wisdom , the other folly . The gentleman from Virginia has not failed to touch on the calamity of war , that fruitful source of declamation , by which humanity is made the advocate of submission . If he desires to repress the gallant ardor of our countrymen by such topics , let me inform him that true courage regards only the cause ; that it is just and necessary , and that it contemns the sufferings and dangers of war . If he really wishes well 167 to the cause of humanity , let his eloquence be addressed to the British ministry , and not the American Congress . Tell them that , if they persist in such daring insult and outrages to a neutral nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by honor and safety to resist ; that their patience and endurance , however great , will be exhausted ; that the calamity of war will ensue , and that they , and not we , in the opinion of the world , will be answerable for all its devastation and misery . Let a regard to the interest of humanity stay the hand of injustice , and my life on it , the gentleman will not find it difficult to dissuade his countrymea from rushing into the bloody scenes of war . " Though the first tones of Mr. Calhoun 's voice , in public life , were for war , yet they were justified , we humbly believe , in the eyes of the truest advocate of peace . They were spoken to rouse the country to a declaration of hostilities , for frightful outrages on humanity . The people of the United States have no resentment to indulge , no revenge to gratify . The judgment of Providence has given them the guardianship of that religion and those laws which have so often been the boast and admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those rights , not for itself , not for our citizens alone but for all nations , and for all objects dear to civilization and to man . War is the instrument of God , to punish nations . Communities , as such , can not be avenged in their individuals , for crimes of their rulers . The crimes which might condemn the government , may exempt the citizen ; and if war were not a means in the power of Heaven , the flame of public liberty might be extinguished , and the wrongs of men , as nations , remain forever unredressed . Inexorable tyrants might , with impunity , overrun the peaceful territories of freedom , and millions of suffering human beings be subjected to the most severe political oppressions . When the United States made war on England , these principles were at stake . Had our Government failed to vindicate the aggressions perpetrated , the injuries inflicted on us would have become perpetual exercises of power over the whole civilized world . The United States , in losing her sense of right , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respect , we cease to fear . The nation , now the asylum of the oppressed of all the // earth , the centre of free commerce , and the locality of the altars of unrestrained religion , would have been , if not a feeble colony of Great Britain , at all events a miserable and weak Republic . Mr. Calhoun saw the consequences , and did not hesitate to give his powers to the justification of the principles involved . He sent forth , in trumpet tones , appeals which animated the patriotism of the Anierican peeple , and stirred up the slumbering energies of a previous revolution . He dissipated the selfish views and doubting policy of the few who considered , or were alarmed by the probable results of a war with that powerful country ; and substituted , for these thoughts , a patriotic regard for the honor , the rights , and glory of the Republic . In the crisis , he not only bore away victory from all his opponents , but achieved a triumph over himself , the greatest of all conquests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his soul been capable of a selfish thought , now was the time for ascendancy . Full as he was of honors , crowded at every step with evidences of the approbation of the public , he might have secured any place in the gift of the people . But he had no self love inconsistent with the purity and integrity of his motives ; and , having accomplished the high end for which he had labored , he looked about to see where his country might be next attacked . He saw the weak point in our internal arrangements . He saw a proclivity in the general government to concentrate power , at the expense of the authority of the States and , from that time to the moment of his death , this danger absorbed his thoughts , and directed his course . It was in vain that men looked , and turned away contemptuously , because they did not see what he did . With eyes fixed on the future , he turned neither to the right nor the left . He pointed to the dim speck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the sole image on his min&amp;s eye . He anticipated terrible calamities ; and , to avert them , determined on new , bold , and to many men , alarming preventives . He left the ranks of a well organized , prosperous and conquering party ; a party , on whose eagles victory seemed to have perched with strength all powerful , to take an isolated Dosition , where all said he was fighting with a phan tom . He made all the sacrifices which are thought dear to the human breast . He forebore the pomp and advantage of a majority , to array himself , with little hope of success , or promise of reward , in the ranks of a small and unpopular minority . May we not , without either approving or con - demning the opinions of this great man , yet give him the just award of possessing a resolute , a conscientious soul ? One which justified right , and contested for truth , in the midst of every disadvantage , and upheld what seemed the right amid the severest opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , Mr. Calhoun , against the preconceived opinions of the body of the Republicans , gave his enthusiastic support to measures for the increase of the Navy . To hii* , to Mr. Lowndes , Mr. Cheves and Mr. Clay , are due all praise for fostering , in its infancy , a branch of the national defence , which has won immortal glory for the American name . On the retirement of Mr. Perlor from the position of Chairman on the Committee on Forei*n Relations , the duties of that committee , all exceedingly arduous , fell on Mr. Calhoun . He discharged them with an ability and industry which elicited universal approval . At the session of Congress ensuing , Mr. Calhoun rendered a signal service to the commercial interests of the country . A forfeiture of millions of the capital of the country , vested abroad , and under the shape of merchandize , imported into the country , to avoid loss under the non-importation act , had been prayed to be remitted . This the Secretary of the Treasury had recommended to be done , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Calhoun , with characteristic honesty , supported the prayer of the petition , but denounced the condition . His efforts relieved our merchants of this onerous penalty . The advocacy of the Loan Bill as rendered necessary by the exigencies of the war , gave Mr. Calhoun an opportunity for new displays of eloquence and reasoning . His speech , on that occasion , is a brilliant effort ; the power and effect of which , iii rousing the mind to a just conception of the duty of sustaining the war , transcended the immediate occasion of its delivery . // On the great question of a Bank of the United States , in 1814 , a measure of the Administration , Mr. Calhoun differed from his party . He opposed the bill which sought to carry out this measure , and rejected various propositions of his friends to adapt its provisions to his views . It would be profitless , perhaps invidious , to survey the particulars of the contest on the Tariff of 1816 . A denial of the charge that it was the origin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions , respecting it , have been misrepresented , would awaken slecpin* feuds , in which party predilections would be substituted for arguments . While , on the one hand , Mr. Calhoun is said to be the author of the system , it is , on the other , asserted that circumstances connected with our foreign relations , and not the idea of home protection , justified the support he gave the measure . Both positions have able and honest advocates . Both are , however , under the influence of long favored attachments . Tb ese sensibly affect the judgment ; and like prejudices , growing up with infancy , and long cherished in manhood , are not easily dissipated , even by the rays of reason . Of the like character is the dispute on Mr. Calhoun 's position with respect to setting apart the bonus of the United States Bank , for Internal Improvement . Mr. Calhoun is no longer here to defend his consistency , or to furnish the explanations so necessary to enable inca to arrive at truth . Enemies and friends alike err-the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let the contrast , so far as his memory is concerned , be withdrawn . The gallant Saladin , and the chivalrous Richard of the lion 's heart , did not think it unworthy of their magnanimity or courage to decline a combat long maintained without success to either . The conduct of the war department as Secretary under Mr. Monroe , gave Mr. Calhoun a very high character for close investigation and high administrative talent . The confused and long unsettled accounts of that office engaged his attention , with unremitted industry , for seven years . From an office difficult of management , it became one of ease for his successors . He reformed it in many particulars , cleared its affairs of all embarrassments , and literally brought order out of chaos . In the contest for the Presidency , in which Mr. Adams , General Jackson , Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Clay were the rival candidates , Mr. Calhoun , with rare selfdenial having withdrawn from the field , had the justice awarded him of being placed on nearly all the tickets for the Vice-Presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sea.t as President of the Senate in 1825 , and , by the exercise of much dignity and firmness , brought the position into very great distinction . It was characteristic of Mr. Calhoun , that in all his public acts , he leaned against power . This was never more prominently displayed than in his decision of an important point arising in the debate on the celebrated Panama mission . Mr. Randolph had made on this question a most scathing attack on the administration . In reference to it , Mr. Calhoun , as presiding officer of the Senate , decided that he had no power to restrain a Senator in respect to words spoken in debate . Out of that decision arose a controversy engaging all the powers and prejudices of friends and opponents of the administration No one ever doubted Mr. Calhoun 's honesty of purpose in this decision , or the superiority of his defence , under the signature of " Onslow . " Mingling in the conflicts arising on the Tariff of 1828 , and in connection with the efforts to defeat Mr. Adams on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position to display , in strong light , his extraordinary resistance to party tics in the performance of duty . The contest in respect to the Tariff had nearly equally divided the Senate . To avoid the consequences of a tie vote , Mr. Calhoun , who was on the ticket with General Jackson for the VicePresidency , was advised to withdraw from his seat . He indignantly refused-determined , as he declared , to risk all hope of advancement for himself , rather than shrink from his duty . In order to avoid , however , the possibility of injuring the prospects of General Jackson , he declared his willingness to take his name from the ticket . We pass over various particulars in the history of Mr. Calhoun 's distinguished services in the Cabinet of Mr. Monroe , in the Vice-Presidency and in the Senate , all cx- // hibiting the superiority of his judgment and the sincerity of his attachment to thc Constitution and the Union . We will pause to consider that period , when , having done so much to elevate General Jackson , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the causes of that event - we will not gather up the nearly extinguished sparks from the ashes of that disgraceful and scandalous quarrel , in which the only decency and moderation were displayed by its victim . Two acts of Mr. Calhoun in the sessions of 1814,1815 , and 1816 , have been the subject of frequent animadversion and defence . It will be understood we refer to the bill reported by him to set apart and pledge the bonus of the United States Bank , as a fund for Internal Improvement , and his assent to the policy of the Bank , recommended by Mr. Madison . It is enough to say here , in regard to these measures , that , with respect to the first , Mr. Calhoun , as we understand , has never denied that it was his early impression that the constitutional power of Congress over Internal Improvement was comprehended under the money power . The error , asic believed , of this view , was soon developed , and the promptest confession of it made . In reference to the Bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity for its establishment , in view of the peculiar position of the country and its finances at the time , and not of its general policy or constitutionality . We come to the exciting topic of Sttite Interposition . Out of the opposition of the South to the Tariff of 1828 , this doctrine began to be developed . From the long fallow ground of the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions the seeds of this principle were gathered , and scattered in a new soil . They grew and flourished luxuriantly in the South , and received the early and warm encouragement of Mr. Calhoun . The " South Carolina Exposition and Protest on the Tariff , " adopted by the Legislature of that State , was understood to have been proposed by Mr. Calhoun . The following extract from a document by Mr. Calhoun , embraces the leading features of this doc-trine " The great and leading principle is , that the General Government emanated from the several states , forming distinct political com munities , and acting in theifseparate and sovereign capacity , and not from all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States is , in fact , a compact , to which each state is a party , in the character already described ; and that the several states or parties have a right to judge of its infractions , and , in case of a deliberate , palpable , and dangerous exercise of power not delegated , they have the right , in the last resort , to use the language of the Virginia resolutions , to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil , end for maintaining , within their respective limits , the authorities , rights , and liberties , appertaining to them . ' This right of interposition , thus solemnly asserted by the State of Virginia , be it called what it may , state-right , veto , nullification , or by any other name , I conceive to be the fundamental principle of our system , resting on facts historically as certain as our Revolution itself , and deductions as simple and demonstrative as that of any political or moral truth whatever ; and I firmly believe , that on its recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " I am not ignorant that those opposed to the doctrine have always , now and formerly , regarded it in a very difterent light , as anarchical and revolutionary . Could I believe such , in fact , to be its tendency , to me it would be no recommendation . I yield to none , I trust , in a deep and sincere attachment to our political institutions , and the union of these states . I never breathed an opposite sentiment ; but , on the contrary , I have ever considered them the great instrument of preserving our liberty , and promoting the happiness of ourselves and our posterity ; and , next to these , I have ever held them most dear . Nearly half my life has passed in the service of the Union , and whatever public reputation I have acquired is indissolubly identified with it . To be too national , has , indeed , been considered by many , even of my friends , to be my greatest political fault . With these strong feelings of attachment , I have examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine in question ; and so far from anarchical or revolutionary , I solemnly believe it to be the only solid foundation of our system , and of the Union itself , and that the opposite doctrine , which denies to the states the right of protecting their several powers , and which would vest in the General Government ( it matters not u0 what department ) the right of determining , exclusively and finally , the powers delegated to it , is incompatible with the sovereignty of the states and of the Constitution itself , considered as the basis of a Federal Union . As stromig as this language is , it is not stronger than that used by the illustrious Jefferson , who said , to give the General Goveramnent the fir*al and exclusive right to judge // of its powers , is to make its discretion , and not the Constitution , the measure of its powers ; ' and that in all cases of compact between parties having no common judge for itself , as well of the infraction as of the mode and measure of redress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can higher authority be adduced . " But how shall we treat this important period in Mr. Calhoun 's life ? How speak of his views , without giving offence ? How shall we mention the arguments , and relate the incidents of Nullification , without awakening the prejudices and heart-burnings of the times ? How shall we do justice to Mr. Calhoun 's sentiments , without wronging the sentiments of others ? The cause that produced this fearful controversy was removed . The quarrel which shook the faith of men in the stability of our government , was adjusted . Great God ! bless the noble spirits who substituted peace for war ! Immortal be the memory of the statesmen who looked beyond the animosities of a moment-who , in the midst of the excesses of the times , animated by holy emotions of patriotism , resolved , by honorable concession and compromise , to preserve and perpetuate the union of these States During the pendency of this question , the most momentous that ever agitated the country , Mr. Calhoun engaged into an intellectual conflict with Daniel Webster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The* rolling words of the great New Englander came like the swelling bosom of the great father of waters , exciting terrible apprehensions of danger to the Union . The keen logic , the clear conceptions of his opponent , filled the whole horizon with effulgence . While the giants were contesting the field , victory now inclining to the one , now to the other , the issue uncertain-dreaded by all men , the great chieftian of compromises stepped into the arena , and threw up the weapons of the combatants . He , whose life was ever superior to the advantage of the moment . He , who revives , in our tune , the most glorious conceptions of Cicero . He , who , when others strove for the triumphs of party , snatched from destiny the victories of conciliation ; introduced his celebrated bill of Compromise , and dispelled the storm . Mr. Calhoun was not behind Henry Clay in magnanimity and love of country . If not the first to pro. - pose the compromise , he was the first to accept it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Southern Presidency , he would never have gone forth so readily to accept , on the part of the South , the proffered olive branch . He stood first in the Northern States . Never had the people of these States been so united in opposition , never so warm in their confi .. dence in Mr. Calhoun Had their Union been dissolved , he would have been the first spirit in the South ; and this he knew . But no one rejoiced more than he did , that the day of tranquility had returned . That the conflict was at an end , and the Union saved . In the most inclement season , he hurried to South Carolina , where resistance had assumed a most decided aspect , arid , by his influence , induced the State to yield to peaceful interference . No man in the United States could have produced the result but Mr. Calhoun : and the anxiety with which he pressed this Compromise , attests , beyond question , his love for the Union . Dissimulation has never found a place in Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confederacy , he would have avowed the wish fearlessly , and without equivocation . But lie believed that the dangers of a consolidation were upon us ; and if , out of his intense study of a means to avert them , he came to conclusions , and pressed abstractions , the truth of which did not strike other men , it does not follow that he was not entirely honest in his belief of their efficacy and veracity . Shall we prohe further the wounds of this controversy ? Shall we draw aside the pall covering the relics of a strife , at rest , we trust , for all future time ? Shall we , like opposin* fanatics , a s was done in the case of William , the Norman , engage in repeated exhumations , in order to indulge in the ostentation of repeated funeral services ? Who would be benefitted , who convinced ? Let the storm rest ! The winds are still ! The surface of the sea is calm and undisturbed . The clouds are receding from the overhanging canopy , and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , the successor of that whichycsterday declined in clouds , is beginning to rise , and pour its healthful rays over the land . Brethren of the same household are rejoicin* , in its splendor . May it warm and // light them forever ! May no dismal shadows intervene , and obscure its beams-but , full of luxuriance , may the land teem with life , all busy in the ark of peace , all faithful in devotion to the Union On the adjustment of the Tariff question , Mr. Calhoun gave himself , with great energy , to his labors as a Senator , in the more general measures in which the country was interested . Attached as he had been from principle to the party of General Jackson desirable as it evidently was on the part of his friends to bring about a reconciliation , and to aid the administration with his talents and influence , he did no act , he said no word , indicating a desire to reconcile past difibrences , or to avail himself of support . He felt he had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successes of compliance . He displayed his independence of party ties prominently in the memorable debate on the Removal of the Deposites ; - he condemned the dismissal of Mr. Duane , as an abuse of power ; and , though he exposed such defects of a national bankin* system , lie did not hesitate to deny the right of the Secretary to withhold the deposits , while the Bank performed its obligations faithfully . He predicted in a speech of extraordinary ability , various errors in the management of the currency . He denounced , with temperate but decided expression , the reception of the celebrated Protest of the President ; and placed the powers of the several departments of the Government under the Constitution in a novel and satisfactory light . He raised by motion a Committee of Inquiry into the abuses of Executive patrona* , e - the able report of which committee , prepared and submitted by himself , astounded the country as to the extent of that corrupt system ; and produced a more powerful and just reaction against the administration than any effort of its avowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the powers of a National Bank , and of State Banking institutions , as vehicles for the dispensin* of the money patronage of Khe Government , he conceived and advocated the adopting the principle of that scheme , since carried into effect under the name of the Sub-Treasury . The Specie Circular next occupied his attention . He denied the authority of the President to issue the order on which it was based ; but regarding the mischiefs of the step as beyond remedy , declined votinn* on*t tion of its revision , he quesIt was at this juncture that the political sky began to overcast with the approaching Abolition storm . The immediate fears on this subject was removed by the firmness of Mr. Calhoun , who , forsc*eino. the d receiving petitions on this typic , anger of which began to overload the tables of Congress , by his arguments and influence , procured the settlement of a precedent against their reception . On the question of the admission of 1Iichigan , the danger spread again . Mr. Calhoun , was opposed to admitting a State on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a territory . His views are presented in the following brief extract " My opinion was , and still is , that the movement of the people of Michigan , in forming for themselves a State constitution , without waiting for the assent of Congress , was revolutionary , as it threw off the authority of the United States over the territory ; and that we were left at liberty to treat the proceedings as revolutionary , and to remand hem to her territorial condition , or to waive the irregularity , and to recognize what was done as rightfully done , as our authority was alone concerned . " A territory can not he admitted till she becomes a State ; and in this J stand on the authority of the Constitution itself , which expressly limits the power of Congress to admit new states into the Union . But , if the Constitution had heen silent , he would indeed he ignorant of the character of our political system , who did not see that states , sovereign and independent communities , and not territories , can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Republic . States , and not territories , form its component parts , bound together by a solemn league , in the form of a constitutional compact . In coming into the Union , the state pledges its faith to this sacred compact : an act which none but a sovereign and independent community is competent to perform ; and , of course , a territory must first he raised to that condition before she can take her stand among the confederated states of our Union . How can a territory pledge its faith to the Constitution l It has no will of its own . You give it all its powers , and you can at pleasure overrule all her actions . If she enters as a territory , the act is yours , not hers . her consent is nothing without qour authority and sanction . Can you , can Congress become a party to the constitutional compact * I-low absurd . " // This view of the subject was novel then  - -  it is novel now . The question has been since raised on the admission of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been entirely overruled . Our limits will not permit us to follow Mr. Calhoun 's brilliant career through the minor phases of his public life . We pass to two great and wonderful cxhibitions of his mind and integrity . We leave out of view his able speeches on the MeLoud matter ; Mr. Crittenden 's resolutions to permit the interference of executive officers in elections ; the Veto power ; the Bankrupt bill ; and look to his services on the Oregon question . In this controversy Mr. Calhoun saw but the great interests of the nation , and the justice of her position . 1-Ic became the great , the leading advocate of peace . He threw his influence into the scale at the very moment when that influence was most needed , and could be most powerfully felt . He performed an act which both God and man approved . He rose superior to the excitements of the occasion . He repelled from his breast the national feelings , which so frequently rule the judgment .. He rejected the prejudices which grow up in the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anticipated the happiness of millions . Few can estimate the value of Mr. Calhoun 's services in the adjustment of this international difficulty . Had Mr. Calhoun no other claim to the favor of his countrymen , that were enough to secure for his name immortality . We are disgusted with the idea of the crime and guilt which would have followed a war with Great Britain on the Oregon question ; and in proportion to our detestation of an unjust war rises our respect for Mr. Calhoun 's noble effort to avert it . We almost tremble when we survey the consequences which would have ensued . We blush to view the pretexts set up for a resort to arms . Is our nation - one boasting its foundation on principles of pacification and good order , to go to war , only for success ? Are human beings , proud of their residence in a land of liberty and laws , to contest as wild beasts , vaunting of their strength and struggling only for spoils ? Is the commerce of all civilized countries to be wrecked , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to be butchered , and widows and or-173 phans to be left mourning , merely to gratify the ambition of party leaders , and to minister to the vain externals of polities ? Who-what advocate of that war ever promised himself , or his country , or the cause of humanity , a single advantage which it were not a crime to boast ? Who , in seeing that chivalrous spirit who interposed his magnanimous efforts to remove all cause of difficulty , did not feel honor , truth , justice , were all vindicated in their own temple , and the cause of universal peace among men subserved ? It is scarcely necessary for us to say that there are many things in the course of Great Britain we do not approve . But , we also declare , there are some things we venerate and respect . Our memory dwells with pleasure on the fact , that we have sprung from her ; that we have been taught the purity of , our language , amidst the glorious remains of her literature , and to appreciate the beauties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We take delight in the recollection that we were instructed by her in our Religion and Laws , and in our first rudiments of civil freedom . That her Magna Charta extends its rays to our institutions , and that the blood of Russell and Sydney sprinkled the door-posts of our dwellings , and exempted us from political death . To us , with these emotions , the settlement of the cause of this last dispute brought the noblest reflections . And to the memory of him , who , more than any patriot and statesman , was the instrument , nay , the conqueror , of peace , we would give the best and highest rewards which a grateful country can bestow . Scarcely had this affair been settled , before another cloud rose on the horizon . The long agitated question of interference with slavery in ' the District of Columbia , and the new territories , was opened to wide and intemperate debate . Ever jealous of the slightest invasion of the constitutionever believing the South , in respect to this institution , in peril , Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It were fruitless to open the book of this controversy over Mr. Calhoun 's bier . The South knows the wrong done her in regard to this topic ; she knows the moral and political influences that crowd around the question ; but the whole world knows her arguments of right , and her means of re // pelling attack . She will make no boast of her chivalry , and hesitate long to anticipate the judgment of posterity as to her patriotism . If these have not been attested in many well fought fields in the Revolutionary and late wars , she claims no privilege of being further heard . On the facts of her slave institutions she makes no explanation , and requires no apology . She will arbitrate mere differences of opinion with any power , but will yield no right in which the integrity of the Constitution and the principles of political liberty are at issue . For the protection of those , she places herself on the moral force of natural laws , and will never resort to physical means of defence , till all peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is Disunion ? " Not so . Much as we revere the institutions of our State-far as we would commit ourselves for their preservation - we can not doubt , we never have doubted , we never will doubt the virtue of loving the Union , and guarding its inviolability . It is true , as was said by Mr. Calhoun , declarations will not preserve it . But it is equally true that sentiments give direction to actions . Though the greatest security of it will be found in the most faithful observance of the obligations of the Constitution ; this fact does not forbid our contemplating with alarm the consequences of a dissolution . This great confederacy of States , considered irrespective of a centralizing power , which might be used as a means of destruction to the authority of the States severally , viewed in connection with the history of its origin , with the characters of the immortal men who originated and have sustained the Union ,  --  . certainly is beyond all value . No speculation can be indulged as to its worth to posterity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of appreciation can be formed to designate its relative price , it is a sacred heir-loom of a family , having higher claims to respect than its age or its parents ; its value consists in the memory of the ancestry which first achieved it ; in the honorable recollections of the triumphs amidst which it was won and worn . Its worth is at once moral and traditionary . It is full of past glory , of present respect , of future hope . It is the title , the dignity , the birth-record of freedom ; the evidence of all that is noble in the history of her noblest contests . Adorning and enriching the story of our country , it comes to us fragrant with proofs of struggles and successes which were national at first , are national now , and should be national to the last . How can this relic be divided ? Who shall take Bunkerhill , Eutaw , Saratoga , or the Palmetto Fort in the partition of these glories ? How , when we come to make up the list of the sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? Long be the period removed , when posterity shall throng about the resting places of the illustrious dead , and prepare to divide the sacred inheritance We approach the close of Mr. Calhoun 's life . The human mind must necessarily pass through a trial , when in great calamity it is called to recognise the superior wisdom of God 's judgment , and to practice resignation amidst its griefs . The vivid intellect was declining at a time of great danger to the principles he bad so long defended , and which had so long filled his thoughts . On one occasion he said , he desired to be heard as one asking nothing for himself , but whose only wish was to see his country free , prosperous and happy . The same sentiment was on his lips when he died . The man who conquers the cruel terrors of death-who looks in the trying moment of dissolution , not on his own immortality on earth , but to the immortality of his country-who , anxious for her liberty , overcomes the shock of disease , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his devotion to the perpetuity of the Constitution , - is surely a Patriot . The confessions of one whose whole life we have distrusted , force themselves on the belief , when they come forth in the instant of dissolution . How much more solemn and impressive the admonitions of one whose long life , exhibiting the utmost purity of private character , and the firmest displays of patriotic self-denial , dying with a prayer for his country on his lips ! Such was the life , such the death of Mr. Calhoun . On his cenotaph let that be written , to which his life was a martyrSincerity . Long in his native State-long in the history of his nation-will his memory illustrate the character of the true statesman , and furnish uncommon inducements to a life of virtue . The implacable hatred which pursued him  --  the secret envy that misrepresented him - are dead ! A // qwq
