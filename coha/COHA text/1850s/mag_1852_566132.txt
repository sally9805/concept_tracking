txt ART . VL-LITCHFIELD COUNTY CELEBRATION . Litchfteld County Centennial Celebration , held at Litchfield , Coan. , 13th and 14th of August , 1851 . Hartford : Published by Edwin Hunt , No.6 , Asylum street , 1851. 8vo. pp. 212 . Tan county of Litchfield is one of the most interesting parts of Connecticut . Its scenery , its soil , its productions , are all peculiar . The influence of these natural peculiarities has been strikingly manifested in the character of its population . This county , unlike most portions of New England , has had a character of its own , and it furnishes the materials for a separate and peculiar history . The traveler , who , starting from the // valley of the Connecticut , takes his way westward , after ascending the basaltic range that first meets his eye , looks across the Farmington valley before him , and descries in the distance a series of hills lying in nearly parallel lines , one rising above the other , as far as the eye can trace them . The general direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valleys divide them , made on the east by the Farmington river and its branches ; and farther west by the tributaries of the Housatonic and their branches . If the traveler follows either of these valleys westward , he will find himself , sooner than he is aware , surrounded by abrupt and lofty hills , and in the midst of a rough and broken country ; or , if he boldly breasts the hills , after crossing the sandy ridge that bounds the Farmington valley on the west , he encounters the granite ridges that give character to the surface , the soil and the scenery of the greater part of Litchfleld county . These ridges , as we have already said , run in general in a southwesterly direction and are separated by valleys more or less defined , into some of which you descend to a moderate depression , while into others , as those of . the Naugatuck and the Shepaug , you are tumbled down into deep and gloomy gulfs , overhung by precipices of granite and shaded by masses of hemlock forest . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre of the county from east to west , are situated the towns of Goshen and Litchfield . These ridges to the southward deeline into somewhat gentler slopes . Northward they are expanded into elevated plateaus , or table lands . The tops and sides of some of them are rough and rocky , tasking the strength and the wits of the laborer , while those of others are beautifully smooth , furnishing a surface inviting to the mower and the ploughman . The soil is tenacious and moist , and the climate cold , so that the whole region is marked by nature as adapted to grazing and those annual crops which are appropriate to a grazing district . The valleys and sunny slopes yield good and tolerably certain returns when planted with indian corn , but the great staple of the hill country is grass . As you pass over these ridges , you are suddenly arrested by the deep and narrow valley of the Housatonic , which cuts its winding course eight hundred feet below the hill tops of the county , and is lined on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descend into this valley and thread your way northward or southward , you are surprised to find that its narrow limits include lower hillocks and easy slopes that creep up the granite mountain on either side , of a formation almost unknown in Connecticut . Their rounded tops often bared of soil down to the rock , reveal the limestone beneath , while the // luxuriant growth of wheat and maize shows that an unusual and stimulating material is present in the dry and at first sight unpromising loam that constitutes the soil . This lime rock formation occurs everywhere in the valley , through the entire length of the county , now opening into wider levels , and shooting out into the narrow valleys that are crowded by the overshadowing mountains , or diminished to a scanty ribbon of rock as the great ranges that attend upon the Housatonic push themselves into the brawling stream . As the valley is expanded at New Milford , in a new direction northeastward , the limestone range thrusts itself along the Aspetuck , in the town of Washington , where it piles itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many years for marble . In Canaan , at the northern extremity of the county , the same formation has yielded for generations much of the lime for the eastern part of Connecticut . But after reaching the valley of the Housatonic , you have still another ridge to climb or to thread , before you gain the western limit of the State , and pass over into that region which was once the dread of all good federalists and lovers of the steady habits of Connecticut-the region where common schools were not sustained and sabbath traveling was not forbidden by law . As you gain the summit of this ridge , there are points from which prospects of unrivaled rivaled beauty , reveal the luxuriant valleys and hills of Dutchess county , which extend westward to the Catskills , ever looming upwards with their dark and peculiar blue . On the west side of this ridge lies the limestone that stretches itself onward to the Hudson , which in the little that is left of Connecticut , spreads itself out into the magnificent slopes of Sharon , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give such a charm to the unsurpassed scenery of Salisbury . South and westward of Sharon lies a valley of the same formation , if possible of still lovelier aspect , which once belonged to Litchfield county , but was bartered away to New York by a bargain in which the Dutch for once were too sharp for the Yankees . To give still greater importance to the valley of the Housatonic , its vicinity abounds with the finest iron ore in America , while the precipitous and otherwise worthless mountains that bound the valley on either side , and the proud sea of mountain tops called the Taconick range , have furnished for generations the fuel to reduce the ore . The reader of this sketch of what nature has done for Litchfield county , will readily believe us , when we add that its scenery is various and interesting . The traveler or resident who has climbed the hills and threaded the valleys ; who has been re // freshed by the breezes on the heights and gazed at their evervarying outline from the valleys ; who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has admired the lakes and been delighted by the waterfalls , which are so numerous and yet so unlike each other , will agree with the opinion which we express , that a thorough exploration of this portion of Connecticut will repay the most fastidious tourist , and will be likely to be followed by a second visit . The peculiarities of soil , of situation , of climate and of resources which we have noticed , have exerted a marked influence upon the population . It is not common to speak with freedom of the peculiarities of our near neighbors and fellow citizens . We presume , however , no offense will be taken at our friendly observations , even if they are free . The severe climate and the ungenial and rocky soil have given vigorous frames and a ruddy hue to the inhabitants . The stern blasts of winter and the never-ceasing breezes of summer have left their mark upon almost every man and woman . The effort required to wrest a subsistence from the soil has toughened the fibres of their muscles , and hardened their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the very necessities of dairy-farming ; the farms are larger than in the more fertile sections of the State , and the dwellings are farther asunder ; to say nothing of the influence of steep hill sides , of extensive marshes , and large intervals of rock and mountain in separating still more widely the farm houses . As the consequence of the sturdier character and the isolation of the people , personal independence and selfreliance are their prominent characteristics . When these take a good direction they lead to strength of intellect , to clearness of judgment and to firmness in good purposes ; when they go wrong they develop themselves into contented ignorance and dogged obstinacy and recklessness of character , beyond the common measure . We doubt whether any community of the same numbers can furnish more originals , or those which are more strongly marked , than Litchfield county . The isolation which we have noticed , makes the people social rather than otherwise . They are not over-crowded and satiated by society , and hence when their duties at home are done , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a peculiar heartiness . They are fond of reading , and in general well informed , though different towns differ very greatly , according to the religious and intellectual culture which they have enjoyed . It rarely happens that a student from Litchfield county , who goes from home to the academy or the college , fails to appreciate the advantages with which he is favored , or // to use them with a wakeful and energetic intellect . The inhabitants , though till within a few years in a remote and rather inaccessible region , have not been isolated from or ignorant of , the world . Many of them have been accustomed to be on the saddle in long and frequent excursions for the purchase and sale of cattle . The manufacturing and mechanical business of many communities have forced others to be often abroad , and most of all , the constant and never-ceasing emigration from the county has covered the whole land with cousins from every household to the remotest degree , multitudes of whom have reflected upon the family circle on the hills , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nowhere is the geography of our new States better understood ; nowhere do you hear more frequent and intelligent conversation respecting the scenery and resources of these States ; nowhere do the proofs present themselves so strikingly at every point , that the people have been accustomed to travel . Certainly there is nowhere greater thrift . Strange as it may appear to those who contrast these hard and rough looking hills with the smooth and fertile meadows to which they are accustomed , there are no farmers who live in greater comfort , who dwell in better houses or who lay aside larger gains , than the farmers of - Litchfield County . The traveler is surprised at the neat and comely appearance of the dwellings , and often in some secluded valley or on some far off hill , is astonished to see the evidence of taste and neatness , which he is sure must be owing to the desire of the inmates to please themselves , for the stranger is certain it will rarely happen that any one else will come so far to enjoy or commend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers of this county is strikingly contrasted with the indolence and neglect that are occasionally , perhaps not unfrequently , exhibited , by the farmers on some of the richest levels of the Connecticut . It may be owing in some measure to the ready sale at good prices of all the products of a grazing district . The principal cause however is the stern necessity for effort , with the habits of early toil and exposure , the wakefulness of intellect and the indomitable and intelligent enterprise , which are enforced by the severe but wholesome teachings of climate and soil . As a consequence of this general thrift , property is more equally distributed and the majority of the people are more nearly equal in all respects , and this in its turn fosters independence and self-reliance . These traits of character may now and then be perverted to self-conceit and self-will , but they are far better than servility and abject dependence . // It ought not to be surprising , that such a population should , under republican institutions , be strongly interested in politics , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their neighbors develop an intense regard for their individual rights , and are apt to be sensitive to real or imagined wrongs . Those who are accustomed to contend with nature and to breast themselves manfully to the sternest encounters with her forces , are not easily frightened by the threats of their fellow men . Those whose existence is a continued effort , a struggle ever renewed , enter upon a ldwsuit or political contest as a kind of diversion . Those who are intelligent enough , or think they are , to form an opinion in regard to every question , whether of local or national policy , are fond of discussing such topics , and are always furnished with well settled opinions . They are familiar with the principles and practices of courts of law , and their strong and acute discernment fastens upon such subjects , with an awakened interest and an intense satisfaction . Whatever is read on such subjects is pondered , digested and thoroughly mastered . It is generally thought of before it is talked about , so that opinions direct conversation rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes his weekly paper , and gives to it a thorough reading , fighting a tough battle with everything which he dislikes , and making as thoroughly his own whatever he approves . He does not , like the New York merchant , glance at the leader of his morning journal , while swallowing his breakfast or crossing the ferry , and then turn to his neighbor to know what to think of it . The farmer may be slow , but he is sure and decided ; the merchant may be quick and showy , but he is likely to be flip pant and vacillating .. To know how deeply an interest in politics and law enters into all the habits of thought and feeling of this population , one must live among them . The conceited student fresh from his books , or " the nice young * nurtured upon the conventionalities of artificial life , who expects to find them " talk of bullocks " only , will learn to his confusion , that they can talk of higher themes , and that they talk with a positiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One striking consequence of this tendency to law and politics has been the immense number of distinguished lawyers and statesmen who are natives of Litchfield county or sons of its emigrants . So far as these tendencies are earthly they need a strong counteracting force , and this force is furnished in the religious faith of the people . This faith is not the blind and unreasoning subjection of the Catholic devotee , nor is it the amiable deference which is cherished by the roystering esquire and the hob-nailed // peasant for the English church , but it is the intelligent faith of the New England Calvinist , who delights in his faith , not merely because it gives peace to his conscience and kindles hope in sorrow and in death , but because it tasks his intellect by the loftiest themes of human inquiry , and employs his enterprise and energy in actual work for the extension of Christianity . To such a population an intelligent clergy is and must be one of the most valued blessings of earth , and their best affections cluster around the dwelling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instructions that quicken and guide their intellects , as well as kindle their affections and confirm their faith . The clergy of Litchfleld county have been inferior to none in the world for theological acumen and for pastoral fidelity and zeal , and the impress of their influence may be traced in every dwelling and on every mind . This district was settled at a later period than any other portion of the State . The first century has just elapsed since it was organized as a county ; and settlements within its limits were rare till twenty-five years before this organization took place . For nearly an entire century after the settlement of Hartford and New Haven , it was an unbroken and uninhabited forest . The tribes of Indians which were found upon the Pomperaug and the Housatonic , are believed to have been remnants of the larger tribes , who fled before the wasting and the wars of the first century , and were redrganized in this secluded and unknown district . The early inhabitants of the Connecticut Colony looked upon these ridges and mountains of forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast and terrible unknown , the symbol of eternity , not merely from their vastness , but from the fact that they suggested the dread of the savage Mohawk , who claimed the forest lands of Litchfield and Berkshire counties as his own , and who issued from their fastnesses at his capricious will , to strike terror into the colonists on the Connecticut , and the Indian tribes who clung to the white man for protection . But the pressure of population and the desire of wealth drove new adventurers over its hills from the east , and into its valleys from the south and west . The first town , Wood bury , was settled in 1674 ; New Milford , the second , in 1707 ; Colebrook , the last , in 1795 . The county was organized in 1751 , and it was at the expiration of the first century since justice first took her seat upon " Litchfield Hill , " that the celebration was held , of which the volume before us is the memorial . The volume consists of a record of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address by the Hon. Samuel Church , Chief Justice of the State , of a Poem by Rev. // John Pierpont , and a sermon by Horace Bushnell , D. D. , together with sundry letters from natives of the county , also short addressess from several gentlemen who were present , and a number of poetic effusions which were elicited by the occasion . No eye witness will forget the scenes of those two memorable days of August . The Hill of Litchfield never showed so proud a spectacle . The situation of this village is admirably adapted to give interest to such an occasion ; crowning as it does one of the highest yet smoothest hills of the whole region , it commands in some directions a view of the most distant parts of the county , and might be seen for miles by the assembling tribes who were literally forced to go up to the place of their joyful solemnities . Indeed , there is perhaps no village so small as this in the Union , which from its conspicuous situation and its more conspicuous memories of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene of such an anniversary . We are quite certain that there is no county which does not include a capital , that could summon so noble a train of descendants , or that could point those descendants to so noble an ancestry . The town itself , once the seat of a law school , where more great lawyers and great statesmen received their legal education than at any single school in the Union , at a time too when lawyers and statesmen found in the state of the country an open , a worthy and an exciting field ; the seat also of one of our first established and widely celebrated female schools ; the resort in summer of many distinguished visitors , and more than all , the resi* dence of some of the ablest and purest men whom the country has ever known-was itself eminently fitted to awaken befitting associations , since almost every dwelling is connected with the name of some family known and honored by the majority of the inhabitants . The celebration was observed with enthusiasm by the crowds who assembled , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The address of Judge Church contains much information of an interesting character in respect to the history of the county , though it is arranged in a manner not entirely methodical and occasionally deformed by serious inaccuracies of language . As a whole , however , it is a valuable contribution to the history of the county and of the State , and will remain as a permanent record of many facts and names , which would otherwise have been forgotten . We appreciate fully the evidences of pains* taking and research which it exhibits , and express with pleasure the gratitude which we are sure the public will feel to the au* thor . In reading it we have noticed here and there a sentence or paragraph which , to say the least , excited our surprise . We // give the following : " I shall not detain you with an eulogium on Puritan character . This may be found stereotyped everywhere - not only in books and speeches , but much more accurately in its influence and effects , not in New England alone , but throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same men and inheritors of the same principles , by which Magna Charta was established at Runnymede . They were Anglo-Saxons inspired with the same spirit of independence which has marked them everywhere , and especially through the long period of well-defin*d English History , and which is destined in its further developments to give tone and impress to the political and religious institutions of Christendom . So much has been said and written of the Puritans , I have sometimes thought that some believe that they were a distinct race , and perhaps of a different complexion and language from their other countrymen ; whereas they were only Englishmen , generally of the plebeian caste , and with more of the energies and many of the frailties and imperfections common to humanity . If our first settlers here cherished more firmly the religious elements of their character than any other , the spirit of independence to which I have alluded developed another  --  the love of money and an ingenuity in gratifying it . " it strikes us that this paragraph is a good example of the rhetorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its appearance . Did the author commence with some glow of feeling towards the Puritans , but instead of being gradually warmed by his theme , was he gradually chilled the more he contemplated it , till in a moment his warmth dropped to zero and his flow of kindly enthusiasm was arrested by a sudden frost ? Or does he differ so far in point of taste from the majority of chroniclers on such occasions , that instead of dilating with ardor on the virtues of a worthy ancestry , being a " little blind " to their faults , he thinks it more becoming to reverse the ordinary rule ? Or did he fear that the old Puritans of Litchileld county , many of whom he knows to be stiff and fervid enough , were so much in danger of being intoxicated with enthusiasm on this exciting occasion , that prudential considerations made it wise for him to administer the sedative of nil admirari in the form of a shower bath ? But is this a fair account of the Puritans ? Are the facts alledged true ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like other liberty-loving Englishmen and moved only by the same principles which animated the Anglo-Saxon race ? Is it true that they were generally of the " plebeian caste ? " If they were so it is a charge which is hardly a reproach in this democratic // country . The Puritans were not indeed to any great extent of noble families , but they belonged to the better portion of the middling classes , many of them being men of education , all of the clergy graduates of the universities , most of them possessed of competent estates , and all elevated above what is properly called the plebeian caste . They were no more plebeian than ninety-nine out of every hundred whom the author was addressing are of the plebeian caste in Litchfield county , and to whom such a characteristic was presented , as it seems to us , with the worst possible grace , as a reason why they should not esteem too highly their Puritan ancestry . We remember that John Locke said of these men of " the plebeian caste , " that " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest of the wheat . " Or , is it true that the Puritan spirit of independence has developed in their descendants in an extraordinary measure " the love of money and an ingenuity in gratifying it ? " So far as this ingenuity in making money is peculiar to the Yankees , it has been developed within the present century , since the Puritan spirit has ceased to give the entire character to New England . But are the descendants of the Puritans more remarkable for the love of money than the canny Scotchman , or the grasping Englishman , or the frugal Dutchman , or the miserly German , or the hoarding Irishman ? Not at all . That they are independent and ingenious is true , but to set off this as a term of reproach against the religious fervor of the Puritans , . as though a sneer at the one would abate admiration for the purity of the other , is , to say the least , not in good taste . Another passage arrested our attention . " I have already suggested that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the first emigrants to Plymouth and Massachusetts . The churches were insulated and in a manner shut out from the disturbing causes which had agitated other portions of the colony . I do not learn from that full and faithful chronicler of religious dissensions , Dr. Trumbull , that there was in the county so much of the metaphysical and subtle in theology as had produced such bitter effects at an earlier time , in the churches at Hartford , New Haven , Stratford and Wallingford . The pastors were men of peace , who had sought the retired parishes over here in the hills and valleys without much pride of learning and without'ambitious views . " This would be all very well , if there were furnished in the history of the churches of the county any striking proofs that they were inferior to those of other parts of Connecticut in their interest in theological discussion , or their concern at deviations from what they believed to be the truth . The estimate of the clergy of // the county , in respect to their theological acumen and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as will appear from the mention of the names of Bellamy , Backus , Edwards , Porter ; Griffin , Mills , Hallock , Beecher and Hart . It strikes us also that Bellamy was not remarkable for his tolerance of Arminian heresies , nor Backus for his tolerance of Thomas Jefferson , nor Porter and Beecher for their tolerance of brandy drinking . But again : " There was here , also , very early , another element which modified and liberalized the temper of the fathers who had smarted , as they supposed , under the persecutions of an English home and English laws . A little alloy was intermixed in the religious crucible , which , if it did not , in the opinion of all , render the mass more precious , at least made it more malleable and better fitted for practical use . There was not in this county an universal dislike of the Church of England . We were removed farther back in point of time , as I have said , from the original causes of hostility . We were Englishmen , boasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and into this was interwoven many of the principles and usages of English ecclesiastical polity . This respect for the institutions of the mother country , though long felt by some , was first developed in the college and extended sooner and more widely in this county than anywhere else , so that congregations worshiping with the Liturgy of the English church were soon found in Woodbury , Watertown , Plymouth , Ilarwinton , Litchfield , Kent , Sharon and Salisbury , and were composed of men of equal intelligence and purity of character with their neighbors of the Congregational churches . And yet enough of traditional prejudice still remained uncorrected by time or impartial examination often to subject the friends and members of the Church of England to insult and injustice . Some of it remains still , but too little to irritate or disturb a Christian spirit . " Our first and most natural inquiry after reading this paragraph was , for what was this written or with what propriety is it inserted in this discourse . A full and respectful notice of the Episcopal churches of Litchfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very respectable character of those who belong to this communion . But such a notice as the one given by the author seems rather to savor of the temper and language prevalent in the strifes of the toleration party of 1817 , than to the genial and friendly spirit of such an occasion . The suggestions in respect to the causes which led to the early planting of these Episcopal churches seem to us quite incorrect , and the insinuation that the members of that church have been liable to " insult and injustice , " seems // hardly appropriate in view of the fact that the people of Litchfield county have delighted to give political honor to the members of that church , far beyond any claim which their numbers would warrant . We say this account of the origin of the Episcopal churches in the county is incorrect . The simple facts were these : sundry members of the Congregational churches did not like the strictness of the discipline ; others had suffered under the administration of this discipline ; others were offended by the excesses attending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money " was strikingly developed , " showed their ingenuity in gratifying it " by preferring the church of England missionary , whose salary was paid by the venerable society for the propagation of the gospel ; others in some local quarrel in respect to the parish matters , the location of a church or the choice of a minister , were active in starting , or hasty in joining an Episcopal parish . None of these causes are named by the writer , whereas a regard to the exact truth of history requires that greater importance should be ascribed to any one of them than to the fancy , vaguely hinted , that it was in the awakening of a regard to English institutions , that these parishes owed their origin or their growth . The writer speaks also of " the temper of the fathers who had smarted , as they supposed , under the persecutions of an English home and English laws ; " and in another place of " the sense of oppression inflicted by the mother country , whether real or fancied . " Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these supposed persecutions , or that the sense of their wrongs was greatly disproportioned to the reality ? We observe no such qualification , when he speaks of the wrongs which they inflicted on " the Quakers , prayer books and %hri'stmass , " or when he charges them with wholesale injustice to the poor Indians , who , according to his own concessions , had no better title to these lands than that acquired by squatters for the term of thirty to fifty years , or when he talks so confidently of the " insult and injustice " which the congregationalists of Litchfield county , with all their acquired tolerance , visited " the friends and members of the church of England . " When our author speaks of the wrongs suffered by the Puritans , then he questions their reality ; when of those which they inflicted , he is certain and positive . Whereas , who does not know , or may not know , that the wrongs which they imposed bear no proportion to those which they were forced to endure ? Surely justice , on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charitable tolerance on which we pride ourselves , when contrasted with // our fathers , should not lead us to be generous , when we are gathered over their graves to honor their memory . But were our fathers mistaken in their suppositions ? Were the imprisonments , the heavy finings , the croppings , the scourgings , only illusions or fancies ? Surely so shrewd as they were and so fond of money withal , they could hardly have been imposed upon so far as to leave their homes and their country for wrongs that were not real but fancied . But to what does the author allude in the remark that the alloy of Episcopacy made the mass more " malleable ? " Does he refer to the conduct of not a few Episcopalians in the war of the revolution ? But enough of these passing criticisms . Our chief objection to these passages is , that they detract not a little from the dignity and authority of an address , that in other respects was so excellent . The address was followed by a Poem from Rev. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and well he might , for he was on his native heather . After exhausting his abundant store of local allusions , and given a sufficiency of local pictures drawn from his own early memory , and still true to the life , he thus concludes in a graver strain . " But , mother Litchfield , thou hast stronger claims To be called holy , than thy holy names Can give thee - Reckon as thy jewels , then , Thy saintly women , and thy holy men . Scarce have thine early birds from sleep awoke , And up thy hill-sides curls the cottage smoke , When rises with it , on the morning air , The voice of household worship and of prayer ; And when the night-bird sinks upon her nest To warm her fledglings with her downy breast , In re*erent posture , many a father stands , And , o'er his children , lifting holy hands , Gives them to God , the Guardian of their sleep ; While , round their beds , their nightly vigils keep Those Angel ministers of heavenly grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , when the day returns for toil to cease , With the disciples of the Prince of Peace , The voice responsive of thy village bells , From hill and valley , on the clear air swells , And up thy hills , and down thy valleys go Thy sons and daughters , reverently slow , To eat the bread of life , their pastor brings , And pay their homage to the King of Kings . " The sermon by Rev. Dr. Bushnell , though it would be pronounced by severer critics not much of a sermon , ' contains a professed description of " the age of homespun , " or the life of a people who spin and wear their own clothing . The idea is // ingenious , and the sketches of life in Litchfield county are felicitously grouped together around this central fact . Of the livelier sketches we give the following : " But most of all to be remembered , are those friendly circles , gathered so often round the winters fire-not the stove , but the fire , the brightly blazing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle is drawn more closely and quietly round it ; but a good neighbor and his wife drop in shortly , from over the way , and the circle begins to spread . Next , a few young folk from the other end of the village , entering in brisker mood , find as many more chairs set in as wedges into the periphery to receive them also . And then a friendly sleigh full of old and young , that have come down from the hill to spend an hour or two , spread the circle again , moving it still farther back from the fire ; and the fire blazes just as much higher and more brightly , having a new stick added for every guest . There is no restraint , certainly no affectation of style . They tell stories , they laugh , they sing . They are serious and gay by turns , or the young folks go on with some play , while the fathers and mothers are discussing some hard point of theology in the minister 's last sermon ; or perhaps the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and newspapers ! Meantime , the good housewife brings out her choice stock of home grown exotics , gathered from three realms , doughnuts from the pantry , hickory nuts from the chamber , and the nicest , smoothest apples from the cellar ; all which , including , I suppose I must add , the rather unpoetic beverage that gave its acid smack to the ancient hospitality , are discussed as freely , with no fear of consequences . And then , as the tall clock in the corner of the room ticks on niajestically towards nine , the conversation takes , it may be , a little more serious turn , and it is suggested that a very happy evening may fitly be ended with a prayer . Whereupon the circle breaks up with a reverent , congratulative look on every face , which is itself the truest language of a social nature blessed in human fellowship. * ' After the sermon followed several speeches , some of which are interesting and spirited , and others , though well enough as spoken , do not add greatly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Litchfield county could be thoroughly canvassed and written . The political and religious influence of this inconsiderable and till recently inaccessible portion of New England , upon our union and the world , has been greater than the proudest of her sons has dared to dream , and we are certain that the more fully this influence should be studied , the greater and more renowned would it appear .
