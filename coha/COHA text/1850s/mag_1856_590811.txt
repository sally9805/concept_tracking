HORATIO SEYMOUR ON THE TOPOGRAPHY AND HISTORY OF NEW-YORK . Tn* accomplished statesman whom , there is reason to believe ? the majority of the people of New-York desired at their recent election to make their Governor for a second term , has , in the pamphlet now before us , * laid the public under a new obligation , which we do not doubt will be as generally recognized as it assuredly deserves to be . It is well known that Horatio Seymour did not desire to be re√©lected Chief Magistrate of his native State . He had been chosen Governor by an overwhelming vote , at the same election in which New-York declared herself so majestically for Franklin Pierce as President ; he had ably , faithfully , and fearlessly performed various public duties ; he was content with the official honors he had won ; and he wished to enjoy for a season the repose of private life , which the popular voice had not allowed him . But the Democratic party thought they had a just claim to further services from him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office of Governor . After deliberating on the subject , and in view of the great issues which were to be presented at the election  --  a prominent one of which was the principle of coercing abstinence from the use of intoxicating liquors , and prohibiting traffic in them , which principle he had himself unanswerably demonstrated both to be against sound morals and contrary to the Constitution-he reluctantly yielded to the demand of the Democracy , and became their candidate for re*4ection . The result of the triangular canvass of 1854 is well known . Fanaticism obtained an apparent triumph . Governor Seymour received 156,000 votes ; but his chief competitor , Mr. Clarke , by the aid of intrigue , deception , and falsehood , was declared to be elected . The most remarkable exploit of Governor Clarke has been the signing a compulsory statute for the obstruction of trade , which the Court of Appeals , the highest judicial tribunal of his own State , has just pronounced to be unconstitutional . In giving this judgment , the Court but affirmed the general principles // upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give his executive sanction to an odious , oppressive , and nugatory bill . The people , the chief sufferers , had lost as their Governor a Democratic statesman , who knew their rights and respected their Constitution ; they found saddled on their backs a fanatical tool , who , true to his party instincts , appears to be as ignorant of the one as disdainful of the other . But , in his retirement from official service , Mr. Seymour has not been unmindful of the duty every one owes to his fellowcitizens , nor has he failed to exhibit his constant interest in every thing of great public concern . In short , he has shown himself to be what many of our public men are not  --  a statesman as well as a politician . While he was Governor of NewYork , his messages to the Legislature , and his addresses on various public occasions , proved him to be a man of no common mould , and confirmed to him the respect which is ever due to eminent ability . Among the many important subjects which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given great prominence to the claims which their own history ought always to have upon the regard and affection of the people . This truth he has exhil3ited and enforced with great eloquence , as well in his official messages as in addresses and speeches at other times . We very well remember the circumstances of the inauguration at Tarrytown , in the autumn of 1853 , of a monument to commemorate the capture of Major Andr6 . The contributors to the fund for the purpose , had invited Governor Seymour to take a leading part in the proceedings of the day . He complied with their request , and delivered a most effective and patriotic address , at the conclusion of which he formally dedicated the monument as " a memorial of the fidelity and bravery shown by our ancestors in achieving our National Independence , a warning against treason to our political institutions , and a memento to remind us of the blessings which God has bestowed upon our land . " In the course of his remarks , the Governor called attention to the fact , that although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken place within their borders , the people of New-York had been strangely neglectful of their claim to honorable distinction , and that the Tarrytown memorial was the only one which relieved them from the reproach of utter indifference . " I thank those , " said he , " who have perpetuated the memory of this event , by rearing this , the first monument erected within the limits of our State , commemorative of the great events which have occurred within // our territory , that they have commenced the MONUMENTAL HIsToIRY OF NEW-YORK . " On several subsequent occasions , Mr. Seymour has eloquently adverted to this subject . At the invitation of the Geographical Society , he delivered an interesting lecture before that body , in which he described the peculiar topographical features of the State of New-York , and traced the circumstances of its early colonization and its political progress , in connection with its physical characteristics . This lecture he repeated at other places , to the great satisfaction of all his auditors ; and , at the request of many who felt that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has been induced to have them published in their present form . Governor Seymour 's purpose in his lecture , is to " rough sketch " the physical characteristics of the State of New-York , and then to consider them in connection with some of the prominent points of its history . The valleys of the hudson and of the Mohawk are thus graphically described : " The Hudson River , Lake George , and Lake Champlain , lie in a narrow and rugged valley reaching from the Bay of New-York to the St. Lawrence . This is intersected at right angles , about midway , by the valley of the Mohawk . These deep channels constitute the great base lines of our State . Its triangular form corresponds with their courses . They demand a particular description , for they are intimately connected with the history of New-Yorli . They have been the war-paths of savage bands and of disciplined armies . They are the scenes of the most interesting and important occurrences in the history of the State and nation . They create our commanding and peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor of New-York , with its accessory bays , its connection with Long Island Sound , its confluent rivers , and its different passages to the Atlantic , excites the admiration of all who study its wonderful adjustments . From this bay you float up the Hudson , past the cliffs of the Palisades , to the rocky fastnesses of the Highlands . Here every analogy of Nature leads you to look for rocky barriers , but you are borne by the Atlantic tide a hundred miles beyond the mountain chain which elsewhere divides the valley of the Mississippi from the Atlantic coast . Nothing can be more impressive than the Ocean 's deep and sullen ebb and flow , far down among the great foundations of those stern , gray heights . They stand as if arrested here when pressing upon the river current ; while north and south , they stretch far away in unbroken chains to the St. Lawrence or the Gulf of Mexico . Elsewhere , rivers dash down the steep sides of the Alleghanies ; but where these crowd upon the Hudson , they are cleft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made through stern portals for ships of war , for vessels deeply laden with commerce , and for iron tracks upon which swift engines drag long trains of cars at the foot of rude cliffs , or through tunnels which pierce their granite buttresses . Ranged for many miles along both banks of the Hudson , had the Alleghanies thrown a single spur across its // stream , how would It have changed the coUrse of events in our land ! Impressed with this unbroken ocean current through the Highlands , the observant Indian called it The River of the Mountains . ' . Continuing up its valley , we find lying in its northern depression , separated from the waters of the Hudson by a short portage , the wild and picturesque Lake George and Lake Champlain . From the Bay of New-York to the waters of the St. Lawrence , this great valley divides the eastern part of our State and all of New-England from the rest of our confederacy . In its whole length , its wild scenery accords with its striking legends . Its lower section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country in the Revolutionary struggle . It was the fortress of our liberties . Its rocky points , its mountain heights , its deep ravines , are associated with the history of the war for Independence . There is hardly a spot which does not bear the marks of invading assaults , or of the intrenched defenses of our armies . The waters in the upper valley , which flow to the north , are still more deeply tinged with blood , and have wilder and older traditions of savage contests and of disciplined war . No other part of our continent has witnessed so much of relentless war , of bloody massacres , and of fierce battles , as have startled the echoes of its beautiful lakes , and disturbed their wonted quiet and repose . " The Mohawk , which intersects this valley , is intimately associated with it in historical interest and geographical importance . I speak of this valley , with its extensions to Oswego and Western New-York . In passing up its banks from its confluence with the Hudson , we find that it also breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county of Oneida , it flows through level lands , which , expanding as they stretch away to the west , are at length merged in the great plain of the Mississippi valley . At Rome the waters of the Mohawk , when swollen by floods , mingle with those which flow into Lake Ontario . These physical peculiarities of the valleys of the Hudson and Mohawk produce remarkable results . Not only are the waters of the harbor of New-York and the St. Lawrence connected by the valley I have described , but , turning up the Mohawk , the light canoe of the savage hunter could float into the tributaries of Lake Ontario , and making a portage around the falls of Niagara , continue on its way through Green Bay , the Fox and Wisconsin rivers , into the Mississippi , and thence up the Missouri into the very gorges of the Rocky Mountains : a distance by the course of the streams , of more than four thousand miles . The entire length of the same route can now be traversed by a vessel of burthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single mile separates the head-waters of the Missouri from those of the Columbia river . From the mouth of that stream on the Pacific to the Bay of New-York , with the exception of this one mile , there is an unbroken silver chain of water . The hand of the Almighty foretold the destruction of one power in letters of fire upon the walls of its palaces . Has it not written across this broad continent , in a long line of rivers , lakes , and floods , that we , who are bound together by this wonderful channel of commerce , should remain one people , living under one government ? * * * * * " But to show more clearly its commanding position , I must call your attention to another remarkable fact in the geography of New-York . The hills on either side of the Mohawk gradually rise up to elevations which pour from their outward , or northern and southern slopes , the sources of great rivers which traverse other States . The waters which drain from our territories , flow by the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run into Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence , passing // by Montreal and Quebec ; by the Hudson , which is exclusively a river of our State , into the harbor of New-York ; from its south-east section into the Delaware , past Philadelphia into the Delaware Bay ; by the Susquehanna , past Baltimore into the Chesapeake ; by the sources of the Alleghany , into the Ohio , past Cincinnati and New-Orleans , into the Gulf of Mexico . Thus our State enjoys the apparently inconsistent advantages of having the deepest channels for commerce with the West , and at the same time , of being at the head of the great valleys of the United States . This is not a fact of mere geographical interest . It gives us substantial advantages . It enables us to penetrate with our canals and railroads into all parts of the country , by following the easy and natural routes of rivers . We can go into twenty States , and into two thirds of the territories of the Union , without leaving the courses of valleys . No other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western borders , without overcoming one or more mountain ridges . Thus , then , are we situated . One angle of New-York rests upon the Atlantic , another reaches north to the St. Lawrence , while the third stretches west to the great lakes and the valleys and streams connected with the Mississippi . We are placed at the heads of the great valleys , while the Mohawk and Hudson unite them all , and give us command of the commerce of our country . " Having thus exhibited the peculiar geographical features which give New-York the control of the commerce between the twenty thousand miles of lake and river navigation on the west , and the Atlantic ocean on the east , Governor Seymour proceeds to show how full of historical interest these " pathways of great events " have been in early times : " When our continent was discovered , the plains of the Mohawk and of Western New-York , were held by a confederacy of Indians , who had subdued the country from north of the great lakes to Georgia , *nd from the Atlantic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree to their bravery in war , yet they owed much to the geographical peculiarities I have described , which gave them easy communications between themselves and avenues which led into the countries of their enemies . Mountain ranges divided their foes into different communities , while they were able to pour their united forces through the valleys I have mentioned . They held in subjecton numbers far greater than their own , because they could attack and subdue isolated tribes . Their war-paths led along the Hudson , the Delaware , the Susquehanna , and the Alleghany , and the margins of the great lakes . Nature marked out for them the same strategy which Napoleon used with such wonderful success , that of maintaining a compact force , of dividing his enemies and bringing the greater power to bear upon the point of attack . That the Iroquois understood the value of union , is shown by their confederacy ; that they appreciated the importance of their geographical position is proved by the figure of speech by which it was designated . It was called the long house ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its outlets and defenses . The Senecas in Western New-York were the keepers of the great western gate which led into the valley of the Mississippi , and the Mohawks , the fiercest and most powerful clan , the keepers of the eastern door or gate from which they issued to conquer the Algon*quins in Canada , or the Mohicans and other tribes of New-England. // " After the discovery of this continent and its settlement by Europeans , the wars and national animosities of France and England were transferred to America . In this remote part of the earth , far away from the observation of the world , in the deep recesses of the forests , a bloody and protracted warfare was waged . In its struggles , some of the most heroic spirits of the day were engaged . We find that armies followed the track of the war-path , and the Mohawk and Upper Hudson were the scenes of their conflicts . The ferocity of this contest , and the numbers engaged , in a region so sequestered and wild , were remarkable . Both nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole country , strove for their possession . Every effort of diplomacy was made to gain the alliance of the Five Nations , and for a long time with varied success . The French established a colony at Onondaga . In 1690 , a party of French and Indians burned Schenectady . In 1755 , a bloody battle was fought at Lake George , between the French under Baron Dieskau , and the Indians and Colonists , under Sir William Johnson . In 1756 , Montcalm with nine thousand men captured Fort William Henry on the same lake , and his savage allies massacred fifteen hundred of its garrison . General Abercrombie , with an army of sixteen thousand men , passed through Lake George with a fleet of more than one thousand boats , and made a desperate but unsuccessful attack on the French at Ticonderoga . His loss was more than two thousand killed , among whom was Lord Howe , one of the most chivalrous and heroic men of the British army . As a part of the same campaign , Fort Stanwix was built at Rome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oswego . In 1757 , Lord Chatham , determined to expel the French from this continent , placed Lord Amherst at the head of an army of fifty thousand men , a greater force than was employed against us at any time during the revolutionary war . One division under Prideaux , was sent up the valley of the Mohawk to Western New-York , another under Wolfe up the St. Lawrence , while the main body under Am. herst , moved through the valley of the Upper Hudson , through Lake George andLake Champlain , to Canada , where the concentration of forces was to complete the conquest of that province . This campaign ended in the capture of Quebec , the dramatic deaths of the rival heroes Wolfe and Montcalm , and the extinction of the French power on this portion of the continent . The expenses of that war constitute a large item in the present national debt of Great Britain . More than ten millions of dollars were spent in fortifying Crown Point , although that fortress was never completed . " New.York was , indeed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war and peace during the century intervening betwee*ii the surrender of New-Netherland to England in 1664 , and the cession of Canada by France in 1763 . Being a frontier province , she was the chief sufferer in the long contest for supremacy which left Great Britain the mistress , in name at least , of the Atlantic seaboard of North-America . Again the home of the imperial Iroquois became a mightier battle-ground . " When the Revolutionary contest began , these valleys , which had been the scenes of Indian warfare , and the equally savage contest between the British and the French , immediately became the theatre of a continued and bloody struggle . The whole region of the Mohawk was plunged into a civil // war of the most ruthless character . The first capture of British arms and prisoners was made by Ethan Allen at Ticonderoga , and the first naval battle of the Revolution , fought by Arnold on Lake Champlain . Knowing that the control of the Hudson would divide and destroy the power of the patriots , our enemies attempted to secure its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the valley of the Upper Hudson . Lord Howe and Sir Henry Clinton , with a fleet , were to sail up that river , while St. Leger , with Indian forces , entered the valley of the Mohawk at Rome . Through these accustQmed pathways of war , our State was assailed at once by the naval power , the disciplined armies , and the savage allies of the British empire . . The defeat of the latter at Rome , and the surrender of Burgoyne , baffled this great combined movement , the most formidable made against our liberties . The battle of Saratoga achieved the freedom of our country . It gained us the alliance of France , and substantially terminated the contest . In our last war with Great Britain , she acted upon the same idea of getting possession of these great avenues of this State , and thus dividing the power of our country . It was hoped , if thus separated from the rest of the Union , the inhabitants of New-England would not be unwilling to renew their allegiance to the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered Northern New-York by Lake Champlain . Attacks were made upon Sacketts Harbor , designed to reach the valley of the Mohawk . The victories of Macomb and McDonough defeated the hopes of our enemies at home and abroad , and terminated this last effort to concentrate hostile armies at the capital of our State . " Since the invasion of the French from Canada , in 1665 , under IDe Courcelles , that part of New-York lying along Lake Champlain and the Upper Hudson has been the field of strife and blood in fifteen campaigns . An equal if not greater number of military expeditions or savage forays have been directed against its Western and Ontario borders , the valley of the Mohawk , audi the head-waters of theSusquehanna . The Lower Hudson was the perpetual seat of war , during the Revolution . There is no part of our State which has not suffered from the contests of disciplined armies , or from the horrors of the torch and the scalping-knife , in the hands of infuriated savages . New-York has been the battle-field of our country . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Governor Seymour eloquently describes the same valleys of NewYork , now the peaceful abodes of industry , and the busy avenues of trade  --  the hunting-grounds of the far-conquering Iroquois turned into fields of waving corn , and producing food for the armies of Europe . " These occurrences have thus followed in the same channels , not for casual but for enduring causes . The influences of these valleys have not been confined te guiding the tracks of war . Where war-paths led through deep forests ; where the standards of France were borne by chivalrous warriors ; where armies marched in their assaults upon our liberties ; where , at a later day , our own citizens went forth to meet the enemies of our country , you will now find the great avenues of commerce . They are crowded with vessels laden with the fruits of our soil ; supplying the wants not only of our own , but foreign lands . France and England are now looking to this country , which they have enriched with their blood , for the bread to feed their // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies than Europe can send forth to battle , are borne , not to violent deaths or lingering disease , but to homes on the fertile plains of the West . Once they were the paths of war ; to-day they are trod by the armies of peace . Look at the products carried though these channels of commerce ; trace back their transportation through great lakes , up winding rivers , or across vast plains , to the fields upon which they were tilled ; think of the toil bestowed upon them , the thousand hopes and fears , of pleasures and of sorrows with which they are associated , and which yet cling to them in their course through our State ; and you will feel that the drama of life as here presented in emigration or commerce , is not of less dignity than the pomp and circumstance of war . " The circumstances and characteristics of the first colonization of New-York by the liberal-minded ilollanders , and others attracted by them , are sketched in the Lecture as follows : " The physical peculiarities of our State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New-York ; with the character of its people ; with the foundations of its society ; with the development of statutory and constitutional law , and its influence over the policy of our whole country . Our commercial advantages brought us a cosmopolitan population from the outset . Commerce , the great agent of civilization , gave us , from the first , the best principles of government and of social and religious liberty then known to the world . The report by Hendrick Hudson of the character of the bay and river he had discovered , led to its immediate settlement by the most heroic , intelligent , and enterprising people of the age . The principles of the Dutch made Holland the asylum of those who fled from religious or political persecution . Their liberal views were imparted to the colonies they founded . By drawing to their settlements here , all nationalities and creeds , they made that toleration a law of necessity , which at first was a measure of wise and humane policy . The world has never witnessed a scene of greater moral beauty than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at a later day , while its just views of liberty continued to influence the community it had founded . At a period when rights of conscience were not recognized in Europe , save in the limited territories of Holland , there were clustering around the beautiful harbor of New-Amsterdam communities representing different nationalities and creeds , living in peaceful intercourse . The Hollanders and Swedes at Manhattan , . the Waldenses upon Staten Island , the Walloons and English upon Long Island , and the Huguenots upon the banks of the Hudson , found here a refuge from religious persecution . What civilized Europe denied them , they sought on this spot , still shaded by primeval forests , and still made picturesque by the gliding canoe of the savage . These exiles from Piedmont , from France , from the banks of the Rhine , and from Britain , lived here in peaceful concord as strongly in contrast with the bigotry and intolerance which prevailed elsewhere , as was their civilization and refinement to the wild scenes and savage tribes who surrounded them . At a later day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mohawk . A colony of Scotch Highlanders , banished for their attachment to the Catholic religion , and to the romantic fortunes of Charles Edward , found a home , not unlike their native hills and lakes , in the northern part of Montgomery county . The Protestant Irish established themselves in Otsego county , and there were settlements of // French in Northern and Western New-York . A small colony of Spaniards once existed near Onondaga Lake , but were destroyed by the Indians . The Welsh came to this country soon after the Revolution . Almost every European tongue has ever been spoken at the firesides of our State , and used on each returning Sabbath in offerings of prayer and praise to the God of all languages and all climes . " It is undoubtedly true , that the State of New-York owes much of its present grandeur to the Batavian element , which formed so large a proportion of its earliest population . Governor Seymour very clearly sets this forth : " As this was originally a Dutch colony , the character of that people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These colonists came here in the heroic age of Holland . She had then asserted and maintained her national independence in an unequal contest of eighty years ' duration against the colossal power of Spain , which , under Charles the Fifth and his immediate successors , overshadowed and threatened the liberties of all Europe . This war with Spain excited the admiration of the world . It should also excite its gratitude . It was a contest for civil and religious liberty in behalf of mankind . After the close of the struggle , Holland battled single-handed against the combined powers of France and England . It was the age in which she produced Maurice , the greatest warrior of his times ; De Ruyter and Tromp , the ablest naval commanders ; Grotius , who is yet authority on international law ; and Barnevelt and the De Witts , the purest and most skillful statesmen . Twice in a century her people let the sea cover their land rather than it should be occupied by tyrannical oppressors . Such was their love for knowledge , that when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic defense of their town , they chose an institution of learning rather than commercial advantages , to perpetuate the remembrance of their patriotism . We should be proud that we derive so many of our political principles from this people . Nor is the debt of gratitude a local one . Holland was the asylum for the persecuted Puritans . It taught them the advantages of a republican form of government . Our obligations are broader than this-they are national . Constitutional liberty was introduced into Great Britain by the revolution which placed upon the British throne the Prince of Orange , who had recently commanded the armies of Holland against those of England . The accession of the Dutch monarch essentially modified the character of the British government , and invigorated sentiments of freedom in all of her colonies. ** This tribute to the Dutch character comes with peculiar grace from a descendant of the Puritan Pilgrim Fathers ; and his remarks upon the contrasts presented by the two leading nationalities in the colonization of the Northern States , are both philosophical and just . Our historical writers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are very apt to claim credit for what certainly never was due to that element . Governor Seymour , we think , sets this point in a true light : // and character of our people , involve inquiries of great interest , which throw light upon the principles of our institutions , and upon questions which even at this time agitate the public mind . Their discussion at times has excited feeling where there should be none . As a descendant of the Pilgrims , and a native of New-York , I can speak upon this subject without partialities . We can clearly trace the influence of the flollander and the Puritan upon the course of public affairs in our country . I select these two emigrations , for they represent conflicting views of constitutional and legislative policies . The Puritan colonists have been the objects of indiscriminate ridicule , and of equally indiscriminate praise ; yet their characters and views are clearly defined in their own transactions and histories . They had been engaged in long and bitter controversies . Those who came after the execution of Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envenomed by religious prejudices . It was a contest in which there were no compromisers . In their successes , they had conceded no toleration-in their defeats , they received none . They fought to establish a religious power not only for their own advantage , but for the control of others . Defeated in this struggle , they withdrew to the wilderness on this side of the Atlantic , sternly brooding over their defeats . They were made gloomy by the belief that they were contending not only against men , but against spiritual foes in bodily forms , and they fenced themselves round with a charmed circle of austerities . They wished to be let alone in their remote retreats , and they resisted what they deemed the intrusions of heresy . They made no pretenses to the views of religious toleration now claimed for them . Their government was partially a theocracy . They believed the Quakers were heretics , and they were banished ; they believed that some were in intercourse with the evil spirits , and they were burned ; they could not understand the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove him out of the land . They persecuted others as they had been persecuted . They were made harsh by suffering and sacrifices . But this is the dark side of their character . They were vigorous and self-reliant . A common poverty destroyed distinctions of rank . None were rich enough to establish the manorial estates or privileges which were created in New-York . They were industrious and enterprising . Their religious doctrines led them to value education as a means of spiritual and intellectual improvement . As they spoke a common language , education was rapidly spread throughout the community . Under these influences the individuals became superior to the spirit of their laws . None do so much injury to their characters as those who , with bad taste , try to soften their stern aspects with inconsistent adornments and graces , or , with still worse logic , insist that they had principles of toleration with practices of persecution . Let them alone , in their clear and decided characters , as men of robust virtues and grave faults . Let the circumstances of their history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtues and advantages ; we get elsewhere our best conceptions of civil and religious liberty . " Toleration , in fact , was peculiarly a Dutch characteristic* and it was transplanted to America by the early colonists of New-York . " The colony of New-York , in its leading features , was the reverse of that of Massachusetts . I have alluded to the character of the Dutch people of the seventeenth century . The Hollanders not only tolerated but invited // different nationalities and creeds to their new settlement . More enlightened than their age , they had made great advances in civil and religious liberty . They rejoiced in the cosmopolitan character of their inhabitants . The rebuke given by the Directors to one of their Governors , who was inclined to persecute the Quakers , is a clear and beautiful illustration of their sentiments : Let every one remain free as long as he is modest , moderate , his political conduct irreproachable , and as long as he does not offend others or oppose the government . This maxim of moderation has always been the guide of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the consequence has been that people have flocked from every land to this asylum . Tread , then , in their steps , and we doubt not you will be blest . ' " It needs no argument to show where religious freedom was most respected . The Walloons , the Waldenses , the Huguenots , and many from the eastern colonies , flying.from persecution , and clustering around the harbor of New-York , mark the spot where liberty and toleration were presented in their most attractive aspects . It requires no discussion to prove whence we get our best ideas of constitutional and commercial law and municipal freedom . Not from England , depressed by the tyranny of the Plantagenets , the Tudors , and the Stuarts , for long centuries down to the period of the settlement of this country ; but from republican Holland , the Venice of the North , ' the Queen of the Seas , ' who , while struggling against the power of Spain , grasped the commerce of the world , and made it to supply the means to wage her unequal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the vigor of character , the appreciation of education and religion derived from the Puritans , are manifested in every quarter of our land ; in public and private enterprises . Our people required and possess the characteristics derived from both of these sources , He who would seek to deprive the ilollanders or the Puritans of their just share of veneration , is unworthy to be the descendant of either . " The municipal system which now prevails in New-York was derived from Holland . But while the political principles of its Dutch founders were much more admirable than those of the neighboring governments , these principles were developed under circumstances in some respects unfavorable . These circumstances are alluded to in the following paragraph , to which we the more especially call attention , as the most profound ignorance prevails , among otherwise well-informed men , with regard to the vastly superior claim to the national gratitude of the first Dutch settlers of the State of New-York over , without exception , all other colonists from Europe : " The Dutch had , then , a republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unity makes might , ' was a motto ; and taxation only by consent , ' a principle . They originated the vital principles of our institutions-municipal and township organizations , and the great conception of local self-government . While the views and practices of government of the first settlers of this State were so superior to those of the New-England colonies , there were causes which made the former less intelligent as a people . Their clergy and teachers were learned men , and academies were established at an early day ; but this learning was lost when // the English language was generally used . The diversities of nationalities and tongues in this colony , were unfavorable to the dissemination of learning ) as each people required distinct teachers and systems of education . The most unfavorable influence was the creation of large estates by grants from the government , which were commenced by the Dutch , and continued by the English authorities . This practice created a class of tenants , or compelled the colonists to buy their lands of the large owners ; it also made great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although their principles of government were superior to those of New-England , the mass of the people were thus made less active and enterprising . It is remarkable how enduring the influences of these facts have been . The population of NewYork and New-England are about equal . If you go to the Western States , you will find a large share of its enterprises in the hands of emigrants from New-England , while the political institutions are moulded after New-York ; you will find the enterprise and mechanical skill with the former , while the judiciary of this State is everywhere recognized as controlling in legal questions . Our judges settle principles of jurisprudence for two thirds of the Union . " As a consequence , it is logically shown that New-York , having superior political principles , necessarily exercised a very commanding influence during the contest between the colonists and the British crown , which ended in the independence of the United States . " The influence New-York has exercised over the constitutional history of our country , is owing to the superiority of its political principles during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netherlands presented all the leading features of the United States of America , although their adjustments were less perfect . It was a Republic made up of several distinct communities , united for common defense , but retaining rights of separate self*government-its government was representative . Its great leading feature was its municipal corporations and subdivisions in the nature of townships , with rights of local legislation . Acting upon this principle in our own State , the several towns manage their own affairs : our boards of Supervisors transact the business of the counties , the Legislatures make laws concerning the Sovereign States , while the General Government is in- vested with powers , and restrained by limitations , which only give it jurisdiction in matters of national defense , dignity , or importance . It is this system which secures the good government of every part of our country . It has been the growing appreciation of its value which has constantly carried jurisdiction from general to local tribunals . The higher governments have been made less powerful and less liable to become injurious from corruption or ambition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and safer control of town and county officers . The germ of this principle existed in the government of the United Provinces ; its full exposition has only been seen in this country ; and its value and importance shown on the broad theatre of our land , where it has preserved the integrity of our Union , and disappointed the hopes or predictions of those who foretold its early dissolution as a necessary c&amp;nsequence or its expansion . The Dutch principle of No taxation without consent , ' lay at the foundation of our Revolution ; and their motto that Unity makes might , ' taught us how to uphold that // principle ; and its municipal corporations and its local legislatures were the types of our political institutions . " Not only were the colonists of New-York imbued with sentiments of freedom , but they had the earliest and most urgent occasions to assert them . Living without the protection of a charter , for a long time under the control of the private ownership of the Dutch West-India Company and the Duke of York , amid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they boldly claimed their legislative rights , and resisted Taxation without consent . ' The contests with the Royal Governor were conducted on the part of the colonists with signal ability , and their protests and arguments were pronounced by Attorney-General Randolph of Virginia , to be the ablest expositions of the rights of popular representatives . These controversies involved a wide range of discussion , and thoroughly instructed the people of the colony in the principles of constitutional liberty . The contest which commenced in New-York between its legislatures and the Royal Governors , extended to other colonies , and excited the public mind from time to time , until the era of the Revolution . The whole of the American people were then united against the aggressions of the Crown . The resolutions of the New-York Assembly against the Stamp Act were drawn up with consummate ability , and , to use the language of Pitkin , breathed a spirit more bold and decided than those from any other colony . ' In 1754 , a convention of delegates from the several colonies , held in the capital of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other eminent men , drew up a plan for colonial union for protection against the French and Indians . This proposition prepared the minds of the American people for n similar measure to resist British tyranny , and most appropriately the motto of Holland that Unity makes might , ' was first acted upon in the city she had founded . In 1775 , a Provincial Congress assembled in the city of NewYork , and was the first of those illustrious councils which , in the language of Lord Chatham , With solidity of reasoning , force of sagacity , and wisdom of conclusion , ascertained , vindicated , and established the liberties of America . ' " I shall not dwell upon the Revolutionary contest . Ta its progress , it carried war and desolation into different sections of our country . Elsewhere , it swept like the tornado in its course ; but its visitations , while destructive , were temporary . In this State its thunderings never ceased , its baleful fires were never quenched , during the whole struggle . On the Mohawk it was attended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and terrible by savage barbarities . The whole length of this gentle valley was desolated by the sword and bayonet , the torch and tomahawk . " When it was determined to sever our connection with Great Britain , Congress recommended the formation of governments in all the colonies , equal to the demands of their new independence . All of the States save two followed the recommendation . The constitution formed in New-York , amid the confusion of the Revolution , is a proof of the profound knowledge of its leading men in the principles of civil liberty , good government , and constitutional law . Its superiority was universally admitted , and it was received with great favor , not only in the State , but elsewhere . Our constitution , ' says Jay , in a letter to the President of the Convention , is universally approved , even in New-England , where few New.York productions have credit . ' " All of the State constitutions recognized in express terms the natural and absolute right of every man to worship God according to the dictates of his // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone were free from provisions repugnant to these declarations . " Governor Seymour also exhibits very forcibly , and , we think , very justly , the ignorance and misapprehension which have prevailed in respect to the real influence which New-York and her statesmen exerted in maturing the great fabric of the American iRepublic . He says : " Great injustice has been done to the early instrumentality of New-York in the cause of American Independence . The peculiar situation of the Province-without a charter ; the arbitrary conduct of many of the Royal Governors ; the questions growing out of their acts and pretensions-compelled the people of this State to place themselves , from the beginning , on the high grounds of natural and inherent rights . Elsewhere these contests frequently grew out of questions about the construction of charters . " Still greater inj ustice has been done to the services of the early statesmen of New-York in the formation of our national constitution , and in the tone of construction given to that instrument , when our government was first organized . I have shown why they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they drew their sentiments from the best sources , the only free and republican government then existing . When the independence of the colonies was achieved by the common patriotism of our countrymen , a greater task remained to be done . The confederation was temporary in its character , and insufficient for a bond of union when the outward pressure of war was withdrawn . We occupied a vast country , which presented a great variety of climate and condition . There was no power to coerce these conflicting interests . To reconcile them appeared impossible . To dissolve again into the original separate communities involved wars , standing armies , and the weakness which would make us a prey to European nations . It was then almost universally assumed that the strength of a government depended upon the amount of its privileges and the extent of its jurisdiction . The European statesmen declared we could not create a government with power enough to make it stable , which would not in its action , trample on some of the varied interests of our land . Out of Holland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the source of power , instead of being its recipient from the mass of the people . The United Provinces of the Netherlands were so limited in extent and so homogeneous in character , that they afforded no clear rule for our action . Under these circumstances , the duty of forming a government was entered upon by the patriots of our country . In the convention which framed it , two great antagonistic ideas were at once developed , and they have , under different phases , divided the public mind from that day to this . On the one hand it was held , that to make a government strong and enduring , it should have a large amount ofjurisdiction ; that its strength and endurance would be determined by the extent of its power . The opposing party held , that the strength and permanency of government grew out of limitations of authority , restraining it from acting upon questions which would bring it into conflict with the views of different sections of our broad land . They also held that the most beneficent legislation would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ localities should direct those affairs which most concerned their own interests and happiness . These considerations were connected with the principle of representation . If it was to be a government // of great jurisdiction , it was a matter of deep concern to know who would direct it . It was urged by some that representation should be graduated by population . This would give control to a few large States . It was contended by others that the several States were sovereignties standing upon equal grounds , and therefore entitled to equal voices in the common government . That this was the only security against the centralization of political power . The three great States of Virginia , Pennsylvania , and Massachusetts , insisted upon representations in the Senate and House of Representatives in proportion to population . New-York , alone , of the large States , declared that she did not ask nor would she take a representation in either branch of the National Legislature beyond what was allowed to the feeblest member in the confederacy . To my mind , this forms the noblest passage in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent , yet she had the magnanimity to rise above the temptations of power , and the superior wisdom to see the necessity of forming a government of limited jurisdiction , and of upholding local sovereignties . When this principle of perfect equality was invaded in the formation of the House of Representatives , the majority of her delegates withdrew from the Convention ; and this State , for a long time , refused to ratify the Constitution , and only yielded her ultimate assent upon the express understanding that it should be so amended that doubtful or implied powers would be cut off . The noble and resolute stand taken by New-York induced the National Convention to limit the authority of Congress . It also did much to secure amendments to the Constitution which contain guarantees of the rights of the States and the liberties of the citizen . It was New-York that took the foremost stand in favor of State rights and local self-government -- those vital principles of our political system which baffled the predictions of European statesmen , that the original thirteen States could not be held together under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it has extended three-fold , until it is as broad as all Europe . " The principle of local self-government is traced from its origin in Holland , to its full and beneficent maturity in this country . Governor Seymour 's remarks on the theory , as well as the practical workings of the system , appear to us as eminently sound and statesmanlike : " Questions relative to the authority which governments ought to possess , have entered largely into our political discussions . I can say , without touching upon partisan grounds , that the policy of decentralization of political power has constantly gained favor with the American people . It is generally supposed this doctrine had its origin in Virginia . The delegates from that State in the National Convention , contended for large grants of authority to the general government . " It has been truthfully said that the wisdom of our institutions exceeds the wisdom of their founders . They established principles of more scope and influence than their authors foresaw . The germ of the Township system existed in Holland , was introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political sagacity of our fathers . The condition of our country is rapidly developing this policy . Equality of rank and the necessities of a thin population on the borders of a boundless wilderness , made all other arrangements unsuitable . It was most rtLpidly spread in New-England , for the growth of her colonies was the most rapid . For this reason it has // been supposed by many historians to be of New-England origin . More correct investigations into governmental history , show that it was a feature in the government of Holland long before the settlement of America . The relationships which that country bore to New-Netherland and to the P11-grims , entitle it to the honor of its introduction here . It is undoubtedly true that at first it was regarded merely as a convenient mode of conducting public affairs , and that it had no higher value in the minds of the early colonists . None foresaw its future importance . This system of local self-government keeps at home the mass of political power . It yields it to the remoter legislative bodies in diminishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people ; it does not regard the central government as the source of authority , from which it percolates in limited measures to the lower jurisdictions . The vital principle of self-government is not the mere demagogical idea that the people , in their collective capacity , are endowed with a wisdom , patriotism , and virtue superior to their individual characters . On the contrary , the people as a society are as virtuous or as vicious , as intelligent or as ignorant , as brave or as cowardly , as the persons who compose it , and will always be viewed accordingly , by every straightforward man . The great theory of local self-government under which our country is expanding itself over our continent , without becoming weak by its extension , is founded upon these propositions . That government is most wise , which is in the hands of those best informed about the particular questions on which they legislate ; most economical and honest , when in the hands of those most interested in preserving frugality and virtue ; most strong , when it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed . These are obvious truths , but how are they to be made available for practical purposes ? It is in this that the wisdom of our institutions consists . In their progress , they are developing truths in government which have not only disappointed the hopes of our enemies and dissipated the fears of our friends , but give promise in the future of such greatness and civilization as the world has never seen . The legislation which most affects us is local in its character . The good order of society , the protection of our lives and our property , the promotion of religion and learning , the enforcement of statutes , or the upholding of the unwritten laws of just moral restraints , mainly depend upon the virtue and wisdom of the inhabitants of townships . Upon such questions , so far as they particularly concern themselves , the people of the town of Kirkland , in the county of Oneida , are more intelligent and more interested , than those outside of their limits can be for them . The wisest statesmen , living and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these affairs , nor can they conduct them as well as the citizens upon the ground . What is true of Kirkland , is true of the other ten thousand towns in the United States . When we shall have fifty thousand towns , this system of government will in no degree become overloaded nor complicated . There will be no more for each citizen to do than now . Our town officers in the aggregate are more important than congressmen or senators . Hence the importance to our government of religion , morality , and education , which enlighten and purify the governed and the governor at the same time , and which must ever constitute the best securities , both for the advancement and happiness of our country . The next organizations , in order and in importance , are boards of* county officers , who control questions of a local character , but affecting more than the inhabitants of single towns . The people of the county of Oneid&amp;* are more intelligent , and more interested in what concerns their own aff&amp;irs , // than any amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions of our supervisors are more important than those of our State Legislature . When we have secured good government in towns and counties , most of the objects of good government are gained . In the ascending scale of rank , and in the descending scale of importance , is the Legislature , which is , or should be , limited to State affairs . Its greatest wisdom is shown by the smallest amount of legislation , and its strongest claim upon our gratitude grows out of what it does not do . Our general government is remarkable for being the reverse of every other system . Instead of being the source of authority , it only receives the remnant of power after all that concerns town , county , and state jurisdictions has been distributed . Its jurisdiction , although confined within narrow limits , is of great dignity , for it concerns our national honor , and provides for the national defense . We make this head of our system strong , by confining its action to those obj ects which are of general interest and value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not act with a due degree of intelligence . If our general government had the legislative power , which is now divided between town , county , and state jurisdiction , its attempts at their exercise would shiver it into atoms . If it was composed of the wisest and purest men the world ever saw , it could not understand all the varied interests of a land as wide as all Europe , and with as great a diversity of climate , soil , and social condition . The welfare of the several communities would be constantly sacrificed to the ignorance , the interests , or prejudices of those who had no direct interest in the laws they imposed upon others . Under our system of government , the right to interfere is less than the disposition many show to meddle with what they do not understand ; and over every section of our great country , there are local jurisdictions , familiar with their wants , and interested in doin*g what is for the right . It required seven centuries to reform palpable wrongs in enlightened Britian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament , were far removed from the sufferings and injuries those wrongs occasioned . Under our institutions , evils are at once removed , when intelligence and virtue have shown them in their true light to the communities in which they exist . As intelligence , virtue , and religion , are thus potential , let us rely upon them as the genial influences which will induce men to throw off the evils which encumber them , and not resort to impertinent meddling , howling denunciations , and bitter taunts , which prompt individuals and communities to draw the folds of wrong more closely about them . " The theory of local self-government , is not founded upon the idea that the people are necessarily virtuous and intelligent , but it attempts to distribute each particular power to those who have the greatest interest in its wise and faithful exercise . It gives to townships and counties and states , the right to direct their local affairs , because they are most intelligent about their own concerns . We know there are individuals wiser and better than the mass of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in private matters . When we are sick , we do not seek the wisest or the best man , but the wisest physician . If we wish to build , we do not look after the most learned man , but the most skillful mechanic . In the selection of agents , we choose those who are most interested in serving us faithfully . Acting upon these simple principles , the tendency of public opinion has constantly been in favor of taking power from central points , and distributing it to those who have the strongest motives and the best intelligence for its judicious exercise . // 485 " This system not only secures good government for each locality , but it also brings home to each individual a sense of his rights and responsibilities ; it elevates his character as a man ; he is taught self-reliance ; he learns that the performance of his duty as a citizen is the best corrective for the evils of society , and is not led to place a vague , unfounded dependence upon legislative wisdom or inspirations . The principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it also makes good manhood . Under European governments , but few feel that they can exert any influence upon public morals or aiThirs , but here , every one knows that his character and conduct will at least affect the character and interests of the town in which he lives . " The conviction gains ground that the general government is strengthened and made most enduring , by lifting it above invidious duties , and making it the point , about which rally the affections and pride of the American people , as the exponent to the world at large , of our common power , dignity , and nationality . " We can not better end our notice of Governor Seymour 's admirable Lecture , than by adopting his own words , in which , with burning eloquence , he exhorts his fellow-citizens to be more just to the claims of their own State history , and , above all , to be faithful to the Union and the Constitution : " Heretofore , our citizens have been unjust to the history of their State . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , with becoming and patriotic pride , recorded the services of their ancestors , and have erected monuments to commemorate the great events which have occurred within their territories , we have been indifferent to the glorious annals of our past . We are more familiar with the early history of New-England or Virginia than with our own . Their citizens have , with pious care , recorded the patriotic services of their fathers , and have rendered them familiar to the entire population of our Union . While I have , on this occasion , briefly attempted to present to your consideration , some of the prominent features in the history of our State , it must not be supposed that I desire to institute any invidious comparisons between New-York and the other members of this glorious confederacy . I only wish to induce you to follow their example of proper reverence for the memory of their fathers . While a monument towers upon Bunker 's Hill , exciting a just pride in the hearts of the citizens of Massachusetts , and respect in the minds of strangers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why is it that no stone marks the spot upon the plains of Saratoga , where Freedom 's fight was won ? Every school-boy in our land is taught that the first blood in the Revolutionary struggle was shed at Concord ; how many of our citizens know that the first surrender of a British flag or weapon was made at Ticonderoga ? The traveller who sails through Long Island Sound , sees on the shores of Connecticut , the monument which tells of the mas*jicre of brave patriots on the Heights of Groton . But what is there to remind him who passes through the valley of the Mohawk , of the thousands who were slaughtered by ruthless savages , during the French war and the Revolutionary contest ? We have all been made familiar with the services which the statesmen of Virginia have rendered to the cause of civil liberty or constitutional law ; while few are instructed that the earliest contests between the rights of the people and the pretended prerogatives of // the crown , were commenced and most strenuously maintained by the popular delegates , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poets of New-England strive to perpetuate the memories of the Pilgrim Fathers , to record their sufferings , and to hallow the very spots upon which they trod . Plymouth Rock has been made a sacred shrine where they annually pour forth their gratitude for the civil and political blessings which they enjoy . But how little is known of the more varied and more interesting emigration to the shores of our own State . While we honor the Pilgrim Fathers , let us not forget the Hollanders , who made earlier settlements upon our shores , who made the harbor of New-York a place of refuge from bigotry , intolerance , and wrong . " The past is full of noble examples animating us with patriotic love of our State and nation , but we must not confine our attention to the past . The present and the future have their obligations . Our geographical position imposes upon us peculiar duties in our relations to the rest of the Union . The progress of our nation will lessen the comparative importance of other States , however important they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great avenues of commerce , of intercourse , and of events , we grow with the growth of our country . It is our duty to emulate the patriotism of our Fathers ; to maintain the rights of the several States ; to preserve their Union , by confining the central government to the exercise of powers designed for the common dignity , defense , and welfare ; and to restrain those sectional passions and prejudices , which are apt to grow up in States , whose isolated positions do not give them the advantages we enjoy , of constant intercourse with the citizens of every part of our broad land .
