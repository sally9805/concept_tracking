txt ART . VL-PROFESSOR HUNTINGTON 'S SERMONS . 8er*nons for the People . By F. D. HUNTINGTON , D. D. , Preacher to the University , and Plurumer Professor of Christian Morals in the College at Cambridge . Boston : Crosby , Nichols &amp; Co . Cincinnati : George S. Blanchard . New Haven : Thomas H. Pease . 1856 . Tnis volume of Sermons is especially noteworthy for three reasons . Its author has a wide and brilliant reputation as an earnest , eloquent and faithful Christian preacher ; he has recently entered upon an office of incalculable relio4ous importance , that of Preacher and Professor of Christian IN ? orals in Harvard College ; and having received Unitarian training , and having occupied during his whole ministry the pulpit of a Unitarian // church in Boston , under the influence of his own spiritual experience and of his labors as a preacher and pastor in winning souls to the belief and practice of real and true religion , he has been for some years gradually approximating an evangelical or orthod6x faith , and is confidently declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who know him well , and who interpret his public discourses and his published articles in the light of frank and frequent social communications . The title of the volume , " Sermons for the People , " is thus explained in its preface . " The title given to the book suggests all that needs to be said of the principle that has governed the selection of subjects and the style of their treatment . One topic , the Reconciliation in Christ , though by no means neglected here , has a less extended and a less complete presentation , because of a desire to discuss it separately , more at large , and more at leisure , than is possible now . Without bringing forward any personal claim to the attention of any considerable numbers of the people , ' II am earnestly desirous to render a little service to some of those who are not much in the habit of reading discourses prepared for the pulpit . Were I to give to this title a more special and local application by emphasizing the definite article , I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love towards my former congregation ,  --  a people that must always be to me in a signification that stands alone , THE PEOPLE ,  --  a people that I tried for thirteen years to help , whose harmony , energy and fidelity made my work delightful , and whose constant kindness I can not repay save by these unworthy acknowledgments , and by an attachmnent that will never be changed . " The readers of the New Englander will remember that in our last issue , in an article entitled " Our November Number and Prof. Huntington , " we considered the doctrinal position of Prof. Huntington , and gave our reasons for extending to him the tokens of our cordial fellowship . The occasion of that article will be remembered . The Religious Monthly Magazine , edited by Prof. Huntington , had republished our article ( which had been preached as the Concio ad Clerum at the commencement in Yale College , and had been generally approved for its thorough orthodoxy ) on the relation of the Atonement to Holiness . Prot . Huntington had introduced the Concio to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its " clear and consistent statements , " and had expressed his own views accordingly in the discussion which followed . We hail the volume before us with pleasure on account of its general excellence , but especially because it gives an additional and decided justification // 431 of the position taken in our last number . In this volume Dr. Huntington has spoken clearly , positively and satisfactorily on the Divinity of Christ , and on the Doctrine of the Holy Spirit , in a discourse on each of these topics . The discourse on the Divinity of Christ was published in the IReligious Monthly Magazine with the name of the author , in May , 1851 . It led many Orthodox ministers into a delightful personal acquaintance with Mr. Huntington ; and it led one of them into acts of Christian and ministerial fellowship with him , which some of our more cautions and less hopeful brethren considered unwarranted and dangerous , but which time and continued Divine grace have fully vindicated . The discourse on the Doctrine of the Holy Spirit was published in the Magazine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extensively modified and supplemented for the present volume , and it is pleasant and instructive to see the progress in clearness , definiteness and positiveness of orthodox statement which is indicated by the difference between the earlier and later editions . Of this difference we shall perhaps give some illustrations in notes or otherwise , as we proceed . XTe turn our attention first to the sermon on the Divinity of Christ , and as our readers will wish to see what Dr. Huntington says , rather than what we say he says , we shall give his language freely . " If we are Christians at all , Christ is the author and founder of our faith . He is the Head of that Church into which disciples gather for fellowship . The question what and who he is , to all persons of any spiritual consciousness , is vital at every point , and momentous under every aspect . " There are two prevalent apprehensions of the character and office of Jesus as Saviour of the world . One contemplates him as specially appointed to represent the perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known or conceived of the spiritual powers and possibilities in a hu . man being . This view holds Jesus to have been a perfect man ; the completest moral example and religious genius of our race ; exhibiting in his life and death the utmost that human excellence can do or be ; as showing the ultimate achievement , thus far at least , of a man 's virtue , love , and faith ; and as having withdrawn his personal presence and power from the world at his ascension , so that the communion of his followers is not literally a communion with him , but is only a commemorative observance for a Teacher living on earth in the past , but retired now into the heavens . " The other view regards Christ as showing forth not only a perfect humanity , but also and primarily God himself ; representing God to man , as well as man to himself ; being the express image of God 's person ; being God in the act and character of revealing or manifesting himself creating and saving the world ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing , in his divinity , any limitation or abridgment from the fulness of God ; exhibiting , as in God 's behalf , through a union of nature with the Father not explicable to us , the Divine attributes ; and reconciling alienated souls by manifesting God in his flesh . According to this doctrine , he survives in his Church to this day , and will survive , not only by influence and memory , but by the presence of his // person ; a distinct and everlasting person in himself , without beginning of days or end of years , the same yesterday , to-day , and for ever . " The latter of these two views appears to me not only incomparably the most benignant and precious , but to stand towards the other in the relation of truth to error ; to be charged with inestimable benefits to our religious progress ; to be liable to fewer theological perversions , and less dangerous abuses ; and to need also that it be more distinctly asserted and impressed on our present habits of thinking , especially among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 252-254 . He then proves and defends the view which he designates as true , by a threefold argument . The first is from " the Word " or the sacred Scriptures . We give the concluding paragraph . " But I must add here a few of the weighty declarations of Jesus himself , so grand , so comprehensive , so clear and unhesitating , so almost overwhelming . in the solemn awe they awaken while we read , that to suppose them uttered by any being not divine , not an eternal dweller in the very bosom and sonship of the Father , would seem a strange infatuation . All power is given unto me , in heaven and on earth . ' All things that the Father bath are mine . ' Be . lieve me , that I am in the Father , and the Father in me . ' He that bath seen me , bath seen the Father . ' I and my Father are one . ' The Father bath committed all judgment unto the Son . ' if ye shall ask anything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Father knoweth me , even so know I the Father . ' Thy sins are forgiven thee . ' I give unto them eternal life . ' No man taketh my life from me ; I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . ' No man bath ascended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the Son of Man which is in heaven . ' As sure as words have any meaning . these are not the words of a man . They are the words of God . " p. 256 . This paragraph is not in the first edition of the sermon . The whole of it is added in the last edition , evidently with the purpose of making the statement and proof of Christ 's Deity delinite , positive and strong . The second argument is from " Christian history , or the organic working of Christian life through the Church . " We can quote only the concluding sentences . " Changes with which no Qther change compares , revolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , conquests of science , growths of institutions , marches of learning and society-all testify that * silent power was cradled in the manger at Bethlehem , which * We will here give in a note the expression made by Dr. Huntington five years ago , of what he regarded as the true view of Christ 's nature , to show ow this passage of the sermon has been modified , cleared and strengthened . " The other view regards Christ as showing forth not only a perfect humanity , but also the mind of the Deity ; representing God to man as well as man to 2aimself ; being the express image of God 's person ; exhibiting , as in God 's behalf , through some union of nature with the Father , not explicable to us , the Divine *forgiveness , justice , and mercy ; and reconciling alienated souls by manifesting *Ilod in his flesh . According to this doctrine , he survives in his church to this day , and will survive , not only by influence and memory , but by the presence - of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faith , we draw near to him , lie , though invisible , yet by the rich gifts of his Messiahship and by a felt bene4iction , draws veritably near to us. " - Jleligioua Magazine , . /Jfa*y , 1851 , pp. 224 - 225. // was to dwarf down the empires of C*sars and Bonapartes into the puny dynasties of nursery games . All the growing multitudes , achievements , industry , enterprise , discoveries , wisdom and strength of the race , lift a chant of thanksgiving that has grown louder from the first , and is swelling still , to proclaim Christ the Divine iRegenerator of its destinies , the Infinite and eternal head over his Church . " The third argument is from the Soul with its intuitions and its wants . " Whenever it ( the soul ) is most deeply stirred by penitence or strained by agony , or kindled into holy aspiration , the spiritual nature craves a more intimate communion with God than would be possible if that God had not mysteriously manifested himself in flesh ; not a sovereign in the skies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It cries out for the Christ , who , by bearing to us the pity and pardon of the Father , is Way , Truth and Life . The individual heart , when it is really agitated , whether by hope , or love , or pain , or fear , emphasizes the promise of revelation ; and the longings of the individual soul respond to the broad verdict of history . It confesses , like Peter before the persecutors , that there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby it can be saved . " Our author then refers to the theories of objectors . To the theory that " in our human nature there are capacities so noble and traits so high , that we do Christ honor enough when we allow him to possess an unprecedented and complete combination ' of them , " he answers : " I believe , on the contrary , that in the essential peculiarity of his nature , Christ is as distinct from us as the spiritual nature in us is from the perishable , as God is from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should like to quote , but have not room . " Another form taken by the argument for Christ 's simple humanity is this ,  - -  that every member of the human family is capable of certain lofty spiritual ex* ercises , is visited by holy aspirations , has a moral sense that distinguishes between right and wrong , and can form ideas of truth , of justice , of holiness . ' These ideas and affections , it is argued , are God within us ; because they are in harmony with his character , and it is by them that we recognize his attributes . In Christ these moral ideas were held with peculiar clearness and power ; these spiritual affections moved in extraordinary purity and constancy . This fact , therefore , is held to satisfy all that language of Christ and his Apostles where he is declared to be one with God , and to exhaust the meaning of those passages that attribute to him a quite superhuman nature . He had in him more of God than we , only by as much as he gave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike , a fuller development than we . " Now , this explanation is as unsatisfactory as the preceding : it grows more and more unsatisfactory , the longer I study the facts of Christ 's ministry , the words spoken by him , or his effect on the world . Those facts are miraculous , // or they are an imposition . Those words are an assertion of a union between Jesus and the Father altogether peculiar and distinctive and complete , or they are deceptions . That effect on the world must be accounted for by an agency behind it entirely above all other known historical motive powers ; or else it is brought about by some artifice superlatively cunning , a legerdemain more incredible than miracle itself . The facts : - When I behold , through those impregnable narratives where sharp-eyed and caviling criticism has sought and sought again , but never found , aflaw or crevice large enough to enter one splitting wedge , those compact records where the persevering batteries of unbelief , shifting their point and method of attack with every shifting current of sceptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth from his grave , the dumb speaking , the blind seeing , the shrunken hand of palsy full and flexible with the circulations of health , the stone over his own sepulchre rolled away , and doubting Thomas putting his fingers into the print of the nails , his hand into the spear-wound in the side , till be exclaims My Lord and my God ! - then I am compelled to recognize a present Divinity , of which no field of human history anywhere gives a token , no breath from any chamber of the past , its marvels of literature , philosophy , or enterpise , yields a whisper . The words : - When I hear him saying , not with any trace of fanatical excitement or transient enthusiasm , but with that calm authority of unmistakable truth to which all the results unite in bearing confirmation : No man knoweth the Father , but the Son ; the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father , he hath revealed him ; ' Before Abraham was , I am ; * I am the resurrection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before men , him will I also confess or deny before my Father and his angels ; * I came forth from God ; - then listening while he thus speaks as man never spake , ' it is as impossible for me to doubt the authenticity of his speech as it would be irrational for me , admitting that , to deny that there is a proper Divinity in him that he does not share with me , and that I can not share with him . The effect on the world : - When we have it thrust upon our convictions by every fragment of historic testimony , by even heathen Pliny and infidel Gibbon themselves , by all monuments of human progress , and by all the civilization of to-day , and all the spreading life of the Church always , that since the moment when Christ came up out of the Jordan , wet with the baptism of John , and with the glory of his heavenly consecration shining upon him , a new principle has been steadily working in the heart of human things , to transform them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in essence ; - then how are we to escape believing , that , if God was in the building of the world , it was not man that by regeneration created it anew ? " Choose out any of the brighter luminaries that have poured splendor on any path of thought , or blessings on any interest of the world 's welfare ,  --  - Men whose great thoughts possess us like a passion ,  - -  Thoughts which command all coming times and minds ; Whose names are ever on the world 's broad tongue , Like sound upon the falling of a force ; Men whom we build our love round , lil*e an arch Of triumph , as they pass us on their way To glory and to immortality ; take the mightiest in influence , the richest in knowledge , the nimblest in genius , the purest in excellence-Plato or Humbolt or Shakespeare or Fenelon ,  --  and then , if your reverence will bear the shock , imagine him using any of those majestic expressions , respecting his origin and his work , which I have quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun to doubt , you will be startled back into a sense of the real Divinity of the Redeemer . Conceive that philosopher , poet , or statesman , standing before the Eternal and Almighty Father , under the shadow of impending death , and uttering that petition in the prayer of the Lord , And now , 0 Father , glorify thou me with thine own self , // 435 with the glory which I had with thee before the world was ; for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world , ' - you will need no other proof how far our idle speculations wander from the awful bounds of truth , when we speak 01 God 's Messiah as in kind like men . " pp. 259-262 . " Our charter for the liberty of this inspiring doctrine is the whole tone pervading the New Testament , from the announcement of the Spirit to Mary the mother ,  --  ' That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ . ' It is in the language express and general , it is in the breath and spirit , it is in the precept and the sanctions , of the whole Christian revelation . If you ask for it in a single sentence , you find it gathered up into that comprehensive declaration , I and my Father are one , ' or , No man can come unto the Father but by me . ' I believe , therefore ,  --  . - . I can not but believe -- I am as unable as I am undesirous to doubt ,  --  that , in regard to that deep , wide line that distinguishes the Infinite from the finite and the Divine from the human , Christ the Redeemer does not stand by his nature on the human side . I discover no way in which an estranged , lost family on earth , not knowing God by all its wisdom , and condemned by a law which it had not power or will to keep , could be raised , restored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deity to the earth , while he lifts up man towards Deity . The Redeemer must make God manifest in the flesh , mediate between Heaven and humanity , show us the Father to move and melt the child . " There can be no half-way statement here , without a wrong to philosophy and faith both . That in Christ which is not human is God ,  --  - verily , literally , and strictly God ; as truly God , and in the same sense God , as the Father is God . All the biblical language seems to me to preclude the conception of any intermediate nature . He is spoken of as man , and he is spoken of as God . That mystery is insoluble to the understanding . But this is clear : while God , to whom all things are possible , may enter into human conditions , and pass through a human experience , and thus become man , ' man can in no sense become God . The difficulties in the way of receiving our Lord and Saviour as God are as nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nay , Faith joyfully finds that she has made them to be , not difficulties , but blessed and simple and gracious helps to holiness . For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily . ' I am not unfamiliar with the several interpretations affixed to the passages cited by tho , e who would discharge them of the contents I have found in them , and reduce them to a consistency with the humanitarian or the Arian theory . It is doubtful , judging by experience , whether it avails much to undertake a refutation of these interpretations in detail , before the heart , by another and a surer process , is brought to an inevitable persuasion of their insufficiency . They will satisfy , till some special exigency of spiritual experience dissolves them in its potent alembic ; and then they look as unengaging to the affections as they do forced and unnatural to the understanding . " pp. 263-265 . It is worthy of notice that the whole paragraph , beginning " There can be no half-way statement here , " is added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following paragraph the word " Arian " is added in the phrase , " To reduce them to a consistency with the humanitarian or the Arian theory , " - evidently to guard more completely against the idea that the author believes that Christ is , or may be , a created being of any order , even the highest . Dr. Huntington then goes on to show that he is not shaken , and with reason is not shaken , in this positive conviction , thus // Prof. lluntington 's Sermons . definitely expressed , of the proper deity of Christ , by any alleged mysteries , or even logical difficulties involved in it . " If , now , any critical mind is tisking what the way and method of this unioa between Jesus and the Father are , as if some logical difficulty there were sure to baffle my conclusion , and win a triumph over faith , let me frankly confess , that no inability of mine to make full answer embarrasses me , nor compromises my doctrine . " Into the interior relations of the Infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celestial adjustments of these revealed personalities ; what are the modes of intercommunication between the Father and the Son ; in what sense he who expressly says , with a clearness of authority that no human intelligence ' dares to question , that all power in heaven and earth are his , can yet have that power given ' to him ; how he who could say , Before Abraham was , I AM , ' could also say , Of that day and that hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels which are in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father ; ' in what character , or referring to what office , that Lord of all , by whom the worlds were made and by whom mankind are to be judged , could declare , My Father is greater than I ; ' how it could be that he who was in the beginning with God , . and was God , ' should yet enter a child 's frame , be born of a woman , be made under the Law , pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempted , and pray and die ; in what manner it was that he who thus shows himself eternally one with the Father could voluntarily veil some things , as it were , from his own mind , and , in the wonderfulness of his condescension and the humility of his Sonship , lay aside for a time , not only the glory that he had before the world was , ' but his vision of some things that the Father hath hid in his power ; - these are secrets . I can not fathom them . Let me say , 1 rejoice that I can not . I gratefully adore that incomprehensible existence ,  --  the Father in the Son and the Son in the Father . It is the life , the power , the spiritual grandeur , the one distinguishing fact and transcendent glory of the Christian faith . To me 4Dhristianity could not be without it . A God without unfathomable realities in the contents of his nature would be no God , just as a religion without mystery would be no religion . In the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should be sceptics , faithless and forlorn . " If it be suggested that these gracious mysteries are of a character so different from other mysteries in the Divine nature and proceeding , that we ought to reject them , I find nothing in that statement that gains my assent . I find no more reason , on that ground , for rejecting them , than for rejecting the being of a self-existent God , the connection of spirit with matter , the creation of a planet , the consistency of the Almighty 's power and love with the prevalence of evil . In one or another of these facts I discover what is just as difficult to my comprehension , what is just as perplexing to my intelligence , what just as much baffles my reason and contradicts my experience , as in the equally wellauthenticated facts of the incarnation , or the subjection of a divine Christ to the forms and limitations of a human experience . Indeed , it would seem far more unreasonable to attempt getting clear of the difficulties by supposing Christ to be wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; because we should not only have equally grave difficulties to dispose of in the record , but others more formidable in the moral problem of the universe , the history of God 's dealings with men , and the actual consequences of Christ 's Mediatorship . What was wanted was a Saviour coming forth out of the Godhead , very God of very God , ' at once divine in his nature and human in his sympathies , to restore , to redeem , to rescue man from himself ,  --  to heal a fatal alienation , to put lost man and the Holy Father at one again . Who else but God manifest in human flesh was competent to this ? While accomplishing it , is it very strange that he should sometimes speak of himself , in this condescending and peculiar office , as uaa6le to know or to do certain things as of himself without the Father , with whom he ever dwells in perfect oneness , each in each ; or that in // this human sojourn he should declare himself dependent on that whole and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he came forth into the world ? For that also , and for all the blessed spiritual comfort , light , strength , hope , assurance , promise , salvation , it gives us , let us be humbly and most devoutly thankful . And let us look reverently up to that Lord and Redeemer who in the beginning was God , ' - who left the Father 's bosom for our deliverance from the law of sin and death ,  --  who hath ascended up where he was before ,  --  who has put it past all doubt or question that he and his Father are one ,  --  and who with that Father reigns in consubstantial glory , ever one God , world without end . " pp. 266-268 . We have given this extended account of this eloquent discourse , that our readers may have the opportunity to judge of its orthodoxy . We are confident that they will agree with us in the opinion that it would be difficult for any one to frame a more decided and positive statement of the full and proper deity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orthodox say , " We look with distrust and uncertainty upon these positive expressions of evangelical doctrine , coming from Unitarians ; and justly , because some Unitarians are in the habit of nsing strong and positive Orthodox language without an Orthodox meaning , putting upon it in their own minds a meaning consistent with the Unitarian faith . " We admit the justice , to some extent , of this feeling of distrust , and for the reason thus alleged . Such language is used in some cases by avowed Unitarians-by those who expressly deny the deity of Christ . For instance , IRev . IDr . Thompson , of Salem , in a late article in the Christian Examiner , uses this language : " We chant our response with the Church , and say : God of God , Light of Light , very God of very God , ' not llomoiousion with the Arians , but ilomoonsion with the Athanasians ; and none shall receive a heavier meaning from those divinely loaded words than we . " We do not wonder that the Christian Inquii-er ( Unitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who shall explain to us the meaning of this ? * * * We read this over three or four times , looked at the title page of the Magazine to see if it were really our old friend the Examiner , " &amp;c . Similar language , though not of such overflowing strength , we have seen in an article in the Christian Register , of Boston . We regard such use of language by Unitarians as in one respect a good sign ; for it indicates a disposition among Unitarians , or at least among some Unitarians , to come as near to Orthodoxy as they can , and this is a significant tribute to the merits and the power of Orthodoxy . Yet we regard the use of such language by them as wholly unjustifiable . We do not charge , and do not believe , that these writers have any dishonest or deceitful intention ; but we do say that their use of language is fitted to deceive , and does deceive those who receive it in its // usual and proper meaning . And it stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion and evangelical convictions , by creating , among Orthodox men , a distrust of Unitarian writers who are evangelically inclined . Still , this distrust , right and unavoidable as it is to some extent , does not properly pertain to the expressions of Prof. Huntington . For in the first place , he is not a Unitarian , even nominally , lie has disavowed the Unitarian name , and declared his independence of it , and has given as one reason for so doing that that name does not describe " his religious convictions on several important points . " The language in which he does this was given in our last Number , and need not be repeated here . And then , in the second place , these Unitarian writer8 do , and Prof. Huntington does not , contradict the proper and orthodox meaning of such language . Instead of contradicting , or saying anything inconsistent with the real deity of Christ , he proves it by strong evangelical arguments ; while they not only make statements inconsistent with it , but often strenuously argue against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Doctrine of the Spirit . " In the introduction to that discourse , Prof. Huntington dwells at some length on the significant fact " that both the form of words which Jesus enjoined to be used in administering baptism , and the apostolic benedictions , associate the name of the iloly Spirit with those of the Father and Christ . " He speaks , also , very justly and pertinently , of the mode and spirit in which this doctrine should be considered . He says : " The true construction of a doctrine like this can only be settled by a reverential appeal to the New Testament . A proud understanding is not competent to handle it . Faith in it depends more on a teachable and worshiping heart than an ingenious brain . " After an earnest enforcement of this truth he comes to the inquiry , what do the Scriptures teach ? Here he remarks : " The essential feature of the New Testament doctrine of the Spirit , as it appears to me , is that the coming of the Paraclete is inseparably connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sent by the Saviour in such a sense as not to be fully received till he is glorified , nor otherwise than by faith in him . " He considers " the principal passages of the Saviour ' s instructions , where the promise of his own continued relation to the body of his Church and of the coming of the Holy Spirit are contained , " viz. , those in the fourteenth , fifteenth and sixteenth chapters of John . He finds scattered through them six distinct declarations bearing on the subject , and then proceeds thus : // 439 " From these six propositions , different in form , but capable of being so reconciled as to be one in substance , we deduce the whole doctrine on the subject . They exhaust the statement of it ; and every other expression in the New Testament is in harmony with them . That doctrine can be no other , it seems to us , than this : that , after the body of Jesus should be removed from the Church , he should still continue to carry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls ,  --  which is his eternal ministry ,  --  the Church itself thus becoming the body of his Spirit , thet visible , but he indwelling , yet manifest still in the fruits of holy love and life ; that , in thus acting on the spirits of believers in answer to prayer , the Son , and the Father who sent him , are together , united in counsel and one in purpose ; and that the Agent , now first distinctly revealed to men , by which they thus move and draw and change the heart , is the Holy Spirit , but also known as the Comforter , the Paraclete , the Spirit of Truth , and the Holy Ghost . " Let us now bring together , in as condensed and clear a paraphase as possible , these scattered statements of Jesus and the Evangelist , so as to exhibit a connected exposition of the truth . In my Father 's house are many mansions ; I go there to prepare a place for you . But this my absence will not separate my spirit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try your faith by leaving you to stand alone , and to prevent my religion from being limited by my bodily presence and associations .

Only love me , and keep my sayings , and you shall feel me with you . Pray to the Father in my name ; I also will pray for you ; and the Father , who is one with me , will answer you through me . Thus I will continue to bring you his blessings . No longer in this frame of flesh , but by a certain interior sense awakened in your regenerate souls , quite as quick as the natural eye , I will manifest myself to you ,  --  to the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But inasmuch as the mode of this manifestation is to be changed ,  --  to be inward , and not outward ,  --  you are to know this continued and united presence of my Father and myself , through a new Agent ,  --  the Holy Spirit , the Comforter . He shall visit and renew you , and be your refreshing . He shall carry forward the work of salvation which I have begun in the body . Pray for the Holy Spirit . The world , that is , men of worldly tastes and gross desires , can not unders*and this promise . The world receiveth not this Holy Spirit , neither knoweth him , as it has not received me hitherto , but goeth about to crucify me . That earthly and sinful temper He will reprove ; convicting it of sin , showing it righteousness , and bringing it to judgment . But on you He will so act as to teach and inspire you , bringing to your remembrance all the things that I have said to you with this mortal tongue . So he shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so with you . By believing in the Holy Spirit , you will abide in me , in the strictest unity .

But , except my body were to be crucified , you could not enjoy those higher benefits that come from my resurrection . I can not come to you in the Spirit , till my form is removed . What you can not now understand of these mysteries , the Spirit will gradually reveal to you . He shall take of my truth , and , little by little , age after age , show mankind the full meaning of my gospel and my redemption . It is true , my Father is the sender of this Spirit ; but between my Father and me is no division of interest , or counsel , or honor . Whoever honors one of us , honors both .

We will send to you together the Holy Spirit , the Comforter ; and , when I thus see you again , your heart shall rejoice ; and that joy no man taketh from you . " pp. 276-279 . A comparison of some passages , which we have quoted above from the edition of this sermon given in this volume , with the corresponding passages in the first edition of it , in the Religious Magazine for June , 1852 , will indicate the progress of Dr. Huntington 's mind on this subject , and show that he has now arrived at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sent by the Father and the Son , and is of course , in some sense , distinct from them  --  a belief in the Divinity of the Holy Spirit , and in his distinct personality , in the modified sense in which that phrase is generally used by Orthodox men in connection with this sub , ject . In the first edition we have this sentence : " That in thus acting on the spirits of believers , in answer to prayer , the Son , and the Father who sent him , are together , united in counsel and one in purpose ; and that the name given to that peculiar and secret ministry by which they thus move and draw and change the heart , is the Holy Spirit , but also known as the Comforter , the Paraclete , the Spirit of Truth , and the Holy Ghost . " In the last edition , the last clause of this sentence reads thns : " And that the Agent , now first distinctly revealed to men , by which they thus move and draw and change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the Comforter , the Paraclete , the Spirit of Truth , and the Holy Ghost . " The italics are ours , used to indicate the alteration . In one of the passages quoted above , in which Christ is represented as addressing his disciples , we have this language : " You are to know this continued and united presence of my Father and myself , through a new Agent  --  the Holy Spirit , the Comforter . " In the first edition , that sentence reads thus : " You are to know this continued and united presence of my Father and myself under a new name  --  the Holy Spirit , the Comforter . " IReturning to the point which we left when we began this comparison , we observe that Prof. Huntington next notices the harmon y between his interpretation of our Lord 's discourse in those chapters of John , and other New Testament references to the same doctrine . From this part of the sermon we extract this passage : " Passing on into the preaching of the Apostles , as they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surcharged with the burden of this great doctrine . Everywhere they preached Christ and the resurrection , and coupled with these the office of the Spirit , regenerating and sanctifying the soul . Their Epistles glow and kindle with the same animating assurance . The radiance of that conviction touched with glory their sufferings by persecution , // the miseries of their prison-houses , their perils by the wilderness , and the martyrdoms that crowned their good confession of the cross . None of these things move me , ' cried Paul ; for the Holy Ghost is my witness . ' Whatever fruits of conversion and faith honored their apostleship , they described as not their own , nor of man 's wisdom , but the demonstration of the Spirit , ' and with power . ' Three verses in the Epistle to Titus really condense the whole doctrine into one comprehensive formula : After that the kindness and love of God toward man appeared , not by works of righteousness which we have done , but according to his mercy he saved us , by the washing of regeneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour . ' " It commends this construction to our cordial reception , that it meets all the variety of our different religious habits , suits itself to whatever sincere moods our shifting experience may bring , and , on whichever of the Divine agents in sustaining our moral life we fix our meditation , furnishes us a more satisfying image of each . " pp. 280 , 281 . Tfere , after describing those who " have been trained to fasten their religions reverence and affection , almost exclusively , on the Father , " and another class , who " find their religious life dependent on the person of Christ , " and the adaptation of this doctrine to each of these classes , he adds : " Or , again , if there are others , whose thought turns less to the person of either the Father or the Son , than to that Divine Paraclete proceeding from them both , which we have seen to be called by the New Testament the Spirit , as actually happens with some branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will receive it in simplicity , our doctrine makes ready room for them also* offering a o violence to their peculiar culture or affinities . And these will seize on those many peasages that ascribe the work of renewal to the Holy Ghost , or refer the joy and peace of believing to His power . " p. 283 . We give the conclnding paragraph of the diseourse : " Come , then , thou Holy Spirit , the Renewer , to replenish our wasting lamps , and revive thy work , in the midst of the years ! Come , Guide and Teacher , to take our hands in thine , and pour light on our way and on our mind ! Come , as the Comforter , to heal bleeding hearts , and bind up the bruises of uncharitableness and every sorrow ! Come , Restrainer , to keep our feet , and all our hidden desires and imaginations , from evil ! Come , thou Sanctifier , to purify and perfect us ,  --  unto the worship of the Father , and obedience to the Son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the immortal Vine ,  --  a people patient and believing , and zealous of good works ! " pp. 287 , 288 . We have seen it suggested somewhere that Professor Hnntington is snbstantiahy a Sabellian . " Sabellian " sounds like a terrible name to those who do not know its meaning . It is ab most equal for the purpose of exciting alarm , and the " odium theologicum " to " Arniiniau , " or " Pelagian , " or worse still , ( because it is longer and looks harder , ) " Semi-Pelagi an . " But it conveys no idea of essential heresy to those who know that the revered and beloved names of Isaac Watts and Philip Poddridge are reckoned among the names of Sabellians . The suggestion , however , is utterly disproved , as our readers will see , by these discourses-so palpably and completely disproved that the // question does not need to be argued . If any one , after reading these two sermons , or the extracts which we have given from them , thinks that Dr. Huntington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Sabellianism is , or shamefully deficient in candor and fairness . The question may be asked by some , " But is Professor Huntington a Trinitarian * " The materials for an answer to that question have already been afforded in the account which we have given of these discourses . We have shown that Professor Huntington holds that the Father , the Son , and the holy Ghost are Divine agents , sending and being sent , cotemporaneously acting and interacting , of course in some sense distinct , and yet inseparably and mysteriously united-one God . And that is the Scriptural doctrine of the Trinity . It includes the great truths which constitute that doctrine . It is not indeed the doctrine reduced to a scientific or philosophical formula , as presented by the schools and in the creeds . Nor do we care to have him so present it or hold it . Such presentation or belief of it is not essential to orthodoxy , or to a good title to Christian fellowship , nor , we may add , to the best communication of the Scriptural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Huntington would not reduce to a scientific formula , after the fashion of some , not all , of the creeds  --  a formula which asserts propositions regarding the essence or substance of God . At least , so we infer from the passages we have quoted from the sermons respecting the secrecy and impenetrable mystery of " the celestial adjustments of these revealed personalities , " and of " the interior relations of the Infinite One . " Such scientific formulas the Scriptures do not give . But such formulas as the Scriptures do give , expressive of Trinity in Unity  --  the baptismal formula and the apostolic benedictionsProfessor Huntington does use , and in their fair and unperverted sense . He believes in Father , Son , and Spirit , one God . Indeed we have no doubt that he would receive the best part of one of the creeds relating to this subject : " The Father is God , the Son is God , and the Holy Spirit is God , and yet there are not three Gods , but one God . " And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as more Scriptural , than to go farther , and profess to know , and assert more specific propositions respecting this sacred mystery of the interior constitution of the Divine Being . On this point we are pleased to be able to quote from an article in the North British Review , the representative of the best orthodoxy of Scotland . " The declaration that the Father is God , the Son is God , and the Holy Spirit is God , and yet there are not three Gods , but one // God , sums up the whole of* our knowledge of this inscrutable mystery , and proclaims those two truths which should influence a Christian 's feelings and conduct . Scripture never intended to reveal to us the real and absolute essence of the Divine nature ; it could not be grasped by the human understanding . But Scripture has required us to acknowledge , as against Polytheism and Pantheism , the unity of the Godhead , and to realize practically the farther truth , that each of the Divine persous stands to us in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must think , feel , and act as God . These are the two practical truths which Scripture reveals . Their theoretical and philosophical combination in a single intellectual formula , is a problem of which the solution surpasses the power of human reason . To hold them fast separately is the Christian 's duty ; to unite them philosophically , neither religion nor reason demands . " This , we are confident , accords with the convictions of many of our best Christiau men , and soundest Scriptural scholars . We once read this quotation from the North British Review to one of our best and most learned Christian scholars , and we were struck with his remark upon it . " That represents my case exactly . I hold the disjecta nmemlira of the doctrine firmly ; but I can not put them together . " We deprecate any controversy among evangelical men respecting Professor Huntington 's orthodoxy . We do not think that there can fairly be any , after what he has published in this volume and in the Religious Magazine and Independent Journal . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public confidence , quietly to pursue his blessed work of winning souls to Christ in his new sphere of labor , one of the most important and responsible in the world . But that , considering his antecedents and the present state of theological parties , is , perhaps , more than can be expected . We have occupied so much space with our review of these two doctrinal discourses , that we can notice but slightly the rest of the volume . The subjects are varied , pertinent , and practical ; and they are treated in a manner which fully vindicates Dr. Huntington 's distinguished reputation as a strong and eloquent Christian preacher . The only criticism we have to make on the style is , that it is too uniformly elevated and elaborate , too suitable for an oration before a Literary Society . It would be more effective , if it was at times less sustained and more homely . There is one marked characteristic of these sermuons . They are replete with the Christian element . We know // of no preacher whose discourses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine of the Spirit , Dr. Huntington describes three classes to whom that doctrine adapts itself ,  --  whose minds turn , the one most to the Father , the second to Christ , and the third to the Holy Spirit . Of the second he speaks thus , " Another class  --  and it seems to , us they are apt to be Christians of a more fervent and effectual faith-find their religious life , not only originally , but constantly , dependent on the person of Christ . They want to feel the touch of his hand , and the breath of his intercession . They are resolute according to the frequency with which they sit at his feet , and vigilant according as they are conscious that he is near to be wounded by their backslidings , or to rejoice personally in their moral victories ; and they are constant to his Church according as they realize him to be veritably in it a le*der , a friend , a reconciler . " Of this class so well described he is , in our judgment , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to be , " Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end . " We should like to give an account of some of these sermons , particularly of one from the text , " Ask and it shall be given you , " and one entitled " Salvation , not from suffering but by it . " But we should thus fill more than our allotted space . We will conclude with making two quotations as specimens both of sentiment and style  --  the first from a sermon entitled " Homeward Steps , " from the text , " For ye were as sheep going astray ; but now ye are returned unto the shepherd and bishop ot your souls , "  --  the same which he preached with so much favor , as we were informed by the papers , in the pulpit of iL3owdoin College . He sums up the successive stages through which Christ leads his followers under the terms " the Need , the Difficulty , the Warning , the Relief , the Application of the Relief , the Fruit , and the Result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " 6 . What is the Fruit ? It is righteousness . Infalliably and invariably , it is righteousness . If that fruit does not grow , some one of the previous links in the line of causes has been left out . The penitence was not sincere . The reform was not true . The faith was not genuine . By their fruits ye shall know them . Not righteousness always in one style of its manifestations . It may be in a tradesman 's bargains , or a mechanic 's job ; in a scholar 's simplicity , or a clerk 's fidelity . It may be in a forbearing disposition , where there are daily provocations ; it may bein magnanimity toward amean competitor ; it may be on a couch of slow and patient suffering , where needed energies are crippled , and a dependent family are left unprovided for . But it is none the less right . eousncss in one case than the other ,  --  as dear to God , as resplendent to the spiritual eyesight of angels . It has equally glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobbies of a statehouse or through the bribes of the capitol , and in the woman that sways with patient justice the perplexing politics of the nursery , or is daring enough to resist the // tyranny of fashion . It is in the politican that refuses to mortgage his conscience to the Devil , and in the freeman that can not be hired by office , nor persuaded by sophistry , to make his brother-man a slave . It is in the preachers that reverence their message more than their salaries , and in parishes that keep a soul as well as a sanctuary . The lustre of a saintly heart needs no artificial reflectors to enhance its glory . It is splendid by its own original radiance . The panoply of sacred principle that lets no arrow of the adversary through any Joint of its harness is the Christian 's every-day garment . Every Christian cause is stronger for his hand and his tongue . No tempter is cunning enough to wring a scandal from his behavior . No neighbor shall hesitate on which side , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is committed frankly . He is pledged irrevocably . He is consecrated manfully . If he is Christ 's man , there is no situation , nor turn , nor emergency , where Christ is not honored in his life . And that because the Master 's spirit is in him . " Christianity patronizes no system of halfeducation . It asks a form of manhood embodying every natural idea that philosophy has propounded , genius represented , or history disciplined . It is no ally of a stationary intelligence , nor of a sluggish will , nor of a timid heart . Growth , is its law ,  --  growth in wisdom and growth in love . It is not satisfied , therefore , with conversion , but is quite as exacting of sanctification , bidding the convert forget the elements and go on to perfection , Christianity wants to build after the pattern of a divine beauty , a symmetry without blemish , and a wholeness without defect . It is itself incarnated in a living example of that completeness . It has a welcome for every contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministerial office , not exalting its telescopes and crucibles into an apparatus of will-worship , displacing dependence and redemption . It has nothing but contempt for that complacent , Pharisaic style of piety , which fancies its only needed work is done when it has just grazed the gates of hell by sliding into a lazy church ; which identifies entering the ark of the covenant with escaping from the vineyards of brave toil , and goes shuffling and dozing through a life that vibrates between formalities on Sunday and intense vitalities all the week , - alive in the shop and caucus , but asleep at church ; - character all the while rotting away under those obscene inconsistencies , a cowardly conscience and a voluble confession ,  --  a . brain boiling with the plots of politics or the bargains of trade , and a heart hard as the nether millstone to all the sufferings of hninanity ;  --  a prayerless life , or else a lifeless prayer . " pp. 82-84 . Our last quotation shall be from a sermon entitled " National IRetribution and the National Sin , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fugitive Slave Law . " " This , among others , seems to me one of the gravest errors into which the present posture of the public mind in reference to the recent legislation on slavery has conducted ns ,  --  that so many who speak and write on the subject , both in public journals and in private conversation , refuse to recognize the existence of any other than two broadly distinguished classes ; namely , unqualified advocates of the law as it stands , and traitors to the government . I can not think that the self-possession of this community has been so completely unsettled , nor its intellect so stultified , that it is necessary to resort to this sweeping classification in order to guard against an alleged incipient rebellion . It not only exasperates well-disposed persons by its presumption , but it inflicts a positive wound on the truth . There is a third class of men in the country ,  --  - how numerous can not be told till they are counted , but not very inconsiderable in numbers nor contemptible in character .

They regard it as the special and overshadowing affront of this nation against the Father of eternal justice , truth , liberty , love . They know that it is an anomaly in our national institutions , an abnegation of our history , a plague in our politics , a gigantic curse upon industry , a foul insult to morality , a blight upon learning , science , and the arts , the annihilation of God 's ordinance in the family , the prostitution of woman , the scourge of innocence , the violation , direct or indirect , of each of the commandments , and the denial of the Gospel , the intensest meanness and the foulest filthiness and the most profane impiety , the consummation of crimes , the comprehensive antagonist of the kingdom of Heaven , constituting , in the whole and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' standing where it ought not .

They believe that such aggressions are forbidden by the civil constitution , while the very continuance of the wrong , in any shape , is rebuked by the entire spirit of that venerated instrument , and by the designs and convictions of the men that formed it .

" There is no measure , especially in a republic , so radical , as that which arrays what is most Christian in a nation against the magisterial autlioity ; no publication so inflammatory , as a law that commands a moral people to do that which a large majority of them believe to be unjust ; no document so incendiary , as one that sets on fire the quenchless instinct that abhors oppression , or wakes from sleep that unmanageable instinct which has shaken so many thrones ,  --  that resistance to tyrants is obedience to God .

In the preface to this volume Professor Huntington remarks that " one topic , the reconciliation in Christ , though by no means neglected here , has a less extended and less complete presentation , because of a desire to discuss it separately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible now . " Our gratification at the views which he has already given to the public on that topic , was expressed in our last number . We hope that he will soon give it the more extended discussion which he desires . On account of his peculiar history , experi euce , and relations , there is no man in the country who could so effectually serve the cause of Christ by such a discussion .
