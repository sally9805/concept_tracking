Speech delivered in the House of Representatives in Congress , June 15th , 1852 , against an Amendment proposed to the California illint Bill , for charging a Seigniorage on the Coinage of Gold ; and a Report on the same Subject . By JAMES BRooKs , Representative from New York . Washington : Published in the National Intelligencer. 3 . The Banker 's Magazine and Statistical Register . Edited by J. SMITH HoMANs . Volume VI. , from July , 1851 , to June , 1852 , inclusive . Boston : Crosby , Nichols &amp; Co. 8vo. pp. 1020 . IT is now generally admitted , that we are on the eve of a great revolution in the commercial world , to be caused by a considerable decline in the value of money . The precious metals , after maintaining a nearly uniform value for over two centuries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of the supply of gold , to undergo a great change , not only in their relation to each other , but in their value as compared with that of all other commodities in the world . This change is not to be a merely nominal one . It might seem , indeed , that , as the precious metals are a universal measure of value , any depreciation of them would amount only to a general rise of prices , all commodities being affected in precisely the same ratio , so that their relation to each other would remain unaltered . This is true ; such a change would not benefit or injure any one . But all stipulations for the payment of money at a future day will be really affected to the full extent of the change which the precious metals may undergo while the contract is outstanding . A single instance will enable us to see the vast importance , in this respect , of a depreciation in the value of money . The national debt of Great Britain , that great incubus which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , and which has been properly regarded as putting the English people under very heavy bonds to keep the peace , as any considerable enlargem cut of it by another war would make the burden wellnigh intolerable , - this mountain of debt , should the expected change take place , will shrink into a molehill . It may all be paid off in a few years , with as little effort as it now costs to pay merely the interest . A revolution which will have this effect , and a proportional one on all other contracts to deliver money at a future day , may well be considered a momentous one . But though the fact that such a revolution is at hand is now generally admitted , people have very vague ideas about its nature and probable extent , and about the measures which ought to be taken to prepare for it and mitigate the shock . It may be worth while , therefore , to consider the subject at some length , especially as it affords some beautiful illustratioub of the theory of mo* ney . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of the depreciation , and the time within which it may be expected . Fortunately there is one example on record of a perfectly similar change , the study of which will throw great light upon the present inquiry . We refer , of course , to the depreciation in value of the precious // metals which took place over two hundred years ago , in consequence of the vastly increased supply from the mines of South America and Mexico . We do not need to know the whole amount of gold and silver which was actually in use in the world , either as coii , plate , or articles of luxury , before the discovery of America . It is a well-ascertained principle in political economy , that the permanent or average value of a commodity depends , not on the larger or smaller stock of it which men possess , but on the average cost of its production . If the stock is ever so large , the value of it can not permanently , or for a long period of years , fall below this cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more would not be remunerated , no more would be produced ; and the constant consumption would steadily diminish the stock , till the value of what remained would rise high enough to pay the laborer for the effort of procuring a. fresh supply . On the other hand , if the stock is ever so small , no one will pay more for any portion of it than it would cost him to raise or manufacture the article for himself . There may be slight fluctuations of price , depending on the fluctuating ratio of the supply to the demand ; but the steady average value , the point about which the price oscillates , never departing far from it in either direction , is the average cost of produ tion . It is important to recollect this , as some have supposed that the great addition to the stock of gold , made by the supply from IRussia , California , and Australia within three years , must cause an almost immediate depreciation of its value . But till it is ascertained that this is a permanent increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many years to yield as much as they have done during the past twelvemonth , so as to affect the average cost of production , the change of value must be quite small . But this point will be considered hereafter . We have adverted to it now , only to prove that the laborious and ineffectual calculations , which some have made in attempting to ascertain how much gold and silver existed in the world before the American mines were worked , are not needed . It is enough if we can form some cstim* te , though a very vague one , of the average annual // product of these metals during the Middle Ages , and down to the time of Columbus . The data are few and uncertain ; but they allow us to say very positively , that the average annual supply did not then exceed three millions of clollars. * How much was this increased by the snpplies from America during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries ? Humboldt is here the only authority generally relied upon ; and as he made very extensive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been written upon the subject , had ready access to official sources of information unknown to former writers , was well versed in the theory and practice of mining , and critically examined some of the most celebrated mines , it is probable that his statements are a very near approximation to the truth . He tells us that the annual supplies of the precious metals obtained from America were as follows . Dollars a year on an average . From 1492 to 1500 . . . . 250,000 1500 to 1545 . . . . 3,000,000 1545 to 1600 . . . . 11,000,000 1600 to 1700 . . . . 16,000,000 1700 to 1750 . . . . 22,500,000 1750 to 1803 . . . . 35,300,000 We see , then , that in the first half of the sixteenth century , the supplies from America had doubled the annual product . In the latter half of this century , they rendered it nearly five times as large . In the seventeenth century , it became over six times , and in the eighteenth , over eleven times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in the latter half of the sixteenth century was owing to the discovery of the mines of Potosi , which were first systematically worked in 1545 . How great and how rapid a depreciation of the value of money was caused by this vast increase of supply ? Here . again , the means for forming an opinion are very imperfect , being chiefly an extensive and laborious comparison of the prices , at different periods , of certain leading commodities , which are in uniform and perpetual de33 * * As late as 1800 , Humboldt estimates that all the Europe n and Asiatic mines did not yield annually more than five millions of dollars // inand . The staple articles of food , such as grain and meat , are the best for this purpose , as it may be presumed that they are not often produced in larger quantities than are wanted , and as nearly the same amount of labor is required for the production of a given quantity of them in one century as in another . If a genuine record can be obtained of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such articles for a long series of years , the variations , if any , in the value of the precious metals during those years may be deduced from it , allowance being made , of course , for any alterations of the quantity of pure metal passing under the same denomination of coin , and for the state of the coinage , whether worn and clipped , or fresh and perfect . Such a record is found in the accounts of Eton College , and in the lists of prices collected by Bishop Fleetwood and M. IDupr* de St. Maur . The conclusions deduced by various writers from these accounts do not agree very well ; but the variations do not materially affect the result for the purpose which we now have in view . We select the computations made by Adam Smith , as they were made with great care and knowledge of the subject , and have been generally accepted by later writers on political economy . Adam Smith says the American mines do not seem to have produced any effect upon prices till after 1*70 , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter of a century . Between Th9*3 and 1620 , silver fell to about one third of its former value ; and about 1636 , it had fallen to one fourth part of that value , where it has remained with little variation almost to the present day . Before Th70 , a quarter ( eight bushels ) of wheat of middle quality was sold in England , on an average of a long period of years , for about two ounces of pure silver ; about 1600 , ( still taking an average of many years , so that the very good and very bad crops may offset each other , ) the price had advanced to a little over six ounces ; about 1636 , it had risen to nearly eight ounces . The present average value of a quarter of wheat in England , since the repeal of the Corn Laws , does not vary much from forty-three shillings , which contain almost exactly eight ounces of pure silver . Comparing these results with the table already given // of the annual product of the precious metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of money for half . a century had no effect on its value , or did not raise prices g all ; 2 . That making the annual product five times as gre ; t had no effect upon its value for five-and-twenty years , after which time , however , the value gradually fell to one third of what it had been ; 3 . That thirty-six years after the annual product had become over six times as great , the had fallen to one fourth of its former amount ; 4 . That from 16.36 to 1846 , two hundrcd and ten years , the val of the precious metals underwent no material alt eratian , though meanwhile the annual supply of them had beto* e eleven or twelve times greater than what it had been before the discovery of America . Such was the result of the only experiment recorded ' in history , which enables us to form any conjecture as to the probable effect upon the money market of the vast *tddition which has been made to the annual supply of gold within a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia . To make the comparison clear and obvious , we have stated the results in their broad%t form , or with the fewest limitations and doubts ; we *h*ll afterwards have considerations to suggest which m y materially modify the conclusions to be drawn from this statement . The figures for the other term of the eornparison may be found in a former article ; but as they are there given only in Troy weight , and with refereuc* *o the single question as to the relative value of thc tWo precious metals , it is worth while to bring then'i togctbser , and state them over again , in Federal money . One pound Troy of pure silver equals about $15. *7 . Que pound Troy of pure gold is almost exactly $248.00 , cording to the present value of the eagle . About the year 1800 , the annual supply of gold amounted to $12,648,000 , and of silver to $36,289,00* making a total of $48,937,008 . There is reason to b*-lieve that the large portion of this product , which was furnished by the American mines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contest l*eg*n which finally produced the independence of the Spaui*h American colonies . The revolutionary troubles , a*n4 *e proscription of the old Spanish families to whonx the // mines chiefly belonged , caused the works in many cases to be abandoned , and there was a great falling off of the product . Mr. Jacob estimated , that , for the twenty years ending with 1829 , they did not yield annually over $20,000,000 , or considerably less than half of their former product . But he evidently exaggerates the falling off ; and the estimate which Mr. MeCulloch formed in 1834 may be safely extended to the whole period , making the annual supply from all parts of the earth to be $30,000,000 . Soon after 1834 , the gold product of the Russian mines and washings began to swell the amount very rapidly , so that Mr. McCulloch affirmed , in 1845 , that if the supply from this source should continue a few years longer , it would cause a fall in the value of gold as compared with silver and with every thing else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parts of the world to $67,000,000 , making it nearly one third larger than it had been iu 1800 . But what was this to the astounding results produced by the discovery of the Californian and Australian gold washings ? The estimates already given make the total product of gold for the present year to be $138,384,000 , and of silver about , $39,900,000 , forming a total of $178,284,000 . Bringing together these amounts , and using the nearest round numbers , as we are dealing only with estimates , we have this table . Annual average . From 1800 to 1809 $49,000,000 " 1810 to 1836 30,000,000 " 1847 67,000,000 " 1852 178,000,000 The supply for the present year , then , is nearly six times larger than the annual product twenty years ago , and about three and a half times larger than the greatest amount obtained in any one year before 1840 . As yet , little perceptible effect has been produced upon the market value , because the increase has been very sudden . But even if we allow that the maximum has been obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no material falling off for five years longer , that there will be a steady but slow depreciation in the value of gold ; and should the annual supply be maintained at or near // the present amount for a quarter of a century , money xviii sink to a fourth part of its former value , if not still lower . There are indications that the maximum has been reached , but as yet there are no tokens of falling off . Notwithstanding the great increase in the number of laborers , the Californian supply this year will hardly , if at all , exceed that of 1851 ; and then the amount obtained in 1853 from this source will most probably be lessened . The deficiency , it is true , will be made up by the product of the Australian washings , which , so far as we can judge from the result in California , have not yet yielded the largest annual supply of which they are capable . It may he safe to estimate , that , for a few years longer , the increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The oreat difference between the experiment which was tried two or three centuries ago , and that Vh*ch is now in progress , is , that , in the former case , far the greater part of the addition which was made to the world 's stock of the precious metals was in silver , while nearly the whole of the present increase is in gold . And this is a very important difference , as regards the question of the pi*oba* ble long continuance of the enlarged annual product . Silver is obtained by mining , and the veins which are worked are most frequently found to grow richer as they are followed into the bowels of the earth . The expense of working them increases as we descend , but the steadily increasing product is more than an offset for this enlarged cost . Gold , on the other hand , is generally obtained by washing from a superficial deposit of gravel and sand . It is chiefly found in what the geologists call " the drift , " and in a stratum of it of no great thickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , and lying at or near the surface , almost any number of persons can be engaged in obtaining it without impeding each other 's operations . If , also , as is the case in California , and to a great extent in Australia , the land in the annferous district has been but imperfectly , or not at all , appropriated either by individuals or the government , - if it is in the main open to all comers , as the Great Bank is to all fishermen , - then , large as the district may be , it will soon be covered with gold-hunters . The most promis // ing localities will be quickly exhausted ; and then , every year , the labor of gathering the shining dust will increase , and the returns will diminish . The experience of California is conclusive on this point . There can be no doubt that the average gains of each washer are now considerably less than they were two years ago . True , the first search is generally imperfect , and a second washing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards yield a fair profit . So , also , the solid rock , though it be tough quartz , in which the gold spangles now found in the drift were originally imbedded , may be crushed and ground by heavy machinery , and a supply of auriferous sand and gravel be thus obtained by artificial means , in addition to that which natural agencies have spread out over the surface . So we may not anticipate that the gold-fever will subside as rapidly as it rose , or that the gold-bearing districts will ever be completely exhausted . Still , two processes must always be more laborious and expensive than one , and the ground will no longer be open to every comer , though he has no other capital than a stout pair of arms , and a great capacity of enduring fatigue . When the business is all reduced to pounding up primary or metamorphic rocks with machines which are yet to be invented , and to washing gravel for the second time , it is reasonable to expect , that , although capitalists may get a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring home gold at the rate of three or four millions a month . Taking all these considerations into view , together with the fact that we have now three great gold-bearing regions to depend upon , so distant from each other as Russia , California , and Australia , it will not be deemed incautious to anticipate , that the annual supply of the precious metals will not fall below a hundred millions of dollars for many years , and that , within a quarter of a century , this sitpply will depreciate money to one half or one third of its present value . Very good reasons have been given why the discovery of the American mines , and the influx into th' market of eleven times as much silver as before , did not reduce its value in the same proportion , but only in the ratio of 4 to 1 ; and why , when the ratio of the quantity of silver to // that of gold was as 45 to 1 , the ratio of their values was only as 1 to 15 . In commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost , silver has been far more generally in use than gold . It has supplied much the larger portion of the currency of all nations . With some nations of the East , the Chinese for instance , gold is not used at all for this purpose . Even on the continent of Europe , silver is , in many cases , the only legal tender , gold being merely an article of merchandise , which is sold at an agio that fluctuates from week to week , though , of course , few people will refuse to receive it in payment . Silver , again , is much in use as plate and for other articles of luxury ; all but the very poorest families in this country have at least a few silver spoons ; and the aggregate existing in this form , in plate , watches , pencils , &amp;c. , probably much exceeds the quantity which circulates as money . Gold is in some nse for trinkets , but in very little for plate , except by crowned heads . Silver must always be used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen much below its present value . Our gold dollar piece is inconveniently small , and will not probably conic into general circulation , unless there should be some alteration in its form . The general principle is , that the value of money falls in precisely the same ratio in which its quantity is increased . If the whole money in cirenlation should be doubled , prices would be doubled ; if it was only increased one fourth , prices would rise one fourth . This is not the case with commodities generally , the value of which does not vary in the same ratio with the excess or deficiency of the supply ; because the desire , being for the thing itself , iuay be stronger or weaker , and the amount of xvhat people are willing to expend upon it , being always limited , may be very unequally affected by the difficulty or facility of attainment . But money is desired as the means of purchasing every thing , and the demand for it , therefore , consists of every thing which people have to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money , holds good only under the supposition that the quantity of commodities , the number of exchanges , and the number of people having occasion to effect exchanges , remain // unaltered . Otherwise , if there be an increase in either of these respects , the quantity of money being unchanged , the value of that money will rise ; or if that money is increasing , the increase in these other respects may neutralize , wholly or in part , the depreciation of that money . This was the case after the discovery of America . There was an immense enlargement of commerce and maunfactnres at that period , and a great improvement in the modes of living . The discovery of America itself , and of the passage round the Cape of Good Hope , and the cobnization of the West by Europeans , greatly enlarged the demand for money . Before 1*OO , vastly the larger portion of the people were engaged in agriculture ; they raised most of the articles which they needed by their own labor , and obtained many others by direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing pursuits , and the consequent division of labor greatly increased the number of proper mercantile exchanges . The middle classes now first came into notice as a distinct power in the state . As wealth advanced , luxury grew apace . The actual consumption of the precious metals , by abrasion of the coin , the wear of plate , lace , and trinkets , by plating and gilding , and by losses through shipwreck or fire , became considerable . It is easy to perceive why , under such circumstances , the supply having become eleven times as great , the value fell only to one fourth of what it had been . On the other hand , why the value did not advance again , in the century during which the supply was nearly stationary , though commerce , wealth , and luxury were still rapidly increasing , is a point which requires explanation . But as society advances , means are discovered for economizing the use of money . The vast extension of credit ; the establishment of banks , and especially of savings ' banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of small sums , which would otherwise be hoarded or lie dormant in the hands of individuals ; the circulation of bank-notes , checks , and bills of exchange , which perform nearly all the functions of money ; and , more than all perhaps , the introduction of accounts current among traders , by which purchases are set off against sales , and commodities are thus virtually bartered for commodities , // money being needed only at the final settlement , and then only to a trifling amount , - all are expedients for completing exchanges without the actual transfer of coin . Only the rapidly extended use of these expedients could have prevented a considerable rise in the value of money , and consequent fall of prices , between 1810 and 1840 , when the annual supply of the precious metals was much diminished , and the operations of commerce greatly enlarged . Is it probable that the effect of the present vastly increased supply of the precious metals will be , to any considerable extent , retarded or neutralized by an increased demand for money , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances likely to produce this result , except the colonization of the gold-bearing regions themselves ; and even this can have comparatively little influence . These countries , it is true , are very distant from the world 's great centres of commerce and wealth , and their population grows with marvellous rapidity . In all distant colonies , and especially in those formed under the excitement of searching for gold , the various expedients for economizing the use of money are slowly introduced and imperfectly developed . Time is needed to import the machinery of banking and all the refinements of trade , and especially for the establishment of confidence in the community , so that large operations can be conducted upon credit . For many years , at least , California and Australia must use chiefly a hard money currency , while large amounts of bullion will be in Iransitu , - wandering about , as it were , from one country to another , to find where they will be of most value , - before they pass into active circulation as currency . But these circumstances can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not materially lessen or weaken it . Perfect as the machinery of trade now is , and perfectly as it is understood , no country which is colonized by commercial nations can remain far behind the mother land in the use of money-saving expedients . It seems most probable that the general princip ! e will hold , that the value of money will fall in the same ratio in which the average annual supply of it is increased . Leaving all these preliminary considerations , then , we come to the main question ; - Is there any thing in the voL . Lxxv. - No. 1u*. 34 // prospect of a great decline in the value of money to create serious uneasiness and alarm ? We suppose that the decline will be gradual , that it will be spread over many years , that at least a quarter of a century must elapse before it can be completed . There will be a rise in thc prices of all commodities , with a corresponding increase in wages and salaries . Labor will be higher paid , both because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the articles it produces will have a greater nominal value , and because the cost of living will be greater , so that , if wages and salaries did not rise , the labor could not be had . The rise of prices being general , will consequently be only nominal ; that is , one commodity may be bartered for another on just the same terms as before . If , now , when flour is five dollars a barrel , it takes five barrels of flour to buy one coat , after money has fallen to one half of its IDresent value , the coat can still be had for five barrels of flour ; but it will then be said to be worth ftv dollars , and the flour to be ten dollars a barrel , instead of five . In this narrow view of the subject , therefore , or so far as this effect extends , no one will be directly benefited , and no one directly injured . With respect to outstanding obligations , or contracts to deliver money at a future day , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars at a time when that sum will purchase twenty barrels of flour , or an equivalent amount of other commodities , and am not called upon to repay it till money has so far fallen in value th. t the sum will buy only ten barrels , the debt is really cancelled by returning only one half of the value which was borrowed . To this extent , therefore , every one will be benefited so far as he owes money , and will be injured so far as he has money to receive . But in either case , he will be affected only by the amount of the depreciation which takes place in the interval between the contraction of the debt and its payment . If twentyfive years elapse before the depreciation is coiupleted , and if it take place uniformly , or at the rate of two per cent . a year , then all promises to pay , which have not more than a year to run , will not be affected to the extent of more than two per cent . Now , vastly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary corirse of busi // ness , are completed within the year ; they will not be so much affected by the general decline in the value of money as they often have been by the common fluctuations of interest , and by changes in the price of particular commodities . Often , within the last ten years , money has been borrowed when the current rate of interest did not exceed five per cent . a year , and the time of repaying it has come when it could with difficulty be had at one per cent . a month . We may say , generally , then , that all the *ommon transactions of business will not be sensibly affected by the great change which is in prospect . But all fixed money payments which are now contracted for , and have many years to run , xviii be seriously affected by the coming alteration ; that portion of them which extends over a full quarter of a century , will experience the full effect of it . All government stocks , and other stocks yielding a fixed rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid off in a few years , all bank stock , and other permanent investments of money yielding income only under the form of interest , and all property let on long leases at a fixed annual rent , must decline in value with the money which they represent . Such stocks , and the property also , if the lease be a perpetual one , when the depreciation is complete , will possess only half their present relative value . The nominal income yielded by them will remain the same , but it vill only purchase half as many commodities as before . There will be no actual loss to the community , for what one loses , another gains . The British tax-payer , for instance , xviii profit by the whole amount of the British faudholders ' loss . As the depreciation goes on , taxation may be extended *ari passu , without throwing any additional burden upon the community ; and a sinking-fund , formed out of the surplus thus obtained , would pay off the national debt in less than one generation . As such stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to hand , the total loss upon any portion of them xviii seldom fall on one person ; it will be divided among many , and thus be distributed among the wealthicr portion of the community , who , profiting in their capacity as tax-payers by the depreciation which occaIons this loss , xviii have no great reason to complain . // Life a nnuitants , persons who have insured their lives , mort*agees on long periods , and those who have let property on permanent or long leases , will be almost the only class compelled to bear the loss without any direct compensation or means of escape . The usually called " money at interest , " will , of course , snifer the full effect of the depreciation ; but , as the oxvnership of real estate is commonly connected with the possession of such funds , and as the value of real estate will rise even in a higher ratio than the prices of commodities , owing to the general eagerness to secure the only form of permanent investment which will not be affected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case will not be generally without cornpensation . The rates of interest can not be directly altered by the change . If gold sinks to half of its present value , the $100 of principal , and the 6 of annual interest for it , will be affected in precisely the same ratio ; both sums will purchase but half as much of any given commodity as can now be obtained for them . Being affected in the same manner , and to the same degree , their relation to cach other will remain unaltered . Indirectly , however , a slight diminution in the rates of interest will probably be produced . The great addition to the stock of the precious metals will appear , at first , in the form of floating capital , seeking investment ; it will swell the specie reserves of the banks , making them eager to extend the circulation of their notes . Thus until the prices of commodities begin to be sensibly affected , there will be more lenders than borrowers , and money will be offered at a lower interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influx of gold , the specie reserves of ' the banks are distended to repletion . The Bank of England has the enormous sum of twenty-two millions sterling in its vaults , or nearly 110 millions of dollars , which is about double the amount that is usually considered a safe basis for its circulation . On the strength of this large reserve , its charter allows it to issue in bank-notes thirty-six millions of pounds sterling ; but all its efforts can not raise the active circulation over twenty-three millions . The Bank of France aNo , *- , // has specie to the amount of 120 millions of dollars , or far more than it needs . Our own Sub-Treasury , or government Exchequer , has about seventeen millions ; and our banks have more than they know what to do with . Supported by these heavy amounts of specie in their vaults , the banks of England , France , and America might safely increase their issues of notes to a very great extent ; and they must so increase them , or their profits will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their customers , and money is offered at very low rates . Everyxv here there appears to be a superfluity of currency , or of money seeking investment , which must soon produce its usual results . A specuiatihg fever can not be long delayed , and then will come tbe. *. - ise of prices , and the old rates of interest will be restored . It is only the coin in active circulation which operates directly upon prices . What is in the vaults of the banks is dormant in this respect , its office being only to guard the really active portion of the currency against frequent and sudden fluctuations . The effects of an influx o efilux of the precious metals are first felt on these bank reserves , which so far retard or deaden the shock , that it is not even perceptible by the community at large till the increase or drain has become very serious . Then , even the banks begin to feel the pressure . After an unnatural inflation of prices by a speculating fever , **he heavy importations of goods , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specie reserves , which are their ballast , that they find they must furl sail , or contract their paper issues , if they would not be thrown on their beam-ends . On the other hand , an anomalous state of things , like that which now exists , creating an immense influx of specie , they find their ballast so much increased that the motion of the vessel ha* become sluggish , and they can not force their way through the water unless they spread more sail , or induce their customers to borrow a larger amount of bank notes . To change the figure , our specie reservoirs are all full now , and they must soon find vent , and pour out their fertilizing streams over the country . It may seem strange , that , as the spirit of speculation has usually been rife when but slight temptation was : 34 ' // offered , it should now show itself so dull , though there is a moral certainty that there must soon be a general rise of prices . The reason is , that the prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempt men into hazardous enterprises so strongly as the chance of a sudden and great enhancement of the price of one commodity or several . The report of a war with China may double or triple the price of tea in a month ; or a rumor of the potato-rot and a failure of crops in England may create a fever almost instantaneously in the flour market here in America . But a gradual enhancement in the money value of all commodities will not tempt men to purchase largely on borrowed capital . There may be brief and violent fluctuations in the relative value of particular commodities , while the great movement is silently going on , which slowly enhances the value of all . It is conceivable , and even probable , that the first effect of this abundance of capital seeking investment , and the consequent diminution of the rate of interest , will be to lower the prices of many commodities , instead of raising them , becanse these circumstances aid and stimulate production . More cotton will be spun , because it will be more easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . It may be readily inferred , from what precedes , that , far from regarding a considerable decline in the value of money , when produced by natural causes , as a calamity , we consider it as a blessing . It will greatly alleviate the burden of taxation in many states that are now oppressed by a heavy national debt . Private debts , as well as public , will become easier to bear ; they will be subject to a steady process of abatement , too slow , and compensated in too great a variety of ways , to occasion any serious loss to the creditor , and still affording a sensible relief to all who have payments to make . The greater proportion by far of fixed payments is made by those who are engaged in business or industrious undertakings , to those who are enjoying leisure and wealth . Thus , the relief and the encouragement come to the more active and industrious classes , while the loss , small in proportion , falls upon those who are most able to bear it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // prices , stimulate all forms of industry and enterprise . As the operations of trade and manufacture are quickened , wages tend to rise even in a higher ratio than the prices of commodities . Thus the condition of laborers is ameliorated , and the inequality in the distribution of wealth , which is the great misfortune of the most prosperous nations , is slowly diminished . Hume , long ago , remarked that , " in every kingdom into which money begins to flow in greater abundance than formerly , every thing takes a new face ; labor and industry gain life , the merchant becomes more enterprising , the manufacturer more diligent and skilful , and even the farmer follows his plough with greater alacrity and attention . But when gold and silver are diminishing , the workman has not the same employment from the manufacturer and merchant , though he pays the same price for every thing in the market . The farmer can not dispose of his corn and cattle , though he must pay the same rent to his landlord . The poverty , beg*ary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even so cautious and conservative a writer as MeCulloch fully admits the truth of this view , though he adds the obvious and just qualification , that the fall in the value of money , which is to be advantageous to a country , must proceed from natural causes , and not be an intentional reduction by the authority of the state . Apart from the obligation to act with good faith and equal justice to all classes , which is incumbent upon every government , it is obvious that any measure , having this end in view , would occasion a great shock to public and private credit , and cause a large amount of capital to be transported to other lands as to places of security . Those who were apprehensive that a decline in the value of money , produced by the increased supply of the precious metals , would derange the dperations of business , and destroy large amounts of wealth , may console themselves by remembering that England , France , and the United States have , at no remote period of their history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crises similar in character , but more violent and sudden than that which is now in prospect . In May , 1837 , all the banks in the United States suspended specie payments ; and the immediate consequence was a depreciation of // their paper , or a rise of specie to a premium , difti*ring in amount in the various States according to the various degrees of solvency of their respective banks , but of which the average for the whole country was at least 12 per cent . The inevitable result followed , that specie disappeared from the circulation , and all obligations were discharged in paper , - that is , by the payment of 88 cents on the dollar . If a person lent *1,000 in April of that year , to be repaid in June , he lent what was in fact 1,000 silver dollars , each worth 100 cents , and received back 1,000 paper dollars , each worth only 88 cents . The event , of course , was an act of national and universal bankruptcy , every creditor receiving , for an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was due to him . The United States government alone , in the exercise of its prerogatives as sovereign , refused to submit to this loss , and obliged all its debtors to pay specie ; - an act of strict justice , it is true , but one which caused it a greater loss by bad debts than it would have suffered by consenting to share the loss equally with the co nimunity . This alteration in the value of the currency was far more violent , and more sweeping in its effects , than that which we have now to expect . It was a depreciation of 12 per cent. , and as it took place at once , it literally affected all debts which came due while it continued . But a gradual depreciation of two or three per cent . a year will have scarcely a perceptible influence on the great bulk of business transactions , which involve obligations to pay that have only a few months to run . It is more important to observe , that the suspension itself , or the acknowledgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had already taken place , was felt as a relief . It had been preceded by a period of advancing prices , great activity in commerce and manufactures , and universal prosperity . These high prices could not be maintained , because the inflation of the currency had been unnatural , and was , therefore , temporary . The suspension came , not because the currency had expanded , but because it could not expand any further , - because there were not gold and silver enough to maintain it at the point which it had reached . The distress was caused , not by the decline // in the value of money , but by its advance , - by the contraction of prices , and ihe restoration of things to the old standard . It was felt , not when a debt of 100 dollars could be paid off by 88 dollars , but when a debt contracted by receiving virtually only 88 dollars had to be discharged by paying 100 . As no such reaction or collapse can follow , when the rise of prices has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the augmented supply of the precious metals , we shall have , in the case before us , the period of prosperity , and a long one too , without being obliged to pay bitterly for it afterwards . It was just so during the suspension of specie payments by the Bank of England , that began in February , 1797 , and continued till 1819 . The depreciation , which was very gradual for a few years , rose suddenly , in 1810 , to 13 per cent. , and attained its maximum in 1814 , when it was 23 per cent . Mr. Pitt , who at first regarded the suspension with great anxiety , came afterwards , it is said , to be as much delighted with it as if he had found a mountain of gold . And well he might be delighted . It was this depreciation of the currency which carried Ensland triumphantly through the war , - which enhanced rents and profits , gave unprecedented activity to mannfactures and commerce , kept the laboring population employed , and therefore quiet , enabled the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people bear , with ease and cheerfulness , an amount of taxation which they can now hardly contemplate without shuddering . " It is undeniable , " says a very well-informed writer , " that during the greater part of that period ( from 1793 to 1814 ) the trade of the country was in a state of unexampled prosperity . In no twenty-two years of our history , of which we have authentic accounts , has there ever been so rapid an increase of production and consumption , as in the twenty-two years ending with 1814 . " It is not going too far to say , that , without the high prices of those years , Wellington could not have driven the French out of Spain , or triumphed at Waterloo . The dark hour came , when , after the close of the war , it was thought necessary to take measures to contract the currency , restore the former value of money , and submit to the consequent fall of prices . " In whatever degree // minor circumstances may have cooperated , the great and mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the transition that took place at the termination of the war , - the transition from an immense , unremitting , protracted , effectual demand for almost every article of consumption to a comparative cessation of that demand . " " There was , " adds Mr. Tooke , " from 1814 to 1816 ( a period of rapid contraction of the currency ) a very general depression in the prices of nearly all productions , and in the value of all fixed property , entailing a convergence of losses and failu es among the agricultural , and commercial , and manufacturing , and mining , and shipping , and building interests , which marked that period as one of most extensive suffering and distress . " By a very natural association of ideas , the years marked first by a great decline , and then by a rapid restoration , of the value of money , come to be remembered only as one period , or complete cycle , of great prosperity followed by still greater depression and distress ; and men naturally shrink from so cruel an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the depreciation of the currency , and if this depreciation could continue , or become permanent , no reaction , no distress , would succeed . It was such a permanent decline in the value of money which caused the marvellous development of the wealth and material prosperity of England , that took place during the reign of Elizabeth ; and it is to a decline equally permanent , and perhaps equally great , that we have now to look forward . 8nrely , there is nothing in such a prospect to create agitation and alarm . We know not what political troubles may grow out of this grand monetary revolution , or that it will have any political effect whatever ; but industry , commerce , and the arts have nothing to fear from it , but every thing to hope . Coming down again to particulars , it is an obvious remark that the decline in the value of money must be indicated by a variation in the relative values of gold and silver , as the increase in the annual supply is almost exclusively of the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time , to determine the // amount of the depreciation which has taken place , and by such enactments as the New Gold Bill , passed in 1834 , and the bill which is now pending before Congress , to adjust the state of the currency to the new values of the precious metals . One reason why such a variation has not already become more manifest , maybe found in the change which is now going on in the currency of France . The circulation in that con ntry was almost exclusively metallic , as the only bank bills were of a very high denomination ; and , till recently , it has consisted for the most part of silver , gold bearing an ag'io of about seven in a thousand , and therefore not coming into general use . But the influx of gold from Russia and California has now reversed this state of things . The French mint has coined a very large amount of gold during the last two years , which has entered rapidly into circulation , displacing an equivalent amount of silver coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is estimated , by well-informed French and English writers , that the silver thus set free in France alone amounts to thirty million* of dollars . To this must be added a very considerable supply from this country , obtained in a similar way , - as we know from painful experience , our American silver coins , of full weight , having generally disappeared , their place , for purposes of change , being supplied by the worn and clipped Spanish pieces . If the specie reserves of our banks could be examined , which , only four years ago , contained a large proportion of silver , they would probably be found to be composed , in a great measure , of gold . If the United States have set free , in this manner , only fifteen millions in silver , which is a very safe estimate , we have an aggregate , from these two countries , of fortyfive millions added to the general stock of silver , which is enough to prevent it as yet from rising materially in value in its relation to gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver , then , will indicate , in part , the decline in the value of money ; but , if a change be not made in the mint regulations of France and the United States , ( and , at a later day , of Great Britain , ) it will not indicate the whole of such decline . For , as gold continues to depreciate , all the silver will otherwise be driven out of the currency ; and // the quantity of silver , thus set free , will depreciate its value also , though not in the same ratio as that of gold . But a change must be made in the mint regulations , since we can not do without silver for purposes of change . The question then arises , - and it is a very important one , - how the alteration in the coinage shall he made ? Shall it be by adding to the quantity of gold , or by diminishing the quantity of silver , which now passes for a dollar ? If the former course be adopted , the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depreciation in the value of gold being obviated by the increased quantity of it which passes under the old denomination . If the latter course be preferred , money will fall in value as rapidly as the worth of gold is depreciated . In either case , frequent changes of the mint regulations will be necessary . If , for instance , gold is now worth three per cent . less , when compared with silver , than it was four or five years ago , the quantity of gold contained in an eagle must be increased three per cent. , or the quantity of silver contained in a dollar must be diminished three per cent . In either case , the relative value of the two precious metals still tending to change , the operation in a year or two must be repeated . The matter might be simplified , it is true , by giving up the double standard , and using in future but one metal for coinage . Thus , we might coin gold only , and at the present rate , putting 232.2 grains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dollar , and allow silver to be bought and sold only as bullion , or at whatever rate it might command in the market per ounce , Troy weight . Or , gold coins might he dispensed with , and only silver allowed to circulate as currency , and at its present rate , of 371.2*3 grains to a dollar . In this case , as so much more silver would be needed if all money was to be composed of it , its absolute value would probably be enhanced ; it would be worth more , not only in relation to gold , but in relation to all other commodities . The question which we are now considering is not one of mere convenience or expediency ; we must also see what abstract justice requires in all dealings between debtors and creditors . Those who are in favor of increasing the quantity of gold , rather than of lessening // the quantity of silver , which now passes for a dollar , may argue very plausibly , that a debt ought to be cancelled only by the payment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracted . If I have borrowed one thousand silver dollars , or something which could readily be exchanged for one thousand silver dollars , I ought not to be allowed to cancel the debt by paying one thousand gold dollars , after gold has fallen to one half of the value which it had when I obtained the loan . This argument is plausible , but it is insufficient . All mercantile contracts must be construed literally , or must have a specific performance . The law never undertakes to guard either party against the evil consequences to himself of a change of values which he has not foreseen . Such changes are very frequent in mercantile transactions , and the maxim , caveat emptor , applies to them all . If I pay one thousand dollars now , for two hundred barrels of flour to be delivered three months hence. , and if the price of flour falls meanwhile to four dollars a harrel , I must not expect that one fifth of the purchase-money will be paid back to me ; and if the price , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not require . mc to make up the difference . Each party must bear th' coup sequences of his bargain , and of his own want of fore* sight . In like manner , if a landholder leases an estate for twenty years , at an anuttal rent of five hundred dollars , he can not rightfully demand compensation* nor can the lessee ask an abatement , if , in the course of *those twenty years , the value of the dollars should btt altered by circumstances over which neither party had any control . According to the state of the law at the time when the lease was made , the annual payment was to be either five hundred times 23.22 grain , s of pure gold , or five hundred times 371.25 grains of pure silver . It was * part of the contract , that the lessee should have the optk*u of paying his rent in either of these forms , the two metals in these proportions being both legal tend r* It is the misfortune of the lessor , but certainly not the fault of the lessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23.22 grain of pure gold will no longer purchase so many commodities as before . The latter can not , therefore , he obliged to pay silver ; for he bargained to pay gold , if he saw fit . If , in VOL . LXXV. - NO. 157. 35 // deed , the government should arbitrarily " raise the standard , " as it is termed , or decree that the dollar should in future contain only 200 grains of pure silver , instead of 371.25 grains , equity , if not law , would require the lessee to pay his rent in coins of the old standard , or their equivalent ; for the spirit , if not the letter , of his covenant is , not to pay what may be called a dollar at any future time , but what was really accounted to be a dollar at the time when the bargain was made . It is but another application of the same rule of equity , to say , that he shall not be held to pay 40 grains of pure gold for a dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apart , then , from all considerations of expediency , it would be an obvious violation of justice , to seek , by any change in the regulations of the mint , to prevent the present and expected depreciation in the value of gold from affecting the value of money , whether silver or gold , in all countries where a double standard exists . Mr. Brooks , of New York , has made an elaborate speech and report in Congress against the new Coinage and Seigniorage Bill , which , so far as it relates to this subject , is wholly sophistical and unsound . The bill had been prepared in conformity with an able report from the iDirector of the Mint , and a strong recommendation from the Secretary of the Treasury ; and after a very able speech in its favor from Mr. Hunter , of Virginia , it had passed the Senate by a unanimous vote . It provides , that the silver half-dollar , instead of 206k 0-rains of standard silver , one tenth being alloy , which is its present weight , shall contain but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dollar , dime , and half-dime being reduced in the same proportion . In other words , the silver dollar is to contain , in future , only 345.6 grains of pure silver , instead of 371.25 grains , as at present , the reduction being about 7 per cent . As silver is undervalued in our own present coinage only about two per cent. , this reduction of the quantity of it contained in a dollar overvalues it for the present about five per cent . To prevent the new silver coin from driving the gold coin out of the market , therefore , the bill further provides that the new coin shall be legal tender only to the amount of five dollars , and prohibits silver from being deposited at the mint for coinage , except by the Treasurer of the Mint , or under authority of the United States . // The object of the bill , therefore , is to introduce into this country the system of coinage which has been tried in England for over thirty years , and has been found to answer excellently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it has obviated the difficulty that would otherwise have arisen from the varying ratio of gold to silver . The English system is explained by MeCulloch as follows . " From 1666 down to 1817 , no seigniorage was charged on the silver coin ; but a new system was then adopted . Silver having been underrated in relation to gold in the mint proportion of the two metals fixed in 1718 , heavy silver coins were withdrawn from circulation , and gold only being used in all the larger payments , it became , in effect , what silver had formerly been , the standard of the currency . The act of 56th George III. , regulating the present silver coinage , was framed , not to interfere with this arrangement , but so as to render silver entirely subsidiary to gold . For this purpose , it is made legal tender only to the extent of 40s. ; and 66s. , instead of 62s. , are coined out of a pound Troy , the 4s. being retained as a seigniorage , which , therefore , amounts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vested exclusively in the hands of government ; who have it , therefore , in their power to avoid throwing too much of it into circulation , and , consequently , to prevent its fusion , until the market price of silver shall have risen to above Ss. 6d. an ounce . " " Under these regulations , " adds MeCulloch , in another place , " silver has ceased to be a standard of value , and forms merely a subordinate or subsidiary species of currency , or change , occupying the same place in relation to gold that copper occupies in relation to itself . This system has been found to answer exceedingly well . " Our copper coins , like those of England , are rated about 75 per cent . above their real value ; but as the government alone determines how many of them shall be issued , and as they are legal tender to the extent only of the smallest silver coin , this over-valuation is not productive of any bad effect . As no more of them are issued than are needed , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not be exported or melted up without great loss , and the coinage of them affords a considerable profit to the government . About $1,300,000 worth of them have been issued in this country , nearly three fourths of which sum is clear profit . // Should the new Coinage Bill pass , the profit on the manufacture of silver coin , though much smaller in rate , will be greater in amount . For a while , it will probably defray the greater part of the expense of our whole coinage . We shall have an abundance of perfect American coin , for the purposes of change , instead of the miserably worn and defaced Spanish pieces which are now current . The over-valuation of the new silver coin , which will be for the present only about S per cent. , will prevent it from being exported or melted up , while it will not be large enough to afford any temptation to the counterfeiter . It will also prevent , for at least two or three years to come , the currency from being disturbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will also supply an accurate measure of that depreciation , so far as the relative value of gold and silver is affected by it ; for as soon as the new silver coin begins to disappear , it will be a proof that gold has fallen at least S per cent . below its present relative value . The depreciation of silver will not be excessive , as the relative value of silver to gold in the English coinage has been , for over thirty years , as 1 to 14.288 ; while in this country , it will be 1 to 14.884 . The relation in our present coinage is as 1 to 15.988 ; in France , it is as 1 to 15.499 . Their true relation , or present bullion value , as nearly as can be ascertained , is as 1 to about 15.675 . The reasons for the alteration to be effected by the new Coinage Bill are very well set forth in a communication to the present Congress from the Secretary of the Trea* sury . " The relative value of our gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I to 15.988 ; and the bullion value of our silver coin in England is 15.716-being a difference of 272 thousandths , or nearly two per cent . It follows , then , as a matter of course , that on all occasions where the course of our foreign trade requires heavy shipments abroad , our silver coin will be first sought after for that purpose , even at a premium , and consequently will disappear from circulation , as it has already done to a very great extent . " There seems to be but one immediate and direct remedy for this evil ; and that is the one which has already been adopted in Great Britain , of changing the relative value between gold and silver coin , by reducing the intrinsic value of the latter . The // opinion of the officers of the mint ( in which judicious persons , whose opinions are entitled to great weight , concur ) is , that this change could be advantageously made , by making our dollar weigh three hundred and eighty-four grains , and the smaller coins in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worth by tale exactly $1 , OOO . The director of the mint , in a communication on the subject , says : If such a scale of weights were adopted , the relation of silver in such pieces to gold would be as 14.884 to 1 ; and if the present true relation or bullion value is about 15.675 to 1 , the new proposed silver coin would be over-valued by law about five per cent. ; a very small advance , and far less than in British silver , or in the worn Spanish coin , which now monopolizes our circulation . ' " In the adjustment of this subject , it will be necessary to consider the depreciation in the value of gold which may have taken place already , or shall hereafter occur , in consequence of the immense additional supplies which have been , and will , no doubt , continue to be , thrown into circulation from California , Australia , and other countries . This consideration might justify a much greater present over-valuation of silver coin , as the future depreciatioa of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance . " If this plan is adopted by Congress , it of course will involve the necessity of making silver coin a legal tender only for debts of small amount - say not exceeding ten dollars , which is about the same limit ( forty shillings ) which has been established in Great Britain . " We fear the bill will hardly pass at the present session of Congress , for so many speeches to Buncombe have been made in the lower House , and the Presidential election has been so much canvassed , that no time remains except for the transaction of ordinary and indispensable business . It passed the Senate , as we have said , by a unanimous vote ; and no opposition has been made to it , we believe , among the Representatives , except by Mr. Brooks . The arguments which he urged against it were such that it is difficult to consider them with gravity . They are directed chiefly against one provision in the Bill which we have not yet noticed ; - a clause inserted at the recommendation of the Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in future on the coinage of gold , not to exceed the actual expense of the coiaage , and not to amount , in any case , to more than one per cent . It was estimated that half of one per cent . would suffice for this purpose for the present . Since the // discovery of the California gold washings , the expenses of the principal mint and its branches have been , of course , much increased ; and still greater cost will be incurred , if , as is now proposed , two other branch mints are established , one at New York , and the other at San Francisco . The annual expense of coinage is now about three quarters of a million of dollars ; the two new branches will raise it to more than a million . A large fund is also kept at the Philadelphia mint , in order to pay depositors at once for the bullion which they may leave there to be coined , instead of obliging them to wait till their own gold is minted . If this fund were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would save nearly $400,000 now annually paid in interest . Adding this annual charge to the whole cost of coinage , we have an aggregate of nearly a million and a half , as a gratuity annually made by the nation to the depositors of gold . Of course , so large a bounty attracts to this country a much larger portion of the annual product of the washings than would otherwise come hither . But it does not stay here after it is coined , and it is not desirable that it should stay . The precious metals , in the shape of coin , distribute themselves among the nations of the earth , in exact proportion to the wants of each , just as naturally and inevitably as water finds its level in a pond . If any country has more than its due proportion of them , the prices of commodities are necessarily inflated , the quantity of goods imported is consequently increased , and the gold and silver are then sent abroad to pay for these imports . It would be as unreasonable to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been coined in our mints during the last two years and a half , should remain in the United States , as it would be in the Californians to wish that the whole product of their washings should be kept within the limits of their own State , for their exclusive use and benefit . Wherever they are unduly accumulated , they undergo a proportionate depreciation , or in other words , cause the prices of other commodities to rise ; and they are sent abroad to escape such depreciation . Every steamer that sails for Europe carries off a portion of them ; and it is certain that one half , probably two thirds , of what has been gratuitously coined in our mints , has already left us , and gone where it has already // received , or will soon receive , another stamp . A good portion of it is safely lodged in the vaults of the Bank of England . The expense of shaping it into United States coin has been literally thrown away . The Director of the Mint and the Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seigniorage , sufficient only to defray the actual cost of coinage , should be imposed , so that no more should be coined than the country really needed . Mr. Brooks vehemently opposes this measure , on the ground that it would cause a larger portion of the gold to be shipped directly from California to Europe . Very well ; what if it does ? What possible advantage can there be , in bringing hither more gold than we want , transporting it first from San Francisco to New York , thence to Philadelphia , coining it there gratuitously at a heavy expense , carrying it back to New York , and then shipping it off immediately to London or Paris , where it will be melted up as soon as possible , and converted into English or French coins ? Why should it not be shipped immediately to the place where it is needed , thus saving the entire expense of coinage , the cost of much unnecessary transportation , and the interest on the whole amount for at least two months ' needless delay ? Mr. Brooks surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either as bullion directly from San Francisco , or as coin by way of New York , without rendering a full equivalent for it in other commodities ; or that the United States suffer any loss by allowing the miner to exchange his gold for other goods . Gold is only an article of merchandise , like copper , tin , and iron ; and , like them , it must be sent to the market where it is most wanted , and where , consequently , it can be sold to the greatest advantage . Would it be good policy , in order to increase the stock of copper in this country , to enact that the pig metal should be manufactured into sheets , plates , and rods at the expense of government , without charge to the owner , who should also receive a free gift of the interest on the whole value of the copper during the time required for its manufacture ? Such a law would doubtless bring all the Chilian copper hither , to be put into a form fit for use , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any charge for the transformation it had undergone . // Mr. Brooks unwisely betrays , in his speech , the true grounds of opposition to the charge of a seigniorage . He says , " I have , in my hands , remonstrances from the largest express companies , " who do a large and profitable business in transporting gold from San Francisco to New York ; and he adds , that he opposes the law , " because the mischievous act would reach our commerce , our freighting trade at the Isthmus of Panama , our insurance offices , our bullion dealers at home , and send the gold and silver in one continuous , overwhelming stream to the British mint . " To support this allegation , which is perfectly well founded , he introduces an estimate , furnished by the " express companies " themselves , of the comparative expense of transporting $100,000 in bullion from San Francisco to New York , and from the same place to London , showing a difference of about $600 in favor of the latter route ; though , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than in the other . The freight to New York is 2* , while to London it is only 2* , per cent. ; the insurance to the former place is 2 , while to the latter place it is only 1* , per cent . Really , the carriers of bullion to New York are very modest ; they ask the government of the United States to incur an annual charge of nearly a million and a half of dollars , in order that they may receive 4* per cent . for a service less expensive and hazardous than that for which their brethren in London charge only 3* per cent . We would suggest a compromise . Let Congress pay " the largest express companies " an annual gratuity of lths of a per cent. , ( the difference of the two rates , ) on the whole amount of gold now brought to New York which would otherwise be sent to London* and thus earn a right to charge a seigniorage . The amount can not be more than fifty millions a year , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would thus save nearly a million of dollars a year . Fearing that his pecuniary calculations might fail to convince , the speaker enforces them with some very fervid appeals to the patriotism of his hearers , - to their pride of country , and love of free institutions . He informs them , that the word " seigniorage " is " almost unknown in our country , " - that " it is not even of English birth , but comes to us from the French , and is a relic of the // reign of feudality , " - that it was " imposed by the old feudal barons as sovereigns in Europe , called seigneurs , " - that " this relic of feudality exploded , however , long ago , " and is now " best known among barbarians ; " and , to sum up all , that " seigniorage is fit only for the dominions of the Grand Seignior . " We wonder he did not also remind them , that it is akin to the " royalty " which monarchs were wont to levy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly be deemed to be of kingly origin , and even to have a suspicious savor of Popery . Mr. Brooks is patriotically indignant , that " the golden product of our California miners** should go forth to the world " under the impress of British sovereignty , " the glorious stamp of the American eagle being effaced , and the paw of the British lion put in its place . He " hopes to see the day when the rich argosy of silver , now freighted to England under the British flag , will be freighted to New York , under the stars and stripes , increased in quantity ten times over . " The force of these patriotic hopes is a little impaired , it is true , by the unlucky allusion to the profits of " the largest express companies . " But no matter ; the reasoning is none the less patriotic , and thoroughly American . The orator ends his speech with this brilliant peroration . " Above all , for the sake of national honor or of national pride , I beg you to guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the British lion , and to feel , at least , as the Englishman feels , when he puts the British emblem upon your gold production , at no cost to the depositor , that he is paid , richly paid , for the slight tax on himself , by the universal circulation and dominion he thus gives that British emblem the wide world over , wherever British gold goes , or Briton travels ; for the day is coming when the American eagle - I mean no eagle emblazoned on any warlike standard - will thus ' traverse the world with this British sovereign , and , if I mistake not , in triumph over him , if you throw no obstructions in the path of his victory . " The speaker must have great faith in the credulity of the House of Representatives in Congress assembled , if he supposes that their action can be guided by this patriotic nonsense . The confident assumption that the propriety of levying a seigniorage is now an exploded fallacy , even among // the governments of the Old World , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of the last century , the charge on gold was fixed at 1* per cent. , and on silver , at 1* per cent. ; at present , it is only * per cent . on gold , and I* per cent . on silver , being hardly enough to defray the actual expense of coinage . In England , the seigniorage on gold , it is true , is only nominal , being ild. on the ounce , the Bank being required to pay ? 3 17s. 9d. for bullion which is coined into ? 3 17s. lOld. ; but on silver , as we have seen , the charge amounts to 6* per cent. , a pound Troy being coined into f36s. , of which only 62s. are returned to the depositor , the other 4s. being retained by the government . Mr. Brooks , indeed , denies that this deduction constitutes a seigniorage ; to which the sufficient answer is , that it is always so called by British writers ; that the goverrunent returns to the depositor only a portion of coin which it manufactures out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense and trouble of the process , and that this is the only descriptioii which can be given of a seigniorage ; and that the only additional circumstance in this case , - namely , the fact that the government will not coin all the silver that is offered , even at this price , - is of no importance , inasmuch as the seigniorage is levied on the whole amount which the mint sees fit to accept . This " exploded fallacy ' * of levying a seigniorage is also defended strenuously by the writers of highest reputation in the science of political economy , - by Adam Smith , MeCulloch , and John Stuart Mill , the last-named being a well-known radical reformer , who is not likely to be accused of favoring any " relic of feudality . " We can afford room only for a portion of MeCulloch 's argument in defence of the practice . " The reasoning of Dr. Smith , in favor of a moderate seigniorage , is quite unanswerable . No good reason has yet been given why those who want coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coinage , by savin* , the trouble and expense attending the weighing and assaying of bullion , indisputably adds to the value of the precious metals . It renders them fitter to perform the functions of a circulating medium . A sovereign is of greater value than a piece of pure unfashioned gold bullion of the same weight ; and for this plain reason , that while it is equally // well adapted with the bullion for being used in the arts , it is better adapted for being used as money or in the exchange of commodities . Why , then , should government be prevented from charging a seigniorage , or duty on coins , equal to the expenses of the coinage , or , which is the same thing , to the value which it adds to the bullion ? Those who contend that the state ought to defray the expense of the coinage , might , with equal cogency of reasoning , contend that it ought to defray the expense of manufacturing gold and silver teapots , vases , &amp;c . In both cases , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased by the cost of workmanship . And it is only fair and reasonable , that those who carry bullion to the mints , as well as those who carry it to the jewellers , should have to pay the expenses necessarily attending its conversion into coin . " The fact that government has a monopoly of the coinage , is a point of no importance . It also has a monopoly of the post-office ; but it does not follow that it should carry letters for nothing . The proper charge , in both cases , is the actual expense incurred by rendering the service to the holders of bullion or to the writers of letters . The objections of Mr. Brooks to the other and more important provisions of the New Coinage and Seigniorage Bill are hardly worth considering , except to show how very crude and imperfect notions exist in the community upon the subject of the currency , and how little the general theory of money , the various portions of which are now as easily demonstrated as any propositions in Euclid , is understood . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed measure will be to depreciate the currency , or , in the old phrase , to " raise the standard ; " and he very properly argues against any such proceeding , as virtually dishonest . He apparently forgets that , in this case , the depreciation of the gold coins has already taken place , not by any act of the government , but by natural causes , - namely , the increased supply of bullion from Russia , California , and Australia ; and the only question is , how we are to adapt our mixed currency , the balance of which has thus been destroyed , to this new state of things . Because the new bill makes no provision for the manufacture in future of any larger silver coin than the half-dollar , and because the two new halves , containing together but 345.6 grains of pure silver , can not // circulate in company with the old dollar , which contains 371.25 grains , he complains that it will have the practical effect of " abolishing for currency the dollar , the money unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States now stands and has stood . " He forgets that very few silver dollars have ever been coined , and that , practically , they never appear in the circulation . For over thirty years , or from 1805 to 1836 , the mint did not issue one of them . But the functions of the silver dollar , as the money unit , do not depend upon its actual presence in the currency , or upon the quantity of pure silver which it contains . They would be discharged equally well , if it were an ideal unit , or if it contained either 200 or 400 grains . He quotes the opinions of several writers , who " have contended that silver is the money of account all over the world , and the fittest to be the standard of value ; " but he does not mention that the latest of these opinions is over twenty years old , and was predicated upon a very different state of things from that which now exists , and which , if these writers could have foreseen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no reason to believe that the two precious metals were not equally stable in value , the greater abundance of silver caused nearly all writers , who preferred a single standard , to favor its adoption , as the exclusive measure of value . They adopted it solely for reasons of convenience , the higher value of gold forbidding its use for the purposes of small change . Now , the vastly increased supply of gold having brought up all the questions connected with a decline in the value of money , the subject appears in a totally different light , and former opinions respecting it are to be reconsidered . Mr Brooks argues , that the " degraded or debased** silver coin , which would be issued under the new bill , would drive the present half-dollars and quarters out of circulation . Of course , it would , if any of them yet remain to be driven out . But the point is , that the present and increasing depreciation of gold from natural causes , and the consequent over-appreciation of silver , have already driven out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substituted for them the worn and defaced Spanish pieces , which have lost at least 10 per cent . of their nominal // value . Since the establishment of our government , the mint has sent forth over 77 millions of dollars in American silver coin , of which it is probable that not 10 millions now remain in the country . As Mr. Brooks admits that our silver coin has already risen to a premium of 1* per cent. , ( more probably to 2 per cent. , ) the residue must disappear within a few months , if the new bill does not previously become a law ; for a profit of 1* per cent . is quite enough to ternpt the bullion dealers to gather it up very eagerly , and send it abroad . On every million of dollars now sent to Europe , - and we send millions every month , - they might gain $12,500 , if they could collect the million in United States silver coin . The question is not , then , whether we shall fall from a silver coinage containing 871.25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is nearly 7 per cent . inferior to it in value , but whether we shall rise from a worn Spanish currency , which has lost from 10 to 15 per cent . of its value , to one that is degraded only about 5 per cent . We repeat it , the new bill does not , though Mr. Brooks constantly implies that it does , degrade , debase , or depreciate any kind of money . It only recognizes a depreciation that has already taken place , from natural causes , over which human legislation has no control ; and it adopts incasnres to prevent this depreciation from proceeding with irregular or undue rapidity or from throwing our currency into unnecessary confusion . For proof that the new system is no hazardous experiment , we have the fact that Great Britain adopted it over thirty years ago , during which time , according to MeCulloch , it " has been found to answer extremely well , " has occasioned no complaint from the people , and has been a complete preservative against the very evil of a debased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real purpose in opposing the new bill is to show , " that , if we make any change , it ought to be in the gold coinage , by increasing the weight of the eagle , " and allowing the silver dollar , with its present weight of pure metal , to remain undisturbed as the unit of value . This is the very course which we have demonstrated to be highly inexpedient and altogether unjust . It is an aP tempt , by making silver , instead of gold , the future inca // sure of value , to prevent the great decline in the value of money , which every one sees to be impending , and to which both Great Britain and France are quietly submitting , not only without resistance , but with apparent gratification . Mr. Brooks has nothing to urge in favor of the attempt except the following extraordinary statement . " To make gold the sole measure of value would be to revolutionize investments or obligations of debt , by enabling the debtor to pay in gold perhaps worth only as one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one to sixteen . " The misstatement here is very obvious . The debtor has not contracted to pay gold which shall be worth sixteen times as much as silver ; no such obli *ation is expressed , noiie is implied , in his contract . He has simply bound himself to pay as many times 23.22 grains of pure gold as he owes dollars , be the worth of that gold more or less . The law under which lie made his contract , and which still exists , declares that the coin containing 23.22 grains of pure gold shall be legal tender for a dollar . Accordingly , to increase the quantity of gold in a dollar , - to declare , for instance , that it should in future contain 30 grains , unless the declaration were accompanied with a proviso that all debts previously contracted might be discharged by payment of the old coin or its equivalent , would be to violate that clause in the Constitution which forbids the passage of any law impairing the obligation of contracts . A debtor no more insures the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the graindealer insures the future price of a cargo of flour , which he sells before it has yet come into port . The contingency of a rise or fall in the value of the article is what the buyer knowingly takes upon himself . As to the general expediency of the attempt which Mr. Brooks here advocates , we need not repeat the considerations already offered . But there are some particular reasons , why a declinc in the value of money , such as is now in prospect , should not be regarded with apprehension in this country , but rather as a great addition to the future sources of our national well-being . As has been mentioned , those countries which have a large national debt are most likely to be benefited by the change . // The burden of taxation will be essentially diminished , while the loss sustained by the fundholders will fall on shoulders that are most capable of bearing it , and will also be distributed among many , and over a long period of years , the freqnent changes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their real depreciation almost imperceptible . For this reason , the coming revolution in the monetary world seems to be contemplated without terror in Great Britain ; at any rate , no one hints at the expediency of giving up the present exclusive gold standard , which exposes the currency to the full shock of the alteration . Mr. Brooks would find few advocates there of his plan , of making silver the standard , and gradually increasing the quantity of pure metal in the gold coins . Our national debt , it is true , is but small , and what little there is , will quickly be extinguished . But the debts of the individual States are large , amounting in the aggregate to over two hundred millions of dollars , a large portion of which is owned in Europe . There are also stocks to a very large amount , issued by cities , railroads , and other corporations , in which English capitalists have made large investments ; while there are no foreign stocks owned in this country . The rate of interest being higher here than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in so large quantities , that our annual remittances for interest already constitute no small portion of our exports . We do not call these remittances " a drain upon the resources of the country , " as they are often denominated by the unthinking ; for the transactions on which they are founded have swelled those resources far beyond the limit which would otherwise have bounded them . Still , it is satisfactory to remember , that , as the coming monetary revolution will operate exclusively to the benefit of the indebted party , our own land will derive more benefit from it , in proportion to our means , than any other country on earth . For this reason , if for no other , Congress ought not to be the first legislative body in the world to make an attempt to resist or evade the great change which Providence *s gradually bringing about , through the agency of natural causes . Since the earlier portion of this article was written , // Congress has adjourned , as we feared , before the House of Representatives had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coinage . It therefore necessarily lies over to the next session . Meanwhile , our silver currency is deteriorating every day , arid will soon be reduced to a condition that will call loudly for remedy . No more effectual measure for this end can be contrived , we believe , than that which was prepared , after careful deliberation , and with a full knowledge of the subject , by the advice of the Director of the Mint and the Secretary of the Treasury , and which has already received the unanimous approbation of the Senate .
