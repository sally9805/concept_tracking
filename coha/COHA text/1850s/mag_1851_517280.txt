txt THE LOST LETTER I. j**NE night , between twenty and thirty years a o , a party were assembled in the drawing-rooms of a house situated in one of the most spacious squares of the great metropolis . The brightly lighted lamps lent an additional lustre to yet brighter eyes , and the sprightly tones of various instruments accompanied the graceful evolutions of the dancers , as they threaded the mazes of the country-dance , cotillon , or quadrille ; for waltz , polka , and schottish , were then unknown in our ball-rooms. here and there sat a couple in a quiet corner , evidently enjoying the pleasures of a flirtation , while one pair , more romantic or more serious than the others , had strayed out upon the balcony , to indulge more unrestrainedly in the conversation , which , to judge by their low and esrnest tones , and abstracted air , seemed deeply interesting to both . It was now long past the hour of night 's black : rch , the keystone , ' and the early dawn of a midsummer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smokebegrimed streets and world-worn thoroughfares of mighty London , as well as on the dewy hay-fields , shady lanes , green hedgerows , and quiet country homes of rural England . The morning star , large , mild , and lustrous , was declining in the clear sky ; and on the left of the lovely planet lay a soft purple cloud , tinged on the edge with the lucid amber of the dawning day . A light breeze just stirred the leaves of the trees in the square garden , and fanned the warm cheeks of the two spectators , as , suddenly silent , they stood feasting their eyes and hearts on the surpassingly beautiful scene before them , and marvelling at the remarkable purity of the atmosphere , which , in the foggy metropolis of Britain , seemed almost to realize the Venetian transparency of the pictures of Canaletti . Perhaps it may be as well to take advantage of the pause to describe the two lovers , for that they were lovers you have of course already guessed . A handsomer pair , I am sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-proportioned figure of the gentleman bespoke at once activity and ease , while the spirited , intelligent expression of his **28;489;TOOLONG as that of an Andalusian-would have given interest to far plainer features . The glance of his dark eye , as it rested fondly on his fair companion , or was turned abroad on the world , told alternately of a loving heart and a proud spirit . Philip Hayforth was one who would have scorned to commit an ignoble action , or to stain his soul with the shadow of a falsehood for all the treasures and the blessings the earth has to bestow ; but he was quick to resent an injury , and slow to forget it , and not for all the world would he have been the first to sue for a reconciliation . Like many other proud people , however , he was open-hearted and generous , and ready to forgive when forgiveness was asked ; the reason of which might be , that a petition for pardon is , to the spirit of a proud man , a sort of homage far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishes at once his own superiority . But to his Emily , Philip was all consideration and tenderness , and she , poor girl , with the simple faith of youth and love , believed him to be perfection , and admired even his pride . A very lovely girl was Emily Sherwood-gifted with a beauty of a r:ue and intellectual cast . As she now stood leaning on the arm of her companion , her tall yet pliant and graceful figure enveloped in the airy drapery of her white dress , with her eyes turned in mute admiration towards the dawning day , it would have required but a slight stretch of the imagination to have beheld in her a priestess of the sun , awaiting in reverent adoration the appearance of her fire-god . Her complexion and features , too , would have helped to strengthen the fantasy , for the one was singularly fair , pale , and transparent , and the other characterized by delicacy , refinement , and a sort of earnest yet still enthusiasm . Her hair , of the softest and palest brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finely-shaped head , and crowned with a wreath of starry jessamine . ' From the absence of color , one might have imagined that her beauty would have been cold and statuelike ; but you had only to glance at her soft , intellectual mouth , or to look into her large , clear , hazel eyes , which seemed to have borrowed their sweet , thoughtful , chastened radiance from the star whose beams were now fast paling in the brightening sky , to learn that Emily Sherwood could both think and love . " Dear Philip , " she said at last , in that low tone which is the natural expression of all the finer and deeper emotions , " is it not beautiful ? I feel at this moment as if I were almost oppressed with happiness-as if this were but an intense dream of love and beauty , that must , as sentimental people say , be too bright to last . ' I never felt as I do now in all my life before . " " Nor I neither , my Emily , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we love , for love intensifies all the feelings. ** " All the best feelings . " " The whole nature , I think . It is , for instance , more difficult to bear a slight from those we love than from a comparatively indifferent person . " " A slight ! but there can be no such thing as a slight between those who love perfectlyas we do . Are we not all in all to each other ? Is not our happiness indivisible ? " " It is my pride and joy to believe so , my sweet Emily . I know in my own heart that the needle is not more true to the magnet than my thoughts and feelings are to you . It shall be the chief care of my life to save you from all uneasiness ; but , Emily , I expect the same devotion I give : unkindness from you , of all the world , I could not and would not endure . " " Oh , Philip , Philip ! " she said , half tenderly , half reproachfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt you , dear Philip , for I judge your love by my own. ** He looked into the truthful and affectionate eyes which were raised #o trustingly to his face , and replied , in a voice tremulous with emotion , " Forgive me , Emily . I trust you entirely ; but I had started an idea , the barest contemplation of which was insupportablemaddening , because of the very excess of my affection . In short , Emily , I know-that is , I suspect-your father looked for a higher match for you than I am . Report says that his prejudices are strong in favor of birth , and that he is very proud of his ancient blood ; and the idea did cross me for a moment , that when you were with him he might influence you to despise me . " " My father is proud ; but , dear Philip , is nobody proud but he ? And notwithstanding his prejudices , as you call them , I can assure you , you are not more honorable yourself in every act and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore you need not fear him , even if you can not trust me alone . " " Oh , Em*y , pardon me ! And so you think me proud . Well , perhaps I am ; and it is better that you should know it , as you will bear with it , I know , for my sake , my best , my truest Emily ; and I shall repay your goodness with the most fervent gratitude . Yes , I feel with you that no cloud can ever come between us two . " Emily Sherwood was the eldest daughter o Colonel Sherwood , a cadet of one of the proudest families in England ; and which , though it had never been adorned with a title , looked down with something like contempt on the abundant growth of mushroom nobility which had sprung up around it , long after it had al . ready obtained the dignity which , in the opinion of the Sherwoods , generations alone could bestow . Colonel Sherwood inherited all the pride of his race-nay , in him it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in minds of the highest class-that rare class who estimate justly the true value of human life , and the true nature of human dignity-is generally allied either with pride or meanness . Of course when I speak of poverty I mean comparative poverty-I allude to those who are poorer than their station . In a retired part of one of the eastern counties , Colonel Sherwood struggled upon his half-pay to support a wife and seven children , and as far as possible to keep up the appearance he considered due to his birth and rank in society . Emily had been for two seasons the belle of the country balls ; and the admiration her beauty and manners had everywhere excited , had created in the hearts of her parents a hope that she was destined to form an alliance calculated to shed a lustre on the fading glory of the Sherwoods . But , alas ! as Burns sings " The best laid schemes of mice and men Gang aft ajee . " During a visit to some relatives in London , Emily became acquainted with Philip Hayforth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation and devotion to herself , had quickly made an impression upon feelings which , though susceptible , were fastidious , and therefore still untouched . Then , too , the romantic ardor with which his attachment was expressed , the enthusiasm he manifested for whatever was great , good , or beautiful , aroused in Emily all the latent poetry of her nature . Naturally imaginative , and full even of passionate tenderness , but diffident and sensitive , she had hitherto , from an instinctive consciousness that they would be misunderstood or disapproved , studiously concealed her deeper feelings . Hence had been generated in her character a degree of thoughtfulness and reserve unusual in one of her years . Now , however , that she beheld the ideas and aspirations she had so long deemed singular , perhaps reprehensible , shadowed forth more powerfully and definitely by a mind more mature and a spirit more daring // than her own , her heart responded to its more vigorous counterpart ; and at the magic touch of sympathy , the long pent-up waters flowed freely . She loved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not , it may be supposed , without some reluctance that Colonel Sherwood consented to the demolition of the aerial castles of which his beautiful Emily had so long been the subject and the tenant , and made up his mind to see her the wife of a man who , though of respectable parentage , could boast neither title nor pedigree , and was only the junior partner in a mercantile firm . But then young Hayforth bore the most honorable character ; his prospects were said to be good , and his manners unexceptionable ; and , above all , Emily was evidently much attached to him ; and remembering the days of his own e*trly love , the father 's heart of the aristocratic old colonel was fairly melted , and he consented to receive the young merchant as his son-in-law . The marriage , however , was not to take place till the spring of the following year . Meanwhile the lovers agreed to solace the period of their separation by long and frequent letters . Philip 's last words to Emily , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commence her homeward journey , were , " Now write to me very often , my own dearest Emily , for I shall never be happy but when hearing from you or writing to you ; and if you are long answering my letters , I shall be miserable , and perhaps jealous . " She could only answer by a mute sign , and the carriage drove away . Poor , agitated Emily , half happy , half sad , leaned back in it , and indulged in that feminine luxury-a hearty fit of tears . As for Philip , he took a few turns in the park , walking as if for a wager , and feeling sensible of a sort of coldness and dreariness about every object which he had never remarked before . Then he suddenly recollected that he must go to the counting-house , as he was " very busy . " He did not , however , make much progress with his business that day , as somehow or other he fell into a reverie over every thing he attempted . Nothing could exceed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three months , while their letters were written on the largest orthodox sheets to be had from the stationer's-post-office regulations in those days not admitting of the volumes of little notes now so much in vogue . At last Emily bethought herself of working a purse for Philip , in acknowledgment of a locket he had lately sent her from London . Generally speaking , Emily was not very fond of work ; hut somehow or other no occupation , not even the perusal of a favorite poem or novel , had ever afforded her half the pleasure that she derived from the manufacture of this purse . Each stitch she netted , each bead she strung , was a new source of delight-for she was working for Philip . Love is the true magic of life , effecting more strange metiunorphoses than ever did the spells of Archimago , or the arts of Armida  --  the moral alchemy which can transmute the basest things into the most precious . It is true of all circumstances , as well as of personal qualities , that " Things base and vile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dignity . " The purse was quickly finished , and dispatched to Philip , together with a letter . Emily was in high spirits at the prospect of the answer . She danced about the house , singing snatches of songs and ballads , and displaying an unusual amount of gayety ; for , though generally cheerful , she was of too thoughtful a disposition to be often merry . Philip , she was sure , would write by return of post . How she wished the time were come ! She knew pretty well , to be sure , what he would say ; but what did that signify ? She longed to feast her eyes on the words his hand had traced , and to fancy the tones and the looks which would have accompanied them had they been spoken instead of written . The expected day came at last , but the post-bag contailled no letter for Emily . At first she could hardly believe it ; her countenance fell , and for a few minutes she seemed much disappointed ; but never mind , the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about and to sing almost as gayly as before . But another day passed , and another and another , and still no letter ! Poor Emily 's blithe voice was mute now , and her light step rarely heard . Sometimes she tried to read , or to play on the piano , but without much success ; while her anxious looks , and the tear which occasionally maight be seen to glisten in her eye , betrayed the trouble within . A whole week elapsed , a longer period than had ever passed before without a letter from Philip Hayforth  --  a fortnight  --  a month-and the poor girl 's appetite failed , her nights were sleepless , and her drooping figure and pining looks told of that anxious suffering , that weary life-gnawing suspense , which is ten times more hard to bear than any evil , however great , of which we can ascertain the nature and discern the limits . Could Philip be ill ? Could heNo , he could not b* inconstant . Ought she to write to him agaiTi ? But to this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unladylike , undignified . If Mr. Hayforth were ill , he would doubtless write as soon as he was able ; and if he were well , his conduct was inexcusable , and on Emily 's part rendered any advance impossible " Poor Emily shrank from transgressillg what her parents represented as the limits due to delicacy and decorum , and she would have died rather than have been guilty of a real impropriety , or have appeared unfeminine in the eyes of Philip Hayforth ; and yet it did often suggest itself to her mind-rather , however , in the shape of an undefined feeling than of a conscious thought-. that the shortest , best , most straightforward way of proceeding , was to write at once to Mr. Hayforth , and ask an explanation . She could not herself see clearly how this could be wrong ; // but she supposed it must be so , and she acknowledged her own ignorance and inexperience . Emily was scarcely twenty ; just at the age when an inquiring and thoughtful mind can no longer rely with the unquestioning faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a diffident one is too timid to venture to trust to its own suggestions . It is only after much experience , or one of those bitter mistakes , which are the great lessons of life , that such a character learns that self-reliance , exercised with deliberation and humility , is the only safeguard for individual rectitude . Emily , therefore , did not write , but lived on in the silent , wasting agony of constant expectation and perpetual disappointment . Her mother , in the hope of affording her some relief , inquired in a letter she was writing to her relative in London , if the latter had lately seen Mr. Hayforth . The answer was like a deathblow to poor Emily . Her mother 's correspondent had " met Mr. Jlayforth walking with a lady . He had passed her with a very stiff bow , and seemed inclined to avoid her . He had not called for a long time . She could not at all understand it . " Colonel Sherwood could now no longer contain his indignation . He forbade the mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily was far too good and beautiful for the wife of a low-born tradesman , and that he deserved the indignity now thrown upon his family for ever having thought of degrading it by the permission of such a union . And his darling child would , he knew , bear up with the spirit of the Sherwoods . " Poor Emily had , it is to be feared , little of the spirit of the Sherwoods , but she tried to bear up from perhaps as good a motive . But it was a difficult task , for she was well nigh broken-hearted . She now never mentioned Philip Hayforth , and to all appearance her connection with him was as if it had never been ; but , waking or sleeping , he was ever present to her thoughts . Oh ! was it indeed p*ssible that she should never , never see him again ? No , it could not be ; he would seek her , claim her yet , her heart said ; but reason whispered that it was madness to think so , and bade her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this she could not do-not yet at all events . Month after month of the long dreary winter dragged slowly on ; her kind parents tried to dissipate her melancholy by taking her to every amusement within reach , and she went , partly from indifference as to what became of her , partly out of gratitude for their kindness . At last the days began to lengthen , and the weather to brighten ; but spring flowers and sunny skies brought no corresponding bloom to the faded hopes and the joyless life of Emily Sherwood . The only hope she felt was " the hope which keeps alive despair . " One May morning , as she was listlessly looking over in a newspaper the list of marriages , her eye fell upon a well-known name-the name of one who at that very time ought to have knelt at the altar with her . She uttered vOL. 11. - NO. iv. - 34. neither scream nor cry , but clasping her hands with one upward look of mute despair , fell down in a dead faint . For many days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but her mother tended her with the most assiduous affection , while her comfort and recreation seemed her father 's sole care . They were repaid at last by her recovery , and from that time forth she was less miserable . In such a case as Emily 's , there is not only the shock to the affections , but the terrible wrench of all the faculties to be overcome , which ensues on the divorce of the thoughts from those objects and that future to which they have so long been wedded . There is not only the breaking heart to be healed , but the whole mental current to he forcibly turned into a different channel from that which alone habit has made easy or pleasant . " The worst , " as it is called , is , however , easier to be endured than suspense ; and if Emily 's spirits did not regain their former elasticity , she crc long became quite resigned , and comparatively cheerful . More than a year had elapsed since that bright spring morning on which she had beheld the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received an offer of marriage from a gentleman of good family and large property . He had been struck by her beauty at a party where he had seen her ; and after a few meetings , made formal proposals to her father almost ere she was aware that he admired her . Much averse to form a new engagement , she would at once have declined receiving his addresses , had her parents not earnestly pressed the match as one in every respect highly eligible . Overcome at last by their importunities , and having , as she thought , no object in existence save to give pleasure to them , she yielded so far to their wishes as to consent to receive Mr. Beauchamp as her future husband , on condition that he should be made acquainted with the history of her previous engagement , and the present state of her feelings . She secretly hoped that when he learned that she had no heart to give with her hand , he would withdraw his suit . But she was mistaken . Mr. Beauchamp , it is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a notion that it was a term much in vogue with novel-writers , and was sometlines mentioned by parsons in their sermons ; but that the heart could have any thing to do with the serious affairs of life never once entered into his head to suppose . He therefore testified as much satisfaction at Emily 's answer , as if she had avowed for him the deepest affection . They were shortly afterwards married , and the pensive bride accompanied her husband to her new home- Woodthorpe Hall ; an ancient , castellated edifice , situated in an extensive and finely-wooded park on an estate in the East Riding of Yorkshire . But I have too long neglected Philip Hayforth-too long permitted a cloud to rest upon his honor and constancy . He was not , in truth , the heartless , light-minded wretch that I fear // you may think him . Pride , not falsehood or levity , was the blemish in his otherwise fine character ; but it was a very plague-spot , tainting his whole moral nature , and frequently neutralizing the effect of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Emily 's present and Emily 's letter , as she had ever ventured to hope , and had lost not a moment in writing to her in return a long epistle full of the fervent love and gratitude with which his heart was overflowing . He had also mentioned several affairs of mutual interest and of a pressing nature , but about which he was unwilling to take any steps without the concurrence of " his own dearest and kindest Emily . " He therefore entreated her to write immediately ; " to write by return of post , if she loved him . " But this letter never reached its destination : it was lost  --  a rare occurrence certainly , but , as most of us are aware from our own experience , not unknown . And now began with Philip Hayforth the same agony which Emily was enduring-nay , a greater agony ; for there was not only the same disappointed affection , the same heart-sickness , the same weary expectation , but there was the stronger suffering of a more passionate and less disciplined temper ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between pride and lovethe same fearful strife which , we are told , once made war in Heaven . Sometimes he thought that Emily might be ill ; but then that did not seem likely , as her health was generally good ; and she was , when she had last written , perfectly well , and apparently in excellent spirits . Should he write to her again No , she owed him a letter , and if she loved him , would doubtless answer it as soon as circumstances would permit ; and he would let that haughty old aristocrat , her father , see that Philip Hayforth , the merchant , had more of the spirit of a man in him than to cringe to the proudest blood in England . And as for Emily , she was his betrothed bride  --  the same as his wife ; and if he was not more to her than any father on earth , she was unworthy of the love he had given her . Let her only be true to him , and he was ready to devote his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time wore slowly away , he became more and more exasperated , fevered , wretehed . Sometimes it seemed to him that he could no longer endure such torment ; that life itself was a burthen too intolerable to be borne . But here pride came to the aid of a better principle . His cheek tinged at the thought of being spoken of as the slighted lover , and his blood boiled at the bare idea of Colonel Sherwood 's contemptuous pity for the vain plebeian who had dared to raise his thoughts to an alliance with his beautiful , high-born daughter . He would show the world that he was no lovesick , despairing swain ; and Miss Sherwood 's vanity should never be gratified by the display of the wounds her falsehood had inflicted . He would very soon , he knew , forget the fair coquette who had trampled thus upon his most THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE . sacred feelings . ' So he tried to persuade himself , but his heart misgave him . No : he could not forget her-it was in vain to attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the more the pride she had wounded in its tenderest point rose up in wrath against her ; and he chafed at his own powerlessness to testify towards her his scorn and contempt . At such times as these he seemed even to himself on the verge of madness . But he had saner moments-moments when his better nature triumphed , and pride resigned for a brief space her stormy empire to the benigner sway of the contending passion . In the midst of those terrific tornados , which in the West Indies and elsewhere carry in their path , over immense districts , ruin and desolation , there is a pause , often of considerable duration , caused , the scientific inform us , by the calm in the centre of the atmospheric vortex of which they are composed . Such a calm would occasionally rest upon the mind of Philip Hayforth , over the length and breadth of which the whirlwind of passion had lately been tearing . One night , after one of those hidden transports , which the proud man would have died rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his bed ( for he rarely went to bed now , in the accepted sense of the phrase ) in a state approaching exhaustion , mental and bodily . By degrees a sort of dream-like peace fell upon his spirit ; the present vanished away , and the past became , as it were , once more a living reality . He thought of Emily Sherwood as he had first seen her  --  a vision of loveliness and grace . He thought of her as he had beheld her almost the last time on that clear summer morning , and like refreshing dew on his scorched and desolated heart fell the remembrance of her gentle words and loving looks . Could they have deceived ? Ah no ! and his whole nature seemed suddenly softened . He seemed to see her before him now , with her angel face and her floating white robes ; he seemed even yet to be looking into those soft , bright eyes , and to read there again , as he had read before , love unspeakable , truth unchangeable . His heart was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fondness , and he extended his arms , as if to embrace that white-robed image of truth and gentleness : but she was not there ; it was but her spirit which had come to still his angry passions with the calm of trust and love . And in the fond superstition that so it was , he sprang from his couch , seized a pen , and wrote to her a passionate , incoherent epistle , telling her that she had tried hini almost beyond his strength , but that he loved and believed in her still , and if she answered immediately , that he was ready to forgive her for all the pain she had caused him . This letter finished , he threw himself upon his bed once again , and after a space , slept more soundly than he had done for many a long night before . When he rose in the morning he read over his letter , and felt , as he read , some faint // misgivings ; but these were put to flight by the recollection of Emily , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . As the post , however , did not go out till evening , he would keep the letter till then . Alas for the delay ! It changed for ever his own fate and that of Emily Sherwood . It chanced that very afternoon that , taking up a provincial newspaper in a coffee-room into which he had strolled , on his way to the post-office , the following paragraph met his eye : - We understand that there is a matrimonial alliance in contemplation between J- R- , Esq. , eldest son of Sir J- R- , Bart. , and the lovely and accomplished Miss Sherwood , daughter of Colonel Sherwood , late of the - th dragoons , and granddaughter of the late R. Sherwood , Esq. , of - Park . ' On reading this most unfounded rumor , Philip Hayforth waited not another moment , but rushed home as if driven by the furies ; and tearing his letter in a thousand pieces , threw it and the purse , Emily 's gift , into the fire , and vowed to bestow not another thought on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold his true and fervent love for riches and title . Oh how he scorned her ! how he felt in his own true heart that all the wealth and grandeur of the earth would have been powerless to tempt one thought of his from her ! To conceal all suspicion of his sufferings from thee world , and , if possible , banish their remembrance from his own mind , he now went even more than formerly into society ; and when there , simulated a gayety of manner that had hitherto distinguished his most vivacious moments . He had always been a general favorite , and now his company was more sought after than ever . Among the young persons of the opposite sex with whom his engagements most frequently brought him in contact , was a young girl of the name of Fanny Hartley , pretty , gentle , excessively amiable , but without much mind , and with no literary taste whatever . She had nothing to say ; but she listened to him , and he felt in her society a sort of repose , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . Her very silence soothed him , while the absorbing nature of his own feelings prevented him at first from thinking of hers . Philip Hayforth had certainly not more than an average share of human vanity , but he did at last suspect , partly from an accidental circumstance which had first drawn his attention to the subject , that he had created in the heart of the innocent Fanny a deeper interest than he had ever intended . He was touched , grateful , but at first grieved , for he " could never love again . " But the charm of being loved soon began to work ; his heart was less desolate , his feclings were less bitter , when he thought of Fanny Hartley , and began to ask himself if he were wise to reject the consolation which Providence seemed to offer him in the affection of this amiable and artless young creature . And when he thought of the pain she might perchance be suffering on his account , all l*esitation upon the subject was removed at once . If she loved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his really kind heart , had already been barbarous . He ought not to delay another day . And accordingly that very evening he offered his hand to Fanny Hartley , and was accepted with trembling joy . Their marriage proved a ha* one . Fanny was as amiable as she had appe*d , and in the conduct of the commoner affairs of life , goodfeeling with her supplied in a gr* measure any deficiency of strong sense . Philip did perhaps occasionally heave a gentle sigh , and think for a moment of Emily Sherwood , when he found how incapable his wife was of responding to a lofty or poetic thought , or of appreciating the points of an argument , unless it were upon some such subject as the merits of a new dress or the seasoning of a pudding . But he quickly checked the rising discontent , for Fanny was so pure in heart , and so unselfish in disposition , that it was impossible not to respect as well as to love her . In short , Philip Hayforth was a fortunate man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . And when , after twenty years of married life , he saw his faithful , gentle Fanny laid in her grave , he felt bereaved indeed . It seemed to him then , as perhaps , at such a time , it always does to a tender heart , that he had never done her justice , never loved her as her surpassing goodness deserved . And yet a kinder husband never lived than he had been ; and Fanny had died blessing him , and thanking him , as she said , " for twenty years of happiness . " " How mfinitely superior , " he *iow daiiy and hourly thought , " was her sweet temper and loving disposition to all the intellect and all the poetry that ever were enshrined in the most beautiful form . " And yet Philip Hayforth certainly was not sorry that his eldest daughter-his pretty , lively Fanny-should have turned out not only amiable and affectionate , but clever and witty . He was , in truth , very proud of Fanny . He loved all his children most dearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very delight of his existence . He had now almost forgotten Emily Sherwood ; but when he did think o* her , it was with indifference rather than 1*rgiveness . He had not heard of her since his marriage , having , some time previous to that event , completely broken off the slight acquaintance he had formed with her relations ; while a short absence abroad , at the time of her union with Mr. Beauchamp , had prevented him from seeing its announcement in the papers . Meanwhile poor Emily 's married life had not been so happy as that of her former lover . Mr. Beauchamp was of a pompous , tyrannieni disposition , and had a small , mean mind . He was constantly worrying about trifles , perpetually taking offence with nothing , and would spend whole days in discussing some trivial point of etiquette , in the breach of which , he conceived himself aggrieved . A very miserable woman was his wife amid all the cold mag // nificence of her stately home . Often , very often , in her hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief , bright days of her early love , and her spirit would be rapt away by the recollection of that scene on the balcony , when Philip Hayforth and she had stood with locked hands and full hearts gazing at the sinking star and the sweetly breaking day , and loving , feeling , thinking , as if they had but one mind between them , till the present seemed all a fevered dream , and the past alone reality . She could not have been deceived then : then , at least , he had loved her . Oh , had she not wronged him ? had there not been a mistake-some incident unexplained ? He had warned her that his temper was proud and jealous , and she felt now that she ought to have written and asked an explanation . She had thrown away her hap .. piness , and deserved her fate . Then she recollected that such thoughts in her , the wife of Mr. Beauchamp , were worse than foolishthey were sinful ; and the upbraidings of her conscience added to her misery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of right ; and in those solitary struggles was first developed the depth and strength of her character . Partly to divert her thoughts from subjects dangerous to her peace , and partly from the natural bent of her inclinations , she soughtassiduously to cultivate the powers of her mind , while her affections found ample scope for their exercise in the love of her infant son , and in considerate care for her many dependents , by all of whom she was loved and reverenced in no common degree . She learned thus the grand lessons- ' to suffer and be strong , ' and to make the best of destiny ; and she felt that if she were a sadder woman , she was also a wiser one , and at any price wisdom , she knew , is a purchase not to be despised . Mrs. Beauchamp had been married little more than five years when her husband died . His will showed , that however unhappy he had made her during his life , he had not been insensible to her merit , for he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while she should remain unmarried , the mistress of Woodthorpe Hall . In the childish affection and opening mind of her little boy poor Emily at last found happiness-unspeakable happiness , although it was of course qualified by the anxiety inseparable from parental love . She doted upon him ; but her love was of too wise and unselfish a nature to permit her to spoil him , while her maternal affection furnished her with another motive for the cultivation of her own mind and the improvement of her own character . She was fired with the noble ambition of being the mother of her child 's mind , as well as of that mind 's mere perishable shrine . IL TWENTY-FIVE years have passed away , with all theirchanges-their many changes ; andnow , Gone are the heads of silvery hair , And the young that were have a brow of care : ' And the babe of twenty-five years ago is now a man , ready to rush into the thickest and the hottest of the great battle of life . It was Christmas time ; the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a recent shower of snow , and crisped by a sharp frost ; the stars were coming out in the cold cloudless sky ; and two enormous fires , high piled with Christmas logs , blazed , crackled , and roared in the huge oaken chimneys of the great oak hall . Mrs. Beauchamp and her son sat together in the drawing-room , in momentary expectation of the arrival of their Christmas guests  --  a party of cousins , who lived at about ten miles ' distance from Woodthorpe Hall . Edmund Beauchamp was now a very promising young man , having hitherto fulfilled the hopes and answered the cares of his fond and anxious mother . He had already reaped laurels at school and college , and his enlightened and liberal views , and generous , enthusiastic mind , gave earnest of a career alike honourable and useful . In person and features , though both were agreeable , he did not much resemble his mother ; but he had the same large , soft , thoughtful eyes , the same outward tranquillity of demeanour hiding the same earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditative . Mrs. Beauchamp gazed at him long and fondly , and as she gazed , her mother 's heart swelled with love and pride , and her eyes glistened with heartfelt joy . At last she remarked , " I hope the Sharpes 's new governess is as nice a person as the old one . " " Oh , much nicer 1 " cried Edmund suddenly , and as if awakening from a reverie . " Indeed ! I used to think Miss Smith a very nice person . ' * " Oh , so she was-very good-natured and obliging ; but Miss Dalton is altogether a dif .. ferent sort of person . " " I wonder you never told me you found her so agreeable . " " I-Oh , I did note- That is , you never asked me . " " Is she young ? " " Yes-not much above twenty I should think . " " Is she pretty ? " " I-I do n't exactly know , " he said , hesita .. ting and colouring ; " I suppose-most persons - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am ! " thought Edmund . " What will my mother think of all this ? " He then continued in a more composed manner- " She is a very excellent girl at least . She is the daughter of a London merchant  --  a remarkably honourable man-who has been ruined by these bad times ; and though brought up in luxury , and with the expectation of large fortune , she has conformed to her circumstances in the most cheerful manner , and supports , it seems , with the fruits of her talents and industry , two little sisters at school . The Sharpes are all so fond of her , and she is the greatest favorite imaginable with the children . " Edmund spoke with unwonted warmth . His mother looked at him half-sympathisingly , half-anxiously . She seemed about // to speak , when the sound of carriage wheels , and the loud knock of a footman at the halldoor , announced the arrival of the Sharpes , and Mrs. Beauchamp and her son hastened into the hail to welcome their guests . Mrs. Beauchamp 's eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger , and partly from the interest in her her son 's conversation had created . But Miss Dalton was the last to enter . Edmund had not erred in saying she was a pretty girl . Even beneath the cumbrous load of cloaks and furs in which she was now enveloped , you could detect the exquisite proportions of her petite figure , and the sprightly graee of her carriage ; while a pretty winter bonnet set off to advantage a face remarkable for the intelligence and vivacity of its expression . Her features , though not regular , were small , while the brilliancy of her colour , though her complexion was that of a brunette , lent a yet brighter glow to her sparkling dark eyes , and contrasted well with the glossy black ringlets which shaded her animated countenance . At this moment , however , her little head was carried somewhat haughtily , and there was a sort of something not unlike bashfulness or awkwardness in her manner which seemed hardly natural to it . The truth was , Miss Dalton had come very unwillingly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not acquainted with Mrs. Beauchamp , and report said she was a very dignified lady , which Fanny Dalton interpreted to mean a very proud one ; and from her change of circumstances , rendered unduly sensitive , she dreaded in her hostess the haughty neglect or still haughtier condescension by which vulgar and shallow minds mark out their sense of another 's social inferiority . And therefore it was that she held her head so high , and exhibited the constraint of manner to which I have alluded . But all her pride and shyness quickly melted before the benign presence and true heart-politeness of Mrs. Beauchamp . Dignified the latter certainly was ; but her dignity was tempered with the utmost benevolence of expression , and the most winning sweetness of manner ; and when she took the hand of her little stranger-guest between both of hers , and holding it kindly , said , " You are the only stranger here , Miss Dalton ; but for my sake you must try to feel at home , " an affection for Mrs. Beauchamp entered into the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase . That she should conceive such an affection was not unnatural , for there was something in the appearance and manners of Mrs. Beauchamp , combined with her position in life , calculated to strike the imagination and touch the feelings of a warm-hearted and romantic girl such as Fanny Dalton , more especially one circumstanced as she was . Even her previous prejudice , with the reaction natural to a generous mind , was likely to heighten her subsequent admiration . But it is not so easy to account for the sudden interest the pretty governess created at first sight in the heart of her hostess . Many girls as pretty and as intelligent looking as Miss Dalton she had seen before , without their having inspired a spark of the tenderness she felt towards this unknown stranger . She could not comprehend it herself . She was not prone " to take fancies , " as the phrase is ; and yet , whatever might be the case , certain it was that there was a nameless something about this girl , which seemed to touch one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause her heart to yearn towards her with something like a mother 's love . She felt that if Miss Dalton were all that she had heard , and that if she should really prove her son 's choice , he should not be gainsaid by her . The Christmas party at Woodthorpe Hall was generally a merry one ; and this year it was even merrier than usual . Fanny Dalton was the life of the party ; her disposition was naturally a lively one , and this hour of sunshine in her clouded day called forth all its vivacity . But Fanny was not only clever , lively , and amiable ; her conduct and manners occa* sionally displayed traits of spirit-nay , of pride ; the latter , however , of a generous rather than an egotistical description . Nothing was so certain to call it forth as any tale of meanness or oppression . One morning Miss Sharpe had been relating an anecdote of a gentleman in the neighborhood who had jilted ( odious word ! ) an amiable and highly estimable young lady , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wealthy and titled widow . There were many aggravating circumstances attending the whole affair , which had contributed to excite still more against the offender the indignation of all right-thinking persons . The unfortunate young lady was reported to be dying of a broken heart . Fanny , who had been all along listening to the narration with an eager and interested countenance , now exclaimed- " Dying of a broken heart ! Poor thing ! But if I were she , I would not break my heart-I would scorn him as something far beneath me , poor and unimportant as I am . No , I might break my heart for the loss of a true lover , but never for the loss of a false one ! " As Fanny 's eyes shone , and her lip curled with a lofty contempt , as her naturally clear , merry tones grew deeper and stronger with the indignation she expressed , a mist seemed suddenly to be cleared away from the eyes of Mrs. Beauchamp , and in that slight young girl she beheld the breathing image of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignant accents she seemed to recognize the tones of a voice long since heard , but the echoes of which yet lingered in her heart . Why she had so loved Fanny Dalton was no mystery now-she saw in her but the gentler type of him whom she had once believed the master of her destiny-even of Philip Hayforth , long unheard of , but never forgotten . But what connection could there be between Philip Hayforth and Fanny Dalton l and whence this strange resemblance , which lay not so much in // qwq only show you how I love you-how grateful I am for all your goodness ; but you will never , never know . " Mrs. Beauchamp looked anxiously at her , and began , " Fanny " - But suddenly stopped , as if she knew not how to proceed . Immediately afterwards the young girl left the room , silently and passionately kissing Mrs. Beauchamp 's hand as she passed her on her way to the door . A few hours later in the day , as Mrs. Beauchamp sat reading in her boudoir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly entered the little room in a state of agitation quite foreign to his ordinary disposition and habits . " Mother ! " he cried . " My love ! what is the matter ? " " Mother ! I love Fanny Dalton-I love her with all my soul . I think her not only the loveliest and most charming of women , but the best and truest ! I feel that she might make my life not only happier , but better . Oh , mother ! is not love as real a thing as either wealth or station ? Is it not as sufficient for all noble works ? Is it not in some shape the only motive for all real improvement ? It seems to me that such is the lesson I have been learning from you all my life long . " " And in that you have learned it I am deeply grateful , and far more than repaid for all my care and anxiety on your account ; and now thank you for your confidence , my dear Edmund , though I think you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been better , I think , to have said all those violent things to Fanny than to me . " " I have said more than all these to Fanny , and-she has rejected me " Rejected you ! my dearest Edmund ! I am grieved indeed ; but I do not see how I can help you. ** " And yet I should not be quite hopeless if you would plead my cause . Miss Dalton says that you have loaded her with kindness which she can never repay ; that she values your affection beyond all expression ; and that she is determined not to prove herself unworthy of it by being the means of disappointing the expectations you may have formed for your son , for whom , she says , she is no match either in wealth or station . She would not listen to me when I attempted to speak to her but this instant in the Laurel Walk , but actually ran away , positively commanding me not to follow ; and yet , I do think , if she had decidedly disliked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , without mentioning you . Mother ! what do you-what do you think ? " " You shall hear presently , Edmund ; but in the first place let us find Miss Dalton . " They went out together , and had not sought her long , when they discovered her pacing perturbedly up and down a broad walk of closelyshaven grass , inclosed on both sides by a tall impenetrable fence of evergreens . As soon as she saw them , she advanced quickly to meet them , her face covered with blushes , but her bearing open and proud . Ere Mrs. Beauchamp had time to speak , she exclaimed , " Mrs. Beauchamp , I do not deserve your reproaches . Never till this morning was I aware of Mr. Beauchamp 's sentiments towards me . Dear , kind friend , I would have suffered any tortures rather than that this should have happened . " Fanny was violently agitated ; while Mrs. Beauchamp , on the contrary , preserved a calm exterior . She took one of the young girl 's hands between both of hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear Fanny , I entreat you . Believe me , I do not blame you for the affection my son has conceived for you . " " Oh thank you ! Indeed you only do me justice . " " But , Fanny , I blame you very much for another reason . " " For what reason , then , madam I " " For the same reason which now causes your eye to flash , and makes you call your friend by a ceremonious title . I blame you for your pride , which has made you think of me harshly and unjustly . Unkind Fanny ! What reason have I ever given you to think me heartless or worldly ? Do you not know that those who love are equals ? and that if it be a more blessed thing to give , yet to a generous heart , for that very reason , it ought to be a pleasure to receive I Are you too proud , Fanny , to take any thing from us , or is it because my son 's affection is displeasing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in tears , and even sobbing aloud . " Oh , forgive me , " she cried , " forgive me ! I acknowledge my fault . I see that what I believed to be a sense of duty was at least partly pride . Oh , Mrs. Beauchamp , you would forgive me if you only knew how miserable I was making myself too ! " " Were you-were you indeed making yourself miserable ? " cried Edmund . " Oh say so again , dearest Fanny ; and say you are happy now Mrs. Beauchamp smiled fondly as she answered , " I will do more than forgive you , my poor Fanny , if you will only love my son . Will you make us both so happy ? " Fanny only replied by a rapid glance at Edmund , and by throwing herself into the arms of Mrs. Beauchamp , which were extended to receive her . And as she was pressed to that fond , maternal heart , she whispered audibly , " My mother 1-our mother ! " Mrs. Beauchamp then taking her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with evident emotion , " Only make Edmund happy , Fanny , and all the gratitude between us will be due on my side ; and oh , my children , as you value your future peace , believe in each other through light and darkness . And may Heaven bless you both ! " She had turned towards the house , when she looked back to ask , " Shall I countermand the carriage , Fanny I " And Edmund added , half-tenderly , half-slyly , " Shall you go to-morrow I " // Fanny 's tears were scarcely dry , and her blushes were deeper than ever , but she answered immediately , with her usual lively promptitude , " That depends upon the sort of entertainment you may provide as an inducement to prolong my visit . " And Edmund , finding that he had no chance with Fanny where repartee or badinage was in question , had recourse again to the serious vein , and rejoined , " If my power to induce you to prolong your visit were at all equal to my will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We must now pass over a few months . The early freshness and verdure of spring had passed away , and the bloom and the glory of summer had departed . The apple-trees were now laden with their rosy treasures , the peach was ripe on the sunny wall , and the summer darkness of the woods had but just begun to be varied by the appearance of a few yellow leaves . It was on a September afternoon , when the soft light of the autumn sunset was bathing in its pale golden rays the grey turrets of Woodthorpe Hall , and resting like a parting smile on the summits of the ancestral oaks and elms , while it cast deep shadows , crossed with bright gleams , on the spreading lawns , or glanced back from the antlers of the deer , as they ever and anon appeared in the hollows of the park or between the trees , that a travelling carriage passed under the old Gothic archway which formed the entrance to Woodthorpe Park , and drove rapidly towards the Hall . It contained Edmund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned from a wedding trip to Paris . They were not , however , the only occupants of the carriage . With them was Mr. Dalton , whom we knew in former days as Philip Hayforth , and who had been specially invited by Mrs. Beauchamp to accompany the bride and bridegroom on their return to Woodthorpe Hall . And now the carriage stops beneath the porch , and in the arched doorway stands a noble and graceful figure  --  the lady of the mansion . The slanting sunbeams , streaming through the stained windows at the upper end of the oak hall , played upon her dress of dark and shining silk , which was partly covered by a shawl or mantle of black lace , while her sweet pale face was lighted up with affection , and her eyes were full of a grave gladness . Her fair hair , just beginning to be streaked with silver , was parted over her serene forehead , and above it rested a simple matronly cap of finest lace . Emily Beauchamp was still a beautiful woman-beautiful even as when in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of the new-born day , clad in her robes of vestal whiteness . The change in her was but the change from morning to evening - from spring to autumn ; and to some hearts the waning light and the fading leaves have a charm which sunshine and spring-time can not boast Having fondly but hastily embraced her son and daughter , she turned to Mr. Dalton , and with cordial warmth bade him wclcome to Woodthorpe Hall . He started at the sound of the gentle , earnest tones which , as if by magic , brought palpably before him scenes and images which lay far remote , down the dim vista of years , obscured , almost hidden , by later interest and more pressing cares . He looked in Mrs. Beauchamp 's face , and a new wonder met him in the glance of her large brown eyes , so full of seriousness and benignity , while the smooth white hand which yet held his in its calm friendly cLsp seemed strangely like one he had often pressed , but which had always trembled as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream ing He was aroused from the reverie into which he had fallen by the same voice which had at first arrested his attention . " We must try to become acquainted as quickly* as possible , Mr. Dalton , " said Mrs. Beauchamp , " and learn to be friends for oar children 's sake . " Bowing low , he replied , " I have already learned from my daughter to know and to esteem Mrs. Beauchamp . " The more Mr. Dalton saw of Mrs. Beauchamp , the more bewildered he became . He fancied what appeared to him the strangest impossibilities , and yet he found it impossible to believe that there was no ground for his vague conjectures . His life had been one of incessant toil , lately one of heavy distress and anxious cares , which had frequently sent him to a sleepless pillow ; but never had he spent a more wakeful night than this , his first under the stately roof which his daughter-his darling Fanny-called that of her home . He felt that he could not endure another day of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he resolved to make an opportunity , should such not spontaneously present itself . But he was spared the necessity ; for after breakfast the following morning his hostess offered to show him the grounds-an offer which , with his desired end in view , he eagerly accepted . They commenced their walk in silence , and seemed as if both were suddenly under the influence of some secret spell . At last , in a hoarse voice and a constrained manner , Mr. Dalton abruptly inquired , " Pray , madam , may I ask-though I fear the question may seem an unceremonious , perhaps a strange one-if you have any relations of the name of Sherwood ? " He saw her start , as she answered with forced composure , " Yes , Mr. Dalton , I have . It was indeed my own name before I married . " As she made this avowal , both stood still , it would seem by a sort of tacit , mutual consent , and earnestly looked at each other . Philip Hayforth Dalton was now a man past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countenance was deeply marked with lines of sorrow and care , and his dark luxuriant locks were thinned and grizzled , while his features , which had long been schooled to betray no sign of emotion of a transient or superficial nature , were now , as his eyes met // those of Mrs. Beauchamp 's , convulsed as by the working of a strong passion . A slight blush tinged Emily 's usually pale cheek ; she drew a rapid breath , and her voice faltered perceptibly as she said at last , " Yes , Philip Hayforth , I am Emily Sherwood ! " Not immediately did he reply either by word or look-not till she had asked somewhat eagerly , " We are friends , Mr. Dalton-are we not ? " Pride wrestled for a minute with the better nature of Philip Hayforth ; but whether it were that his self-command was now greater than in the fiery and impassioned season of youth , or that it was difficult to maintain anger and resentment in the gentle , soothing , and dignified presence in which he now found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that this time at least he crushed the old demon down , and forced himself to answer , though with a formal manner and somewhat harsh tone , " Friends , Mrs. Beauchamp ! Certainly , we are friends , if you wish it . Your goodness to my poor motherless Fanny has completely cancelled all wrongs ever done to Fanny s father . Let the past be forgotten ! " " Not so , if you please , " she answered gently , " rather let it be explained . Mr. Dalton , we are neither of us young now , and have both , I trust , outlived the rashness of youth . Never till our mutual truth is made mutually clear , can we be the friends we ought to be-the friends I wish we were for Edmund 's and Fanny 's sake . Let us both speak plainly and boldly , and without fear of offence on either side . I promise , on mine , to take none at the truth , whatever it may be . " Mr. Dalton , as she spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she finished , half in reverie , half addressing her , it would seem , " The same clear good sense , the same sweet good temper , which I had persuaded myself was but the effect of a delusive imagination ! But I entreat your pardon , madam , and I promise as you have done . " " Tell me then , truly , Mr. Dalton , why you never answered the last letter I wrote to you , or acknowledged the receipt of the purse I sent ? " He started , as if he had received a pistol shot ; the formal , distant Mr. Dalton had disappeared , and the eager , vehement Philip Hayforth stood before her once more . " I did answer it , Emily . Out of the fulness of my heart  --  and how full it was I can not tell you now-I answered your letter ; but you , Emily , you never answered mine . " " Indeed I never received it . " It was some minutes after this announcement crc either was able to speak , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . wronged you ? Emily , at this instant I catch , as it were , at the bottom of a dark gulf a glimpse of the evil of my nature . I begin to believe that I have cherished a devil in my bosom , and called it by the name of a good angel . Emily , if I am not too old to improve , you will have been the instrument of my improvement . I do not ask you to forgive me , generous woman , because I feel that you have already done so . " Mrs. Beauchamp felt what it must have cost the proud man to make this acknowledgment , and she honored him for the effort . " We have both been to blame , " she said , " and therefore stand in need of mutual forgiveness . But it would be idle now to lament the past ; rather let us rejoice that our friendship , re-established on the firm basis of perfect confidence , is cemented by the union of our dear children . " Mr. Dalton only answered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politeness of an old friend , as she looked a little fatigued , and they walked together some distance in silence . At last Mrs. Beauchamp inquired , " Was Fanny 's mother like herself ? " " No , Emily . My poor dead Fanny , " and his voice trembled slightly , " was very sweet and amiable , but not at all like my living one . " " Your marriage was happy then I I am glad of that . " " I should have been the most ungrateful of men had it not been so ; and yours too , Emily I hope " - He stopt , he har*y knew why , while , with her eyes fixed on the ground . she answered slowly , " I am happy , very happy now A feeling of profound respect and admiration held Mr. Dalton silent for a few seconds , and then he said , in the tone of one who expresses an earnest conviction , " You are the most noble minded woman I ever knew . " Mrs. Beauchamp made no answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , that she said in her natural tone of kind and calm cheerfulness , " And now , Mr. Dalton , let us look for Edmund and Fanny ; and if you please , in order that they may learn of our mistakes that trust is the nobler part of love , we shall tell them this story of THE LOST LETTER . "
