txt ART . III . - The Lives and Times of the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States . By HENRY FLANDERS . First Series : John Jay , John Rutledge . Philadelphia : Lippincott , Grambo , &amp; Co. 1855. 8vo. pp. 645 . IT is to Roger North , in his Lives of his illustrious brethren , that we are indebted for one of the most discriminating and satisfactory elucidations existing in our language , of the plan upon which the biography of a great man should be built . He very justly compares the biographer 's labors to those of a portrait-painter , whose works would be held as naught , were he to omit presenting upon his canvas the blemishes as well as the beauties of his subject , and who is held by the rules of his art to a strict accountability in transferring the living features of his original to a mute immortality . True it is , that a Vandyke or a Sir Joshua may excel in that delicate flattery , and that rare aptitude of conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the attributes of a hero of romance , or the airy lightness and grace of a being of another sphere ; but this , so far from militating against our proposition , is but confirmatory of it . With all their power , these great artists have never dared to lose sight of the primary object . To make a pleasing picture was not more their aim than to make a good likeness . Every one who recollects - and who does not ? - that superb passage in which Scott renders from the involuntary lips of Cromwell an extorted tribute to the Flemish brush that painted Charles the First , will comprehend our meaning . And it is to a like eminence of art that the biographer should bend his aspirations ; nor // neglect , for the pretence of an unnatural pre-eminence above his fellows , to give us those real traits of character which constitute the distinguishing marks of the man . " If the history of a life , " says honest Roger , " hangs altogether upon great importances , such as concern the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct of the person that gives title to the work , it may be a history , and a very good one , but of anything rather than that person 's life . " Never were words spoken more apposite than these , and never has a rule been more generally disregarded . It appears to have become a cardinal principle with almost every biographer , to consider his hero less as a human being than as an ill-used demigod , whom the jealousy or blindness of his time had cheated of his due honors . In the execution of his task , the writer seems to clothe himself with the properties of an avenging Nemesis , resolute to compel the recognition of those merits to which mankind has hitherto been insensible . To the truly great there is nothing more degrading than this enforced association with that which is ignoble ; that which , in itself mean , shows more meanly than ever in comparison with the giants by whom it stands . " Pigmies are pigmies still , though perched on Alps " ; and though it often happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into notice become at once the monument of his downfall , though he soar like Icarus , only to be whirled " From high , To grinning Scorn a sacrifice , And bitter Infamy , " - yet it is not the less a wrong done to those who have earned our veneration , to permit the sanctuary of their fame to be polluted by such a " midnight crew. ** There is , however , a certain class of pretenders to greatness , who claim , and to whom we willingly concede , a disgusting precedence ; who , by their mischievous example , may have already accomplished much harm to public morals and to public taste . Were it merely to strip empty folly of its tinsel , we would hardly turn aside . It struts its brief hour in the sun , and crc night is forgotten . We never heard that any one was seriously oppressed by the glory , living or posthu // mous , of Timothy Dexter , or " the great Twaimley , the inventor of the celebrated smoothing-iron . " But when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him who holds up his own picture for our admiration , it is high time , we think , to enter a protest . The land has been plagued with autobiographies , where characters conspicuous neither for public merit nor for private worth are with venal eagerness obtruded upon the public attention . Deeds which a person of any sensibility should blush to have committed are unhesitatingly brought forward by their perpetrator to give a zest to his pages , a point to his tale . That , in the pursuit of gain , a man should incur the risk of being sent to gaol or to Coventry , is , unhappily , no solecism in human nature ; but that he should , for the sake of a further pittance , proclaim his own infamy , argues a strange degree of moral abasement . Such a man is the true Yahoo of the race . Nor is it always the lot even of a man really worthy of high praise to meet his just deserts . He is as often injured as benefited by the unjust system of indiscriminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often attributed to those opposing qualities , distorted in representation to the semblance of virtues , in whose very despite he succeeded . To find a chronicler who , with a full sense of the merits of that career which forms the burden of his strain , is not blind to its blemishes , - who beneath the Julian laurel perceives the baldness of the naked skull , - is not the fortune of all the heroes who have flourished since the days of Agarnemnon . It is a gratification as rare as welcome to find that faculty so well displayed in the volume before us , where are brought together two characters alike eminent for public services , yet differing toto cailo upon many questions of public duty and policy . The historian of the Chief Justices of the United States has undertaken one of the noblest tasks ever afforded to the pen of man . To no page of our national career can the mind recur with such unalloyed satisfaction . The annals of no other land offer a more noble succession of professional ability , mental vigor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the realm . The light of a Marshall will hardly pale // 1855.1 FLANDERS 'S LIVES OF THE CHIEF JUSTICES . even beside that of a Hardwicke or a Mansfield ; but however rigidly we may search , no Macclesfield can be found upon the scroll ; - from first to last , the ermine has been kept pure and unsullied . Of human frailties , our sages have doubtless had their share , for they were human ; but not a breath has ever impeached the integrity of their public lives . With equal hand , and with unsparing diligence , they have continued since the foundation of the empire to measure out justice alike to rich and to poor . The proscribed Tory , contending with the embodied wrath of a powerful state , found there a tribunal which neither the fear of a people , nor its favor , could induce to swerve a tittle from the direct line . The fallen statesman , on whose head were opened all the vials of private jealousy and of public hate , there found an arbiter whose firm mind no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dignity of their office , and the respectability of their characters , far above the noisy bustle of the crowd , they shine , as it were , in a firmament all their own ; where " No mist obscures , nor cloud , nor speck , nor stain Breaks the serene of heaven . " We should be sorry to have it inferred , from anything that has hitherto dropped from us , that there was aught in the character of JOHN JAY of which even the most virtuous of statesmen need have been ashamed . His death-bed was in. strict keeping with his whole life , the crowning triumph , as it were , of a long career of dutiful and pious deeds . But it is so much the fashion now-a-days to make every Revolutionary patriot perform actions and imagine sentiments which were , in point of fact , utterly foreign to his hand and head ,  --  to portray the genius of American Independence springing , Minerva-like , into full being from his brain , and radiant in celestial armor , - that in sober truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents to us , in calm , steady colors , the faithful picture of that gradual and slow operation of causes which , during the decade immediately preceding the Revolution , was training the hearts of men to exchange a loyal devotion to the mother country for indignation and anger , tempered for a while by the hope of a speedy // accommodation , and subsequently to abandon this ground for that of undisguised and overt hostility . If biography be really history teaching by example , all will concede that it is useless unless true ; else the wanderings of Sinbad the Sailor , or of Captain Lemuel Gulhver , would be as serviceable to the voyager as those of Scoresby or of Ross . To paint man such as he really is not , is the province of romance ; the description may be entertaining , but perhaps not instructive . To be enlightened by the genius , to be warned by the example , of those who have gone before , to learn to shun the dangerous rocks and sunken shoals on which they have split , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perilous confusion , should be our more serious instigation to the study of their lives . And nowhere will the reader find a more valuable lesson than in that of John Jay . The history of this eminent statesman has already been well told by his son , and very ill by others whom it is not necessary now to mention . Mr. Flanders , therefore , would seem to have had little else to do than to travel upon a beaten path . Fortunately for himself and the public , however , new lights have of late years been shed upon some of the most important scenes of Jay 's career , and that which his son could only hint is now susceptible of proof positive . Otherwise we should hardly venture to dwell very long on a sub- . ject that can not be new to a majority of our readers . On the 12th of December , 1745 , in the village , as it might then almost have been styled , of New York , was born John Jay . For conscience ' sake and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves from their native shores , whither fortune and friends , their children 's cradles and their mothers ' graves , in vain lured their return . And their virtue brought its own reward ; for it is not in the chain of probability that on any other soil than this such long generations of domestic happiness , brightened , in time , by such illustrious fame , should have been their lot . The youthful life of Jay was sober , discreet , and pious . If not distinguished in early years by precocious ability , he at least secured the more solid advantages of a healthy and vigorous frame . With an industry restrained only by a rare // 1855 . FLANDERS 'S LIVES OF THE CHIEF JUSTICES . judgment , he passed through his collegiate career , honored with the amplest triumphs of that little world ; and with a like perseverance and success he applied himself to the study of the law . The delving toils of the student of those days are well described by our author ; when as yet Blackstone and Kent were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth . Bracton and Fleta , Coke on Littleton and the Year-Books , still lay , mighty stumbling-blocks , across his path , daunting the courage and confusing the brain of the bewildered novice ; and hence the tedious probation crc an apprentice arrived at the full dignities of the long robe . With all his application and ability , Jay was four years at the desk before he was admitted to the bar . It was not until 1774 that Mr. Jay became at all involved in public life ; and interesting as is the sketch of New York politics of that period which Mr. Flanders presents to us , we can not pause to do more than refer the historical student to it as a passage of remarkable accuracy and value . In its examination , he will perceive how Jay , at first counselling conciliation , advanced step by step to a position of firm resistance to the extravagances of the ministry . It has been ignorantly asserted , that he was from the outset the advocate and friend of independence . So far from this being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a majority of his Whig fellow-citizens , opposed to even a non-importation or nonconsumption agreement , unless the sentiment of the whole continent should imperatively demand such measures . He evidently reprobated the violence of the Boston mobs , and deemed the victims of their excesses amply entitled to have their losses redressed by those who had tacitly permitted them . But at the same time he was clear on the great questions at issue between Great Britain and America . As a delegate to the Congress which met at Carpenter 's Hall in Philadelphia on the 5th of September , 1774 , his conduct was in strict accordance with these views . On the floor , however , were assembled Whigs of every complexion , from him who burned for independence , to him who looked to nothing beyond a restoration on a firmer basis than ever of the reciprocal ties that bound the two countries . Of this last class was // the once celebrated Joseph Galloway . His plan of adjustment , indorsed by his own Province , and in turn so popular as to be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odious as to be expunged from its records by a subsequent vote of that same body , met now with the warm approval of Mr. Jay , and the no less fervent hatred of Patrick Henry . The views of the latter triumphed , and Galloway 's plan has since , with scanty justice , shared the ignominy of its author . It was during this session that Jay first attracted the admiration of the whole nation by his Address to the People of Great Britain . Re-elected to the Congress of 1775 , we still find him , in opposition to the ultra Whigs , urging on to adoption the Petition to the King , and thus incurring the severe reprobation of such men as John Adams , who not without cause apprehended the ill effects of that measure . But this was his last effort for conciliation ; and on its failure , he hoped nothing more for his country from the justice or the mercy of England . On the passage of the Declaration of Independence , he was laboring in the immediate service of his native State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred scroll ; but it found no warmer supporter than in him . As a leading member of the Council of Safety , as Chief Justice of New York , as President of the Congress , his services were not less conscientiously rendered than gratefully appreciated by his country . When , in September , 1779 , he was appointed Minister to Spain , he undertook a duty which he well knew would prove the source of prolonged discomfort to himself , though possibly of material benefit to America . He left Congress , too , with the unpleasant consciousness of having failed in the accomplishment of " the special occasion ' * of his election . The government of New York had anticipated from his efforts the settlement , in some satisfactory way , of the Vermont controversy . This he could not bring about ; and the Green Mountain Boys rejoiced in their triumph . As a very remote result we may remark that , had Mr. Jay succeeded , and Vermont remained an integral part of New York , one probable consequence would have been the election of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jay embarked a man who once " possessed the // affections of our whole people , " to whom his name is now almost unknown . The portrait at full length of M. G6rard , Minister to the Congress from his Most Christian Majesty , was once the ornament of what might have been called the capital of America ; a few months since , it was with difficulty that a purchaser could be found for it at any price . So much for the stability of popular favor , ever in extremes . Yet it was to a difficulty with this gentleman that Jay owed that deep-seated prejudice against his nation which was afterwards so plainly developed . Arrived at his destination , the new envoy was plunged at once into all the intrigues and embarrassments that his position engendered . It would be amusing to follow his career , from the arrival of those bUes noires of Miss Burney , Cumberland the dramatist and his two daughters , who annoyed Jay as bitterly as they had the authoress of Cecilia , to his removal to Paris as a negotiator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief . A single point further , however , demands our attention . The American Commissioners , every one knows , were instructed to keep the French ministry an courant of everything they should do . Utterly distrustful of the sincerity of that court , Mr. Jay very much disregarded these instructions , and , with Adams prevailing over Franklin , negotiated a separate peace . In France , and particularly in America , this course was severely censured . Jay had nothing but his suspicions to justify him , and these , pointing directly to an anxiety on the pa ' *t of the French that the Americans should be deprived of the fisheries and the navigation of the Mississippi , have hitherto remained unsustained by proof . We have now , for the first time , Mr. Jay 's complete justification . In 1838 , Lord St. Helen 's , who as Mr. Fitzherbert had represented the Court of St. James at Paris pending the negotiation , disclosed the nature of the propositions made to him by M. de Vergennes . We believe they have not before been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " entirely to a certain enlargement of the limits of the French fisheries , as defined by former treaties . But in the course of these discussions , M. de Vergennes never failed to insist on the expediency of a concert of measures between France and England , for the purpose of excluding the Amen30 * // can States from these fisheries , lest they should become a nursery for seamen. ** Returning to New York in 1784 , after an absence of eight years , Mr. Jay was again summoned to the service of the State . When the present Constitution was subniitted to the people , he was one of the famous triad who , through the aid of the press , chiefly brought about its adoption ; and under its operation , he became , on the 26th of September , 1789 , the first Chief Justice of the United States . Weighty as were some of the cases that came before him , this is not the place to dwell upon them in a professional view . His decision , in Chisholm vs . Georgia , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had the effect of producing an amendment to the Constitution . In Henfield 's case , the leading doctrine of his opinion seems now to be generally abandoned as unsound . In that of Georgia vs . Brailsford , he held views with regard to the powers of a jury with which we do not believe that the profession has ever precisely coincided . But in all his judicial career , he manifested , says Mr. Flanders , " a judicial faculty , a power of analysis , an aptitude for logical processes , and a ready apprehension of principles . " The poverty of the Reports of the period has failed to do justice to many of the luminaries of the ancient bar . Of Jay 's embassy to England in 1794 , and its results , of his election as Governor of New York in 1795 , and of his withdrawal to private life in 1801 , the reader will find much in these pages to interest , much to instruct him . On the 17th of May , 1829 , his long and eventful career was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthened his hands through life , now smoothed his dying pillow and supported his parting soul . It has been objected to them that they were narrow and fanatical . His proposal that no Roman Catholic , who held that the Pope or his priesthood had power to annul oaths or even to grant absolution from sin , should be admitted to civil rights , was certainly not conceived in that spirit of modern liberality which grants the same toleration to Methodist and Mormon , to Jews and Jumpers , Episcopalians and Thugs . The wide benevolence of Jay 's life will best answer these critics . In this feature // FLANDERS ' S LIVES OF THE CHIEF JUSTICES . 355 there is a strong resemblance between his character and that of the poet Cowper , while in statesmanlike notions of just liberty he may well be compared to the predecessor of Cowper 's kinsman , the great Lord Somers . Mr. Flanders thus happily sums up his character : - " Mr. Jay 's character is disclosed in the record of his life . His moral and intellectual qualities were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . His private virtues attracted the affection and homage of his friends . He was modest , claimed no merit , assumed no importance , and seldom alluded to the great events of his life . He was charitable , not impulsively bestowing his means without discrimination , like Goldsmith 's village preacher , whose pity gave ere charity began , ' hut with a judicious selection , and from a sense of duty . His economy was exact , but liberal . A wise man , ' he said , has money in his head , but not in his heart . ' The recipients of his bounty were numerous . He had an elevated sense of justice , and the claims of humanity . His religion was a part of his being , and displayed itself in the uniform tenor of his life . He acted under the habitual conviction of accountability . All his serious thoughts had rest in heaven . ' His feelings were always under the control of his will , and hence he was never guilty of those extravagances of conduct which too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his friendships , and equally so , we suspect , in his enmities . Having once had good cause to doubt a man 's sincerity or integrity , he never after trusted him . ' His disposition was cheerful , - his conversation equally instructive and entertaining . " The intellectual endowments of Jay are easily described . his mind was vigorous , exact , logical . To genius he could make no pretensions . Judgment , discriminative , penetrating , was the characteristic of his understanding . If over the other faculties of his intellect imagination had presided , the compass of his thought would have been enlarged , and grace and flexibility been imparted to his mind . Jay was not a variously learned man . Modern genius did not delight him . Of the ancients , Cicero was his favorite . The Bible was his constant study . Observing steadily throughout his life the great principles of justice and rectitude , he ascended to the temple of honor through the temple of virtue . " ' We now advance to the contemplation of a character cast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUTLEDGE has long been a desideratum in our literature , the // sketches in existence with which we are acquainted being inexact and meagre . This want is now amply supplied . Born at Charleston , in September , 1739 , the future dictator was early left an orphan . His mother , in whom appear to have been beautifully combined all those qualities which constitute the glory of her sex , supplied to him , with tender care , the place of father , fortune , and friends ; and at the age of seventeen he commenced the study of the law . Two years later , he was sent to London , and entered in the Temple , where he remained three years , exciting , by his abilities as a student , expectations which nothing less than his future success could have justified . Returning to Charleston in 1761 , he was retained in a cause crc his foot had pressed the shore . It was a case of breach of promise of marriage ; then , as now , not a very hopeful cause for the defendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantaneous position at the bar , which warranted him in regarding his virgin fee of a hundred guineas as but the first drops of the golden shower about to break upon his head . Though but twenty-two years of age , he was fortified with the results of five years of uninterrupted application upon a mind of no common order , backed by an eloquence so energetic as often to be literally commanding . Instead of undergoing long years of drudgery , he stood at once at the head of his profession . In 1764 , he was appointed Attorney-General . Previously to this , however , and not regarding the old legal prescription , that " Mistress Common-Law should lye alone , " he gave his hand and name , and with them all the threads of his existence , to a lady of his own city . When a man like Rutledge loves , it is with a fervor and intensity of which ordinary minds can form but a slight conception . The blow which , after long and happy years , bereaved him of his faithful partner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist . Shattered alike , the one rapidly followed the other to darkness and extinction . As may be supposed , the qualities which had procured Rutledge 's success at the bar proved equally efficacious in the Assembly , and from his first advent on the stage of politics his influence was marked and decided . In resisting the encroachments of the Governor and the ministry , his voice // FLANDERS 'S LIVES OF THE CHIEF JUSTICES . was ever the foremost , and it was mainly through him and through Christopher Gadsden that the Province was induced to acquiesce in James Otis 's Massachusetts circular , and to send delegates to the Stamp Act Congress of 1765 . Of these delegates , Rutledge was one . Though the youngest member of that body , none occupied a more conspicuous place in its proceedings ; and there , for the first and last time , was he fated to encounter the only Northern man of his period who at all resembled him , - James Otis . The position which Rutledge on this occasion took and maintained justly brought upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when , in 1774 , delegates were again to be chosen to a Continental Congress , he was once more selected for the post . The first impressions made by Rutledge , at this period , upon the minds of some of his New England associates , were probably not very favorable . John Adams characterizes his conduct as indicative of " reserve , design , and cunning . " But Rutledge did not as yet share in the fiery politics of the great Massachusetts statesman . His Colony had suffered little or no sensible oppression . He had no notion of rushing blindfolded into open rebellion . Besides , there was a hauteur , a social arrogance in his manners , that probably was not very agreeable on all occasions to strangers . When the agreement for non-exportation and kindred measures came up in Congress , Rutledge would not consent to it until a clause was inserted giving a solitary and unjust immunity to the staple of his own Province . Gadsden in the House , and the people of Carolina out of it , viewed this odious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its advocates sought to justify it were unsound . The Provincial Congress , however , of which he was a member , yielded to his eloquence , and did not hesitate to re-elect him . In the Congress of 1775 , we still find him advocating the same conciliatory measures which had already drawn upon him the censure of New England men . In Massachusetts , where matters had reached their crisis , there is no doubt that men 's minds were ripe for independence ; but it was hardly just to blame distant Colonies , whose interests were not touched , whose passions and // pride had not been violently wounded , and who were at best but contending for a naked principle , should they evince a disinclination to premature insurrection . Massachusetts was the principium etfons of the war ; her sons were united , and almost unanimous ; they had gone too far to recede , even if they wanted to . In some of the Southern Colonies the case , as we have observed , was widely different , and their representatives merit honor rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no right to bring ruin and disgrace upon their constituents to gratify the zealous fury of strangers . As the tide of aggression rolled up , however , Rutledge was ever found equal to the opposition . Wherever an American right was touched , he was always prompt to advocate its instant redress . He joined with energy in recommending to the people of the various Colonies to take the respective gov ernments into their own hands , and bore an active part in framing and carrying into execution such a scheme in his native Province . In March , 1776 , the new constitution was adopted , and Rutledge was chosen President of South Carolina . In this capacity , an ample field for the exercise of his vast abilities was afforded . The triumphant defence of Charleston against Sir Henry Clinton 's army and fleet remains a glorious attestation to his courage and his wisdom . But in March , 1778 , two years after its adoption , the new constitution received a number of violent legislative stabs , and a substitute for it was presented to him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office . His successor , Arthur Middleton , was not more compliant , and it was not until Mr. Lowndes was elected that the bill was formally enacted into a law . But Carolina was not long destined to lose the services of her most eminent citizen . The invasion of Georgia , in 1778-9 , was an emergency that called for the utmost exertion , and , Governor Lowndes retiring , Mr. Rutledge was , on February 5th , 1779 , called to fill his place , with the concession to his council and himself of full power " to do everything that appeared to him and them necessary for the public good . " This power he did not hesitate to exercise to its utmost limit . When , in the ensuing May , Prevost besieged Charleston , Rutledge and his council // took the extreme step of proposing to the enemy that Carolina should remain neutral during the war , and with peace should follow the fortunes of the victor . Ill-advised as this step was , the folly of the British leader prevented any bad consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the siege . We would fain follow our author through the varied and troublous scenes that attended the path of Rutledge during the remainder of his constitutional term of office , but the scope of his duties was so wide and so various that the attempt would be vain . Nothing , nevertheless , could exceed the implicit confidence reposed in him by his fellow-citizens ; and so soon as he had retired from the gubernatorial chair , he was elected to represent them in the national Congress . His services in the sessions of 1782 and 1783 were neither few nor slight . Much was looked for at his hands ; much was performed . To his manful defence of their conduct in the negotiations for peace , Jay and his brother commissioners at Paris were not lightly indebted . No one denied to John Rutledge the keenest sense of personal honor , and when he declared that , so far from having acted underhandedly or dishonorably towards the French court , they had fulfilled their duties with such propriety , that , if recalled or censured by Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , even the indignant voice of the respectable Mercer became dumb . That these were the sentiments of reason , not of personal partiality , was evinced by his subsequent treatment of Mr. Jay . The ample fortune accumulated by Mr. Rutledge at the bar had , as may be supposed , been very thoroughly exhausted in the service of his country . When , in 1783 , he returned to Charleston , and endeavored to draw together the scattered threads of his private affairs , he found his library destroyed by the enemy . To a lawyer , his books are what fields are to the farmer , tools to the carpenter . Deprive him of these , and he may well say with Shylock : " You take my house , when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house ; you take my life , When you do take the means wherehy I live . " // State , he was , in 1787 , one of the delegates sent to Philadelphia , to found the present Constitution . His views on this occasion were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed by the test of time . This duty accomplished , he rendered a noble service to his own State , in procuring its speedy adoptioii of the Federal Constitution . On the first election for President of the United States , it being apprehended that the possible dereliction of one or two electors might give Mr. Adams the priority to Washington , the vote of South Carolina was bestowed , not upon Adams , but on her own favorite son , Chancellor Rutledge . When Jay was named as Chief Justice , Rutledge was appointed eldest of the puisnes of the Supreme Bench ; but ere he had either resigned his chancellorship or taken his seat on the federal bench , he was appointed to be Chief Justice of South Carolina . On this , he withdrew from both the other offices . Here his judicial conduct was able and dignified , unless we may except to the share he took in the public proceedings in regard to Jay 's Treaty . It is now well known that Washington , during Mr. Jay 's absence abroad , and anticipating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rutledge ; the latter replied that he would accept it , and was notified that on the 1st of July , 1795 , his commission would be made out . Notwithstanding this , and the knowledge he must have possessed that in his prospective seat it might easily become his task to maintain and to expound the provisions of this very treaty , we find Mr. Rutledge among its fiercest and most prejudiced assailants . It is not the part of a candid criticism to uphold such a course . We conceive it to have been irregular and improper ; and it was justly calculated to offend , as well as seriously to embarrass , the administration . Nevertheless , his commission was duly handed him , and he took his seat and entered on its duties . It was some months before Congress was to meet , and his name to go before the Senate for confirmation . Ere that day came around , his fate was decided ; his reason was hurled from her throne , and his mighty mind lay in ruins . His rejection by the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrowing and sympathizing hands .

If the labor be performed with a skill commensurate with that of which we have already had a sample , it will leave little to be desired . His first volume is indeed one of no ordinary interest , and of far more than ordinary trustworthiness . We do not observe in it , from beginning to end , a single misapplied fact or inaccnrate date . His language is clear and forcible , his reasoning philosophical and sound .

We take leave of Mr. Flanders in the confident expectation of hearing from him again with as much pleasure and as much profit as we have now received at his hands .
