Discussion of the Atonement and its incidents , by the Editor . Mionthly Religious iVfagazine and independent Journal , April , 1856 . Tins Quarterly contained , last November , the article on the relation of the Atonement to Holiness , which is placed first in // the preceding list . It had previously been delivered , by the appointment of the General Association of Connecticut , before the clergy who assemble at the Commencement exercises in Yale College . Although the nature of the topic precluded any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced by the following statements : " It is well in stating the atonement to distinguish between the fact and the theory . The fact of the atonement is this : That Jesus christ , God manifest in the flesh , by his life and his death , and especially by his death , has constituted a just ground of divine pardon for penitent and believing sinners-has done that , with which sinners , if repentant and loyal , may be justly pardoned , and without which , sinners , though repentant and loyal , can not be justly pardoned . In this general statement of the fact of atonement , all who are properly denominated evangelical , agree . And this , it may be added , is all that is essential , as it respects the atonement , to real and trustworthy orthodoxy . " When we come to the statement of the theory or philosophy of the atonement-of how it is that the life and death of Christ renders it just for God to forgive the penitent and believing sinner-we find light indeed in the Scriptures , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who honestly receive the Scriptures as the Word of God . Among the diverse theories on this point , that which seems to me most accordant with the Scriptural testimony , and with those principles of ethies , government and reason , which the Scriptures imply and confirm , while most benign in its bearing on the minds and hearts of men , is that which has been substantially held in New England by our denomination for the last sixty or seventy years ; viz , that the sacrifice of Christ renders God just in the pardon of the sins of the repentant , by being substituted for the remitted penalty , as an equivalent expression of the divine displeasnre at sin , and thus of the divine regard for the law , which forbids sin ; or , to go one step farther back , an equivalent expression of those divine attributes , particularly the divine justice , which dictated and found manifestation in the divine law and its penalty . " The correctness of the exposition , in respect to the belief of evangelical Christians , has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a single exception , which should scarcely be counted . The weekly organ of the Reformed Dutch Church has given a striking instance of its own perspicacity and candor by finding fault with Mr. IDutton for teaching that the life of Christ is a part of his atoning work . The Batavianized New Englaudman who conducts that journal with so much superserviceable zeal , does not seem to have become , as yet , sufficiently acquainted with the Old School Calvinism to know what it is on this point . The larger part of the article was occupied with showing the practical and religious influence of this great doctrine , and the whole was copied , with a kind and approving notice by the editor , into the Monthly Religious Magazine , which is conducted by Professor F. ID . Huntington , ID . ID. , of Harvard College , who has recently been appointed the stated Preacher to the University . lie introduced the piece with such commendations as these : // " We can do our readers no better service than to reprint entire Rev. Mr. Dutton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Association of Connecticut last July . It must be borne in mind that it received the evident and full approbation of that rather orthodox body ; though we are aware that to mention this circumstance will prejudice its reception with some persons whose liberality is rather in name than in reality . Others will not fail to be nourished by the trnths it so fervently proclaims , finding something there that meets their hearts , and gratified by the encouragement it gives to the hope that clear and consistent statements shall yet be found out for vital theological doctrines in which earnest Christian believers can agree . " The February number of the Monthly Magazine contained a letter from Rev. Dr. Hall , of Providence , II . I. , a distinguished divine of the Unitarian body , demanding Scriptural proof of the doctrine ; upon which letter , the editor founded remarks explanatory , and defensive of the doctrine therein assailed . Rev. Mr. Dutton rejoined to Dr. hall in the Magazine for March , with a fuller exposition of his views , and an abundant quotation of Scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from Dr. Hall , and also by an eminently instructive and suggestive view of the discussion , and of the spirit in which it had been received , from the pen of the editor . Dr. Hall affirms , if we understand him correctly , that there is nothing in the Bible which indicates that God could not pardon the penitent " of his own free grace , independently of all else . " We are content to leave him in the hands of his opponents , who certainly , thus far , need no foreign aid ; but it may not be amiss to indicate some difficulties which the conflicting statements of this Unitarian divine involve , lie intimates , or at least does not deny , that God may in the death of Christ have so vindicated his law , and maintained his righteous character , as to render pardon to the sinner on repentance a possibility . So we are compelled to interpret the following lan-guage : " Our faith is in God , our hope is in his mercy , and the mediation of his Son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and punishment , but from sin . Sin is the enemy we fear , the obstacle to be removed . If there be any other obstacle , it is not in man , and all say it is not in God . Where is it ? If God in Christ has already removed it , the way is open to the penitent and be lieving ; and if aught can make us penitent and believing , it is such love as God 's , such life and death as Christ 's . His death stands forth as no other event does in the world 's history , and exerts a power that nothing else has . That power is spiritual and for man . We say not , there can be no other power there ; but if there be , it is not for us to define . We ask not what repentance would be , or could do without Christ 's death and its influences . Enough to know that repentance , if genuine , will be accepted ; enough that it is essential . " - Mont hly Religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 , p. 256. // with Mr. IDutton 's clear exhibition of the obstacle to pardon , existing in the nature of justice , and in the necessities of God 's government , as expounded by the Divine Sovereign ,  --  can ingennously inqnire , with apparent ignorance , as to the exact position of this hindrance . Wherein lies the obstacle to the making yesterday tomorrow  --  or cansing two bodies to occupy at the same moment , the same space ? Wherein lies the obstacle to pardon without penitence ; to an absolnte remittance of all penalty ? Not in man , surely , and according to Dr. Hall 's theory of the Divine Being , not in God , save as he has revealed himself . The writer does not deny that the death of Christ may have an effect beyond mere indncement to repentance ; and he declares in the closing sentences , which we have italicised , that it is not for us to define its nature . So we afflrm* , and therefore look to the word of God for instruction . If , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress ,  - -  God has intimated that the death of his Son may be so related to the availability of repentence as Dr. Hall suggests : does not that of itself establish the nece8sity of such a provision ? For is it conceivable that a perfectly benevolent and infinitely wise being wonld permit unnecessary evil ; would give his only begotten Son to ignominy without a cause ; or for a reason which was not actually imperative ? We have never imagined that any nominal Christians attributed to the Deity a gratuitous love of suffering . Some of us believe that the continuance of the human race , in their fallen condition , was consequent on the eternal purpose of Jehovah to provide a ransom , " a lamb slain from the foundation of the world ; " that otherwise , neither sin nor repentance would have been possible to mankind , by reason of their non-existence ; and that the grace , manifested in Christ , exhibits the Divine love in that we are enabled , through the experience of trial , to attain a position loftier than the angels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper perdition of him who has despised this better covenant . We are , however , content to leave the matter with those who at present have it in charge , as we suspect that Dr. Hall will find his time abundantly occupied in answering the inquiries urged by Professor Huntington , at the conclusion of his remarks iu the latest number of the Magazine . We had a different design in alluding to the discussion , one which is of far more interest and importance to the majority of our readers . We are desirous of ascertaining the position of Professor Huntington in doctrinal belief , and the treatment which he deserves from the Christian communion to which // we belong . This inquiry is the more important because it concerns the principles of catholity and of Christian recognition , applicable to the particular case ; although the case itself has peculiar claims on our regard . Professor Huntington occupies a public position , of incalculable power over the religious convictions of the American people ; and we have a right , therefore , to a clear and candid avowal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his qualifications for the office which he sustains . Every parent who is desirous of educating his boy , has an interest in ascertaining the nature of that religious teaching to which he will be subjected in the oldest and wealthiest University of our land . Every true patriot is concerned with the principles which the ductile mind receives during its preparation for leadership in society . We conceive that the world has a right to be informed as to the opinions and convictions of au instructor , holding so elevated and commanding a station : that , where other men , with the natural reserve of a delicate sensibility , might guard their treasured faith in the privacy of their own souls , he is obliged to utter himself boldly , and to expect that his opinions will be discussed , and weighed , as a matter belonging to the common welfare ,  --  a public property . Never theless , under all this , there lies a broad and fundamental principle , which ought to be recognized , and which , wherever it is fairly received and permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstruct the conditions of Christian fellowship , by developing a church unity , not of form , but of spirit , the bond of a common life ,  --  the oneness of a Christian love , " till we all come in the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ . " A strange forgetfulness has crept over many Congregationalists in respect to the liberty unto which they are called , and we are glad of an occasion to remind our brethren of the catholicity of our ecclesiastical system , which is not a 8ect , but invites to its communion all truly Christian churches , anu em braces in its brotherhood all who manifest sincere love to ou* Lord Jesus Christ by witnessing a good confession . We have , therefore , an interest in this particular case , through its illustration of the general rules which should govern our church fellowship . The doctrine involved in these discussions is confessedly the central truth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other truths , and which , as accepted or rejected , decides in the estimation of evangelical minds , the Okri8tianity // of any system , and its consequent right to Christian recognition . We are to inquire , first , what Professor Huntington believes on this most fundamental of all doctrines ; and secondly , how he ought to be treated ? I. What does Professor Huntington believe in respect to the atonement made by Jesus Christ ? We propose to let him speak for himself , so that our readers may judge of his sentiments ; and we bespeak for him a candid hearing . 1-fe was not educated in an orthodox school of divinity , and has not been nurtured in the technical phrases and nomenclature which are the household words of our communion : but , on the other hand , he has been habituated to a distrust and misapprehension of these terms , and can not be expected , even if his ideas coincide with ours , to use the scientific expressions which convey to us a meaning different from that which they carry to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regard this as a disadvantage in an honest exposition of his faith , for we have always lamented the hieroglyphics in which theologians write , and have anticipated the restoration of the Saviour 's method of communicating truth in simple language , as one blessing of that glorious era which is yet to crown history in the triumph of the gospel . Yet we must recollect that Professor H. will not be likely to take the words of our catechism , and say , " Thus I believe , " - we might distrust him if he did ,  --  but that like a free , outspoken man , he will utter his own convictions in his own fashion , so that we can discern his real opinions , and judge him righteously . With these facts in mind , let us listen to the avowal of faith which is delivered in the confessions and discussions of this religious teacher . We commence with an article , written by the Editor in the Monthly Religious Macrazine for May , 1851 , on " The Divinity of Christ . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , also , as indicating that his sentiments have not been hastily adopted , but are the result of protracted study , and have been elaborated by the meditation and experience of years . We have no doubt that Protessor H. would now express himself even more fully , but enough is here recorded to satisfy the candid reader that the Author 's opinions are not Arian . " There are two prevalent apprehensions of the character and office of Jesus as Saviour of the world . One contemplates him as specially appointed to represent the perfection of humanity , meaning by humanity what we have hitherto known or conceived of the spiritual powers and possibilities in a human being . This view holds Jesus to have been a perfect man ; the cornpletest moral example and religious genius of our race ; exhibiting in his life and death the utmost that human excellence can do or be ; as showing the ul // timate achievement , thus far at least , of a man 's virtue , love , and faith ; and as having withdrawn his personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the communion of his followers is not literally a communion with him , but is only a commemorative observance for a Teacher living on earth in the past , but retired now into the heavens . " The other view regards Christ as showing forth not only a perfect humanity , but also the mind of the Deity ; representing God to man as well as man to himself ; being the express image of God 's person ; exhibiting , as in God 's behalf , through some union of nature with the Father , not explicable to us , the Divine forgiveness , justice , and mercy ; and reconciling alienated souls by manifesting God in his flesh . According to this doctrine , he survives in his church to this day , and will survive , not only by influence and memory , but by the presence of his person ; so that when , in the communion of faith , we draw near to him , he , though invisible , yet by the rich gifts of his Messiahship and by a felt benediction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in saying , without reference to any former opinions , that the latter of these two views appears to us , not only incomparably the most benignant and precious , but to stand towards the other in the relation of truth to error ; to be charged with inestimable benefits to our religious progress ; to be liable to fewer theological perversions , and less dangerous abuses ; and to need also that it be more distinctly asserted and impressed on our present habits of thinking , especially among the inquiring and the young . " - Monthly Bel . Meg. , Vol . VIII , pp. 224 , 225 . He appeals for the witness of this truth to " the Word , or the New Testament writings ; history , or the organic working of Christian life through the church ; and the Soul , with its intuitions and its wants . " The ablest and most conclusive representation of his convictions is to be found in his answers to certain theories , indicating what he denies , and affirming what he believes : " Objectors start other theories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our human nature there are capacities so noble , and traits so high , that we do Christ honor enough when we allow hini to possess an unprecedented and complete combination of them . We believe , on the contrary , that , in the essential peculiarity of his nature , Christ is as distinct from us as the spiritual nature in us is from the perishable ' - Monthly Bel . Keg. , Vol . VIII , p. 227 . " Another form taken by the argument for Christ 's simple humanity is this ,  - -  that every member of the human family is capable of certain lofty spiritual exercises , is visited by holy aspiration , has a moral sense that distinguishes between right and wrong , and can form ideas of truth , of justice , of holiness . ' These ideas and affections , it is argued , are God within us ; because they are in harmony with his character , and it is by them that we recognize his attributes . In Christ these moral ideas were held with peculiar clearness and power ; these spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , is held to satisfy all that language of Christ and his apostles where he is declared to be one with God , and to exhaust the meaning of those passages that attribute to him a quite superhuman nature , He had in him more of God than we , only by as much as he gave to those ideas and affections , possible to him and us alike , a fuller development than we . " - Monthly 1 ? el . Meg. , Vol . VIII , pp. 228 , 229 . " If our God were only an assemblage of abstract qualities ; if , instead of looking to him as a personal Friend and Father , we had regarded him as only an agglomeration of impersonal attributes , mercy , justice , wisdom , strength ; or if we refined away our feeling of trustful intimacy towards him into an intellectual conception of a Causative Principle ,  --  then the argument we have just noticed // might have some force with us . All that would be necessary to make God manifest , either in Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities or attributes in us ; and just in proportion to the degree in which they appeared , we should all be gods . But , if our view of God 's nature and man 's nature proceed according to another philosophy than this pantheistic one , we shall presently be satisfied , that though a man were strong , wise , just , and good , up to the full measure of the possibility of his nature , and such a pattern of all spiritual graces as should equal the Christian standard itself , yet he would be as far from participating in the essential and incomprehensible nature of the Deity as every other man ; simply because his constitution is human ; because , being human , he is made subject to certain limitations of ability ; and becau*se every finite being is psychologically separated by an impassable gulf from the Infinite . Christ , we believe , was not so separated . He was one with the Father , in a sense and a way that we can not be one with him ; united to him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as easy for faith to conceive as it is impossible for logic to define ; not contradicting the fact of his derivation from the Father , but forming a oneness between them which is at once the secret of the Mediatorship , the key to the gospel , the ground and hope of our final reconciliation with both : and , moreover , it is of the person ' of God that he is the express image . ' Our charter for the liberty of this inspiring doctrine is the whole tone pervading the New Testament , from the announcement of the Spirit to Mary the mother , That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end , ' - down to the last benediction of the Apocalypse , in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ . ' It is in the language express and general , it is in the breath and spirit , it is in the precept and the sanctions , of the whole Christian revelation . If you ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into that comprehensive declaration ,  - -  No man can come unto the Father but by me . ' We believe , therefore , we can not but believe ,  --  we are as unable as we are undesirous to doubt ,  --  that , in regard to that deep , wide line that distinguishes the Infinite from the finite and the Divine from the human , Christ the Redeemer does not stand by his nature on the human side . We discover no way in which an estranged , lost family on earth , not knowing God by all its wisdom , and condemned by a law which it had not power or will to keep , could be raised , restored , and justified , but by one who should bring the Deity to the earth , while he lifts up man towards Deity . The Redeemer must make God manifest in the flesh , mediate between heaven and humanity , show us the Father to move and melt the child . " - Zifonthly Rel . Mag. , Vol . VIII , pp. 231 , 232 . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith , although the animus of the entire production can not be apparent as in the eloquent whole . These few blossoms will show the nature of the mind , whose fruit was then but forming , and which we trust may long continue to ripen rich earthly harvests , before transplanted to the Paradise of God and of the Lamb . We ask , now , what would an honest man suppose to be the views in respect to the Divinity of Jesus Christ , held by one who employed the preceding language ? Is there an intelligent member of our evangelical churches who would not say , " This is not Unitarianism-this is what I believe ; the author agrees in my interpretation of the New Testament doctrine ? " Who will hesitate in avowing that such an impression is iievitably conveyed by these passages ? // Enter a heresy hunter . " This sounds well  --  but you must not trust to plausible words-has Mr. Huntington anywhere , signed the Savoy Confession , or ever avowed faith in the Nicene Creed ? These words are line , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing tendency on the part of Unitarian ministers to clothe their false doctrines in the garb of orthodoxy : - IMir . Huntington still occupies a Unitarian pulpit , and we must interpret him by his posiMon , not by his phrases . " We can not adopt this opinion , or libel any man who publishes a serious conviction in a serious manner , as a deceiver and a hypocrite . Mr. Huntington has told his own associates , that he does not agree with them , that he believes , not in a mere exalted manhood , nor in a divinity common to human nature , but in the essential Divinity of Jesus Christ , separating him from ns by an infinite difference ;  --  and we dare not brand him as false , when there is no inducement for hii* to blind our judgment , and no proof of the intention , but only a morbid suspicion of it . We protest against that rigid and bigoted misconstruction of free outspoken men , which has so long built walls of mud between those who are included in one glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us give an earnest speaker credit for what lie says , unless we can prove him false ; and when he affirms the essential truth , let us be willing to acknowledge the fact , and not hold out the dry husk and bid him swallow that , before we will recognize that he has the inner meat . The miserable practices of an effete diplomacy have too long marred the discussions of theology , and we trust the time is coming , when there shall be personal conferences , where men may communicate ideas , instead of jealous dispatches full of empty words . Mr. Huntington 's avowal in these quotations must satisfy every impartial judge that he is orthodox in this doctrine , untIl he denies the obvious interpretation ; and in the light of these declarations we are to examine his later expositions of a doctrine equally essential . We have already shown that the accuracy of the definition which was contained in the sermon copied by Prof. H. into his magazine , was conceded in the endorsement which speaks of " the truths it so fervently proclaims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope , that clear and consistent statements shall yet be found out for vital theological doctrines , in which earnest Christian believers can agree . " This was addressed to Unitarians , and is therefore to be judged from their stand-point . How could they understand such a recommendation , except , as // they have understood it ; an acknowledgment that the statements contained in that discourse in respect to this vital theological doctrine , are sound and trustworthy ? Can any fair minded man , who assumes the honesty of the Editor , arrive at any other decision ? But we are not left to this inference , incontrovertible unless by the imputation of views and habits to Prof. H. , which would unfit for virtuous society . The progress of the discussion has induced the Editor to express himself yet more clearly in harmony with the doctrine of the discourse , by essaying its defense with a heartiness , and an assurance , that prevents all hesitation in regard to the sincerity of the champion . We quote a few of the many passages , prefacing these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written to be read as a confession of faith before an ecclesiastical council , by a candidate for the Gospel ministry ; but are the free utterance of a religious teacher to those who disbelieve the truth , or misunderstand the faith of others . Nor are we to expect that Prof. Huntington will constrain his thoughts into the precise mould of another 's brain ; he would not be worth regarding if lie did , since we should prefer the original , and not the copy . What then has he said ? The February number of the Monthly IReligious Magazine contained , as has been already stated , a letter from Rev. Dr. Hall , objecting to the doctrinal views in Mr. Dutton 's discourse , and to this letter the editor appended remarks . lie commenced with disabusing his readers from some erroneous impressions of the orthodox doctrine , and then proceeded : " But it is not to be denied that the view commonly called Orthodox , and presented by Mr. Dutton , differs from the proper Unitarian view ; and a large part of our interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutton 's defense , we should be glad to bespeak for the system he represents a new and unprejudiced inquiry among liberal people . The idea may be briefly stated , we think , thus : Christ died for the world , because it was not consistent with the rectitude , the wisdom , and the mercy , of the divine government , that those who had broken its laws should be treated as if they had not broken them , without such a suffering ; while the divine method , including such suffering and such a Sufferer , opens a consistent way for the pardon and acceptance of the sinner , with no detriment to the sanctities of law , and no danger of loosening the foundations of a righteous judgment , and , at the same time , affords a signal and glorious manifestation of spiritual love . Now , d priori , what moral or logical objection lies against this statement ? Is it not for God to determine for himself the way in which he will carry forward the administration of the universe , accomplish his beneficent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his promises , insulted his affections , and plunged away from him ? hf we , with our shortsightedness , our ignorance , our enfeebled faculties , and , in fact , belonging to the guilty party , should undertake to set up a better method of our own , is it not likely we should commit some blunder ? Still , it is said , the method must seem to comport with our ideas of rectitude and // 305 reason , or else we can not refer it to God . Is either rectitude or reason compromised , then , by this doctrine Whom does it wrong ? Not God , who originates it . Not Christ , who voluntarily and joyfully-out of his divine sympathy with man 's misery , and longing for his deliverance , and prevision of the sublime issue-undertakes it . Not man himself , who , if he will comply with the simple conditions , accept what is offered him , and give his faith to the Redeemer , is thereby saved , notwithstanding his offenses . Not the abstract principles of right and truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor compulsion of the unwilling , nor forcing the innocent into the place ? * the guilty : but all is the moral working of a moral administration , according to the laws of a moral Governor and of moral impression on the governed ; and the whole is supposed to be openly declared beforehand . What says reason ? We confess we are at a loss to discover any rational process which runs against man 's being pardoned and saved through Christ 's sufferings which would not run against his being pardoned and saved on any condition whatever , so long as those sufferings are voluntary , represent to us the very highest possible instance of disinterested goodness , and release no single offender without the penitence , trust , holy effort , and entire spiritual state , which qny plan of salvation must contemplate , superadding the most interesting and endearing relations to a personal divine Deliverer . And the logical value of a system which provides some sort of moral equivalent for the universal violation of a perfect law , in the balance of a complete government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system which leaves mediation out , and sayr , merely , Obey my law in every thing ; but then , if you do not , if you break it with all your might , and only repent afterwards , you shall be treated just as if you had done what I commanded . ' But if any one without pretending to adduce strictures either of reason or equity , simply rejects the doctrine of the atonement because it does not happen to appear necessary to him , such an attitude would seem to imply nothing but vanity and impiety . We understand the Letter ' as asking why one should believe the death of Christ necessary to the pardon of sin . It strikes us that one very obvious reason for believing so is that Christ has died . That sacrifice could hardly have been a work of supererogation . But we can go farther ,  --  can we not ? We can suppose the Almighty to have said thus : Of my omniscience , I know that such is the constitution of man , such is the organization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human race , that to pardon the repenting sinner without a divine mediation , would , on the whole and in the wide result , prove a lax rule of government . Unlawful advantage would be taken of that indulgence . Either sin would take encouragement , or despair would palsy effort . Lo ! my beloved Son comes forth , by his own free suffering ,  --  the just for the unjust , the sinless for the sinful , the divine with the human ,  --  to confirm the holy demands of the law , and , at the same time , to hold out gentle and inviting terms of release . See in this how sacred and awful is the majesty of the commandment ! how much is suffered for it ! Accept , believe him in that character , and thou shalt be saved ! ' Is there anything repulsive , irrational , opposed to the character of God , in this ? We may not be iible , by our poor definitions , to tell completely how this redemption acts to open the way ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have not known the Saviour 's name , or that lived before he was manifested in the flesh . It would be strange if our thoughts or words could exhaust such a mystery . But may we not still feel assured , that , as an organic whole , the divine administration so embraces this element of mediation , that all ages and lands and accepted souls shall feel its influence , and share finally in its blessing ? That righteous heathen not knowing Christ here , should yet be saved through him , is no more inexplicable , than that righteous heathen , not knowing God the Father , should be saved by him . " - Monthly Rel . Mag . and md . Journal , Vol . XV , pp. 112 , 115. // ile quoted passages of Scripture which he presumed would be cited in defense of this doctrine , adding his own impressions . " Now , as one ponders the singular force and directness and agreement of these passages , and very many more of the same import , and marks their cumulative power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will not be strange if he feels that on those who believe with the author of the Letter ' rests the burden of explaining how , according to the Bible , the death of Christ is not the divinely ordained and essential ground of human salvation , and that something possessing vitality , energy , and power , has been left out of the system which confines the efficacy of that death to the noble but incidental influence of a consistent martyrdom . There is some reason to think that passages like those we have quoted have become comparatively unfamiliar to Unitarian ears , by having been dropped out of Unitarian preaching , under a natural persuasion that they do not harmonize with the Unitarian theory . " The Sermon is objected to , as using language which implies that God died . We have no wish to defend any such language , on the score of taste or reverence or theological accuracy . We think it would be a gain if the orthodox pulpit and press were to drop it . It has no clear scriptural sanction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is any Unitarian wild enough to assert or imagine that any Calvinist blasphemously supposes the eternal and self-existent Almighty One to be dead ? What then ? Why , we must patiently sit down , and try to find out exactly what the languaged oes mean , and , after this kind appreciation , seek , if we will , to dissuade its authors from repeating it , for the reason that other language , better and less offensively , expresses that meaning . We suppose the idea to be this : Christ , whose nature is God 's nature , took upon himself a human body and a human experience , and , in that body , passed through the suffering and dissolution which we call death , fulfilling thereby his great work of redeeming man , and re-entered into his everlasting and heavenly glory , lifting the dying world with him , leading captivity captive , and , by his infinite condescension , bringing many sons unto glory . The central thought is , that the recovery of sinning man was wrought out , as it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's behalf . There is an unutterable strength in the tenderness of the entreaty pronounced by such suffering . It moves the soul as nothing else in the universe can move it . This conviction has become so full and so dear to many minds of Unitarian education , that we have repeatedly heard of late , from some of their best preachers , such statements as that the redemption of the sinner was costly to the mind of God . ' There is a transcendent philosophy , an adorable adaptation of boundless love and wisdom to human wants , in that mystery . The writer of the Letter ' will not question that the Scripture says , God was in Christ , ' nor that Emmanuel , his name , signifies God with us ; ' and yet Christ did die . In all reasonableness we must acquit the Sermon-as indeed the Letter is inclined to-of intending literally to teach that death or destruction took effect upon the Divine Being . It is to be hoped , too , that the resources of liberal logic will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Unitarian polemics , to the effect that Orthodoxy makes Jehovah to have perished to appease his own anger , inasmuch as it purchases a complacent conceit at the expense of a double falsehood . As an ironical satire on an in felicitous style of Orthodox rhetoric , it is more justifiable . " How far the governmental aspect of the atonement presented in the Sermon can be made efficient for producing repentance and holiness , through the public discourse of the pulpit , depends much , we presume , on*personal gifts , affinities , habits of speech , education , and the traditional impressions of congregations . Wherever it is so set forward as to intensify man 's abhorrence of guilt , and heighten the sanctity of God 's law , its effect is not only practical , but , as it seems to us , edifying to the last degree . Why any one should be startled or disturbed at its being held as the firm and vindicatory background of justice in // the representation of God 's boundless love , is something we can not understand . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preaching of the cross will always be realized most perfectly where-theories apart  --  the death of Christ is most simply and affectingly held forth as the one supreme and matchless exhibition of the love of God-his pity , his long suffering , his desire for man 's salvation . When the doctrine has been properly guarded against abuse , by showing its harmony with the immutable laws and equities of the divine character , its manward action must always be of principal , immediate interest to the soul needing redemption . To move , to melt , to change , to save , the hard and selfish heart , Christ died ; and without that death is no remission . That eternal Mind should have foreseen , from the beginning , that , by this system of Messianic redemption , powers , affections , spiritual agencies , would be laid hold of , and brought into glorious exercise , through all time , which other . wise could not be reached , seems to us not only possible , but singularly according to our own experience and the inspired word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude before the plan , instead of caviling and doubting ? We know not how others may be struck with the testimonies of history : but for ourselves , as we turn back on the line of holy witnesses since the first age , as we take up biography after biography , study life after life , follow saint after saint to his victory and his rest , and thus grow intimate with the great fellowship of wise , strong , unyielding , and mightily gifted thinkers and believers of the church , and listen to the almost undivided voice of confession and faith coming up from the innumerable company , declaring Christ Jesus and him crucified the ground of their hopes , and his sufferings the great pledge of par . don ,  --  with only here and there a different doctrine , falling in coGler accents from some exceptional tongue ,  --  we readily own that we must reconsider whether there is not some element of blessed power here that Unitarianism has overlooked or thrown away .

Could the cordial , unsolicited , and intelligent agreement of a mind with a doctrine be more forcibly presented ? The moral effect of such testimony far outweighs any monosyllabic response to a fixed formula , and settles beyond a doubt the faith of the writer , whose sincerity is eloquently exhibited in the closing passages , which reveal his convictions , as through the glowing eye and beaming look , and frank utterance of an honest transparent countenance , the heart shines to gladden the beholder. - " Now , we are fully mindful that none of our statements on this great subject may be adequate , or even correct ; nay , we remember that the truth itself may not be seen by any of us as it will yet be seen by eyes of purer vision , or as it really is .

Unless we entirely misapprehend the expreB. sions and tendencies of Unitarian belief , there is a growing demand in that quarter for views of the work of Christ which reach beyond the old standards , which promise a profounder peace to the heart , and which , while they magnify the cross , attach a more valid and sufficing efficacy to the whole mediato. rial humiliation and spiritual sacrifice of the Son of God . How this demand is to be satisfied is not , perhaps , altogether clear . That it is to be by going to the New Testament with a simple and childlike confidence , and not to ecclesi. astical creeds , we are very sure . After all , it is in our purest and highest de // votional moods that the language of the cross becomes most natural and unquestionable to us ; and that which we stumble at in cool debate , we take up with eager and delighted acceptance in prayers and hymns . Should it prove that a ground can ultimately be found where such minds as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand together , we shall not mourn nor be frightened , but rejoice and take courage , thanking God . It is to be hoped that no portion of the Unitarian denomination will draw itself up into an attitude of impatience or protest at these inquiries ; partly because such a course would be unworthy of the antecedents and pretensions of a liberal body , and partly because it would be feeble and ineffectual in its results . We live too late to be told again the imbecile lie that truth can be protected by restricting earnest and right-hearted thought on any side ; and the liberality which is liberal only to the side of laxity , but bigoted towards the ancient forms of faith , is a kind we do not covet . If there are any of our readers who are displeased the moment the infallibility of Channing , or of a sect , is called in question , we must wish them well , and pass on .

Meg. and md . Journal , Vol . XV , pp. 119 , 120 . The Monthly Religious Magazine for April contains another letter from Dr. Hall in reply to Mr. Dutton 's argument from *Scriptnre sustaining the orthodox doctrine ; and Prof. Huntington again rejoins with further explanations of the views held by our divines , and then alludes to the spirit in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unitarian denomination . In this connection he states his own purpose and agency in the matter . " When we opened our columns , three months ago , to a fresh consideration of the great truth of the atonement , by republishing a sermon , on the Orthodox side , which we had both heard preached and read through with edification , we did it with a desire to contribute something to a real and legitimate concern in the great central theme of the New Testament ,  --  the bringing of sinners to God by Christ . We did it , in a belief-which is not weakened , but strengthened , every day-that the views on that subject , ordinarily offered from Unitarian pulpits ,  --  let them be stated as they will ,  --  are unsatisfactory , in the extreme , to many who hear them ; it being almost always found , that when Unitarian writers go on from their own statements of the doctrine to quote scriptural passages in support of them , the scriptural passages seem to mean more a d something other than the original statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that since the old controversy , a generation of persons has come forward that would be interested in an earnest presentation of the topic . We did it , in a very full and well founded conviction that Unitarian Congregations are often little informed , if not misinformed , as to the actual sentiments of Orthodox men ; and it might thus be well to let one of them speak for himself . We did it , because the sermon we selected was not conceived in a dogmatical vein , but in one that is practical and spiritual . We did it , yet more , because we // are wholly convinced , that , in the secret substance of the view there presented , there is a truth and a power not technical , nor mechanical , nor commercial , nor dogmatical , but spiritual , quickening , encouraging , and comforting  --  a truth and power which may not yet have been drawn out in the most perfect language , nor set into the widest relations , nor made impressive to all sincere minds ; but , nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a germ of divine and sanctifying energy , which will yet be a tree for the healing of the nations . And we did it also , as we briefly hinted at the time , because , if this should prove to be true , then the frequent and candid declaration and comparison of honest men 's thoughts upon it might lead on , in God 's good time , to a more fraternal , Christian unity among the followers of the Lord Jesus .

We refrain from copying , for-though the chastisement must be eminently healthful to those for whom it was administered-we remember the injunction , not to behold the mote in our brother 's eye . Orthodox men have some sins of their own on the side of uncharitableness , which we will endeavor to distingnish before we are through . The closing paragraph is , however , most pertinent . " Let us leave these discouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Unitarian denomination , quite unworthy of its professions , of its opportunities , of its fathers , of the age , of the country , of Christendom ,  --  hoping never again to return to a subject so disagreeable . If the discussion that has been begun shall be continued , we venture to suggest that attention be given especially to the three following points ,  --  on no one of which , so far as we know , has a very full or clear statement been made by Unitarian writers : 1 . How are we to account for the extraordinary signs of suffering and solitude and agony of spirit , in the Son of God , at his cruciflxion ,  --  the marvelous cries of Gethsemane and Calvary ,  --  unless , in some surpassing and dread experience , he there felt the weight of human iniquity pressing on his soul ?

If it is true , as , with the last degree of amazement , we have lately heard some of our distinguished divines say they believe it is , that God , in the death of Christ , in some holy and profound sense , does not suffer ' with us and for us , then wbat is the meaning of those many passages of Scripture which declare that God spared not his own Son ; ' that he freely gave him up for us ; ' that he so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son ? ' Is the Christian 's God a Being of feelings , emotions , sympathies , making voluntary sufferings and sacrifices for us in his infinite grace , or not ? Or , in brief , what do we mean when we pray , Our Father ? " ' - Monthly Rel. ifag. and lad . Journal , VoL XV , p. 271 . Assuming that Prof. TTnntington is a man of common honesty , and is able to make himself understood ; which we imagine his worst enemy would not pretend to dispute , we would // ask in all sincerity , whether he has not in these pages identified his own views , with those which are conceded to be the evangelical belief on the doctrine of the atonement ? He has explained the theory , and separated it from the false impntations which have been attached to it ; he has defended the theory thns explained , most vigorously , and that to unbelievers ; and he has avowed that in it he recognizes the truth , although like all thoroughly Christian scholars he is ready to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these stupendons mysteries ; hoping , that , in the future , yet more of the marvelous wisdom and love of God in the plan of salvation may be discovered . Prof. Huntington discloses his opinion of sin as from its nature and enormity deserving the wrath of God , and requiring an exhibition of the Divine abhorrence to render its pardon justifiable , even in the penitent . He accepts Mr. I ) utton 's statement , which is so widely confessed to be a full and fair definition of the orthodox belief . Those who always judge of a man by his associates , who would not acknowledge a nightingale in a flock of crows to be anything but a crow because of his company , and no matter how sweetly he sang would prononnce it a caw , may feel themselves not relieved exactly , but compelled to examine and decide what the man is , when they are informed that he most distinctly disavows the Unitarian connection . He appended to the February number of his Monthly the title " Independent Journal , " with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number thus explains his independence . " Denominations , now-a-days , strangely overlap each other , and get mixed . To be clear of all sects is not to stand between any two , nor to court the favor of any . Our own aversion to the Unitarian name , and our desire to be independent of it , arises partly from a belief that that term is not a description of our religious convictions on several important points , and partly from a settled distrust of the general influence of the sectarian measures it covers , rather than from any want of friendship for its men , or of appreciation of its freedom . " - Monthly Bel . Mag . and lad . Journal , Vol . XV , pp. 266 , 261 . We have thus endeavored faithfully to expose the published belief of a religions teacher on a topic , which is by the confession of all Christians , the foundation of Christian truth , that which the evangelical mind has decided to be the test of Christianity . We have no personal acquaintance with the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which belongs to every truth-loving member of the community , either in his belief or in his treatment , but beyond his particular case , though that has a peculiar claim to notice , there lies a broad encircling principle , which demands to be enforced , and which is the law of Christian charity . Assuming then the essential orthodoxy of // Prof. Huntington on the doctrine of the atonement , we arrive at the second inquiry ,  --  in regard to his treatment . II . Shall a minister in Prof. Huntington 's present position be received into our fellowship ? We prefer to discuss this question in the concrete , because the matter is thus fairly before the mind , and contains all the force of the parable in illustrating a general principle . We have also in the actual treatment , which he has received , a sufficient justification of remarks that might otherwise be deemed needless , or perhaps slanderous . We have nothing to do with the course that the Unitarian community may choose in respect to their former associate , for we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to employ his own figure , that it would be difficult to expel from a heuse without sides ; but we have clearly marked boundaries , a city with foundations and walls : - shall we welcome him as a fellow-citizen ? A considerable number , both of pastors and laymen , are still active in the Orthodox Congregational Churches of IMlassachusetts , who remember the bitterness of that exodus , when for conscience 's sake and the Gospel 's they were obliged to forsake the sanctuaries where they were baptized , and in weakness and poverty to erect anew the house of prayer , and to sustain through much affliction the faith delivered to the saints . They still feel sorely the wrongs which they then endured , and regard with especial sorrow of heart , that ancient university whose funds they esteem misappropriated , and whose religious character they lament , as the child mourns over the footfall of a strange owner crossing the threshold of the homestead where he was born , and whose every chamber is consecrated by a separate association , awakening reverence and affection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced , while ministers employed the old forms of speech , and the covenant was unchanged , they will naturally be suspicious of any , who have been associated with the communion that denies , in their apprehension , both Christ and his cross . We sympathize in their hesitation , and agree with them in the declaration , that there is a radical distinction between the Unitarian and the Orthodox belief , which precludes the latter from fellowship with the former . He who denies the essential Deity of the Messiah , who virtually affirms t1*at man can save himself , and that sin does not require a Divine mediator , and an atoning sacrifice , has not in our apprehension accepted the Gospel of Jesus Christ , and without enmity , but as true to our own convictions , we must decline his fellowship or communion . // He does not so confess Christ as to give us evidence of discipleship . All New England knows , though some Presbyterians seem to be ignorant of the fact , that this is the faith and practice of Orthodox Congregationalists ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as earnest in the duties and as sound in the essential doctrines of the New Testament , as any other ecclesiastical communion of like extent . We know what we believe , and we have a clear , well defined confession , not in one set of words , but in a common unity of faith , which distingnishes our fellowship above the constrained bond of forms or letters . Nevertheless to those who are naturally prejudiced against any evangelical sentiment from the lips of one who has been associated with Unitarians , regarding such , as the Scotch covenanters regarded the king 's soldiers , we have something to say in the way of expostulation . Prof. Huntington has not come to you , suing for admission and protection ; but he has in a manful spirit addressed his old companions by a free and frank avowal of disagreement with their opinions . He does not ask to publish in our periodicals his confession of faith ; but he publishes our confession in his own Monthly , for the benefit of his Unitarian friends , and explains and defends its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy and recognition , which those fathers of our churches had , who left their own communion at the commencement of the present century , and sundered their ancient associations at the expense of personal ease and consideration ? Let any one , who wishes to be informed of the parallel , peruse the strictures on Prof. H. in the Unitarian papers , or read his own remarks on the discussion . Moreover he is coming forth from his childhood 's faith , and from all his earlier habits of religions belief ; while those with whom we have compared him , only separated from their friends and teachers , because the latter avowed doctrines which they had not imagined them to hold ; doctrines , which were directly at variance with the public confession of the churches where they ministered . Ought not the memory of that severe trial to quicken the generous yearning for a mind that is struggling to obtain the truth , and brave enough to accept and avow it wherever discerned ? By the recollection of their own afflictions , which were endured in the conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods , or the severing of the tenderest ties , in comparison with the honor of their Lord ,  --  and which have already been transformed into crowns of glory ; - we entreat these fathers of our Israel to be true to their own history , in the treatment of any , who , like them , though under heaver burdens , are mounting Zionward . Another class , perhaps more numerous , are willing that such // earnest minds should achieve their own deliverance , and when they have landed on terra firma will congratulate them on their escape from the whirlpool ; but while they observe the endeavors of these souls , will not help them by the lifting of a forefinger , or even so much as a cry of encouragement . The majority of believers in our churches are not in a position to observe or to aid the struggle , and they do well to wait ; but for Christian teachers , and pastors , who have the means of forming an opinion , who can help by kindly explanation and generous sympathy , to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes open to see how the struggle will end , is in our thought both cowardly and dishonorable , although it may be safe . We are placed just where we are , not only to hold our own opinions , but to aid others on to the true foundation ; and he who fearing for his character or reputation , dares neither to cheer and guide an inquiring mind to truth , nor to acknowledge one who in his judgment maintains a sound doctrine , is to be classed with the man who would not save a human life from the waves for fear of wetting his coat . The pastor , who is unable to speak the truth and express his convictions in regard to a Christian brother , through dread of the influence on his position , should immediately unite with a presbytery that will help to prop his tottering foundations , or place himself under the watch arid guardianship of a diocesan bishop , since he is not fit to be a Congregational pastor . There is however a third class , and we speak advisedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more narrow and bigoted than themselves , and who are ever glancing with wistful eyes towards the constraints of severer creeds and more unintelligible dogmas . Their idea is , that since Christians are separate from the rest of the world , the more rigid and narrow the division , so much the more of Christianity is contained in a sect , forgetting , that the progress of the Redeemer 's kingdom must embrace an increasing proportion of the human family , until at last there shall be one fold , and one shepherd . Those who hold this view are naturally suspicious of any who advance toward them from heresy , or even from a rank whose orthodoxy is somewhat questionable , and immediately begin to repent of the unconscious liberality , which has induced these enquirers to hope for sympathy in their yearning after truth , and to expect a charitable examination of their doubts . The only way of obtaining the favor of this school is by denouncing their creed , as not up to the correct standard , since then they hunibly own their errors and plead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caricature , but a plain , unadorned portrait , is abundantly verified by the history of certain recent theological discussions , // and also by the strictures with which , in certain quarters , the declarations of Prof. Huntington have been received . We have a simple word of advice to all such , and that is , to withdraw at once from Congregationalism . The genius and history of this ecclesiastical system is so thoroughly antagonistic to such a spirit , that it is impossible to find a cell in its broad , free landscape for the imprisonment of a soul who can not venture abroad and must needs be confined within monastic walls . A class , uneasy if they are associated with any who are suspected of variation from the letter of the standard , can not coinfortably continue , where each church has its own confession ot faith , and must be judged by its principles , rather than by its forms of speech ; where it is impossible to depose a minister of Christ who retains the confidence of the church , and of the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points on which his error will not even in the view of his opponents exclude him from the society of the redeemed . We may as well own it before the world , that our system hinders all interference with the free and honest differences of Christian minds in their examinations of truth ; that it is impracticable to make all our churches sign precisely the same articles of faith ; that men in our order can and will think for themselves , and that it is impossible so to constrain Congregationalism , that it will banish from its communion , or exclude from its fellowship any who give good evidence of their oneness with Christ . Those who are anxious to be orthodox in the method we have depicted , should immediately betake themselves to some denomination where they can enjoy sectarian privileges , make everybody swear by a fixed formula , and indulge themselves in citations for heresy against any who differ in the slightest from the letter of the book of discipline . It would diminish greatly their temptations , if they would attach themselves at once to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest number of devout Christians , since they will not then be so likely to hanker after a narrower platform . We can readily perceive that the frank and manly inquiries of a devout mind among Unitarians would terrify such a class , and that they would proclaim their entire and absolute distrust of every endeavor after triXth , and their determination to convince this inquirer that he could not be countenanced , until he had yassed them , and was beyond their position in orthodoxy . What throbbings of heart , and trembling of knees there have been , when a voice of encouragement or a helping hand has been proffered from the Orthodox Congregationalists to some brother , who was striving to know the mind of Christ , as if our character would not endure such a strain of Christlike love and // aid ? Are we not already regarded with doubt by the divines of ecclesiastical organizations who boast their orthodoxy ; does not Princeton shake its head with sadness ; and even New York nod , in ludicrous imitation of its senior , over the laxity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world believe ) of New England Theology ? Can we stand under the terrible charge of countenancing a teacher , who does not belong to a denomination , and who is only to be judged by his Christian belief as expressed in his free way and without conventional exactness ? Those who have no confidence in principles , and whose reliance is human approbation , may well be frightened , lut those whose faith is in God and his word , need not be alarmed . The denominations , who with Pharisaic pride are boasting their orthodoxy , may as well be told once for all that they contain within their boundaries less of purity and of intelligent devotion to the great doctrines of the Bible , than the Orthodox Congregational churches of New England . We beg for no other support , either 8piritual or temporal , from our brethren abroad , whom yet with Christ*ian charity we are willing to recognize so far as we discern in them a readiness to acknowledo*e the essential truths of the Gospel , the Divinity of Christ , the atoning expiation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peculiar views of particular churches with whom we hold fellowship , any more than for the distinguishing logmas of the Methodist or Baptist churches , or for the limited atonement of the Presbyterians , all of whom we recognize as disciples of Christ whose venial errors we commiserate with a Christian charity . Prof. Huntington proclaims himself a believer in the essential Divinity of Christ , and in the orthodox exposition of his atoning sacrifice , with the consequent conception of sin and its demerit . We on our part , not making the churches responsible for our action , but as individual members of Christ , welcome him as a brother , so far as he has expressed his sentiments , and stand ready to extend to him the tokens of our hearty fellowship . When we discover that he rejects an essential doctrine of the Gospel , we shall be as frank and free in our withdrawal of confidence , but while he approaches us with evangelical sentiments on the most essential points , we will not maintain the undignified , unchristian , and cowardly attitude of driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear that our character may suffer in the eye of others , from such confederation . That must be a very slim orthodoxy , which is overturned by such catholicity : it can be nothing but a pole , strait , bare , and dead , little resembling the living truth of Christ rooted in eternity , whose broad boughs shelter and nourish all the redeemed .
