txt THE AMERICAN DEER : ITS HABITS AND ASSOCIATIONS . nv T. 13 . TnORPE . NO animal , native to our continent , is better known or more generally appreciated than the common deer . His form is exquisitely beautiful , his habits simple and delicate , and , as game affording employment for the hunter and amusement for the sportsman , he is of all other animals the most universally popular . The deer tribe is diffused entirely over the continent , and in the extremes of north and south varies but very little in its general appearance ; for the largest found in the swamp regions of the Lower Mississippi and the best specimens of Upper Canada will average about the same size . Their general appearance varies , however , in particular localities ; and the experienced hunter will tell , by looking at the carcass , the kind of country " in which it has run . " A deer living habitually in the highlands never attains the magnificent proportions of one occupying a low , wet region . This is because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a general thing , whether in Maine or Florida , a deer that weighs two hundred pounds is considered of a large size ; but they have reached , or weighed , two hundred and fifty , and even three hundred pounds . In summer the animal is of a deep red color , and unfit for food . In winter he changes to a grayish blue , and is then in perfection . From the fact of this diversity of appearance Buffon was led astray by his correspondents , and was induced to say that there were two species of American deer , designated by the changes in color . which regularly take place in the same PLA5N AND ama OF CORINTH. // animal . If any exceptions occur to the colors named , they may be looked upon as unnatural . There was found once in Louisiana a pet deer pure white , marked with red spots . Also in the same region a pure white buck was often seen and pursued , but we are not aware that it was ever killed ; while , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were caught in the Rocky Mountains , and nfterward exhibited in some of our Western cities . A general peculiarity of the deer species is , that , with rare exceptions , they renew their horns annually . The American deer usually sheds his antlers in the months of May and June . At these times the bucks have been met with one antler gone , and shaking their heads discontentedly , as the weather grows warm and the blood increases in the rapidity of its circulation . At this time also the doe drops her young , and both male and female may be said to have retired for the time being from strife , the buck burying himself in the deep fastnesses of the woods , and the doe , by a beautiful arrangement of nature , protected for a while from the pursuit of the hounds by giving out no scent , thus being left in comparative peace to foster its helpless young . The place of separation of the old horn from the head at first is very tender , but the spot is soon covered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The determination of the blood to the head , which preceded the displacement of the old antlers , seems suddenly to increase , and becomes more intense in proportion to the demand for the enormous secretions required for the new growth . The budding horn first makes its appearance in a soft pulpy mass , protected by a velvety covering ; the development goes rapidly on , the increase of every few hours being clearly perceptible . Those who have had an opportunity of grasping these incipient weapons of defense realize a startling idea of the animal heat required by nature to forge them , for they throb , and glow , and swellthe very incarnation of reproducing life . The antlers are , finally , complete , and the buck is said to have a velvety head . The external surface now rapidly hardens , compresses the blood-vessels , and obstructs the circulation , and suddenly the whole of the once sensitive integuments lose their vitality , leaving a perfectly formed insensible weapon . The buck , who up to this moment has sought the deepest recesses of the forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects , now comes forth and confidently prepares for future action . The velvety covering has performed its office , and now only mars the beauty of the growth beneath . That the weapons may be polished the buck commences rubbing them against the surrounding trees ; the " peels " are thus torn off , and are often seen dangling to the bark and lacerated limbs . At last the new horn is left naked and burnished , and the animal stands perfect before you in all his pride of strength . It is now a charmin0 sight to behold him at early morn snuff the fresh air , look around with the mien of a monarch , and then , in the mere wantonness of his strength , dig his horns into the green turf and shake the uprooted grass and disturbed earth over his glossy sides . As the season advances he will spring at the lower boughs of the trees and entangle his antlers in the meshes of thrifty vines , or loaded oaken boughs , shaking the rich grapes or budding acorns plentifully at his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its prongs or antlers , are not necessarily indications of the size and age of the animal , although such is the common tradition . A yearling buck has one straight prong , and is termed a " spike buck ; " but after he is three or four years old , or rather " aged , " the horns cease to be peculiar . The largest buck we ever saw , and apparently the most venerable among the patriarchs , had medium-sized horns , the branches consisting 1 ) ut of five antlers . The age of the deer is very nearly ascertained by an examination of the teeth , and , in addition to this , by the presence or absence of gray hairs about the forehead . In this connection it may be well to repeat the often uttered question , What becomes of the deers ' horns ? for whether kept in parks or running wild in the woods there is a sort of mystery about the disappearance of these sturdy appendages . The head ornaments of the moose and the elk , equally with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After long exposure the substance of a deer 's horn becomes very light and friable ; and , when in that state , it is reported , on authority that appears reliable , that the deer and other animals greedily chew them up , as a corrective to acidity of the stomach-es cows may sometimes be seen picking out withered bones and chewing them vigorously , probably for the same purpose . If this theory be true , it will account in part for the singular mystery that attends the shedding of these horns . That wild animals have instincts thus to act is inferable from the fact that , when from age about to die , they retire to some lone place , some dark fastness or deep cave , where alone their bones are ever found . Some years ago a man was looking for " strayed cattle " in a forest in Victoria Province , Canada West . While thus engaged , his attention was attracted by some curious shoots from the stump of a beach-tree . Upon examination he was surprised to find that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of which was embedded in the centre of the tree 's trunk . It is probable that some forester had made a commencement at cutting down the tree , and left his work unfinished , when the horn was inserted and finally caught in the new wood which nature provided to fill up the gaping wound inflicted by the axe . Independent of the fact that the deer annually sheds its horns , it has another peculiarity most worthy of notice . Upon examination there will be found , just above the hoof on the // hind leg , a spot sometimes scarcely noticeable in the fawn , but in old bucks very observable . This insertation seems to be the seat of the secretion which scents the air , and enables the hound to follow so certainly on the deer 's track . In some old bucks we have found the depository evincing remarkable activity , and emitting , even to our senses , a strong , but not absolutely unpleasant odor . When the buck is in " the velvet , " and the doe is with young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus they escape for the time being from their numerous enemies . But for this merciful provision of nature the species would become extinct . The deer , though proverbially considered a harmless animal , is not without powerful means of defense , to which , in part , must be ascribed its preservation . Its frame is one of the most perfect that can be conceived , one of the most beautiful mechanical constructions under the sun  --  a sublime combination of bone , muscle , sinew , elastic cartilage , and springy hoof , which jointly in action produce a rapidity of motion superior to many quick-flying birds . For the hunting-whip there is no handsomer handle than the fore foot and bone of the fawn ; and , independent of its genial feeling in the hand , the marvelous beauty of its structure gives pleasure by its appearance . Independent of the speed of the deer , the male is armed by a " brow of bayonets , " which gives majesty to its appearance , and when considered in connection with the powerful hind-quarters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive them home with telling force , they become formidable weapons of defense , and no ordinary antagonist can withstand a fair blow from their many points . Although among themselves they are exceedingly playful , still they are not unconscious of their power to do injury , and are not disposed to pass by an opportunity to make the effort . For hours a herd of deer will feed quietly together , when suddenly a joust will commence between two rivals that will fill the whole herd with excitement-the does suspending their eating , the unoccupied bucks regarding the battle with professional gravity . The challenges of aspiring braves are very curious , and full of etiquette . There is no rushing together with unceremonious haste . They come side by side , affecting an unconsciousness of each other 's presence , looking around and beyond , yet evidently , in spite of appearances , eying each other . While thus engaged , one suddenly presumes his opponent is off his guard , when he " pitches in , " only to find his intende&amp; blow scientifically caught upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would it be to find a buck assaulted when off his guard . Sometimes these woodland duels consume the day , until the combatants sink exhausted on the broken turf ; not unfrequently , when the opposing antlers are large aud the battle fierce , they will lock together , and thus fasten the duelists in fatal contact . When this is the case , they oppose each other by pushing until one or the other falls ; a hopeless struggle to separate then ensues , and the poor creatures recover their wind and strength only to realize that a lingering death is to close their career . SKULL AND ANTLERS OF D ER . Some buzzards , on one occasion , wheeling over our heads , directed our attention to a dark spot in the forest , upon visiting* which we found occupied by the dead and greatly decayed bodies of two once proud monarchs of the forest , who had thus fallen in their struggle for ascendency . Nor does the buck always confine himself to attacks upon his own species ; many incidents are related where they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced the battle . In the year 1808 the Earl who then held the title of Berkeley was walking with his little son in one of his parks , when he was set upon by an American deer which he kept as a curiosity . The Earl seized the horns of the animal with both hands , bravely holding on after he was thrown down and rudely trampled upon by the furious beast . In this critical condition he called out to his child not to be alarmed , but to take from his ( the father 's ) pocket a knife , and stab the deer , or , if he could , cut his throat . The boy obeyed , reached his parent 's pocket , found the knife , and went to work upon the throat of the animal . The noble boy 's courage , however , was greater than his strength , and he could not cut the animal 's windpipe ; nevertheless , he quniled not , but dealt the brutal assailant of his father so many stabs that weakened with the loss of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way back to its deep wood haunts , just as the Earl was all but exhausted . It is traditionary that the deer species are long lived . Hesiod was so impressed with this idea that he suggests they reached the age of many centuries , and the reason of this was supposed to be dependent on the fact that they have no gall . This singular phenomenon was noticed by Aristotle , Pliny , and lat*r writers , although it has recently been revived as the result of the observation of many of our Western hunters . To test the truth of this peculiarity in the group , Professor Owen extended his examination so far as to include a giraffe , and most singularly , by some freak of nature , it had two gall bladders ; and it has been very properly observed that if he had continued his investigations no farther , this sh*gular animal would have been credited with what would seem to be an nunatural amount of " bitterness . " But subsequent experiments developel tho fact that the giraffe , ic its natural formatiou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is not long lived-it shows symptoms of decay when ten years old  --  and we presume one that had reached the age of // twenty would be justly considered a Methuselah of his kind . If the deer does not reach a great age , its tenacity of life , while in its prime , is most remarkable ; but perhaps it forms no exception to the general rule , that all animals , in high health , and possessed naturally of a superior organization , often " die hard . " Man , of all created beings , shows the most tenacity ; examples being recorded of the human frame surviving wounds , and maintaining life beyond what can he found exampled in any other warm-blooded creature . We have known a deer to keep its position in front of a fleet pack of hounds for near a mile , running all the while with its fore legs broken below the knee . A stag was killed in the year 1686 by Dorothen , the Electress of Brandenburg , and her attendants , that seemed for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new wound , however severe , seemed only to inspire it with renewed power to elude its pursuers . Among other wounds inflicted a long time before it was pulled down by the hounds , was that resulting from a ball through the posterior part of the heart , through the middle of the right and a portion of the left ventricle ; the wound was sufficiently large to admit a finger , and the fleshy fibres of the surrounding parts were much lacerated and contused . A more remarkable case of vitality came under our own observation . Some years ago a friend residing in Concordia parish , Louisiana , after a very prolonged hunt , killed a fine old buck . After it was dressed according to custom , the negro boy in attendance proceeded to cut up the lights , liver , and heart , to divide them among the hounds . The boy met with his usual success until he came to the heart , which , when cut through to the interior , resisted the edge of his sharp knife . Our friend , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attention attracted by the circumstance , and upon a critical examination , to his surprise he discovered that a rifle-ball had passed entirely through the heart , and that the orifice thus made was filled up with a cartilaginous substance very nearly resembling bone . It was evident that the animal had been at some previous season thus severely wounded , but escaping pursuit , had gradually recovered its health , for when killed no deer could have been in better condition . A case not less extraordinary is reported by a physician living in Virginia . Like our friend just alluded to , he was fond of the chase , and on one occasion had the good fortune to kill a buck that was remarkable for his fine condition . In opening the animal the wonderful discovery was made that , at some time in the animal 's history , an elder stalk had entirely transfixed his heart : on examination it was evident that the stalk had been thus embedded for a great length of time . The wounds which it had made in its ingress were perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor was there any sign of disease in the substance of the heart through which the stalk penetrated . Nature had kindly and effectually cured the wound , and preserved the life of the gallant buck that he might die by the hands of the doctor , secundum artem . The circumstances connected with the death of " Bill Poole " rendered the event notorious , but when the post-mortem examination of the body displayed the fact , that he had lived eleven days with a pistol bullet embedded between the ventricles of his heart , additional notoriety was given to the circumstance . The popular idea that a wound in the heart was necessarily immediately fatal was exploded , and we find that men in a high condition of health are quite as full of vitality as are animals subjected to the chase . On the 21st of December , 1835 , at Cincinnati , Ohio , a man by the name of Maguire was shot in the chest by a ball weighing seventy-four to the pound . He lived in spite of the perforation of his lung five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart had been perforated by the ball , and the wound had begun to heal . In all probability but for the injury to the lung he might have recovered . A similar case , but perhaps more extraordinary , is related of a negro of McNairy County , Tennessee , who was wounded in the chest by a load of shot . He was doctored entirely for the relief of inflammation of the lungs , no indications appearing that the heart was diseased . Up to the sixty-seventh day of his confinement he improved in health , and finally died by an over-indulgence of his appetite . In tracing the course of his wounds after death , the physicians were astonished at finding three shot in the bottom of the ventricle , and two shot in the bottom of the auricle of the heart . The wounds made in the substance of the organ were all firmly healed , and the internal surface of the cavities , in which the shot were found , betrayed no sign of having suffered in any way from the presence of the shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by representing that , when torn down by the dogs , they have been known to weep . Somerville , Thomson , and even deer-stalking Will of Stratford , have alluded to their tears . This idea would naturally be suggested by a merely superficial examination of a deer 's face , from the fact that there is an indentation under the corner of the eye peculiar to this animal , that gives the idea , in connection with its mild blue eyes , of melancholy , helped out , no doubt , by the fact that the inner lining of this depression is of a dark color , as if caused by the markings of continual drops of water from the eye . There is no reasonable authority to say the deer sheds tears ; the physical representation that leads to such an idea is an evidence of the beauty and variety of Nature 's handiwork , for it has thus made the deer species additionally charming , and separated its physiognomy from more destructive animals . Upon dissecting a deer 's head the cavities alluded to are found // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathes through his mouth , these contrivances may be vents to add to respiration , and also to give more intense perception to the olfactory nerve-an addition not accorded to any other species . The food of the deer consists of grasses , mosses , and weeds . They also browse on fhe tender buds of almost all kinds of shrubs and trees ; but deer will destroy , seemingly without discrimination , every thing that is to be found in a well-stocked garden . They are also passionately fond of " mast , " which term includes the whole acorn family . In the seasons when the mast is abundant the deer , as well as all other wild animals consuming vegetable food , become very fat . In the northern parts of our continent the deer live for months , sometimes , on hemlock leaves , and so impregnated does their flesh become with the pungent odor that it is entirely worthless for food . At times these poor animals suffer immensely from starvation , and this is particularly the case when the snow is so deep that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth and obtain some sustenance from the roots of grasses and herbs . In the year 1835 a gentleman , traveling in the vicinity of Lake George , came into a hemlock forest which was full of different wild animals that had sought its protection against the unusual prevailing cold . Here , among other things , he discovered a " deer yard , " in which were huddled together nearly a hundred and fifty deer , who stood with their heads all turned out from the centre , to anticipate any outside attack . The deer had , by constant trampling , made an inclosure in the snow with walls over four feet high . Inside of this they had remained until nearly famished , many being so weak that they could not stand . Sixty of the most vigorous were taken out without their making any serious resistance , and placed in a large barn , where they soon recovered upon a diet of excellent hay . In the vicinity there were several small yards . So long had these creatures lived upon the aromatic leaves of the hemlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The favorite haunts of the deer are where they can find some matted thicket in which to hide , places they select with remarkable sagacity to secure seclusion . When their antlers are in velvet they then occasionally seek the sunny side of a hill , in the expressive language of the hunters , " to dry their horns . " The deer is a great bather , and a luxurious one . He chooses a shallow place with a hard bottom , and first scraping away any pebbles or other rough projections that may be distributed under his feet , he lies down with the air of a creature that is about to be comfortable awl A hAPPY FAMIaY. // knows how to enjoy it . After resting a while , that the water may quietly soak through his thick coating of hair and cool his sensitive skin , he rolls from side to side , occasionally rising partially out of the water , and shaking himself as will a Newfoundland dog . These traits suggest habits common to the deer , north and south ; but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at nightfall , seek the protection of the water against the attack of the poisonous mosquito , and will for hours remain entirely buried under the surface , with nothing visible but his sharp nostril , over which is continually buzzing a cloud of rapacious insects , which , the moment they attempt their bloody work , are disappointed , by the sinking of the nostril under the water . At this game of attack and defense will deer and mosquito indulge all night . The scent of the species is very powerful , while the sight , on the contrary , is quite imp*rfect . A chamois , when dashing down the mountains , will suddenly stop , as if struck by a thunder-bolt , some yards from the spot where recent human footprints are visible in the snow , and turning , scared , away , will rush in an opposite direction . The very taint in the air is recognized long after the hunter is passed . The common deer will often approach within a few yards of a human being without perceiving him ; but directly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal will be off like ashot. : In localities where they are not much hunted they do not fly at the approach of man , but , like all game , crouch in the long grass or underwood , endeavoring to conceal themselves , lying with their heads erect , their ears pressed flat on their necks , their eyes keenly watching the movements of the intruder , ready , on the instant , to spring to their feet . The Indians sometimes disguise themselves in the entire skin of the deer , imitating , at the same time , its cries and gait , and in this way often destroy many , provided the keen scent of the animal , which can not be deceived , does not take the alarm . Of all animals known the deer is the most easily domesticated  --  a fact which seems exceedingly strange when we take its natural timidity and wildness into consideration . Persons who can imitate the bleat of the fawn often , bring the doe within gunshot , though it is certainly a cruel thing to shoot the poor creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not an extraordinary thing for the hunter to be obliged to push the doe off with the muzzle of his gun when he has accidentally captured its young . Upon seizing a fawn it will , for a few moments , struggle and bleat terribly ; but when you set it down its contact with humanity seems to have changed its nature , for , like an affectionate spaniel , it will follow you home , and never requires farther domestication . When the doe goes out to feed she hides her fawn away , with maternal solicitude and consummate judgment . She will , by some power known to herself , cause the young one to lie down in the thicket , and there remain until she returns . Nature has made these little creatures not only very strong and active , but has kindly mottled up its skin so that it is less distinguishable among surrounding natural objects than it would otherwise be . When very young they are red , with white spots on their sides like little stars ; these spots disappear when they advance toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat in the autumnal season . A gentleman of our acquaintance was on a hunt when a doe was shot ( a most cruel murder ! ) , and , perceiving that it was with fawn , he stooped down , and , with his knife , brought the tiny thing into the world . The little animal , thus " untimely ripped " from the body of its dead mother , ultimately gained its feet , and , to the surprise of all who witnessed it , followed the party home . We afterward saw the animal in the full pride of a majestic head of horns . It is *ot uncommon , in riding among the plantations of the South , to see a deer bound over the high Virginia fences into the road , stop and gaze upon your intrusive presence , and then frisking its tail , gambol along in sight , and suddenly disappear behind some Cherokee hedge . You know this to be a domesticated deer , not only from its sociability , but also from the little bell it wears upon its neck to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might otherwise be deceived , when met with in remote parts of the plantation where it was domiciliated . These domesticated deer shed a beauty over the lawn , and afford infinite amusement when the hound puppies about the yard open at full cry and " give it a brush . " The old dogs take no notice of these household pets , but seem to know them as well as any other prominent member of the family . Mrs. Kenzie , in her " Early Day of the Northw6st , " relates that , as a token of gratitude from an Indian woman for some trivial favor bestowed , she received a fawn , which pleased her much by its soft blue eyes and dappled coat , and having often heard of the simile , " as wild as a fawn , " she was greatly surprised to witness how soon it became tamed . Wherever the lady went " Fan " was sure to follow , showing all the familiarity and affection of a spaniel . On one occasion the pet made her way to a shelf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie dovu*n among the plates and dishes . Upon examination it became evident that it was the protecting projection of the shelf the animal was after , as it always sought the shade of a chair or something else approaching an " umbrageous bower . " The hint , or rather the instinctive feeling of the animal , being understood , at the usual hour of the morning when the gentle creature took her nap , a large green parasol was opened and set on the matting in the corner of the room . Fan was then called , when she would come and instantly nestle under the " genial shade , " and fall asleep . // There are three methods practiced by American hunters in killing deer , designated in general terms as " Fire-hunting , " " Still-hunting , " and " Driving . " Fire-hunting is considered the least legitimate , and is seldom resorted to by the conscientious sportsman , except when game is very scarce , and consequently , from being much hunted , rendered too shy to approach in daylight . Two persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend to the torch , and one to bear the gun . The hunters are generally accompanied by a cur dog , one that is well trained and will not " open " on the trail . The dog has a little bell suspended to his neck , the tongue of which is stuffed around with cotton that it may emit no sound until the proper time for action . If the weather is favorable , it must be a still , misty , dark night after a rain , which renders the fallen leaves so moist that they will make no noise under the feet of the hunter . A person of much experience can generally distinguish between the eyes of a deer and those of other animals when " shined " by a torch ; first , by their brilliancy ; secondly , by their unusual size ; and , thirdly , by their great ( distance apart compared with other animals . FIRE-nUNTINcI. // A colt 's eyes approach the nearest in appearance , but they are dim . The deer also gazes at the light with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly moving theirs about , being of a more fretful and fiery disposition . The deer , fascinated as it was by the illumination , remains motionless , giving the hunter ample opportunity to approach within gunshot . If a hunter once loses the " eyes " after they have been " shined , " he is satisfied that the creature is alarmed and is moving oft ; and he embraces the first favorable opportunity to fire . As a general thing , if the shot is at all successful , the victim falls , and is at once secured ; but if mortally wounded , and yet possessed of strength enough to make an effort to escape , the " track-dog " is unloosed from the cord that has fastened him to his master , the cotton is removed from the tongue of the bell , and he follows in pursuit , the hunter for his course being entirely guided by the tinkling of the bell . If no dog is employed , and the deer runs oW the spot is carefully marked , and the hunter returns home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . It is related that Daniel Boone , while fire-hunting , " shined " a pair of mild blue eyes which struck him as not belonging to the game he was seeking to destroy . lie lowered his rifle , and made farther examination , when , to his surprise , he discovered a young girl , who , with himself ; was equally astonished at the adventure . Boone expressed the most eloquent gratitude that he had not fired his weapon , and waited upon the woodland nymph to her home hard by ; in time the damsel became the wife of this most famous of backwoodsmen . We knew a gentleman who indulged in this rather questionable amusement , who saw what he believed to be the glare of a deer 's eyes , and fired . His astonishment can be faintly imagined when he discovered by the yelp that followed that he had shot his " track dog " in the head , and at the instant when the animal was firmly held between the knees of a negro to keep him from too suddenly springing after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peck , of Louisiana  --  a most accomplished hunter and writer-speaks of a neighbor of his , who went on a fire-hunting excursion , and having discovered the eye of a deer , dismounted , and , with his companion , fastened their horses to a limb of a tree and advanced toward the deer . After walking some distance , and occasionally losing sight of the " eyes , " they were finally " shined ' and fired at , the result of which was , the killing of the gentleman 's favorite saddle-horse . " Still-hunting " resembles the English practice of " stalking , " and with many gentlemen sportsmen is preferred to any other method . To an individual who is fond of nature , and can find amusement in communing with the solitudes of the forest , still-hunting possesses manifold charms . A good still-hunter , says our friend , Harry I-huntington , " of Trinity , " must be thoroughly acquainted with the habits of the deer , know where he ranges , be able to tell his tracks from other cloven-footed beasts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in evist HUNTING . // the soil . He must know which way the game in the locality walkwhen feeding , and the direction they take at nightfall-things which seem to be strangely dependent upon the moon . The abundance of acorns or mast is also to be considered ; and , moreover , still-hunting is most practiced , by all familiar with this wood craft , when the buck is seeking the company of the doe . Then they are less than usually cautions , and an imitation of the female , even if clumsily done , will often attract their notice ; while others again , utterly reckless , will come rushing toward the hunter , and , not nulike some more intelligent lovers , find , instead of a flirtation , a premature death . At this particular season the still-bunter is in. his glory . The woods , if a favorable resort , seem to be alive , the deer are so active . Presently he notices coming toward him a doe , he lets the timid creature pass , knowing full well that a nobler haunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low hangin* branches seem to shake as if agitated by a strong wind ; two , three , perhaps four bucks are plunging on , almost side by side . It must be the work of a flashing thought only to decide which one is the finest , for they are going with almost lightning rapidity . This done , a slight whistle , or other unusual noise , is made ; the intrusion arrests the bucks for an instant , and they stop to gaze : the delay is fatal , for the unerring weapon is brought to bear , and the far-reaching echoes of its report mingle confusedly with the sounds which come from the death-throes of a lordly monarch of the forest . A more difficult contest is exhibited when the still-hunter pursues his game in a less propitious season-at a time when the buck is comparatively unoccupied *xcept by thoughts of self-preservation , and has no passions roused to betray him into imprudences . To approach a deer at these times requires patience which few possess ; his suspicious nature must be conciliated by penances of almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only agalust the wind but he must move with the silence of the cloud 's shadoxv : if the deer 's attention is attracted , he must not be alarmed . When a deer is reposing , satisfied that the wind will convey the approach of an enemy in that quarter , it gazes intently in the opposite direction . If there are any birds in the vicinity it watches them , knowing that they will give the alarm if any aggressor is near . It not only selects its cover with the greatest caution , but , if possible , it chooses c6mmanding ground . The difficulty attending the pursuit of the stillhunter can , therefore , be appreciated . An eminent English deer-stalker was often balked by a *vary stag , which had for years occupied a part of the plain from which it could perceive bhe smallest object at the distance of a mile . The man , determined to succeed , finally conceived the idea of approaching his victim behind a clump of bushes . Having prepared his screen he startcd at eight o'clock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six in the afternoon , after nearly ten hours ' labor , the stalker managed , without alarming the stag , to get within gun-shot and bring him down . It is a common thing for still-hunters , when a deer is suddenly " bounced up , " or when one happens to be passing , to bleat , imitating the noise of the fawn . This , as we have already observed , will always arrest the attention of the buck . When a deer is approached , and , in hunter 's phraseology , " has got wind " of his enemy , even if only an imperfect view is obtained , the hunter instantly fires ; for on such occasions the deer makes a few bounds into some open space , in order to satisfy his curiosity , and then instantly disappears . The Indians excel in this method of hunting , being by nature remarkably patient and full of caution . In their preparations they wisely adopt colors for their dress that harmonize with the barks of the trees and decayed logs with which they are surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are almost invisible while stealing through the thickets and lairs . An old woodsman of our acquaintance , who had been , without success , still-hunting through a long day , from fatigue sat down on the banks of a small stream to rest himself . While thus negatively employed he was surprised at the sight of a number of deer at a distance entirely beyond the reach of his rifle , he being at the same time so situated that he could not approach them without being seen . Abandoning the idea of securing " their venison , " he became interested in their playful gambols . Presently two lordly bucks commenced a joust , when , most unexpectedly , a third appeared  --  a young " spike , " which , as if fired with revenge , made one plunge at the side of his now occupied entagonist , and drove his sharp horns into the quivering flesh , where they cut their way as if sharpened knives . The wounded , stricken deer staggered , and fell dead on the green turf . The woodsman leisurely proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpectedly placed in his possession , and , with a heavy load upon his back , but a light heart , proceeded homeward . Such good fortune sometimes overtakes other individuals when they least expect it . A gentleman , riding along a well-beaten road in Southern Mississippi , was arrested by the sight of two large bucks furiously engeged in a fierce trial of strength . Finding that the animals did not heed his presence , he dismounted from his horse , and , without difficulty , killed then with his knife . Tying their hind legs together , he with great labor hung them over the back of his patient steed , and thus enriched he proceeded on his journey . Killing deer by " driving " furnishes more excitement than either method already described . In " driving , " the cheerful clamor of the horn , the thrilling cry of the hounds , and the inspirin* sympathy of the well-trained steed , make the pleasure , at times , as perfect as it is possible for the hunter to enjoy . To be // successful in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrounding couatry , must be perfectly familiar where the game haunts , and must know at what places to enter the drive ; for deer are fond of following and retracing the paths which they have formerly pursued , and will continue to do so even after they have been hunted " on the trace . " It is also a well-known habit of the deer to skirt along the edges of thickets , and keep in the shade of the thick woods . In ascending rising ground they never take a direct route , but wind about after the fashion of a turnpike road ; and in descending to the plains they observe the same rule . Hence it is that the hunter takes his stand in the lowest gaps between the hills ; and by so doing he is sure to occupy the path the deer will take when driven from the vicinity . The morning is always selected for the hunt , and at daybreak the party is in the woods . The hounds are kept compactly together , and , as they become interested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , and hear the encouraging voices of the riders , they become constantly more enthusiastic , and in spite of all discipline , will occasionally yelp forth their impatience . The noble steed also sympathizes with the work in which he is engaged ; and as he steps upon dead twigs that crush and break beneath his feet , he affects to start as if he already saw the game . The hunters having finally reached the " drive , ' a consultation is held as to which stands are most available* This question settled , they separate , and each quietly moves on to the point assigned him . Meantime the driver , accompanied by the pack , scours through the outside of the range , circling round until the dogs come upon the trail of a deer . This done , they instantly open , as , no longer able to restrain their impatience , they make the surrounding heights and wooded isles musical with their cries . The deer , which have been quietly feeding in the vicinity , start at the . sound , throw their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if exulting in their conscious fleetness . The dogs , with heads near the earth , have now fallen into line , and are running close and compact , seriously engaged in their work . Occasionally you hear a sharp bark as the scent grows warm , and their steady , unerring course is accelerated . To them there is blood in the air . The hunters have gained their " stands , " where , concealing their horses in a neighboring thicket , they examine their weapons , and , lying down on the grass , wait with anxious ears the sounds that will announce the approach of their victim . Hours sometimes thus listlessly pass away , and oftentimes every surrounding object , by repeated examination , is vividly impressed on the eye . More particularly do the pathways of the deer leadinu from the highland3 TuE nmum STAND . // toward the hunter become painfully familiar . Patience . is oftentimes exhausted , and the hunter pettishly wishes himself home , when suddenly he hears on what is now , perhaps , the noonday air , the distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lassitude is gone ; . and he springs to his feet , inspired with life . The distant echoes play upon the air as will the sweet sounds of the A*olian harp . Under those notes are the breathings of the maddened honnds , who are now sweeping on in the path of destruction ; while the deer , still defiant and vigorons , is flying and ambling by turns , nnconscions of his fate . Nearer and nearer the exciting sounds approach ; for in the distant melody , the hum-drum of twenty or thirty throats mingling together in a general sound , yoa can occasionally discern the sharp bark of some impatient hound whose bloodshot eyes bespeak his Cuba stock-rushing on in anticipation of throttling the game so swiftly speeding on the wings of fear . A glancing of bright rays , as if from a mirror , flashes in the blue vista of the distant gap that leads from the foot of the hills . The hunter is now on the alert . Another moment and a lordly buck comes plunging into the open space ; his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has scented an enemy in front , and those fearful demons are ringing what may soon be his death-knell in his rear . Undecided he gazes , turns to fly back to his haunts , and then wheeling round , rushes on with headlong speed ; the rifle is raised to the eye , and the spiteful echoes that follow tell of the flight of the messenger of death . The tail of the deer that , a moment before , like a white plume , waved in triumph over the noble haunch , drops suddenly down , the deer gathers up his body in pain  --  the lead has done its mortal work . But life still exists , and the animal rushes out of sight . Before the hunter can regain his horse to follow , the maddened pack , like so many fiends , come rushing in sight , their voices ringing like BREAKING covza. // fifty trumpet chargcs on the battle-field-with mouths open and teeth flashing , with ears erect , and eyes hazy with passion , they go on , treading , like inexorable fate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now mounted , gives the dogs a cheer , exultant and soul-stirring ; the horse , no longer manageable , inflates his nostrils , and , throwing his delicate limbs into the air , carries his rider like a spectre through the dust that rises in the track of the now distant hounds . Converging from point and point come in the different hunters , and , side by side , they spur their steeds over ravines , and rush down the sides of hills reckless of limb or life . At last the game is overtaken , the buck is dead ; the dogs surround it , and reluctantly yield the prize to their masters . Dragging the body to some shady place , hounds , horses , and hunters in turn recover their breath . The brute animals stand panting , their tongues out , and their sides heaving with painful efforts to regain composure . Now commence animated discussions upon the merits of the several dogs composing the pack . The l ) ody of the deer suggests a thousand reminisceaces-the performance of the steeds revive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by is sought ; the cnnteen is produced , and the party , refreshed , is ready for the homeward route . The carcass of the deer is thrown across the back of a horse ridden by a faithful servant , the horn sounds to call the dogs together who have already broken into groups in search of fresh excitement , and the party thus joyfully end the day . Such are the leading incidents of a deer drive in the Southern States . In the excitement of a drive places are passed over by the skillful rider that seem impossible when viewed in dispassionate moments . Deer sometimes fail to come within gunshot of the hunter at the stand , but pass beyond his reach . It is now that the expert sportsman shows his skill . Mounting his horse he follows and passes the hounds then coming in sight of the fleeing deer . He rides across the circle the animal is making to escape his eneThies , and , having accomplished his object , suddenly reins up his horse , raises his rifle to his shoulder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bronze . The deer , in spite of the speed with which he is flying , is killed in his tracks , and falls a legitimate prize to the prowess of man . Hunters are very fond of good stories-those told round the camp fire have become proverbial . They are al . o given to practical jokes . One RETURN FRO* ! TuE HUNT . // of the most ridiculous we ever witnessed was " played upon " a friend of ours who was given , to an insane degree , to the indulgence of such unwarrantable wit  --  and therefore only made excusable in his case . The individual alluded to , from excessive fatigue , threw himself on the ground , while his party was indulging in a lunch , and directly fell asleep . One of the " boys " taking advantage of the occasion , tied a strong cord to one of the sleeper 's feet , and then fastened the other end of the cord to a team of good dogs , which , lashed together , were quietly gazing upon the viands forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joker was awakened from his nap , not only by various punches in the side , but also by the presentation of some good brandy and water . By a concerted arrangement , just as he raised the tumbler to his lips , some one blew a blast on the horn , when the two hounds in the tackling made a spring , upsetting the gentleman with marvelous rapidity , besides doing other inconsiderable damage . We once heard an old hunter gravely relate the story of " Ike Toadvine , " who made a living by killing " varmints , " and had a dog named " True , " which was his friend and fellow-hunter for ten years . The dog was represented to be really part of his master , for old Ike declared , when he was intoxicated , that he loved him more " than he did his whisky . " The dog in time died of old age , and his master , out of pure affection , tanned his hide , and with a piece of it mended his old buckskin breeches ; from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than ever , for the patch would swell out and palpitate whenever it came within scent of a deer . We heard another old Hunter , John Spinek , of Guichita , say that he once shot an old buck , which was so astonished and pained by the circumstance , that the " critter , " in his agony , " broke through a sweet gumtree four feet over , and tore the whole consarn up by the roots . " While in Texas we had the pleasure of meeting with " old Martin Bailey , " known the country round as " the deer-hunter . " He was a powerfully-made man , six feet high , and , like all men who are much in the forests , was slow of speech . He wore a buckskin hunting shirt , pantaloons , and moccasins , and had hanging to his person a hatchet , knife , shot-pouch , and powder-horn . His rifle weighed twenty-seven pounds , and carried a ball weighing exactly an ounce . He could with this weapon bring down a deer at two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen hundred deer , only saving their skins . He could strip the animal of this natural covering in a few seconds ; he made a cut along the belly of the animal , and then forced it off with his clenched fist inserted between the flesh and the skin . The deer of America are thought to be more active and swift than those of Europe , and are ranked before the antelope , notwithstanding the extraordinary tales related of the latter by naturalists and poets who never saw one or the other . The average speed of the deer is quite equal to the best blooded saddle-horse . An old buck is the least active , a spike buck is the fleetest . No calculation has ever been made of the number of miles an American deer could run in a given space of time . It is recorded that a rein-deer once ran nineteen miles in sixty minutes . In 1699 an officer carried the news of an invasion of Norway to Stockholm , with a single deer and sledge , making eight hundred and forty miles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is superio* to the horse . " We have seen a tame buck , suddenly alarmed by the hounds , leap over-without touching it- an inclosure near eight feet high ; and we have seen a wild buck , pursued by hounds , clear a fence six feet high , leaping thirty feet clear in the extraordinary effort . " Greater distances are recorded of the European stag . One is said to have accomplished fiftyfour , and another sixty feet , but they are traditions of the " olden time , " and most probably pleasant exaggerations . As necessary as deer are generally considered as ornaments of an English nobleman 's park , sometimes the " gentry " take an inveterate dis- like to the breed , and destroy them with the most criminal recklessness . It is stated , on the best authority , that the late Duke of Portland ordered four hundred head of deer to bu slaughtered at Bulstrode . The . Earl of Jersey offered three thousand pounds for the animals alive , but was refused ; the noble duke not only disdained the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act with the infamous injunction that the venison , skins , and horns should be buried in the earth entire . If a combination of crimes could create an unpardonable sin , it rests upon the head of this mosr honored nobleman . In this country , with rare exceptions , we properly eat our venison ; but the term in old times took a wider signification . It seems almost profane to go to Lord Coke for an opinion that shall bear upon our subject ; yet the " venerable " tells us that venison derives its name from the means whereby the beasts* were taken , and a beast must be hunted before its carcass could lay claim to the title . But to make the thing " legally clear , " we learn from those old forest laws once in force in England , that a roe killed with buck or pheasant shot was not venison ; while the wild boar , if he submitted to be chased before he was killed , was venison ; and that the hare is venison too , because he submits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri , while out on a hunting expedition , came across a buck in the midst of the open prairie . The gentleman was well mounted , and gave chase ; in a few moments he overtook the animal , and threw a lariat over its horns . A fight now commenced , the rider only by the most finished equestrianship keeping clear of the fore-feet of the infuriated buck . Mr. Gilkey finally reached a small tree , around which he fasten d the Ianat , // and was thus enabled to dispatch his game at leisure . The Indians of Sierra Valley , California , resort to various stratagems to circumvent the deer . They not only disguise themselves in their skins , but they set the woods on fire on one side of the valley , which drives the game in the opposite direction , where bark ropes are stretched along the brow of the hill , with here and there openings to let the deer through . The Indians lie concealed near these openings , waiting for the deer , which edge along the rope , th&amp;y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sense of danger . By this simple contrivance many are slain . It would seem to be necessary for the completion of our article to mention the black-tailed deer , which inhabit the mountains ( for they rarely descend to the plains ) of that part of our continent known as New Mexico . They are larger than the common deer , and their flesh is equally good for food . Living among precipices , they have habits peculiar to the goat and the chamois . When disturbed , they usually take a succession of hounds into the air , bringing their feet back again to the earth in nearly the same place from which they sprung . They possess the same curious disposition as the antelope , and thus frequently fall an easy prey to the hunter . The peculiarity of the common deer about the eye ( elsewhere noticed ) is possessed by the black-tailed species in a more eminent degree , for just below the internal canthus of each eye is an oval opening , which the animal appears to have the power to open alA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these have something to do with the respiratory organs ; for it is said that , when the deer is eating or drinking , these oval openings uniformly contract and enlarge with the motions of these organs . The young are even more easily tamed , if such a thing is possirde , than the red deer . A well known peculiarity in its power of endurance is , that it will go without ' water for a day , or even two days , without apparent suffering . As a curiosity of the deer species we must not forget the deer , specimens of which have been brought from the island of Java . When fall grown they are among the most tiny things that can be imagined , not possessing the weight of a small rabbit . Their limbs are remarkably delicate , and their hoof , which is cloven , is almost transparent . In colors they are red and brown , with white upon their breast . From the nose , and extending back to the ear , is a tancolored stripe* and under the lower jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is large and projecting ; they ruminate ; and are the smallest animals in creation that chew the cud . They are represented to be very swift in their movements , and to all outward appearance are miniature representations of the common red deer of our own continent . Venison , as a culinary dish , has ever been esteemed one of " the greatest luxuries of the season , " and the merciless way it is tortured while being prepared for the table is the best evidence of its high appreciation by cooks and gourmands . It is a nutritious food when eaten with other viands , but its a remarkable fact that . in an exclusive diet of " deer meat , " it will finally cease to afford any sustenance , and the person thus living will present the phenomenon of actual starvation . Frontiersmen have been found in Texas in the last stages of exhaustion . wan , shriveled , and at the point of death , who had been reduced to this condition while there was a plentiful supply of venison in the camp . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the mysteries of Ude and Soyer ; upon one thing have its fanciers only agreed , and that is , that to be best enjoyed the meat must be served up hot . We have tried it broiled , fried , and stewed ; plain , and mixed with innumerable condiments ; we have partaken of it in palaces , and amidst the equally imposing associations of ' the primitive forest ; we have rejoiced over it with one of Britain 's proudest bids at our elbow , and a " Nature 's nobleman " on the opposite side ; we have indulged in venison served up in silver dishes , in costly china , and on fragrant birch bark ; we have tried it when relying upon its natural sweetness for its flavor , and when it has been loaded down with spices and wines ; yet the time in our historywben eating venison made the most lasting impression was under the following peculiar circumstances : We once found ourselves , on a cold winter 's day , with some half dozen fellow-travelers , working our tedious way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , Kentucky . Our mode of progression was by means of " an extra , " in the shape of a stage attached to two indifferently good horses . The fare we obtained along the road , though seasoned by frank hospitality , was not always sumptuous nor always plentiful . On one occasion our breakfast consisted entirely of corn bread that had soured at the disgust it felt at being left uncooked in the centre ; but our backwoods host jocosely remarked that we could do better at the next " hotel , " still farther on the road . With this comforting assurance we proceeded on our journey , and kept on with it until our appetite and that of our fellow-sufferers was sharpened to an extreme edge . Desperate with hunger , we hesitatingly inquired at a log-cabin for food . Through the chinks between the logs of which it was built we easily observed the glowing flame of a hickory-wood fire . The " lady of the house , " to our inquiries , said she had no meat to give us , but we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus making as nice a distinction as ever did my Lord Coke . Looking in the direction she pointed with her finger , we beheld the carcass of a fine buck hanging within the huge jambs of the fire-place . It was but a few moments ' work , by the aid of my companions , to move the pine table nearly into the centre of the room . Some pure crystallized , but not too fue , salt was produced , // along with a hunting-knife possessed of an edge sharp to perfection . A cart-load of coals was glowing on the earthen hearth , and a sharp , clear , winter wind came refreshingly through the openings in the cabin walls . Thus situated , we fell to work on the haunch of the lordly buck . A good carver and a man of sense wielded the knife and brought away the tender-loin steaks ; they were laid upon the coals , and in a trice involved themselves in a fragrance that would not only tempt an anchorite , but would have roused an overfed and insensible alderman for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the delicious morsels from the embers , we delicately sprinkled them with salt , and ate ! The viand was hot to intensity , but it only burned its rich juices into our lips , and gave an intense gusto to our palate we never before realized . Our conversion to the true way to cook and eat venison was complete-all doubts about the perplexed question were solved  --  and we never expect to realize the full merits of its wild sweetness until we find ourselves , after a long fast , again in a backwoods cabin , with a glowing fire , a handful of hard salt , and with a fine buck at our service hanging in the chimney jamb.
