CRUSOE*LWE. * A NARRATIVE OF ADVENTURES IN TIlE ISLANI ) OF JUAN FERNANDEZ BY 3 . ROSS BROWNE . THE BOAT ADVENTURE . NOT quite four years ago , the ship Anteus was a noted vessel . Many were the strange stories told of strife and discord between the captain and the passengers ; pamphlets were published giving different versions of the facts , and some very curious questions of law were involved in the charges made by both parties . It appeared from the statement of the passengers , who were for the most part intelligent and respectable Americans , that , on the voyage of the Anteus to California , their treatment by the captain was cruel and oppressive in the extreme ; that , before they were three weeks from port , he had reduced them almost to a state of absolute starvation ; and , in consequence of the violence of his conduct , which , as they alledged , was without cause or provocation on their part , they considered their lives endangered , and resolved upon making an appeal for his removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel at Rio , the captain was arraigned before the American Consul , and pronounced to be insane by the evidence of six physicians and by the testimony of a large majority of the passengers . It was charged , on the other hand , that the passengers were disorderly , mutinous , and ungovernable ; that they had entered into a conspiracy against the captain , and in testifying to his insanity were guilty of perjury . The examination of the case occupied several weeks before the American Consul ; voluminous testimony was taken on both sides ; the question was submitted to the American Minister , to the British Consul , and to the principal merchants of Rio , all of whom concurred in the opinion that , under the circumstances , there was but one proper course to pursue , which was , to remove the captain from the command of the vessel . He was accordingly deposed by the American Consul , and a new captain placed in the command . This was regarded by the principal merchants of New York as an arbitrary exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Act of Congress , in the year 1853. by Harper and Brothers , in toe Clerk 's Office of the District Court of the Southern District of New York . cedent , and a memorial was addressed oy tasm to the President of the United States for the removal of the Consul . A new administration had just come into power ; and the Consul was removed , ostensibly on the ground of the complaints matle against him ; but , inasmuch as some few other officers of the government were removed at the same time without such ground , it may be inferred that a difference in political opinion had some weight with the administration . It is not my intention now to go into any arguinent in regard to the merits of this case ; the time may come when justice will be done to the injured , and it remains for higher authority than myself to meet it out . I have simply to acknowledge , with a share of the odium resting upon me , that I was one of the rebellious passengers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their confidence as to give me charge of the case . I was unlearned in law , yet possessed some experience in sea-life ; and believing that the lives of all on board depended upon getting rid of a desperate and insane captain , aitled to the best of my ability in having a new officer placed in the command . To the change thus made , unforeseen in its results , I owe my eventful visit to the Island of Juan Fernandez , It was the intention of our first captain to touch at Valparaiso for a supply of fresh provisions . In the ship 's papers this was the only port designated on the Pacific side , except San Francisco . Our new commander , Captain Brooks , assumed the responsibility of leaving the choice between Valparaiso and another port , to the passengers . It was put to the vote , and decidetl that we should proceed to Callao , so that we might pass in sight of Juan Fernandez , and have an opportunity of visiting Lima , " the City of the Kings . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1849 , we made the highest peak of Massa Tierra , bearing N.NW. , distant *eventy miles . The weather was mild and clear . As the sun rose , it fell calm , and the ship lay nearly motionless . A light blue spot , scarce higher than a handspike , was all that appeared in the horizon . It might have passed for a cloud , but for the distinctness of its outline . Weary of the gales we had encountered off Cape Horn , it was a pleasant thing to see a spot of earth once more , and there was not a soul on board but felt a desire to go ashore . For some days MAP OF JUAN FECNANDEZ. // nast , myself and a few others had talked secretly among ourselves about making the attempt in case ye went close enough but now there seemed to l ) C every prospect of a lontr calm , and we took it for granted the captain would clap on an sail if we took the trades . There was no other chance but to lower one ot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us agreed to do this , provided we could get a boat . The ship 's boats we knew it would be impossible to get a ithout permission of the captain , and that we were not willing to ask . Mr. Brigham , a fellow passenger , was owner of one of the quarter-boats We broached him , and he gladl in the adventure , with his partner ann soiin friends , so that we usade in all a very pleasant party of eleven . The proper number of men for the boat svas six , but in considerstion of the great distance and the necessity of a change at the oars , five more were crowded in . We had been in the habit of rowin* about the vessel whenever it was calm , and this we thought would be a good excuse for lowerin* the boat . Being in reat haste lest the captain should object to letting us go , we only thought of a few necessary articles in case we should be cast away or driven off from the island . Two small demijohns of water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some cheese and crackers comprised our entire stock of provisions ; and for nautical in. truments we had only a lantern and a small pocket compass . Not knowing but there might be outla -s or savages ashore who might undertake to murder us , we armed ourselves with a double-barreled gun , a fusee , and an old harpoon , which was all we could smuggle into the boat , in the excitement of starting . Captain Brooks happening to come on deck , perceived that there was something unusual going on , and suspecting our design , took occasion to warn us of the folly of such an expedition . At the same time thinking there was more bravado than re lity about it , he laughed go od-hurnoredly when we acknowledged that we were going ashore . " Be sure , " said he , as we went over the side , " not to for5et the peaches . You will find plcaty of them up in the valleys . Only do n't lose sight of the vessel . You may exercise yourselves as much as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do . Bear in mind that you are more than seventy miles from that peak ! " We promised him that we would take care of ourselves , and come back safe in case we were not foundered . At 9 in. we bade our friends good-by , and with three cheers pushed off from the ship . The boat was only twenty-two feet long and an eighth of an inch thick : it was made of sheet-iron and was very narrow and crank . Most of us , except myself and a whaleman named Paxton , were unused to rowing , so that the prospect of reaching land depended a good deal upon the day remaining calm , and upon keeping the boat trimmed ; the gunwales being only ten inches out of the water There was no excuse for this risk of life , savt that insatiable thirst for novelty which ad experience to some extent after the monotony of a long voyage . I will only say , in regard to *nyself , that I was too full of joy at the idea of a ramble in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . If there was danger it merely served to give zest to the adventure . By a calculation of the distance and our tate of going , we expected to reach the land by sundown or soon after ; and then our plan was to make a tent of the boat-sail , and sleep under it till morning , when by rising e*rly we thought we could take a run over the island , and perhaps get some fruit and vegetables . By that time , should a light reeze spring up dun g the night . we thought it likely the ship would be well up by the land , and we could pull out and get on board without difficulty . Before long we found that distances are very deceptive in these latitudes where the atmosphere is so clear ; for notwithstanding tIme statensent of the captain that by the reckoning we were seventy miles from land , we believed that he only told us so to deter us from going , and that we were not much more than half that distance. , In rowin we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an hour each at the oars , so as to share thin labor . Once fairly under way , with a smooth sea and a pleasant day before us , we became exceedingly noerry at the expense of our fellow-passesmgers whom we had left in the ship to drift about LEAVING THE SHIP . // in the calm , and it afforded us much diversion to think how they would be disappointed upon finding that we were in earnest about going ashore . Before long , we had cause to wish ourselves back again in the ship ; which goes to prove that apparently the most unfortunate are often less so than those who seem to be favored by circumstances . At noon we took a lunch , and refreshed ourselves with a drink of water all round . We had also a good supply of cigars , which we smoked with great relish after our pull ; and I think there never was a happier set than we were for the time . Still there was but a single peak on the horizon . It was blue and dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we saw it from the mast-head : from which we inferred that there must be a current setting against us . The Anteus was hull down , yet we seemed as far from the land as when we started . A ripple beginning to show upon the water . we hoisted our sail to catch the breeze , and found that it helped us one or two knots an hour . With songs and anecdotes we passed the time pleasantly till 3 P.M. , when we entirely lost sight of the vessel . Paxton , the whaleman , now stood up in the boat to take an observation of the land . There were a few more peaks in sight ; the middle peak , which was the first we made , began to loom up very plainly , showing a flat top . It was the mountain called Yonka , which is said to be three thousand feet high . We were apparently forty miles yet from the nearest point ; and the sun setting here in May at a little after five , we began to feel uneasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of us , having gone so far , were in favor of keeping on , though in secret we thought there was a good deal of danger . At sunset , we took another observation . The land had risen quite over the water from end to end , and we hoped to reach it in about three hours . It is true none of us knew any thing about the shores , whether they abounded in bays or not , and if so where any safe place of landing could be found-which made us doubtful how to steer . Clouds were gathering all over the horizon ; a few stars shone out dimly overhead , and the shades of night began to cover the island as with a shroud . Swiftly , yet with resistless power , the clouds swept over the whole sky , and the horizon , in all the grandeur of its vast circle , was lost in the shades of night . No sail was near ; no light shone upon us now but the dim rays of a few solitary stars through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening ear save the weary stroke of our oars : a gloom had settled upon the mighty wilderness of waters , and we were awed and silent , for we knew that the spirit of God was there , and darkness was his secret place : that " his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies . " One large black mass of clouds rose up on the weather quarter . A low moaning came over the sea , and the air became suddenly chill , and the waters rippled around us , and were tossed about by the unseen Power , and we trembled , for we beheld the coming of the storm that was soon to burst upon us in all the majesty of its wrath . For a while there was the stillness of death ; then " the Lord thundered in the heavens , and the Highest gave his voice , " and out of the darkness came the storm . In fierce and sudden gusts ii came , terrible in its resistless might ; lashing the sea into a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms outstretched grasping up the waters as it raged over the deep , and scourging them madly through the air , while it moaned and shrieked like the dread spirit of desolation Every one of us cowered down in the boat to keep her balanced . The spray washed over us fearfully , and the sail shook so in the wind , having let go all , that we thought it would tear the mast out . At this time we were about three leagues from the SE. end of the island , which was the nearest point then in sight . As the cloud spread by the attraction of the land , the whole island became wrapt in a dark shroud of mist , and in half an hour we could discern nothing but the gloom of the storm around us , as we bore down toward the darkest part on the lee . Our lamp was now quenched by a heavy sea ; and being unable to distinguish the points of the compass , we were fearful we should miss the island , and be carried off so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lull we tried to haul in our sheet ; but a sudden flaw striking us once , the boat lay over till she buried her gunwales , and the sea broke heavily over her lee side , and the crew at the same time springing in a body to the weather side , to balance her , brought her over suddenly , so that it was a miracle we were not capsized ; which , had it happened so far out at sea in the darkness , would have made an end of us . Indeed , it was as much as we could ( 10 , by baling continually , to keep her afloat , and every moment we expected to be buried in a watery grave . For the reason that we feared the tide or current , which set against us , might carry us off beyond reach of the land , we kept up our sail as long as we could , thinking that while we made headway toward the lee of the island , we increased our chance of safety Moreover we knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we had neither water nor provisions left . At best our position was peril ous . Ignorant of the bearings of the harbor , we qwq harbor , we could lie off a short distance and wait till daylight . This plan was so reasonable that none could object to it . As soon as we were well in by the shore , where the gale was cut off by the mountains , we had a light eddy of air in our favor , which induced us to keep up our sail . We soon found the danger of this . A strong flaw from a gap in the land struck us suddenly , and would have capsized us had we not let go every thing , and clung to the weather gunwale till it was over , when we quickly pulled down the sail , and took to the oars . We could see nothing on our starboard but the wild seas as they rolled off into the dark- qwq a ship-neighbor of mine , succeeded in light mg the lantern again , which he held out in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light upon the rocks that we might grope out our way and reach some place of safety ; but it only seemed to make the darkness thicker than it was before . We therefore concluded it was best to pull on till we rounded a point some few miles ahead , where we thought there might be a cove . So we put out the light and got Paxton to go in the bow as a look-out , he being the most keen-sighted , from the habit of looking from the mast-head for whales . On turning the point we were qwq Greatly rejoiced by this discovery , we pulled ahead with a good will and rapidly bore down toward the light . Chilled through with the sharp gusts from the mountains , wet with spray , and very hungry , we congratulated ourselves that there were still inhabitants on the island , and we could not but think they would give us something to eat , and furnish us with some place of shelter . Captain Brooks had told us that he had been here several times in a whaler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast of Chili , and sometimes it was entirely deserted . The Chilians who frequented this lonely island we knew to be a very bad set of people , chiefly convicts and outcasts , who would not hesitate to rob and murder any stranger whom misfortune or the love of adventure might cast in their power . Pirates also , had frequented its bays from the time of the buccaneers : and it was a question with us whether the light was made by these outlaws , or by some unfortunate shipwrecked sailors or deserters from some English or American whale-ship . The better to provide against danger we loaded our two guns , and placed them in the bow , as also the harpoon ; upon which we steered for the light . All of a sudden it disappeared , as if quenched by water . This was a new source of trouble . What could it mean There was no doubt w* had all seen it . The early voyagers had often seen strange li* , hts at night on the tops of the mountains , which they attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , and was too well ( lefined and too distinctly visible to us all , either to be a supernatural visitation or the result of some volcanic eruption . While we lay upon our oars wonderin* what it meant , it again appeared , brighter than before . Now , if the inhabitants were not pirates or freebooters why did they pursue this mysterious conduct We suspected that they heard our oars , and had lit a fire on the beach to guide us ashore , but if they wanted us to land in the right place , why did they put out the light and start it up again so strangely For half an hour it continued thus to disappear and reappear at short intervals in the same mysterious way , for which none of us could account . It being now about four o'clock in the morning , we felt so cast down by fatigue and dread of death , that we decided to run in at all hazards , and if necessary make our way through the breakers . All hands fell to upon the oars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the head . Paxton , who was in the bow , quickly started up , and began peering sharply through the gloom . " What 's that * " said he , " look there , my lads . I see something black ; do n't you soe it-there , on the larboard-it looks to me like the hull of a ship ! Pull , my lads , pull and so all gave way with a will , and in a few minutes the tall masts of a vessel loomed up against the sky within a hundred yards ! I shall never for5et the joy of the whole party at that sight . The light which we had seen , came from a lamp that swung in the lower rigging , and though the ship might be a Chilian convict vessel , or some other craft as little likely to give us a pleasant reception , yet we were too glad to think of that ; and straightway pulled up under her stern and hailed her . For a moment there was a pause , as our voices broke upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a voice answered us in clear sailor-like English , " Boat ahoy ! where are you from ? ' " The ship Anteus , " said we , " hound for California ; what ship is this B ' " The Brooklyn , of New York , bound for California ! Come on board No longer able to suppress our joy , we gave vent to three hearty cheers ; cheers so loud and genuine that they swept over the waters of Juan Fernandez , and went rolling up the valleys in a thousand echoes . In less than five minutes we were all on deck , thankful for our Providential deliverance from the horrors of that eventful night . FIRST IMPRE55ION5 OF THE IsLANn . The decks of the Brooklyn presented a strange and half-savage scene . Most of the passengers aroused from their sleep by the shouts of the officers and crew , had rushed upon deck nearly naked , and quite at a loss to know what had happened . While we were answering some of their questions , Captain Richardson , the master , pushed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise was about . We speedily explained how we had left the Anteus seventy miles out at sea , and how through the aid of Providence we had made our way into the harbor and descried the ship 's lamp ; declaring at the same time our belief that had we missed the ship , in all probability we would have been dashed to pieces upon the rocks . We then made ourselves known personally to the captain , who was well acquainted with some of the party . He cordially welcomed us on board and invited us into his cabin , where we gave him a more detailed account of our adventure . Meantime the cook was ordered to get us some breakfast as soon as possible , and Captain Richardson offered us dry clothes , and administered to our wants in the kindest manner . Nor was it long till we felt exceedingly comfortable considering the previous circumstances . ' We soon had breakfast , which , after our toils and troubles , was truly a Godsend . Some of the finest fish I ever ate was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and coffee boiling hot . It was ( ICvoured with a most uncommon relish , as you may suppose ; and it was none the less agreeable for being seasoned with pleasant conversation . The captain admitted that in all his seafaring he had never known of any thing more absurd than our adventure , and that it was a miracle we were not every one lost . All the passengers crowded around us as if we had risen from the depths of the sea , and I fancied they examined us as if they had an idea that we were some kind of sea-monsters . The Brooklyn lay at anchor about half a mile from the boat-landing . At the dawn of day I was on deck , looking eagerly toward the island . // qwq Never shall I forget the strange delight with which I gazed upon that isle of romance ; the unfeigned rapture I felt in the anticipation of exploring that miniature world in the desert of waters , so fraught with the happiest associations of youth ; so remote from all the ordinary realities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most fascinating of all the dreams of fancy . Many foreign lands I had seen ; many islands scattered over the broad ocean , rich and wondrous in their romantic beauty ; many glens of Utopian loveliness ; mountain heights weird and impressive in their sublimity ; but nothing to equal this in variety of outline and undefinable richness of coloring ; nothing so dreamlike , so wrapt in illusion , so strange and absorbing in its novelty . Great peaks of reddish rock seemed to pierce the sky wherever I looked ; a thousand rugged ridges swept upward toward the centre in a perfect maze of enchantment . It was all wild , fascinating , and unreal . The sides of the mountains were covered with patches of rich grass , natural fields of oats , and groves of myrtle and pimento . Abrupt walls of rock rose from the watef to the height of a thousand feet . The surf broke in a white line of foam along the shores of the bay and its measured swell floated upon the air like the voice of a distant cataract . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls were scattered over each eminence ; and the straw hats of the inhabitants were almost embosomed in trees , in the midst of the valley , and jets of smoke arose out of the groves and floated off gently in the calm air of the morning . In all the shore , but one spot , a single opening among VOL . VI. - No. 33. -U the rocks , seemed accessible to man . The rest of the coast within view consisted of fearful cliffs overhanging the water ; the ridges from which sloped upward as they receded inland , forming a variety of smaller valleys above , which were strangely diversified with woods and grass , and golden fields of wild oats . Close to the water 's edge , was the dark moss*covered rock , forever moist with the bright spray of the ocean , and above it cleft in countless fissures by earthquakes in times past , the red burnt earth ; and there were gorges through which silvery springs coursed , and cascades fringed with banks of shrubbery ; and still higher the slopes were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow of the early sunlight , almost dazzled the eye ; and round about through the xalleys and on the hill-sides , the groves of myrtle , pimento , and corkwood were draped in green , glittering with raindrops after the storm , and the whole air was tinged with ambrosial tints , and filled with sweet odors : nothing in all the island and its shores , as the sun rose and cast off the mist ; but seemed to suffer a sea.clmange Into something rich and strange . " GOING ASHORE . No longer able to control our enthusiasm , , we sprang into the boat and pushed off for the . landing . Captain Richardson , who was well ac* quainted with the ruins of the Chilian settlement , joined us in our intended excursion , and we were accompanied also by a few sporting passengers fiom the Brooklyn in another boat&gt; The waters of the hay are of crystal clearness , : we saw the bottom as we dashed over the swell , .

Why , I tell you , my dear friends , all the gold of California was not worth the ecstatic bliss of that moment ! CONDITION OF THE ISLAND IN 1849 We first went up to a blurn about half-a-mile from the boat-landing , where we spent an hour in exploring the ruins of the fortifications , built by the Chilians in 1767 . There was nothing left but the foundation and a portion of the rainparts of the principal fort , partly imbedded in banks of clay , and nearly covered with moss and weeds . It was originally strongly built of large stones , which were cast down in every direction , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained perfect was the front wall of the main rampart and the groundwork of the fort . Not far from these ruins we found the convict-cells , which we explored to some extent . These cells are dug into the brow of a hill , facing the harbor , and extend underground to the distance of several hundred feet , in the form of passages and vaults , resembling somewhat the Catacombs of Rome . During the penal settlement established here by the Chilian government , the convicts , numbering sometimes many hundreds , were confined in these gloomy dungeons , where they were subjected to the most barbarous ireatment . The gates or doors by which the entrances were secured , had all been torn down and destroyed ; and the excavations were now occupied only by wild-goats , bats , Pardon the fondness with which I linger upon these recollections , reader ; for I was one who had fought for poor Robinson in my boyish days , as the greatest hero that ever breathed the breath of life ; who had always , even to man 's estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great , Julius Cnsar , and all the warriors of antiquity were common-place persons compared with him ; that Napoleon Bona parte , the Duke of Wellington , Colonel John . son , Tecumseh , and all the noted statesmen and warriors of modern times , were not to be men tioned in the same day with so extraordinary a man ; I who . had always regar ( led him as the most truthful and the very sublimest of adven turers , was now the entranced beholder of his abiding place-walking , breathing , thinking , and seeing on the very spot !

Rank fern hung upon the sides ; overhead was dripping with a cold and deathlike sweat , and slimy drops coursed down the weeds , and the air was damp and chilly : thick darkness was within in the depths beyond ; darkness that no wandering gleam from the light of day ever reached-for heaven never smiled upon those dreary abodes of sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the worst criminals , were dug still deeper underground , and rough stairways of earth led down into them , which were shut out from the upper vaults by strong doors . The size of these lower dungeons was not more than five or six feet in length , by four or five in height ; from which some idea may be formed of the sufferings endured by the poor wretches confined in them ; shut out from the light of heaven , loaded with heavy irons , crushed down by dank and impenetrable walls of earth , starved and beaten by their cruel guards ; with no living soul to pity them in their woe , no hope of release save in death . We saw , by the aid of a torch , deep holes scratched in one of the walls , bearing the impression of human fingers . It might have been that some unhappy murderer , goaded to madness by such cruel tortures of body and terrible anguish of mind , as drive men to tear even their own flesh when buried before the vital spark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his desperation , and left the marks in his death agonies upon the clay that entombed him , to tell what no human heart but his had suffered there , no human ear had heard , no human eye had witnessed . The deep , startling echo breaking upon the heavy air , as we sounded the walls , seemed yet to mingle with his curses , and its last sepulchral throb was like the dying moan of the maniac . Some time before the great earthquake , which destroyed the fortifications and broke up the penal colony , a gang of convicts , amounting to three hundred , succeeded in liberating themselves from their cells . Unable to endure the cruelties inflicted upon them , they broke loose from their chains , and rushing upon the guards , murdered the greater part of them , and , finally , seized the garrison . For several days , they held complete possession of the island . A whale-ship , belonging to Nantucket , happening to come in at the time for wood and water , they seized the captain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as the vessel could contain . About two hundred were put on board . They then threatened the captain and officers with instant death , in case of any failure to land them on the coast of Peru , whither they determined to go , in order to escape the vengeance of the Chilian government . Desirous of getting rid of them as soon as possible , the captain of the whaler ran over for the first land on the coast of Chili , where he put them ashore , leaving them ignorant of their position until they were unable to regain the vessel . They soon discovered that they were only thirty miles from Valparaiso ; but short as the distance was from the Chilian authorities . they evaded all attempts to capture them , and eventually joined the Peruvian army , which was then advancing upon Santiago . The remainder of the prisoners left upon the island , escaped in different vessels , and were scattered over various parts of the world . Only a few out of the entir* number engaged in the massacre were ever captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were shot in the public plaza of Santiago . Turning our steps toward the settlement of the present residents , we passed a few hours very agreeably in rambling about among their rustic abodes . The total number of inhabitants at this period ( 1849 ) , is sixteen : consisting of William Pearce , an American , and four or five Chilian men , with their wives and children . No others have lived permanently uponthe island for several years . There are in all some six or seven huts , pleasantly surrounded by shrubbery , and well supplied with water from a spring : These habitations are built of the straw of wildoats , interwoven through wattles or long sticks , sad CHILIAN HUTS . CONVICT CELLS . // thatched with the same ; and whether from design or accident , are extremely picturesque .

Seen through the green shrubberies that abound in every direction , the bright yellow of the cottages , and the smoke curling up in the still air , have a very cheerful effect ; and the prattling voices of the children , mingled with the lively bleating of the kids , and the various pleasant sounds of domestic life , might well lead one to think , that the seclusion of these islanders from the busy world is not without its charms . Small patches of ground , fenced with rude stone walls and brush-wood , are attached to each of these primitive abodes ; and rustic gateways , overrun with wild and luxuriant vines , open in front . Very little attention , however , appears to be bestowed upon the cultivation of the soil ; but it looks rich and productive , and might be made to yield abundant crops by a trifling expenditure of labor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any evidence here that they depart from their usual philosophy in taking the world easy . Even the American seemed to have caught the prevailing lethargy , and to be content with as little as possible . Vegetables of various kinds grow abundantly wherever the seeds are thrown ; among which I noticed excellent radishes , turnips , beets , cabbages , and onions . Potatoes of a very good quality , though not large , are grown in small quantities ; and , regarding the natural productiveness of the earth , there seemed to be no reason why they should not be cultivated in sufficient quantities to supply the demands of vessels touching for supplies , and thereby made a profitable source of revenue to the settlers . The grass and wild-oats grow in wonderful luxuriance in all the open spaces , and require little attention ; and stich is the genial character of the climate , that the cattle , of which there seems to be no lack , find ample food to keep them in good condition , both in winter and summer .

The peaches were just out of season when we arrived ; but we obtaiiied a few which had been peeled and dried in the sun , and we found them large and of excellent flavor . Many of the valleys abound in natural orchards , which have sprung from the seeds planted there by the early voyagers , especially by Lord Ansun , who appeared to have taken more interest in the cultivation and settlement of the island than any previous navigator . The disasters experienced by the vessels of this distinguished adventurer in doubling- Cape Horn , caused him to make Juan Fernandez a rendezvous for the recruiting of his disabled seamen ; and for many months he devoted his attention to the production of such vegetables and fruits as he found useful in promoting their recovery ; and having likewise in view the misfortunes and necessities of those who might come after him , he caused to be scattered over the island large quantities of seeds , so that by their increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all future voyagers . He also left ashore many different sorts of domestic animals , in order that they might propagate and become general throughout the island , for the benefit of shipwrecked mariners , vessels in distress for provisions , and colonists who might hereafter form a settlement there . The philanthropy and moral greatness of these benevolent acts , from which the author could expect to derive little or no advantage during life , can not be too highly commended . If posthumous gratitude can be regarded as a reward , Lord Anson has a just claim to it . How many lives have been saved ; how many weather-worn mariners , bowed down with disease , have been renewed in health and strength ; how many unhappy castaways have found food abundantly , where all they could expect was a lingering death ; and have been sustained in their exile , and restored at last to their friends and kindred , through the unselfish benevolence of this brave and kind-hearted navigator , no written record exists to tell ; but there arc records graven upon the hearts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of good deeds and their reward , more eloquent than human hand hath written . Besides peaches , quinces , and other fruits common in temperate climates , there is a species of palm called C/mu/a , which produces a fruit of a very rich flavor . Among the different varieties of trees are corkwood , sandal , myrtle , and pimento . The soil in some of the valleys on the north side is wonderfully rich , owing to deposits of burnt earth and decayed vegetable matter , washed down from the mountains . There is but little level ground on the island , and although the area of tillable soil is small , yet by the culture of vineyards on the hill-sides , the grazing of sheep and goats on the mountain steeps , and the proper cultivation of the arable valleys , a population of several thousand might subsist comfortably . Pearce , the American , who had thoroughly explored every part of the island , told me he had no doubt three or four thousand people could subsist here without any supply of provisions from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing that way , . by means of which potatoes , fruits , and other refreshments , could be bartered for groceries and clothing . Herds of wild cattle now roam over these beautiful valleys ; fine horses may be seen prancing about in gangs , with all the freedom of the mustang ; goats in numerous flocks abound among the cliffs ; pigeons and other game are abundant ; and wild dogs are continually prowling around the settlement . - // The few inhabitants at present on the island subsist chiefly upon fish , vegetables , and goatflesh , of which they have an ample supply . Boatloads of the finest cod , rock-fish , cullet , lobsters , and lamprey-eels , can be caught in a few hours all around the shores of Cumberland Bay , and doubtless as plentifully in the other bays . Nothing more is necessary than merely the trouble of hauling them out of the water . We fished only for a short time , and nearly filled our boat with the fattest fish I ever saw . Had I not tested myself a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding the abundance of the smaller sorts of fish , I could never have believed it-that they will nibble at one 's hand if it be put in the water alongside the boat , and a slight ripple made to attract their attention . This is a remarkable truth , which can be attested by any person who bas visited these shores and made the experiment . There is no place among the cliffs where goats may not be seen at all times during the day . They live and propagate in the caves , and find sufficient browsing throughout the year in the clefts of the rocks . Lord Anson mentions that some of his hunting parties killed goats which had their ears slit , and they thought it more than probable that these were the very same goats marked by Alexander Selkirk thirty years before ; so that it is not unlikely there still exist some of the direct descendants of the herds domesticated by the original Crusoe . The residents of Cumberland Bay have about their huts a considerable number of these animals , tamed , for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or skins ( for they often kill them merely for their skins ) , they go in a body to Goat Island , where they surround the goats and drive them over a cliff into the sea . As soon as they have driven over a sufficient number they take to their boat again , and catch them in the water . Some of them they bring home alive , and keep them till they require fresh meat . Nor are these people destitute of the rarer luxuries of life . By furnishing whale-ships that touch for supplies of water and vegetables with such productions as they can gather up , they obtain in exchange offee , ship-bread , flour , and clothing ; and lately they have been doing a good business in rowing the passengers ashore from the California vessels , and selling them goat-skins and various borts of curiosities . They also charge a small iuty for keeping the spring of water clear , and the boat-landing free from obstructions ; and sometimes obtain a trifle in the way of port-. charges , in virtue of some pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juan Fernandez abound in many different kinds of marine animals , among which the chief are seals and walruses . Formerly sealing vessels made it an object to touch for the purpose of capturing them , but of late years they have become rather scarce ; and at present few if any vessels visit the island for that purpose . Situated in the latitude of 330 40 ' 5. , and longitude 79 W. , the climate is temperate and salubrious-never subject to extremes either of heat or cold . In the valleys fronting north , the temperature seldom falls below 500 Far . in the coldest season . Open at all times to the pleasant breezes from the ocean , without malaria or any thing to produce disease , beautifully diversified in scenery , and susceptible of being made a convenient stopping-place for vessels bound to the great Northwestern Continent , it would be difficult to find a more desirable place for a colony of intelligent and industrious people , who would cultivate the land , build good houses , and turn to advantage all the gifts of Providence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawback , is the want of a large and commodious harbor , in which vessels could be hauled up for repairs . Thisisland could never answer any other purpose than that of acasual stopping-place for vessels in want of refreshments , and for this it seems peculiarly adapted . The principal harbors are , Port English , on the south side , visited by Lord Anson in 1741 ; Port Juan , on the west ; and Cumberland Bay , on the north side . The latter is the best , and is most generally visited , in consequence of being on the fertile side of the island , where water also is most easily obtained . None of them afford a very secure anchorage , the bottom being deep and rocky ; and vessels close to the shore are exposed to sudden and violent flaws from the mountains , and the danger of being driven on the rocks by gales from the ocean . In Cumberland Bay , however , there are places where vessels can ride in safety , by choosing a position suitable to the prevailing winds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anson will be found useful to navigators who design stopping at Juan Fernandez . ROBINSON cRusoE 's CAVE . Our next expedition was to Robinson Crusoe 's Cave . How it obtained that name , I am unable to say . The people ashore spoke of it confidently as the place where a seafaring man had lived for many years alone ; and I believe most mariners who have visited the island have fixed upon that spot as the actual abode of Alexander Selkirk . There are two ways of getting to the cave from the regular boat-landing ; one over a high chain of cliffs , intervening between Crusoe 's Valley , or the valley of the cave , and the Chilian huts iiear the landing ; the other by water . The route by land is somewhat difficult ; it requires wALRUs , as BEA LION . // half a day to perform it , and there is danger of being dashed to pieces by the loose earth giving way . In many parts of the island the surface of the cliffs is composed entirely of masses of burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll down , carrying every thing with them . Numerous cases are related by the early voyagers of . accidents to seamen and others , in climbing over these treacherous heights . The distance by water is only two miles , and by passing along under the brow of the cliffs a very vivid idea may be had of their strange and romantic formation . We had our guns with us , which we did not fail to use whenever there was an opportunity ; but the game , consisting principally of wild goats , kept so far out of reach on the dizzy heights , that they passed through the ordeal in perfect safety . Some of us wanted to go by land and shoot them from above , thinking the bullets would carry farther when fired downward than they seemed to carry when fired from below The rest of the party had so little confidence in our skill , that they dissuaded us from the attempt , on the pretense that the ship might heave in sight while we were absent . A pleasant row of half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only landing place is upon an abrupt bank of rocks , and the surf breaking in at this part of the shore rather heavily , we had to run the boat up in regular beach-comber style . Riding in on the back of a heavy sea , we sprang out as soon as the boat struck , and held our ground , when , by watching our chance for another good sea , we ran her clear out of the water , and made her fast to a big rock for fear she might be carried away . ' . About two hundred yards from where we landed we found the cave . It lies in a volcanic mass of rock , forming the bluff or termination of a rugged ridge , and looks *s if it might be the doorway into the ruins of some grand old castle . The height of the entrance is about fifteen feet , and the distance back cRusos ' 5 cAvR. into the extremity twenty-five or thirty . It varies in width from ten or twelve to eighteen feet . Within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pockets dug into the sides , which it is probable were used for cupboards ' by the original occupant . There were likewise large spike nails driven into the rock , upon which we thought it likely clothing , guns , and household utensils might have been hung even at as remote a date as the time of Selkirk , for they were very rusty , and bore evidence of having been driven into the rock a long time ago . A sort of stone oven , with a sunken place for fire underneath , was partly visible in the back part of the cave ; so that by digging away the earth we uncovered it , and made out the purpose for which it was built . There was a darkish line , about a foot wide , reaching up to the roof of the cave , which by removing the surface a little , we discovered to be produced originally by smoke , cemented in some sort by a drip that still moistened the wall , and this we found came through a hole in the top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with deposits of earth and leaves from the mountain above . In rooting about the fireplace , so as to get away the loose rubbish that lay over it , one of our party brought to light an earthen vessel , broken a little on one side , but otherwise perfect . It was about eight inches in diameter at the rim , and an inch or two smaller at the bottom , and had some rough marks upon the outside , which we were unable to decipher , on account of the clay which covered it . Afterward , we took it out and washed it in a spring near by , when we contrived to decipher one letter and a part of another , with a portion of the date . The rest unfortunately was on the piece which had been broken off , and which we were unable to find , although we searched a long time , for as may be supposed we felt curious to know if it was the handiwork of Alexander Selkirk . For my own part I had but little doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own hands , and the rcaron I thought so was that the parts of the letters and date which we deciphered corresponded with his name and the date of his residence , and likewise because it was evident that it must have been imbedded in the ground out of which we dug it long beyond the memory of any living man . I was so convinced of this , and so interested in the discovery , that I made a rough drawing of it on the spot , of which I have since been very glad , inasmuch as it was accidentally dropped out of the boat afterward , and lost in the sea . // CRUSOE-LIFE . We searched in vain for other relics of the kind , but all we could find were a few rusty was covered with foam , and the surf beat against the l ) oint beyond the cove and flew up in the air . to a prodigious height in white clouds of spray . Large birds wheeled about over the rocky heights , . sometimes diving suddenly into the water , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward in the sunlight , their wings seemed to sparkle with jewels out of the ocean . Following the curve of the horizon , the view is suddenly cut off by a huge cliff of lava that rise* directly out of the water to the height of twelve or fifteen hundred feet .

A stream of pure spring water rippled down over the rocks , and wound through the centre of the yalley ; breaking out at intervals into bright cascades , which glimmered freshly in the warm rays of the sun ; its margins were fringed with rich grass and fragrant flowers , and groves of myrtle overhung the little lakelets that were made in its course , and seemed to linger there like mirrored beauties spell-bound . Ridges of amber-colored earth , mingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains on every side and converged into the valley as if attracted by its romantic beauties . Immense masses of rock , cast off from the towering cliffs , by some dread convulsion of the elements , had fallen from the heights , and now lay nestling in the very bosom of the valley , etmamored with its charms . Even the birds of the air seemed spell-bound within this enchanted circle ; their songs , were low This cave is now occupied only by wild goats and bats , and had not been visited , perhaps , by any human being , until recently , more than once or twice in half a century ; and then probably only by some deserter from a whaleship , who preferred solitude and the risk of starvation to the cruelty of a brutish captain .

DAY-DREAMS OF ROBINSON CRUSOE . Some of us scattered off into the woods of myrtle , or lay down by the spring in the pleasant shade of the trees and bathed our faces and drank of the cool water ; others went up the hill-sides in search of peaches . or gathered seeds and specimens of wild flowers to carry home . Too happy in the change , after our gloomy passage round Cape Horn , I rambled up the valley alone , and dreamed glowing day-dreams of Robinson Crusoe .

RESCUE OF FRIDAY . DREAM-LAND CRIYSOE. // CRUSOE-LIFE. the fancy of a dreaming youth . Well I remembered , too , the favored few that I let into the secret ; how we went every afternoon to a sandbar , and called it Crusoe 's island ; how I was Robinson Crusoe , and the friend of my heart Friday , whom I caused to be painted from head to foot with black mud , as also the rest of my friends ; and then the battles we had ; the devouring of the dead tnen ; the horrible dances , and chasing into the water ; and , above all , the rescue of my beloved Friday-how vividly I saw those scenes again Years passed on ; I was a sailor before the mast Alas , what a sad reality !

Yet the dream was not ended ! Bright and beautiful as ever seemed to me that little world upon the seas , where dwelt in solitude the shipwrecked mariner .

There was a sudden rustling in the bushes . " Hallo , there ! " shouted a voice . I looked round , and beheld a fellow-passenger ; a strange eccentric man , who was seldom known to laugh , and whose chief pleasure consisted in reducing every thing to the practical standard of common sense . He was deeper than would appear at first sight , and not a bad sort of person at heart , but a little wayward and desponding in his views of life . " You 'll catch cold , " said he ; " nothing gives a cold so quick as sitting on the damp ground . " " True , " said I , smiling , " but recollect the romance of the thing .

You 'll lose them before you get half-way to America . " " No matter-they cost nothing . Lend me your knife , and we 'll try the experiment at all events .

On our way back to the cave , as we emerged from the grove , I was astonished to see the entire valley in a blaze of fire . It raged and crackled up the sides of the mountains , blazing wildly and filling the whole sky with smoke .

It was a damp and gloomy place enough ; reeking with mould , and smelling very strong of strange animals . The rocks hung gaping over our heads , as if ready to fall down upon us at the mere sound of our voices ; the ground was covered with dirty straw , left there probably by some deserters from a whale-ship , and all around the sides were full of holes , which we supposed from the smell must be inhabited by foxes , rats , and , perh* ps , snakes , though we were afterward told there were no reptiles on the island .

" Upon which , having made this acknowledgment , we let him alone , and he turned over and went to sleep . We now pricked up our lamp , and prepared to follow his example , when a question arose as to the propriety of standing watches during the night  --  a precaution thought necessary by some in consequence of the treacherous character of the Spaniards . There were eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . For my part , I thought there was not much danger , and proposed letting every man who felt uneasy stand watches for himself . We had labored without rest for thirty-six hours , and I was willing to trust to Providence for safety , and make the most of our time for sleeping . A majority being of the same opinion , the plan of standing watches was abandoned ; and having loaded our two guns , we placed them in a convenient position commanding the mouth of the cave . I got the harpoon and stood it up near me , for I had made up my mind to fasten on to the first Spaniard that came within reach . ATTACK OF THE ROBBERS . Scarcely had we closed our eyes , and fallen into a restless doze , when a nervous gentleman in the party rose up on his hands and knees , and cautiously uttered these words : " Friends , do n't you think we 'd better put out the light . The Spaniards may be armed , and if they come here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll be sure to take aim at our heads . " " Sure enough , " whispered two or three at once . " We did n't think of that ; they ca n't see us in the dark , however , unless they have eyes like cats . Let us put out the light by all means . " So with that we were about to put out the light , when the man who had doubts in regard to Robinson Crusoe , rose up on his hands and knees likewise , and said : " Hold on ! I think you 'd better not do that . It ai n't policy . I do n't believe in it myself . " " Confound it , sir , " cried half-a-dozen voices angrily , " you do n't believe in any thing ! What 's the reason you do n't believe in it 3 Eh 3 what 's the reason , sir 3 " " Well , I 'll tell you why . Because , if you put out the light , we ca n't see where to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I feel certain of any thing , it is , that I 'd be the first man shot ; it 's my luck . I know I 'd be a dead man before morning . " There was something in this suggestion not to be laughed at . The most indignant of us felt the full force of it . To shoot our enemies in self-defense seemed reasonable enough ; but to shoot any of our own party , even the man who doubted Robinson Crusoe , would be a very serious calamity . At last , after a good deal of talk , we compromised the matter by putting the lamp under an old hat with a hole in the top . This done , we tried to go to sleep . Brigham went to the mouth of the cave about midnight to take an observation . He was armed with one of the guns . " What 's that 3 " said he , sharply ; " I hear something !

" " Ahoy there ! What do you want 3 Answer quick , or I 'll shoot you ! Speak ! or you 're a dead man All hands were now in commotion . We rushed to the mouth of the cave in a body , determined to defend ourselves to the last extremity . Gentlemen , " cried Brigham , a little confused , " It 's a goat ! I see him now , in the rays of the moon ; a live goat , coming down the cliff .

" " Then you 'd better go and satisfy yourself , if you 're not afraid . " The Doubter did so . He walked a few steps toward the object , so as to get sight of its outline , and then returned , saying : " That thing there is n't a goat at all ; neythex is it a chicken .

Bushes do n't walk about of nights any more than they do in the day-time . I never did believe in it from the beginning , and I told you so , but you would n't listen to me . " We said nothing in reply to this , but returned into the cave and lay down again upon the sail .
