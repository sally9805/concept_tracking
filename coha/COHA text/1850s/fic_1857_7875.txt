Smith , Samuel Francis , 1808-1895 : I AM READY TO FLY . from I am ready to fly ( 1857 ) Footnote : 1Kb Ready now to spread my pinions , Glad to wing my flight away , From the gloom that hovers round me , To the realms of endless day . Ready am I , washed and pardoned ; Ready am I , freed from sin ; Ready to complete the conflict ; Ready heavenly joy to win ;  --  Ready over death to triumph , And to tread the tempter down ; Ready life and bliss t ' inherit , And to wear the glorious crown ; Ready to be freed from sorrow , Tears and parting , toil and pain ; Ready for the heavenly mansion  --  Life is dear , but death is gain ;  --  Ready to forsake the shadows Of the night so dim and long ; Ready for my harp of glory ; Ready for the angels ' song ; Ready , with salvation 's banner , To ecstatic joys to rise ; Ready for the glad hosanna In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect , Clothed in robes of life to be , Swelling the enraptured chorus , Singing " joy " and " victory . " Heavenly messengers are round me ; Hark ! their voices bid me come : " Earth and time too long have bound thee ; Sister spirit , welcome home . " Glad I go  --  my toil is finished ; Broke at last my earthly spell ; Upward now my soul is tending  --  " Earth , and time , and death , farewell . " As the bird with warbling music Soars above our feeble sight , Singing still , and still ascending , Melting in the glorious light , So the dying saint , departing , Joyful took her heavenward way , Life , and time , and gladness blending In the light of perfect day .
