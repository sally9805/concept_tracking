228 WRAT CONSTITUTES REAL FREEDOM OF TRADE ? * CHAPTER IL THE reader has seen that the modern English political economy is founded on a basis directly the opposite of that upon which rests the system of Ad am Smith , and that the tendency of the two is in a precisely opposite direction . Nevertheless , both profess to teach the advantage of perfect freedom of trade . Thus , Mr. McCulloch says of the author of the Wealth of Nations , that he showed " in opposition to the commonly received opinions of the merchants , politicians , and statesmen of his time , that wealth does not consist in the abundance of gold and silver , but in the abundance of the various necessaries , conveniences , and enjoyments of human life ; that it is in every case sound policy to leave individuals to pursue their own interest in their own way ; that in prosecuting branches of industry advantageous to themselves , they necessarily prosecute such as are , at the same time , advantageous to the public ; and that every regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine the species of commercial intercourse between different parts of the same country , or between distant and independent countries , is impolitic and pernicious-injurious to the rights of individuals  --  and adverse to the progress of real opulence and lasting prosperity . " t Nevertheless , while thus agreeing with Dr. Smith as to the advantage of perfect freedom of trade , Mr. McCulloch thought that his t Principles of Political Economy . Introduction . * The following additional extracts from Smith 's Wealth of Nations , are necessary to complete the sense of page 137 , of article entitled " What Constitutes Real Freedom of Trade 1 " in the last number ( August ) : " The monopoly of the colony trade , besides , by forcing towards it a much greater proportion of the capital of Great Britain than what would naturally have gone to it , seems to have broken altogether that natural balance which would otherwise have taken place among all the different branches of British industry . The industry of Great Britain , instead of being accommodated to a great number of small markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her commerce , instead of running in a great number of small channels , has been taught to run principally in one great channel . But the whole system of her industry and commerce has thereby been rendered less secure ; the whole state of her body politic less healthful than it otherwise would have been . In her present condition , Great Britain resembles one of those unwholesome bodies in which some of the vital parts are overgrown , and which , upon that account , are liable to many dangerous disorders , scarce incident to those in which all the parts are more properly proportioned . A small stop in that great blood-vessel , which has been artificially swelled beyond its natural dimensions , and through which an unnatural proportion of the industry and commerce of the country has been forced to circulate , is very likely to bring on the most dangerous disorders upon the whole body politic . The expectation of a rupture with the colonies , accordingly , has struck the people of Great Britain with more terror than they ever felt for a Spanish armada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether well or ill grounded , which rendered the repeal of the stamp act , among the merchants at least , a popular measure . In the total exclusion from the colony market , was it to last only for a few years , the greater part of our merchants used to fancy that they foresaw an entire stop to their trade ; the greater part of our master manufacturers , the entire ruin of their business ; and this greater part of our workmen , an end of their employment . A rupture with any of our neighbors upon the continent , though likely , too , to occasion some stop or interruption in the employments of some of all these different orders of people , is foreseen , however , without any such general emotion . The blood , *f which the circulation is stopt in some of the smaller vessels , easily disgorges itself into the greater , // 229 work , " however excellent in many respects , " still contained " many errors , " and those of " no slight importance . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that in prosecuting such branches of industry as are most advantageous to themselves , individuals necessarily prosecute such as are , at the same time , MOST advantageous to the public . His leaning to the system of M. Quesnay  --  a leaning perceptible in every part of his work-made him swerve from the sounder principles of his own system , so as to admit that the preference shown by individuals in favor of particular employments is not always a true test of their public advantageousness . He considered agriculture , though not the only productive employment , as the most pro ductive of any ; the home trade as more productive than a direct foreign trade ; and the latter than the carrying trade . It is clear , however , that these distinctions are all fundam*ntally erroneous . " - Ibid . Unhappily for the followers of Dr. Smith , of the modern English school , this " fundamental error " is the base on which rests his whole free-trade system , and in the effort to substitute another they totally lose sight of real freedom of trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was the mode of c*nploying labor and capital that tended most to facilitate the acquisition of " the necessaries , conveniences and enjoyments of life , " enabling the laborer most rapidly to improve his own condition , and to provide for the farther improvement of that of his children , and the result of his inquiries was to satisfy him that the natural tendency of man was towards agriculture , which could be improved only by bringing the mechanic and manufacturer to its aid , the place of exchange being thus brought to the neighborhood of the place of production . He saw clearly that when employed at home the same capital might perform many more exchanges than when employed at a distance , and that when the farmer and the mechanic exchanged on the spot there was a great economy of labor , and therefore that what was needed for the improvement of the condition of man was that he should be allowed to follow the bent of his " natural inclination , " which led inevitably to making manufactures and commerce the mere handmaids of agriculture  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the aids , and not the masters , of the producers . In his school , Commerce was not King . Comparing this natural system with that of England , he saw that the whole tendency of British policy was that of making agriculture " subsidiary " to commerce and manufactures , driving labor and capital from the profitable employment of producing commodities to be e*vc1ianged , to the without occasioning any dangerous disorder ; but , when it is stopt in any of the greater vessels , convulsions , apoplexy , or death , are the immediate and unavoidable consequences . If but one of those overgrown manufactures , which , by means either of bounties or of the monopoly of the home and colony markets , have been artificially raised up to any unnatural height , finds some small stop or interruption in its employment , it frequently occasions a mutiny and disorder alarming to government , and embarrassing even to the deliberations of the legislature . How great , therefore , would be the disorder and confusion , it was thought , which must necessarily be occasioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so great a proportion of our principal manufacturers ? " Some moderate and gradual relaxation of the laws which give to Great Britain the exclusive trade to the colonies , till it is rendered in a great measure free , seems to be the only expedient which can , in all future times , deliver her from this danger : which can enable her , or even force her , to withdraw some part of her capital from this overgrown employment , and to turn it , though with less profit , towards other employments ; and which , by gradually diminishing one branch of her industry , and gradually increasing all the rest , can , by degrees , restore all the different branches of it to that natural , healthful , and proper proportion , which perfect liberty necessarily establishes , and which perfect liberty can alone preserve . To open the colony trade all at once to all nations , might not only occasion some transitory inconveniency , but a great permanent loss , to the greater part of those whose industry or capital is at present engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even of the ships which import the eighty . two thousand hogsbaads of tobacco , which are over and above the consumption of Great Britain , might alone be felt very sensibly . Such are the unfortunate effects of all the regulations of the mercantile system . They not only introduce very dangerous disorders into the state of the body politic , but disorders which it is often difficult to remedy , without occasioning , for a time at least , still greater disorders . In what manner , therefore , the colony trade ought gradually to be opened ; what are the restraints which ought first , and what are those which ought last , to be taken away ; or in what manner the natural system of perfect liberty and justice ought gradually to be restored , we must leave to the wisdom of future statesmen and legislators to determine . " // far less profitable one of transporting and exchanging those produced in other lands , the great domestic trade being valued as merely **subsidiary** to a comparatively trivial foreign one , and that in the effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been led to the commission of acts of great injustice . Their fellow subjects of Ireland , and of the colonies , had been deprived of the exercise of " the right of employing their stock and industry in the way they might judge most advantageous for themselves , " in " manifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind , ** with " great discouragement " to their agriculture , and to the diminution of their power of producing commodities with which to trade . Fellow subjects at home had also been heavily taxed for the payment of bounties on the importation of various articles of raw produce , to " the great discouragement " of British agriculture , upon the improvement of which depended the power to increase the production of commodities to be given in exchange for those foreign ones required for the maintenance and improvement of their own condition . He saw clearly that this system was in opposition to man 's " natural incli* and that its direct effect was to produce an unnatural distribution of population , both at home and abroad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and capital . He therefore urged a change of system tending to permit the return of both to the great and profitable home market , regarding that as being the mode in which production might be increased , and the acquisition of the necessaries and comforts of life facilitated-and also as the mode in which the people of Great Britain would be rendered less liable to be affected by convulsions in other portions of the world . He thought the farm more productive of commodities than the ship . This it is that is denounced by Mr. MoCulloch and the whole of the school he represents , as " fundamentally erroneous , " and they advocate whatthey call freedom of trade , with the express view of carrying out the system which Dr. Smith denounced as being " fit only for a nation of shopkeepers , " because calculated to make Great Britain " the workshop of the world , " thereby rendering her dependent on the movements of foreign nations to an extent that is inconsistent with the secure employment of the rights of property , while preventing the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the discouragement of their agriculture , the diminution of their productive power , and consequent diminution of their power to maintain trade . Dr. Smith was right or he was not . If the former , then was Great Britain bound to abolish the system which he denounced , as tending to prevent improvement in the condition of both laborer and capitalist , and in case of her failure so to do , her colonies and the independent nations of the world owed it to themselves to resist the further continuance of such a system. - Colonists , bound by English laws , might , in perfect accordance with his views , associate for the purpose of refusing to purchase the commodities thus attempted to be forced upon them , and ultimately even take up arms with a view to throw off their dependence on the mother country , and thus place themselves in a position to assert " the most sacred right * that of exchanging their labor and its products at home instead of submitting to be compelled to seek a market abroad . Such in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their adoption is due the fact that they have prospered while all the other dependencies of Great Britain have been ruined . Non-importation agreements long preceded resort to arms , and when at length independence was established , some of the measures first adopted had special reference to this question . Laws for the protection of manufactures against the power of Great Britain , were then regarded as essentially necessary to the improvement of agriculture and the prosperity of the agricultural interest , and were especially favored by the middle , and most agricultural , states . It was believed that they tended to increase the power to produce , and consequently to increase the power to trade , by bringing the consumer to the side of the producer , and thus emancipating the great internal trade from English interferences , such as had been denounced by Dr. Smith . If he was right , so must have been the men by whom such measures were advocated . If Dr. Smith was notright , and he certainly was not if there is any truth in the theory // upon which rests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonists should have led them to devote themselves to agriculture , to the entire exclusion of all other pursuits . Sofar , indeed , were English lawsfrom being " a violation of the rights of mankind , " that their only effect would have been that of compelling them to do that which , had those laws never existed , their own interests would have led them voluntarily to do . The land of England was to be regarded as a machine of constantly decreasing power , while from the abundance of rich soils and the scarcity of population in the colonies , there could there exist no necessity for cultivating any but those which were most fertile , for which reason the most profitable course for the colonists would be to apply themselves exclusively to cultivation , remaining all producers on one side of the ocean , and thus aiding to bring about the conversion of the whole people of the other side into artizans , consumers of their products . They would , as do now the people of Canada and of India , usc the ships of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men and supply the looms of England . The more perfectly her prohibitory laws were enforced , and the more exclusively they could be compelled to devote themselves to agriculture the larger would be the return to labor . We have thus two systems , the antipodes of each other in every respect . The course of policy which they would dictate is directly opposite , and can not by any possibility produce the same results . To determine which is right , we must see the foundations on which they rest , and follow At the first period , when No. 1 alone is cultivated , second period , " No. 1 and 2 are cultivated , " third period , " No. 1,2 and 3 , fourth period , " No. 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , " fifth period , " No. 1 , 2 , 3,4 and 5 , " " sixth period , " No. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , " seventh period , " No. 1,2,3,4 , 5 , 6 and 7 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorption of the whole produce by the owner of the land , and to a steadily increasing inequality of condition ; the power of the laborer to consume the commodities which he produces steadily diminishing , while that of the landowner to claim them , as rent , is steadily increasing . them upwards , step by step . That done , we may be qualified to determine what constitutes real freedom of trade , and whyit is that the advocates of the system now known as " free trade , " are so generally obliged to depend upon their memories for their arguments , and their imaginations for their facts . The modem system is based upon the theory of Mr. Ricardo in relation to the occupation of land , which may be stated as follows : First : That in the commencement of cultivation , when population is small and land consequently abundant , the best soils , those capable of yielding the largest return , say one hundred quarters , to a given quantity of labor , alone are cultivated . Second : That with the progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necessity for cultivating that yielding a smaller return ; and that resort is then had to a second , and afterwards to a third and a fourth class of soils , yielding respectively ninety , eighty and seventy quarters to the same quantity of labor . Third : That with the necessity for applying labor less productively , which thus accompanies the growth of population , rent arises ; the owner of land No. 1 being enabled to demand and to obtain , in return for its use , ten quarters , when resort is had to that of second quality : twenty when No 3 is brought into use , and thirty when it becomes necessary to cultivate No. 4 . Fourth : That the proportion of the landlord tends thus steadily to increase as the productiveness of labor decreases , the division being as follows , to wit Total Product . 100 190 270 340 400 450 490 Labor . 100 180 240 280 300 300 280 Rent . 00 10 30 60 100 150 210 Fifth : Tbat this tendency towards a diminution in the return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propor-. tion , always exists where population increases , and most exists where population increases most rapidly ; but is in a certain degree counteracted by increase of wealth , producing improvement of cultivation . // Sixth : That every such improvement tends to retard the growth of rent , while every obstacle to improvement tends to increase that growth ; and that , therefore , the interests of the landowner and laborer are always opposed to each other , rent rising as labor falls , and vice versa . The necessary consequence of all this is that while the landlord is enriched , the laborer is supposed to experience constantly increasing difficulty in obtaining the necessaries and comforts of life , and the greater the tendency to association , the less must be the power of production , and the less the power to maintain trade . Population becomes daily more and more superabundant , and men arc more and more compelled to fly from each other , seeking abroad the subsistence that is denied to them at home , and the greater the tendency to fly from each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to trade . Arrived abroad , they are supposed to commence the work of cultivation on fertile soils , and to be enabled to obtain large wages , while those who remain at home are forced to waste their labor upon poor soils , yielding small returns , for which reason it is deemed highly advantangeous that the latter should employ themselves at the loom and the anvil while the former confine themselves to the plough , the former becoming all consumers , and the latter remaining all producers . Thus it has been that the political economists ofEngland have been enabled to satisfy themselves that the fundamental doctrines of Adam Smith were " erroneous , " and that free trade instead of indicating the adoption of measures tending to the localization of manufactures in ' the various countries of the world , looks to the adoption of measures tending to promote the centralization and monopoly of machinery in the island of Great Britain a course of policy regarded by Dr. Smith as tending to diminution in the productiveness of labor and capital , abroad and at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Mr. MeCulloch , " it is not enough to observe results in particular cases , or as they affect particular individuals ; we must further inquire whether these results are con8tant and universally applicable-whether the same circumstances which have given rise to them in one instance , would in every instance , and in society , be productive of si-* A theory which is inconsistcut with a uniform and constant fact must be erroneou5 . " The " uniform and constant * is direedy opposed to the theory upon which is built his whole system , while it is in perfect accordance with the views of Dr. Smith . The first poor cultivator jnvariably begins with poor machinery , and as invariably does it improve with every step in the progress of wealth and population . The man who has no cup takes up water in his hand , and little is obtained in exchange for much labor . Next he obtains a cup , and water becomes less costly . The arrival of the carpenter enables him to obtain a pump . Population grows again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from which eac*ii draws as much as is needed for himself , his house , his bath , and his water-closet , and the labor required to be given in exchange for all this water is not as great as in the outset was needed for obtaining the little that he drank himself . So with air and light . He begins with the wind-mill and the sail , and ultimately obtains the steam-engine and the steam-ship , and then it is that power becomes cheap . The gas works furnish light at a cost of labor that is infinitely small compared with that which was needed for the maintenance of the " little farthing rush light . " The poor man , widely separated from his fellow-man , uses wood , and heat is dear . With growing wealth and population coal is mined ) and the furnace heats the house at less cost of labor than had before been required for a single room . The first poor occupant of the land makes traps in which to take the wild animals by whom he is surrounded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes cheaper . The first clothes himself in skins , and clothing is dear . The second obtains cloth , and clothing becomes cheaper . The " constant and uniform fact " is , that in everything else than land man begins with the poorest machinery , and that with the growth of wealth and population , he proceeds onward towards the best , and we should be therefore warranted in supposing that such would be the case with land . Mr. Ricardo , Mr. Malthus , and Mr. MeCulloch however , assure us that such is not the case , and that , on the contrary , he comnaenc en , necessarily , the // work of cultivation on the best soils , leaving the poorer ones to his successors , whose powers of production diminish , therefore , with the growth of wealth and population . It is singular , that the fact that this supposed " observation of a particular result was at variance with our customary experience , " in regard to all other results connected with the appropriation of the powers of nature , had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " modify or reject " the principles laid down by Dr. Smith , which " account satisfactorily for the great number of appearances , " the test to which Mr. MeCulloch deemed it necessary to subject all theories . We , however , go further . We say that theories , to be received as true , must account for all the facts , and that any theory at variance with a single well-observed fact , is not true . To natural laws there are no exceptions . Mr. Ricardo and Mr. Malthus contented themselves with an effort to account for " the greater number of appearances , " and their successors have followed carefully in their footsteps , in establishing a theory in relation to land that is at variance with laws that we know to govern man in relation to fire , water , air , light , clothing , transportation , and every other of the things needed for the maintenance and improvement of his condition , the consequence of which is , that they have experienced a perpetual necessity for providing places of escape for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory . The reason of all this is that the theory itself is in opposition to the universal fact as our readers may satisfy themselves on any farm in the land . Let them inciuire , and they will find that the occupant did ; zot comnience in the fiats , or on the heavily timbered land , but that he did commence on the higher land where the timber was lighter , and the place for his house was dry . With increasing ability , he is found draining the swamps , clearing the heavy timber , turning up the marl , or burning the lime , and thus acquiring control over more fertile soils , yieldinga constant increase in the return to labor . Let them then trace the course of early settlement , and they will find it to have followed , and that invariably , the course of the streams , but keeping away from the swamps and river bottoms . The earliest set-233 tlements of the Union were on the poorest lands of the Union-those of New England . In South Carolina it has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their predecessors did not select the rich lands , and that millions of acres of the finest meadow land in that State still remain untouched . The settler in the prairies commences on the outer and poorer land , making his way , by slow degrees , to the richer and heavier soils of the centre . The lands below the mouth of the Ohio are among the richest in the world , yet they are unoccupied and will continue so to be until wealth and population shall have greatly increased . So is it now with the rich lands of Mexico . So was it in South America , the early occupation of which was upon the poor lands of the Western slope , Peru and Chili , while the rich lands of the Amazon and the La Plata remained , as most of them still remain , a wilderness . In the West Indies , the small dry islands were early occupied , while Porto Rico and Trinidad , abounding in rich soils remained untouched . The early occupants of England were found on . the poorer lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were those of Scotland in the Highlands , or on the little rocky islands of the channel . Mona 's Isle was celebrated while the rich soil of the Lothians remained a mass of timber , and the morasses of Lancashire were the terror of travellers long after Hampshire had been cleared and cultivated. - Cresar found the Gauls occupying the high lands surrounding the Alps , while the rich Venetia remained a marsh . The occupation of the Campagna followed long after that of the Samnite hills , and that of the poor soils of Attica long preceded the cultivation of the fat ones of the rich Bceotia . The occupation of the country round Thebes long preceded that of the lower lands surrounding Memphis , or the still lower and richer ones near Alexandria . The negro is found in the higher portions of Africa , while the rich lands along the river courses are unoccupied . The little islands of Australia , poor and dry , are occupied by a race far surpassing in civilization those of the neighboring continent , who have rich soils at command . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ancient Babylonia are only ridden over by straggling hordes of robbers . Layard had to seek the hills // 234 when he desired to find a people at home . The higher lands of Asia are peopled , while the deltas of the Ganges and the Indus are in a state of wilderness . Look where we may , it is the same . The land obeys the same great and universal law that governs light , air and heat . The man who works alone and has poor machinery must cultivate poor land , and content himself with little light , little power , and little heat , and those , like his food , obtained in exchange for much labor ; while he who works in combination with his fellow-men may have good machinery , enabling him to clear and eultivate rich land , giving him much food and enabling him to obtain much light , much heat , and much power in exchange for little labor . The first is a creature of necessity , and as such is man universally regarded by Mr. Ricardo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest , Mr. J. Stuart Mill , who , like his predecessors in this school , teaches that the neces3ities of man increase and his powers diminish with every increase of population . The second is a being of power , and as such is man regarded by Adam Smith , who taught that the more men worked in combination with each other the greater would be the facility of obtaining food and all other of the necessaries and comforts of life  --  and the more widely they were separated the less would be the return to labor and capital , and the smaller the power of production , as common sense teaches every man must necessarily be the case . The first poor cultivator commences , as we have seen , his operations on the hillside . Below him are lands upon which have been carried by force of water , the richer portions of those above , as well as the leaves of trees , and the fallen trees themselves , all of which have from time immemorial rotted and become incorporated with the earth , and thus have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor ; yet for this reason are they inaccessible . Their character exhibits itself in the enormous trees with which they are covered , and in their power of retaining the water necessary to aiJ the process of decomposition ; but the poor settler wants the power either to clear them of their timber , or to drain them of the superfluous moisture . He begins on the hill-side , but at the next step we find him descending the S hill , and obtaining larger returns to labor . He has more food for himself , and he has now the means of feeding a horse or an ox . Aided by the manure that is thus yielded to him by the better lands , we see him next retracing his steps , improving the hill-side , and compelling it to yield a return double that which he at first obtained . With each step down tl , *e hill , he obtains stiil larger reward for his labor , and at each he returns , with increased power , to the cultivation of the original poor soil . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid he extracts from the new soils the manure that had accumulated for ages , he has also carts and wagons to carry it up the hill ; and at each step his reward is increased , while his labors are lessened . He goes back to the sand and raises the marl , with which he covers the surface ; or he returns to the clay and sinks into the limestone , by aid of which he doubles its product . He is all the time making a machine which feeds him while he makes it , and which increases in its powers the more he takes from it . At first it was worthless . It has fed and clothed him for years , and now it has a large value , and those who might desire to use it would pay him a large rent for permission so to do . The earth is a great machine given to man to be fashioned to his purpose . The m re he fashions it , the better it feeds him , because each step is but preparatory to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor and yielding larger return . The labor of clearing is great , yet the return is small . The earth is covered with stumps , and filled with roots . With each year the roots decay , and the ground becomes enriched , while the labor of ploughing is diminished . At length , the stumps disappear , and the return is doubled , while the labor is less by one-half than at first . To forward this process the owner has done nothing but crop the ground , nature having done the rest . The aid he thus obtains from her yields him as much food as in the outset was obtained by the labor of felling and destroying the trees . This , however , is not all . The surplus thus yielded has given him means of improving the poorer lands , by furnishing manure with which to enrich them , and thus he has trebled his original return without further labor ; for that which he saves in What Constitutes Rear Freedom of Trade ? // 235 working the new soils suffees to carry the manure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased power over the various treasures of the earth With every operation connected with the fashioning of the earth , the result is the same . The first step is , invariably , the most costly one , and the least productive . The first drain commences near the stream , where the labor is heaviest . It frees from water but a few acres . A little higher , the same quantity of labor , profiting by what has been already done , frees twice the number . Again the number is doubled , and now the most perfect system of thorough drainage may be established with less labor than was at first required for one of the most imperfect kind . To bring the lime into connection with the clay , upon fifty acres , is lighter labor than was the clearing of a single one , yet the process doubles the return for each acre of the fifty . The man who wants a little fuel for his own use , expends much labor in opening the neighboring vein of coal . To enlarge this , so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small labor ; as is the next enlargement , by which he is enabled to use a drift-wagon , giving him a return fifty times greater than was obtained when he used only his arms , or a wheel-barrow . To sink a shaft to the first vein below the surface , and erect a steam-engine , are expensive operations ; but these once accomplished , every future step becomes more productive , while less costly . To sink to the next vein below , and to tunnel to another , are trifles in comparison with the first , yet each furnishes a return equally large . The first line of railroad runs by houses and towns occupied by two or three hundred thousand persons . Half a dozen little branches , costing together far less labor than the first , bring into connection with it half a million , or perhaps a million . The trade increases , and a second track , a third , or a fourth , may be required . The original one facilitates the passage of the materials and the removal of the obstructions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor than was required for the first . All labor thus expended in fashioning the great machine is but the prelude to the application of further labor , with still increased returns . With each such applica tion , wages rise , and hence it is that portions of the machine , as it exists , invariably exchange , when brought to market , for far less labor than they have cost . The man who cultivated the thin soils was happy to obtain a hundred bushels for his year 's work . With the progress of himself and his neighbor down the hill into the more fertile soils , wages have risen , and two hundred bushels are now required . His farm will yield a thousand bushels ; but it requires the labor of four men , who must have two hundred bushels each , and the surplus is but two hundred bushels . At twenty year 's purchase this gives a capital of four thousand bushels , or the equivalent of twenty year 's wages ; whereas it has cost , in the labor of himself , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years of labor , or perhaps far more . During all this time , however , it has fed and clothed them all , and the farm has been produced by the insensible contributions made from year to year , unthought of and unfelt . It is now worth twenty years ' wages , because its owner has for years taken from it a thousand bushels annually , but when it had lain for centuries accumulating wealth it was worth nothing . Such is the case with the earth everywhere . The more that is taken from it the more there is left . When the coal mines of England were untouched , they were valueless . Now their value is almost countless ; yet the land contains abundant supplies for thousands of years . Iron ore , a century since , was a drug , and leases were granted at almost nominal rents . Now , such leases are deemed equivalent to the possession of large fortunes , notwithstanding the great quantities that have been removed , although the amount of ore now known to exist is probably fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sole producer . Man fashions and exchanges . A part of his labor is applied to the fashioning of the great machine , and this produces changes that are permanent . The drain , once cut , remains a drain ; and the limestone , once reduced to lime , never again becomes limestone . It passes into the food of man and animals , and ever after takes its part in the same round with the clay with which it has been incorporated . The iron rusts and // 236 gradually passes into soil , to take its part with the clay and the lime . That portion of his labor gives him wages while preparing the machine for greater future production . That other portion which he expends on fashioning and exchanging the products of the machine , produces temporary results and gives him wages a*lone . Whatever tends to diminish the quantity of labor necessary for the fashioning and exchanging of the products , tends to augment the quantity that may be given to increasing the amount of products , and to preparing the great machine ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preparing for a future further increase . Widely different is this view of the progress of the occupation of the land from that which is taught in the politico-economical school of England , which professes to follow in the footsteps of Adam Smith , yet the doctrine of the Wealth of Nat ions , is in precise accordance with it . Dr. Smith taught that " no equal quantity of labor or capital employed in manufactures can ever occasion so great a reproduction as if it were employed in agriculture . So employed , " he adds , " it not only puts into motion a greater quantity of productive labor than any equal capital employed in manufactures , but in proportion , too , to the quantity of productive labor which it employs , it adds a much greater value to the annual produce of the land and labor of the country , and to the real wealth and revenue of its inhabitants . " This is denied by those who p ofess to be his followers , and Mr. MeCulloch insists that while increase of capital applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profit " no such diminution follows from any increase in the number of steam- engines , each in succession of which may be as perfect as its predecessor , while the new soils taken into cultivation must , of necessity , be poorer than those previously cultivated . io determine this question we may now inquire in what manner machinery tends to augment production . The first poor cultivator obtains a hundred bushels for his year 's wages . To pound this between two stones requires thirty days of labor , and the work is not half done . Had he a mill in the neighborhood he would have better flour , and he would have almost his whole thirty Sept. days to bestow upon his land . He pulls up his grain . Had he a scythe , he would have more time for the preparation of the machine of production . He loses his axe , and it requires days of himself and his horse on the road , to obtain another . His machine loses the time and the manure , both of which would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage derived from the mill and the scythe , and from the proximity of the axemaker , consists simply in the power which they afford him to devote his labor more and more to the preparation of the great machine of production , and such is the case with all the machinery of preparation and exchange . The plough enables him to do as much in one day as with a spade he could do in five . He saves four days for drainage . The steam-engine drains as much as without it could be drained by thousands of days of labor . He has more leisure to marl or lime his land . The more he can extract from his machine the greater is its value , because every thing he takes is , by the very act of taking it , fashioned to aid further production . The machine , therefore , improves by use , whereas spades , and ploughs , and steam-engines , and all other of the machines used by man , are but the various forms into which he fashions parts of the great original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as much so as food , though not so rapidly . The earth is the great labor savings ' bank , and the value to man of all other machines is in the direct ratio of their tendency to aid him in increasing his deposits in that only bank whose dividends are perpetually increasing , while its capital is perpetually doubling . That it may continue forever so to do , all that it asks is that it shall receive back the refuse of its produce , the manure ; and that it may do so , the consumer and the producer must take their places by each other . That done , every change that is effected becomes permanent , and tends to facilitate other and greater changes . The whole business of the farmer consists in making and improving soils , and the earth rewards him for his kindness by giving him more and more food the more attention he bestows upon her . Every saving in the labor requlred to be applied to the work of conversion or transportation ineiease the quantity that I // may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found the sole advantage resulting from such saving . That being admitted , we may now see what is the cause of the difficulties resulting in England from the introduction of machinery . The system tends to expel labor and capital from the machine of production , and to drive them into manufactures , and next by additional machinery to expel it from the work of manufacture itself ; the consequence of which is that labor is rendered superabundant and has to seek the almshouse , there to be supported by aid of forced contributions of food , taken from the producers , in support of the system called " free trade . " Such is not the doctrine of Adam Smith , the tendency of whose whole book is that of bringing the consumer to take his p lace by the side of the producer , and thus increasing the power of combination and of production . The solitary settler has to occupy the spots that , with his rude machinery , he can cultivate . Having neither horse nor cart , he carries home his crop upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India . He carries a hide to the place of exchange , distant , perhaps , fifty miles , to obtain for it leather , or shoes . Population increases , and roads are made . More fertile soils are cultivated . The store and the mill come nearer to him , and he obtains shoes and flour with the use of less machinery of exchange . He has more leisure for the preparation of his great machine , and the returns to labor increase . More people now obtain food from the same surface , and new places of exchange appear . The wool is , on the spot , converted into cloth , and he exchanges directly with the clothier . The saw-mill is at hand , and he exchanges with the sawyer . The tanner gives him leather for his hides , and the paper-maker gives him paper for his rags . With each of these changes he has more and more of both time and manure to devote to the preparation of the great food-making machine , and with each year the returns are larger . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases , but his necessity therefor diminishes , for with each year there is an increasing tendency towards having the consumer placed side by side with the producer , and with each he can devote more and more of his time 237 and mind to the business of &amp;shioning the great instrument ; and thus the increase of consuming population is essential to the progress of production . The loss from the use of machinery of exchange is in the ratio of the bulk of the article to be exchanged . Food stands first ; fuel , next ; stone for building , third ; iron , fourth ; cotton , fifth ; and so on ; diminishing until we come to laces and nutmegs . The raw material is that in the production of which the earth has most cooperated , and by the production of which the land is most improved , and the nearer the place of exchange or conversion can be brought to the place of production , the less is the loss in the process , and the greater the power of accumulating wealth to aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises food on his own land is building up the machine for doino ' 0 so to more advantage in the following year . His neighbor , to whom it is given , on condition of sitting still , loses a year 's work on his machine , and all he has gained is the pleasure of doing nothing . If he has employed himself and his horses and wagon in bringing it home , the same number of days that would have been required for raising it , he has misemployed his time , for his farm is unimproved . He has wasted labor and manure . As nobody , however , gives , it is obvious that the man who has a farm and obtains his food elsewhere , must pay for raising it , and pay also for transporting it ; and that although he may have obtained as good wages in some other pursuit , hisfarm , instead of being improved by a year 's cultivation , is worse by a year 's neglect ; and that he is a poorer man than ho would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next greatest bulk is fuel . While warming his house , he is clearing his land . He would lose by sitting idle , if his neighbor brought his fuel to him , and still more if he had to spend the same time in hauling it , because he would be wearing out his wagon and losing the manure . Were he to hire himself and his wagon to another for the same quantity of fuel he could have cut on his own property , he would be a loser , fvr his farm would be uncleared . If he take the stone from his own fields to build his house , he gains doubly . His house is built , and his land is cleared . If // he sit still , and let his neighbor bring him stone , he loses , for his fields remain unfit for cultivation . If he work equally hard for a neighbor , and receive the same apparent wages , he is a loser by the fact that he has yet to remove the stones , and until they shall be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the machinery of exchange , there is a diminution in the proportion which that machinery bears to the mass of production , because of the extraordinary increase of product consequent upon the increased power of applying labor to building up the great machine . It is a matter of daily observation that the demand for horses and men increases as railroads drive them from the turnpikes , and the reason is , that the farmer 's means of improving his land increas3 more rapidly than men and horses for his work . The man who has , thus far , sent to market his half-fed cattle , accompanied by horses and men to drive them , and wagons and horses loaded with hay or turnips with which to feed them on the road , and to fatten them when at market ; now fattens them on the ground , and sends them by railroad ready for the slaughter-house . His use of the machinery of exchange is diminished nine-tenths . He keeps his men , his horses , and his wagons , and the refuse of his hay or turnips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and draining , while the latter fertilizes the soil heretofore cultivated . His production doubles , and he accumulates rapidly , while the people around him have more to eat , more to spend in clothing , and accumulate more themselves . He wants laborers in the field , and they want clothes and houses . The shoemaker and the carpenter , finding that there exists a demand for their labor , now join the community , eating the food on the ground on which it is produced ; and thus the machinery of exchange is improved , while the quantity required is diminished . The quantity of flour consumed on the spot induces the miller to come and eat his share , while preparing that of others. - The labor of exchanging is diminished , and more is given to the land , and the lime is now turned up . Tons of turnips are obtained from the same surface that before gave bushels of rye . The quantity to be consumed increases faster than the population , and more mouths are needed on the spot , and next the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses which now are turned to transporting coal , to enable the farmer to dispense with his woods , and to reduce to cultivation the fine soil that has , for centuries , produced nothing but timber . Production again increases , and the new wealth now takes the form of the cottonmill , and with every step in the progress , the farmer finds new demands on the great machine he has constructed , accompanied with increased power on his part to build it up higher and stronger , and to sink its foundation deeper . He now supplies beef and mutton , wheat , butter , eggs , poultry , cheese , and every other of the comforts  --  and luxuries of life , for which the eJimate is suited ; and from the same land which afforded , when his father or grandfather first commenced cultivation on the light soil of the hills , scarcely sufficient rye or barley to support life . In the natural course of things , there is a strong tendency towards placing the consumer by the side of the producer , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wherever that tendency does not grow in the ratio of the growth of population , it is a consequence of some of those weak inventions by which man so often disturbs the harmony of nature . Wherever her laws have most prevailed , such has been the tendency , and there have wealth and the power of man over the great machine , most rapidly increased . Rent is the price paid for the use of that power , and it increases with every diminution in the quantity required of the machinery of exchange . The course of things here described is in accordance with the facts that may be observed in every improving community , and equally in accordance with the views of Dr. Smith , who saw that " human institutions " had every where " thwarted the natural inclinations of man " in building up large cities to be maintained at the cost of both producer and consumer . It is precisely that which he would every where desired to see , and that which would every where have been seen to exist had the natural course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced large quantities of food , and of other // raw ii*i*ls too bulky for transportation , and that the most profitable application of labor and capital was to appropriate a portion of them to the work of converting those materials into forms fitting them for use at home , or for cheap transportation to distant countries , and that by so doing the acquisition of the necessaries and comforts of life would be facilitated . The more perfectly this view was carried out , the larger , as he saw , would be the quantity of labor that could be given to cultivation , and he denounced every interference with progress in this direction as being not only " a discouragement of agriculture , ** but a violation of man 's " most sacred rights. ** Dr. Smith had no faith in the productive power of ships or wagons . He knew that the barrel of flour , or the bale of cotton , put into the ship came out a barrel of flour or a bale of cotton , the weight of neither having been increased by the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of consumption . He saw clearly that to place the consumer by the side of the producer was to economize labor and aid production , and therefore to increase the power to trade . He was therefore , in favor of the local application of labor and capital , by aid of which towns should grow up in the midst of producers of food , and he believed that if " human institutions " had not been at war with the best interests of man , those towns would nowhere have increased beyond what the improvement and cultivation of the territory in which they were situated could support . " How widely different is all this from the system which builds up London , Liverpool , Manchester , and Birmingham , to be the manufacturing centres of the world , and urges upon all nations " free trade , " with a view to their maintenance and increase ! Directly opposed in this respect to Dr. Smith , Mr. MeCulloch has unbounded faith in the productive power of ships and wagons . To him , " it is plain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are to be produced to where they are to be consumed , and in dividing them into minute portions so as to fit the wants of consumers , is really as productive as if they were employed in agriculture or in manufactures . " The man who carries the food adds he thinks , as much to the quantity to be consumed as did the one who ploughed the ground and sowed the seed  --  and he who stands at the counter measuring cloth adds as much to the quantity of cloth as did he who produced it . No benefit , in his view , results from any saving of the labor of transportation or exchange . He has , therefore , no faith in the advantage to be derived from the local application of labor or capital . He believes that it matters nothing to the farmer of Ireland whether his food be consumed on the farm or at a distance from it - whether his grass be fed on the land or carried to market - whether the manure be returned to the land or wasted on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enriched . He is even disposed to believe that it is frequently more to the advantage of the people cf that country that the food there produced should be divided among the laborers of France or Italy than among themselves. * He believes in the advantage of large manufacturing towns at a distance from those who produce the food and raw materials of manufacture , and that perfect . freedom of trade consists in the quiet submission of the farmers and planters of the world to the working of a system which Smith regarded as tending so greatly to " the discouragement of agriculture , " that it was the main object of his work to teach the people of Britain that it was not more unjust to others than injurious to themselves . He taught that the workman should go to the place where , food being abundant , moderate labor would command much food . His successors teach that the food should come to the place where , men being abundant and food scarce , much labor will command little food , and that when population has thus been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considering the circumstances under which most Irish landlords acquired their estates , the difference between their religious tenets and those of their tenants , the peculiar tenures under which the latter hold their lands , and the political condition of the country , whether their residence would have been of any considerable advantage . * * * The question really at issue refers merely to the spending of revenue , and has nothing to do with the improvement of estates ; and notwithstanding all that has been said to the contrary , I ant not yet convinced that absenteeism is , in this respect , at all injurious. *** . Principle8 , p. 157. // surplus should go abroad to raise more food for the supply of those they left behind . The one teaches the concentration of man and the local division of labor . The other , the dispersion of man , and the territorial division of labor . They differ thus in every thing , except that they both use the **30;631;TOOLONG to totally distinct ideas . With the one , COMMERCE has that enlarged signification which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " man 's natural inclination " for association , while with the other TRADE has reference to no idea beyond that of the mere pedlar who buys in the cheapest market and sells in the dearest one . The system of the one is perfectly harmonious , and tends towards peace among men .
