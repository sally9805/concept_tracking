txt From The London TirneB , 2 Jnn* THE AMERiCAN QUESTION . THE Administration of Gen. Pierce has taken another step in that downward course to which it has resolutely addicted itself ever since its entrance upon official duties . As if the questions in dispute between England and the United States were not sufficiently embroiled already , the President has just decided on a measure , the effect of which must necessarily be to complicate relations already grievously entangled , and embitter feelings on both sides of the Atlantic , already needlessly and wantonly irritated . As the matter seems not to be perfectly understood , we will , in a very few words , state to our readers so much as may be necessary to enable them to appreciate the full significance of the untoward circumstance which has just*ccurred at Washington . About six months ago , a band of adventurers from the United States , under the command of a freebooter , named Walker , invaded the republic of Nicaragua , with no claim or pretext that we are aware of , merely relying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might to right . Success crowned their efforts ; they overthrew the existing Government - by what acts of 112 // blood and treachery , it is not now necessary to state - and installed themselves , for a time at least , in the position of sovereigns of Nicaragua . But the neighboring States of Costa Rica and Guatemala became alarmed , and commenced an attack upon the American invaders ; the success in which , according to the last accounts , had declared in their favor , and against the piratical occupiers of the country . Walker and his followers have appealed to force , and force seems on the point of deciding against them . The ClaytonBuiwer Treaty binds the American and English Governments alike not to occupy any portion of Central America , and this doctrine has been applied by America with the most unrelenting precision to our proceedings . It was , therefore , impossible for the United States to take any direct share in Walker 's invasion without a most flagrant breach of existing treaties - nay , they are bound , by every principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their power , the sending of any support to those of their citizens who are disgracing the American name by deeds of blood and rapine worthy of the most condign punishment . More than this , they have been recently insisting , not only on the strictest observance of their neutrality laws , but on a respect for their sovereign rights , which obliges every nation in its conduct toward another to consider not merely what is legal , but what may be agreeable and acceptable . No nation ever had bound itself , by its own conduct and declarations , to more scrupulous and even punctilious reverence for the rights and feelings of others . The course of the American Government , therefore , would seem to have been exceedingly plain - to have left Walker and hi* followers to undergo the fate they so richly merited , and to take credit to themselves for the rigor with which they observed that neutrality , and respected that treaty , which they accuse us of violating and disregarding . Unfortunately , however , the elections are at hand . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conciliate as identifying the Government of the United States with an enterprise such as that of Walker and his associates . Between these two views the Government of Gen. Pierce has for some time balanced , but at last has taken and acted upon a resolution . The President has sent down to the Senate a message , in which he broadly professes the doctrine of recognizing a Government de facto , whatever its origin , and thus has no difficulty in concluding that the Government of Walker is entitled to this recognition . Consequently , though there is now residing in Washington a certain Mr. Marcoleta , representative of the ate Government DCXXXII* LiVING AGE . VOL . XIV . 8 of Nicaragua , who protests loudly against the proceeding , the President has received the ambassador sent by Walker , and thus recognized his Government as one with which the United States may enter into alliance , and one into whose service her citizens may enrol themselves without any violation of neutrality . The effect of such a step will , of course , he to send to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from every part of the Union , and to involve the United States virtually , though not ostensibly , in war with Costa Rica and Guatemala . The pretences on which this step has been taken are extremely flimsy and transparent . Walker 's Government is for the moment in possession of power , and may therefore be called , by a straining of language , a Government defacto : but it is in imminent peril of being overthrown from day to day by the combination of neighboring States who are waging against it a war of extermination , and it occupies such a position that no impartial Government , willing to hold the scales evenly between it and the Government it has supplanted , could have dreamt of recognizing its existence as an independant State . It is only commencing the struggle which must be successfully terminated before it has a right to claim foreign recognition . But ought the United States to be impartial in this matter ? The Government of Walker is founded by their own citizens in defiance of the laws of their country and in contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such men have no right to any favor - no , not even toleration , from a government which understands its honor and its duty , and the Union would only be making a suitable reparation for the crinies of her citizens , did she employ her forces to suppress the banditti who have taken possession of a friendly and unoffending State The recognition of such power is a melancholy proof of the state of political morality which could counsel such a ste 1** and the impotence of consideratioos of right and justice to restrain the government of the great Transatlantic Republic from the most dangerous and unjustifiable courses . At the same time , the real natur&amp; of this . proceeding must not be misunderstood . it is. an alarming manifestation of the ideas that actuate the American Government , and leads to most disagreeable anticipations as to the possibility of an amicable solution of any dispute with men who seem to recognize no other law than their wishes and their passions . But it is no case of war , it is not even necessarily a ground of diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated , and it may p*bbably be expedient in the present critical state of 113 // the relations between the two countries , rather to pass this matter by in silence than to incur the risk of introducing fresh difficulties into a discussion already sufficiently perilous , or give an excuse to those who are even now on ly too ready to seek an occasion of quarrel . If war do come we must meet it as we may . Let us , at any rate , have the satisfaction of reflecting that this greatest of human calamities has not been precipitated by any undue sensitiveness or any avoidable interference on our part . From The London Times , 3 June . THE yet more recent intelligence which we have reccived from the United States leaves us little reason to doubt that the Government of Gen. Pierce will not stop short in the career on which it has embarked , but will follow up the reception of the Minister of Gen. Walker by the dismissal of the Minister of Queen Victoria . It is vain any longer to delude ourselves with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a Government which has thrown off all pretence of adherence to the rules that regulate the intercourse of nations , and feels no degradation in allying the interests of the great nation with whose destinies it is intrusted , to men exercising a trade which a few years ago any sanguine speculator on human progress would have pronounced to be an anachronism and an impossibility . The same electioneering necessities which make the representative of a band of lawless free-booters a fit guest and companion for the Chief Magistrate of a Christian and educated Re*public have decreed that , in spite of our earnest wish to atone for the offence we have unintentionally given , and our abstinence from anything which could by any possibility aggravate the dispute , we must undergo the indignity of seeing our Minister dismissed from the diplomatic circle at Washington for offences supported by testimony on whiob we should never dream of convicting the basest of mankind . The Presidential election must be carried , at whatever price , and it is deemed by the present ministry better to plunge their Government into any amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger , than to lose a single vote which may be gained by insolence to allies or union with criminals . At this critical time nothing is more melancholy than the attitude of the American press ; at least of *that portion of it which we have seen . It is either afraid to speak out at all , or , in order to catch the first breath of popular favor , involves itself in the most flagrant and glaring contradictions . Thus we are *told in The New York Herald that Walker 's cause is dss1perate and certain THE AMERICAN QUESTION . to succeed , and in two successive articles that England cares nbthing for Central America , that she will be glad to be rid of it , that she has sold the Mosquitoes to Walker , and is chaffcring with Honduras for the price of Ruatan , and that , true to her policy of aggression and violence , she is ready to fight to the death for these very possessions . One moment we have a blast of war , the next a song of peace ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now treated as a bold and successful statesman , now as a feeble and cowardly intriguer . We seek in vain for something on which to anchor our faith , something animated by a higher principle than that of the most momentary and grovelling expediency , and we seek in vain . Still , even the dismissal of Mr. Crampton and the dismissal of Mr. Dallas , which must immediately succeed it , by no means imply a state of war , or even necessary preludes to that dire calamity . We may be at peace with America , though without any diplomatic representative ; and , perhaps , at the point at which matters have arrived , the absence of an Ambassador may in some degreq diminish the apprehension of danger . When one party is bent upon fixing a quarrel upon the other , the fewer points of contact they have the more likely is the desire of the more pacific party to be attained . The less they see of each other the less likely will the embers of smouldering discontent be to be fanned into a flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence of the case . As war is threatened for electioneering objects , if the rupture is adjourned till the elections are over we are comparatively safe . The American papers anticipate that , after a meeting which was to take place on the 2d of June for the purpose of naming a candidate for the Presidency , the fever in the blood of the Washington Cabinet would begin to subside . At any rate , when the Presidential election is over , we may reasonably conclude that the urgent necessity which is felt for a quarrel with England will be over too , and the new incumbents of office will turn their attention to filling up places , rewarding friends , and punishing enemies , and leave us , if they have left us at peace so long , in undisturbed possession of the blessing of which they now seem so anxious to deprive us . Everything , therefore , combines to inculcate upon our government a temperate ( we had almost said a temporizing ) policy , which may give angry passions time to cool , selfish objects time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide on the merits of the dispute . We can ass&amp;t our own dignity without peevish haste ; nay , all the better that we do not feel driven to show an irritable or quarrelsome spirit . We must endure no insult ; // but we must not be eager or anxious in endeavoring to discover offence , even where it may perhaps he intended . It well becomes us , as the elder , and certainly not the less powerful State , to be slow to believe that any Government can deliberately intend to seek a quarrel with us , and , even if satisfied that this is the case , to leave them up to the very last moment the most ample opportunity of re-consideration and retreat from a position hastily and unadvisedly taken up . The consciousness that we are equal to any encounter that may be forced upon us may well teach uspatience and long suffering . Still it must be confessed , though recent events in the United States do not menace us with immediate war , and though a strong effort on behalf of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary politics may perhaps still arrest the course of the Government , that each new account we re-. ceive shows more and more clearly the predominance of a spirit fatal to relations of permanent good-will and amity between the United States and any Government faithful to those principles and traditions of which England may not unreasonably boast to be the representative . We have to do with men who habitually subordinate foreign to domestic politics , and who have now finally deserted the safe and honorable course of trusting to internal growth and development to secure their greatness , and have embarked on the endless and restless career of territorial conquest and annexation . If we be so fortunate as to get over the present danger , we can not , therefore , hope for a long respite . Some new nation may be found weak , disunited and tempting-some new combination of parties , which can only be secured by raising anew the war-cry against England , until at last , in some unhappy moment , the pretence so oft repeated will turn into grave earnest , and both nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one that she has advanced so far , the other that without dishonor she could recede no farther . From The London Times , 4 June . WE have received fresh intelligence from the United States as to the progress of Ministerial opinion and resolution with reference to this country , and we are sorry to find that the prospects of the settlement of the dispute seem more remote than ever . We fear that the letter notifying to this Government the dismissal of Mr. Cram*ton may be every day expected in England . This event , which , seen through the mist of the future , was calculated to inspire the most gloomy apprehensions , seems to have lost a little of its magnitude as it comes nearer , and to be after all , a not unendurable evil . Considering 115 how much we have already borne- how we have apologized and re-apologized - how we have offered to refer our case to arbitration , and submitted to see that arbitration refused - how we have argued , expostulated , and remonstrated , and all to no purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rest . We have at any rate , in this case the melancholy satisfaction that we are able to make a complete reprisal , and that a fortnight after Mr. Crampton has ceased to represent us at Washington , Mr. Dallas will no longer exercise his functions as Representative of the United States at the Court of St. James . There will , however , be this remarkable difference between the two cases - that Mr. Dallas has been treated with all res*ct , while Mr. Crampton will be ordered to Jave the territory of the Union after having endured more than probably any British Representative in any foreign court during the present century has been called upon to submit to . Not only has Mr. Crampton been subjected to a virtual trial in the persons of Messrs . Hertz and Strobel ; whose veracity he has publicly and solemnly disputed , apparently not without very sufficient reason , but a new method of annoyance has been discovered , by which it is sought not merely to give a color to his dismissal , but to affix an indelible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Minister back to England not only dismissed , but degraded . Mr. Crampton has advisedly stated in his letters to Lord Clarendon that Mr. Clayton , Mr. Marcy , and Mr. Cass have severally admitted to him that Ruatan is an undoubted British possession , with which America has not the slightest claim to interfere . This statement is met with denials more or less earnest from the different persons implicated by it . But , beside these , evidence i*now produced that Mr. Crampton has himself admitted the falsehood of his own statements . What answer our Minister may be able to make to these accusations we do not know . In the mean time , it seems very difficult to believe that a man of experience and ability should make deliberately and advisedly official statements which he has felt himself , subsequently , when challenged , obliged to withdraw . Here are Mr. Crampton 's own words in the very last letter of the blue book on Central America : " It will be within your Lordship 's recollection that Mr. Clayton was informed by Sir Henry Bulwer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruatan was de jure and defacto a British possession ; and Mr. Clayton has on various occasions since , in conversation with me , stated that he considered Ruatan as much a British p*ssession as Jamacia or any other British West Indian island . " THE AMERICAN QUESTION . // It seems incredible that such a statement can have been disavowed so soon after it was made , and under circumstances so critical , and yet this is now the accusation which is pressed against Mr. Crampton , and which we have reason to believe the United States Ministry intends to support . We must hear both sides before we condemn any one ; but to us it certainly looks as if , the attempt to injure Mr. Crampton by the evidence of Hertz and Strobel having failed , some new device was to be hit upon in order to justify , in the eyes of the American people , the determination of the Government by some means or another to remove the representative of Great Britain . At any rate , if Mr. Crampton only remains at Washington to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undermine th *n by intrigue or traduce them by calumny ; if an institution introduced and devised in the interests of peace is to be perverted for the purposes of mutual irritation and recrimination , it would seem far better that , for a time at least , diplomatic intercourse should cease , and , at any rate , that this ground of offence should be taken away from between us . The American Government is doing its utmost to reconcile us to the impending dismissal of our Minister , and to convince us that his absence , however much to be regretted in ordinary times , is now a less evil and danger than his remaining in a place where offence seems so sure to be given and taken . Something more , apparently , than the denunciations of their Government , the debates of their Senate , and the accusations of their press , is nccessary to convince the American people that they have fallen into the hands of men who are embarking on wild and dangerous courses , with no fixed object but their own immediate popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has become so entirely a part of the American practice - at least , of the practice of those possessed of cultivated minds and considerable properties - to stand aloof from the fierce struggles of politics , and to leave the game to be fought out by more ignoble hands , that they seem to have extended to foreign relations the same apathy which they exercise with regard to domestic affairs , and to feel great surprise that any one should think of treating their govern*nent as the real and efficient exponent of the natioaal will , instead of some fortuitous agglomeration of atoms whirled together by the inexorable vortex of party and political necessities , and possessing i*o other object in common than the desire to retain the prize they have won at whatever cost , and by whatever means . This view of their Government is repeatedly prcsented to us by educated Americans , and we are desired to turn from the violence of popular leaders and scheming politicians to the opinion of those great classcs who comprise the wealth , the respectability , and the equilibrium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have waited and appealed in vain ; that step after step has the government of General Pierce advanced in its career of violence and aggression , while no voice has been raised , no hand stretched out , to arrest a course so full of danger and discredit . America will not submit to arbitration , because she is determined to seize Nicaragua whether the true terms of the Clayton treaty authorize the seizure or not , and every advance we make is sure to be met in a spirit which seeks grounds for provocation out of every effort to conciliate . From the people of America , in whose name these things are done , but with whose consent and assent we firmly believe they are not done , we seek for aid in vain . They give them Government but little support ; but they de nothing to control it , and by their Constitu tion they are unable to remove it . Unde* these circumstances , we can only reiterate the suggestions we have made before - tha* we should avoid all occasions of offence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own rights , and wait with patience to *ec whether the objects of the American Government may not be satisfi&amp; by something short of the last extremity . From The Daily News , 4 June . IN considering the possibility of war witL the United States - its pro6ability has n&amp; yet arisen - there is one thing that must bc pressed on the attention of the Cabinet . P is that the Admiralty should impress th necessity of exercising the utmost prudence let us add forbearance , on the Admiral anr all naval officers on our North American sta tion ; for the real danger at present does not so much lie in any deliberate recourse to hostilities on the part of either Government as in a hasty , indiscreet , precipitate , an unauthorized collision between single cruic ers of the two States , or in an unnecessary and intemperate interruption of lawful corn merce off San Juan del Norte . And as w. have already had reports of such an inciden in the case of the United States emigran ship , the Orizaba , and an English ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chark Wood to send , and , if already sent , to repen the most peremptory instructions on thi point to our naval squadron . The question in dispute as to Central America are purei* and entirely in the domain of politics ; the are matters pending between the Secretarie of State of the two countries ; and the great 116 // est misfortune that could befall England at this moment would be the introduhtion into them of naval asperities , naval opinions as to what the honor of the country requires , or naval collisions . Anything of this sort would play into the hands of President Pierce and assist him in the mischievous and wicked use to which he is trying to turn the Central American question and the recruitment dispute . That he , his advisers and cabal are prepared to retain , by risking war , the power they have abused , appears only too certain . But that the British Government will aid him in this monstrous design , by directly doing aught to precipitate hostilities , or by any declaration of war , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If , then , the conduct of our cruisers be equally temperate and moderate , and if all chance of collision on their part be avoided , President Pierce may find himself rather out-wited in his policy ; for though he has , as President , power to accept war , when declared against the United States , and is , of course , bound to resent and vindicate the honor of their flag , when attacked by the naval force of another Government , the President of the United States , be it remembered , has no authority by virtue of his office to declare war against another country . He may , it is true , pursue a policy that must inevitably bring the United States to the brink of hostilities- and that President Pierce is certainly now doing ; he may persevere in this policy , although he has not influence enough over Congress to induce it to adopt any of his recommendations on domestic questions  --  and that is President Pierce 's position . He may go headlong on in his career of wickedness , after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made him President ; but there his power stops . In England it is the prerogativeof the Crown to declare war , as it is also to make peace ; but no such authority is reposed in the Chief Magistrate of the United States ; and its absence , is one great safeguard for the preservation of tranquility , if our Government are only wise and calm , and our cruisers prudent and unofficious . By the Constitution of the United States , the President has literally no power in the matter ; for by clause XI of Section VIII . of the Constitution , it is enacted : " The Congress shall have power to declare war , grant letters of marque and reprisal , and to make rules concerning captures on land and water . " If , then , President Pierce be disappointed in his expectations of having war declared against the United States , or of its becoming inevitable from an accidental collision , the question is , can he induce Congress to exercise its undoubted authority of de 117 daring war against England on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion be exercised on this side of the Atlantic , and by the officers in command of our North American squadron on the other side , President Pierce will never think of making any such recommendation to Congress ; and that , if he did , Congress would treat it with the same contempt with which it has treated all his other recommendations . No , Mr. Franklin Pierce 's game is something very different from this : it is to play the bully , and to hector himself at our expense into the Presidency again , even at the risk of war , if we are weak and foolish enough to meet him more than half way in his extravagances and recklessness . For that very reason it is our policy to look calmly on while he plays . his last desperate stake at the presidential faro-table . If the evil time does come - if the devil allow Mr. Pierce another turn of success - if war be thrust upon us , we have spirit enough to vindicate our honor , and force enough to deal signal punishment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanwhile , just in proportion as excitement prevails at Washington , let temperance predominate here ; and if we can not rouse by our calmness the better sort of citizens in the Republic to vindicate , in this unnecessary emergency , the common sense and self-respect of our common origin and common interests , let us , at all events , by our abstinence asssist them in averting the misfortune of another term of Presidency for Mr. Franklin Pierce . We do not undervalue the importance of the United States Government obtaining , through Walker 's success , now that his Government is recognized , a command of that route from the Atlantic to the Pacific , to the neutrality of which it is bound by the Clayton-Bulwer Convention . We can perfectly appreciate the danger of encouraging these springs beyond the bounds of civilization , which first annexed Texas , then acquired California , afterward grasped at Cuba , and have now laid a heavy hand on Nicaragua ; and we know not where this doing evil that good may come is to stop . But we have no mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Filibusterism . Our duty is to take care of ourselves and our own interests , and though it be much more advantageous to us that an independent instead of a dependent , State should possess this interoceanic route , that is not a question on which we are going to war . We heartily wish and pray for the success of Costa Rica in the cause of national independence which that little State is so gallantly defending , but further assistance than sympathies and remonstrances we have none to give . So far // our course is clear enough . But if the whole of the State of Nicaragua is to fall under the control of the United States , it can not be expected that we will recede from our demand to have San Juan made a free port , or retire from the Bay of Islands . Substantially the Clayton-Bulwer Convention will become worthless and inoperative , if Walker , now that his Government is recognized at Washington , shall fairly establish himself in Nicaragua ; and the argument in support of our abandonment of our pretensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will fall to the ground , when the treaty on which it is founded ceases to be binding on the United States . If , then , a new colony is to be formed in Nicaragua , from the United States , we also shall have a claim to establish a colony in the Bay of Islands that will at least give us some power over the route through Nicaragua to the Pacific - a place of refreshment for our cruisers , a depot for our commerce . That President Pierce wilr follow up this utter abandonment of the Clayton-Bulwer Convention in his recognition of Walker , by dismissing Mr. Crampton , appears likely enough . Indeed we have o*ood reason to believe that Mr. Crampton his already reached Toronto . But , Mr. Crampton dismissed , ought we to send away Mr. Dallas , and suspend all diplomatic intercourse with the Cabinet at Washington ? That may , we think , be doubted . The ground on which Mr. Crampton 's recall has been demanded is , that his proceedings in the recruitment question have rendered his further residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , diplomatically , they have a perfect right to express and to act on that opinion . To act on it must necessarily give offence to the Government of England ; but retaliation does not as necessarily or as logically follow offence ; and so , notwithstanding Mr. Dallas is packing up his portmanteau , we hope the British Cabinet will think twice before they send him nway . From the London Telegraph , 2 June . THE question is a simple one , and easy of solution . Is it worth our while to expend several millions of money , sacrifice several hundred thousand lives , jeopardize our commerce , lose our colonies , impoverish our country , and grind down with almost unbearable taxes , imposts , and exactions , the hardworked millions of these islands , all for one object , the retention of a Mr. Crampton , formerly a Government clerk , as our Minister at Washington  --  a Mr. Matthew , formerly a sporting officer in the Guards , ejected for bribery from a seat in Parliament , and then a Governor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consequence of the dissatisfaction caused by his conduct , as our Consul at Philadelphia - a Mr. Barclay , who has held a snug berth for years as Consul at New-York , and who , during that period , must have amassed enough money to retire with competence for the remainder of his days - and , lastly , to retain a Mr. Roweroft , of whom we know nothing , as our Consul at Cincinnati ? For the purpose of retaining these four individuals as our accredited agents in the United States , against the express wishes of the American Government , shall England go to war with our powerful trans-Atlantic cousins ? Surely the war just terminated by a disgraceful peace , which we were obliged to accept , ought to be a lesson to curb the overweening pride of our countrymen . As to the performances of our army , the least said the better . Our men were brave to a fault , and that is all that can be conceded to the service . As to the genius of our officers , it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military tact to keep a brigade of horses from starving , and the entire staff of the British Army - engineers , artillery , cavalry and infantry - were unable to devise a scheme to p lace under shelter a squadron of dragoons in the field . Civilians could construct a railway in an enemy 's country , several miles in length , hut and shelter the navvies employed , feed their men , and perform their duties without one single instance of failure . Civil engineers did this , because they were practical men , and because they were not checked and curbed by spurred and plumed staffilonentities . If the construction of that railway had been left to the army , not one mile of it would be at the present moment finished ; and , during the progress of that mile , some hundreds of men would have been flogged at the triangles by our Provost Marshals . So much for the proved military genius of our officers . As to our Navy , we had old Admirals suffering from the gout , living on port wine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the juice of Oporto , raving about " sharpening their cutlasses , " bearding the Muscovite in his stronghold , and threatening to bring forth the reluctant Russ , and make him fight ? And how did we manage that fight ? Our wooden walls battered down , at long range , Bomarsund , did not venture to Cronstadt , but sacked and burnt some dozen Finnish villages - and here we have the sum total of our naval achievements . We bad 70,000 gallant sailors ready to fight , and not one head to direct our floating armaments . At home we bungled at the Admiralty , and on the eve of signing a humiliating peace we had launched when too late a swarm of gunboats. // The peace concluded , we had a grand bungle , called a review , at which we paraded several score of ugly mortar and gunboats , all nearly gunwale under with the weight of metal on board , and in smooth water , with wind and tide not progretaing at the rate of above a mile and a half per hour . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day after the fair , of what we could do on some future occasion ; and thus terminated our naval triumphs . There is no use concealing the fact , we are not now in a position to go to war . Our military and naval establishments require a remodeling before we can safely cope with another enemy . As the Services are at present constituted , officered , and handled , we have no hope from their prowess when placed in antagonism to a young , brave , and powerful nation . Poor Russia ! at the best she was but a heavy enemy . There was no vitality in her . Her armies were slaves , and the knout was the only incentive to action . Her navy was only for show . Her sailors were fresh-water salts - a sort of brackish imitation of the nautical tar . And yet we failed to humble Russia , backed as we were by France , and , after the expenditure of some hundred millions of money , and the sacrifice of a gallant army by gross mismanagement , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph , we concluded peace , and left the enemy not minus one yard of territory formerly possessed by her and paid ourselves all the expenses of the war . This should be a sufficient lesson to curb our belligerent propensities . A war with the United States would be a very different kind of affair . In that Republic we have a powerful foe - the American flag floats in every sea . Her sailors are sailors . Her ships equal our own in tonnage . There is no cooping up her ships in a Sebastopol harbor - for the American harbors are numberless , and the steamers and ships are the finest specimens of naval architecture afloat . It was all very well our " talking big , " and brag*ing in the Bunkum style , when the war with the United States was only an idle rumor . We could then afford to reciprocate a joke with our cousins , who talked of " beating all creation , " and ribttle on about bombarding the Atlantic cities . That was all , however , very " big talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the war of 1814 we never succeeded in firing a broadside into an Atlantic City , and our nearest approach to such an achievment was at New Orleans , the remembrance of which should crush our high-flown ideas of battering down Ameriean towns . It must , further , not be forgotten that there is not one harbor on the Atlantic coast which could not easily be 119 closed to all approach from the sea , and that as effectually as Sebastopol harbor was rendered inaccessible to our fleet . And as to any hope from the diversion in our favor of the slaves in the Southern States , we must not forget that in 1814 the slaves remained true to their masters , and we are not aware that the " darkie " element is one whit more enlightened now than it was then . A war with the United States would in fact be a guerilla war upon the ocean . Her ships would prey upon our commerce , and countless privateers would swarm the ocean path . In fact , during that war , all our commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north would stop for the raw material ; the cotton of Louisiana would be wanting to feed them .

The Muscovite would again sniff the tainted atmosphere Eblood . Persia with the Russ would then indeed have a fair chance of an invasion of India , and could we then hope that our gallant ally will remain faithful to England in the immensity of her fresh warlike entanglements ? The idea is absurd . No one expects it . A war waged upon the great Powers of the earth must necessarily place France in antagonism to England .

From The London Daily News . THE aspect of the latest news from the United States is undeniably ugly . Still we will not believe that the Governments in London and Washington can be so insane as to risk a war , the results of which must be so tremendous , on such miserable grounds of quarrel as they are debating a out . If there is a war , it will be a mere buccaneering war . The United States have no standing army ; they can not invade England ; the immense extent of the Republican territory , and the thinness of the population , enable it to laugh an invasion to scorn . But on the other hand , the coasts of England and the United States are equally destitute of fortifications , and open to predatory incursions ; and both nations have hordes of unarmed ships in every sea that would be an easy prey to vessels of war . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be by shelling and burning seaport towns , by sinking and capturing merchant vessels . Fights there might be between single men-of-war or small squadrons , but there would be no battle like the Nile or Trafalgar - for the simple reason that the United States have not a large enough fleet . While the war lasted , therefore , the efforts of the belligerents would be almost exclusively confined to predatory and destructive operations against private property - a course of action calculated to lower the combatants to the level of the moss troopers or buccaneers of former centuries . The loss on both sides would be enormous . The mere paralysis of productive industry , produced by the cessation of commercial intercourse , would spread bankruptcy and beggary through every district of England and the United States . And all this waste and misery to be incurred on flimsy points of honor , about which a brace o f*iIrish fireeaters of the olden time would ha* hesi a e to exchange shots ! With regard to the enlistment question , the United States have suffered no detriment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. James ' has again and again declared it had no intention to injure or affront the Government of Washington , and that it is sorry that it should innocently have given occasion for umbrage . As to the American Isthmus , both Governments are loud in their protestations of their determination not to acquire any new territory there ; and in truth such acquisition by either would be gaining a loss . The pecuniary interests of both countries in the questions at issue would be outrageously overestimated at a penny sterling . England , we know , has no desire to act uncourteously towards America ; and America , we hope and believe , has no desire to act uncourteously towards England . The whole controversy between the two Governments arises from their reluctance to express the same ideas in the same words and phrases . If they go to war , it will be on either side simply with a view to impose its own verbalforrnuhr on the other . What an awful responsibility the statesmen must incur who precipitates two States , so capable of inflicting injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How the despots of the world will laugh to see the two most free and enlightened nations of the age cutting each other 's throats and destroying each other 's property for such pitiful no-reasons ! Such , they will exclaim , in scornful triumph , are the fruits of free institutions ; these are the consequences of allowing people to govern themselves ! We address these considerations alike to Englishmen and Americans , for we can not regard any war between England and America - and that is our great objection to one - in any other light than as a civil war . We know that any English Government that by unjust or even discourteous conduct towards America shall render war inevitable , will be driven with disgrace from power . On former occasions , we do not deny that English Governments have been too apt to treat Americans with a supercilious aflectation of superiority . We admit that some of Lord Palmertson 's antecedents warrant suspicions on the part of the Americans that he has still some of this Old World leaven about him . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all such silly and antiquated preji*dices ; and we know that his Lordship is not the man to allow any personal feeling ( or principle ) to interfere with his tenure of office . We say that on the whole , the conduct of the existing English Government throughout this disagreeable controversy , if not always remarkable for prudence , has always been fair and courteous . The difficulties regarding Central America they offer to refer to arbitration ; they disclaim any intention to act in contravention of the laws of the United States in the unlucky enlistment affair ; and as for Mr. Cram*ton and Consuls , the language used by*ordClarendon is in effect , " We can not punish men who have served us faithfully to the best of their abilities , unless they are proved to have violated the laws of the United States ; the witnesses adduced in support of the charge that they have done so are utterly unworthy of credit upon oath ; do you ( the American Government ) prove by trustworthy witnesses that they have misconducted themselves , and we will withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our own honor . " This we maintain , is all straightforward ; and for the reason we have assigned above we believe that the English Ministers speak and act , in this matter , with perfect sincerity . As for the Americans , we concur in the view taken of their feelings by our New York correspondent , who declares that the whole difficulty on their side is owing to the unscrupulous tactics adopted by the party leaders now in power , with an eye to the impending Presidential election . He tells us - and we believe him - that if the English Ministers keep their tempers , and abstain from any acts or words that may give a handle to the reckless agitators of the White House , till after the elections in November , there will be no danger of war . We , too , would give this advice to our rulers , and w* 120 // believe it will be acted upon . But , at the same time , we would appeal to the rational and truly patriotic portion of the American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perfect and cordial sincerity , with regard to the American people , entitles us to do so - to aid us actively in the preservation of the peace . They can do so , for they are the majority , and in the United States the majority is all-powerful . They need to do so , for the last step of President Pierce demonstrates that as little confidence can be placed in his prudence as in his principles . When Walker appeared to be carrying all before him in Nicaragua , President Pierce refused to recognize him ; now that Walker appears to be tottering on the verge of destruction , President Pierce receives his envoy . The man who can thus act in defiance of every dictate of prudence and common sense , may at any moment adopt measures that render war inevitable . We assure our American friends that this conviction is already becoming operative here in England . Next mail will convey to them intelligence of fluctuations in our money market-fluctuations attributable solely to the aspect of our relations with America . And we can tell them more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers with whom they deal , are already talking seriously of restricting their operations within such limits as may expose them to the least possible risk in the event of a war breaking out . Fully one-half of the evils that actual war could inflict on the two countries , are about to be incurred in a state of peace , from the mere unsatisfactory aspect of our relations with the United States . We call upon the true patriots in North America to assist us in putting a stop to this ruinous state of affairs . Our sole object in these remarks is to impress both on Englishmen and Americans the ridiculous and criminal light in which the two countries would present themselves to the world by going to war for the paltry objects that are now agitated between their Governments . When we shall have succeeded in this - when the voice of both nations has compelled their rulers to discuss their differences rationally - we are prepared to enter upon that controversy . At present a word misapprehended might have a prejudicial effect , and therefore we abstain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braggadocio in which some of our contemporaries have been pleased to indulge about the might of England . We are , perhaps , more fully aware of the real strength of our country than these braggarts , but we know that , with a high-spirited and energetic people like the Americans , to talk of such matters at such a crisis is wantonly to add fuel to the flames . From The London Press ( Tory-Opposition ) 2 June . LORD ELGIN , in a guarded speech , submitted to the Lords on Tuesday some considerations on the state of our relations with America . The subject could not have been in better hands . Lord Elgin is one of the few great statesmen of our day . His Canadian administration has established his reputation on a solid basis . It will bear to be tested by results . Contrasted with the Indian administration of Lord Dalbousie , we see the difference between solid ahd showy qualities of goverment . There exists on record no example of such progress in every element of prosperity as Canada has exhibited under Lord Elgin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States ' government and people gives additional weight to his opinions . He touched on both the recruiting question and the Central American question . The points originally in dispute were of the most trifling nature . They are in themselves so subtle as almost to elude apprehension . They more resemble the refinements of schoolmen than the differences of practical politicians . On reading the correspondence , our wonder is moved at the ingenuity which could evolve serious difficulty from such insignificant elements of disturbance . Lord Elgin pointed out that on each of the questions in debate our government has adopted a line the very reverse of that which true policy should have dictated . The executive of the United States has great difficulty in preventing its adventurous and turbulent population from engaging in unlawful enterprises . It is this aggressive spirit which endangers the tranquility of neighboring countries , and exposes them to attack . The neutrality laws of the States are feeble to repress it but they are the only check which can be imposed on it , and manifestly it is the interest of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of strictly en forcing those laws . We ought rather to urge that they should be made more stringent , than that they should be in any way relaxed . The opposite view is adopted by Lord CIarendon . He argues for the greatest latitude in the interpretation of the neutrality laws . He picks out their weak points , and insists that advantage may be taken of them . Because they are lax , they may be totally evaded . In his last despatch , of the 30th of April , he is careful to show how much more loose are the neutrality laws of the States than those of this country . Recruiting is forbidden within the American territory , but he contends that American citizens , when 121 // once clear of that territory , are at liberty to enter the service of any foreign Power they please . This is an evasion of the spirit of neutrality which a minister of England ought never to have sanctioned . Lord Clarendon is playing into the hands of the extreme democratic party . The motion which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws altogether , might be best supported by arguments from Lord Clarendon 's despatches . With regard to Central America , again , it was the policy of this country to uphold the independence of the Central American States . The BuiwerClayton treaty had been concluded for that express purpose . It was our part to give a liberal not a restrictive interpretation to that treaty , that the whole region , being free from the influence of any one great Power , should be open as a highway of transit to the commerce of the whole world . In comparison with the attainment of this great object the right we claimed to a protectorate of part of the Mosquito Territory , or to the possession of some small islands on the lIonduras coast , was extremely insignificant . Such rights were valueless , but to maintain them we have suffered the principle to escape us of preserving inviolate the independence of the whole region of the Isthmus . There is great force in the American argument , that in respect to future acquisitions the probability of advantage , if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America . It was worth some concession on our part to induce the United States government to join us in guranteeing the independence of Central America ; and , having obtained it by treaty , it ought never to have been lost sight of by this country . By Lord Clarendon 's policy a pretext has been afforded to the American government for departing from the principle . While we hold a few insignificant islands , events are tending to the annexation of Central America to the United States territory . While grasping at a shadow we are losing the substance . Had a good understanding subsisted between the two governments , they would have cordially concurred in measures for the instant suppression of Walker 's buccaneering enterprise . The apathy with which the invasion of Nicaragua has been viewed by our government is inexplicable . We know that Lord Clarendon has regarded it with displeasure , but we do not find that he has taken any steps to arrest it . The correspondence of the agent of Costa Rica throws some light on the secret proceedings of our Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was applied to for assistance against Walke*r . When told that a force of 800 men had been raised to resist him , he exclaimed , " That was a right step , " and when applied to on behalf of Costa Rica for arms , he obligingly told the agent that he might have 2,000 muskets from the War Department , at the price of 23s. each for the inferior sort , or 56s. 8d. each for the line pattern . Lord Clarendon 's approval and sympathy went no further . Whether the agent , acting on the caveat emptor principle , inquired elsewhere and found the same article could be furnished cheaper , or whether Costa Rica would not furnish funds for so extensive a purchase , is not material . The arms were not supplied , and General Walker has not to face muskets of British manufacture . The incident should not be lost sight of , as it indicates the kind of action which Lord CIarendon thinks becoming the Foreign Minister of England . lie allows it to be seen that he is adverse to this paltry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided measure for its suppression , or for vindicating the vital principle of the Buiwer-Clayton treaty . Should the reported intelligence of the recognition of Walker 's government by the United States cabinet prove correct , this country will have to make up its mind to abandon altogether that important principle of the independence of the Central ' American States firmly secured by a treaty only six years old , or engage in a war with America to maintain it .
