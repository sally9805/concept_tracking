ART . VI . - Propositions concerning Protection and Free Trade . By WILLARD PHILLIPS . Boston : Little &amp; Brown . 1850. l2mo. pp. 233 . QUESTIONS of science , especially in the moral sciences , when their determination seems likely to affect the material interests of rival classes in the state , are not likely to be dispassionately weighed , or fairly answered . In vain are the eager disputants reminded of the fundamental distinction between a science and an art , - that the former relates exclusively to the formal evolution , whether by inductive or deductive logic , of abstract principles , while the latter alone is concerned with the application of these principles to the practical business of life . The application of the principle seems easy and obvious ; it is taken for granted that it can be applied but in one way , and that without limitations or exceptions . The consequences of such application are found to be offensive , or perhaps injurious ; and those who are harmed by it are then tempted to quarrel , not m*erely with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the theory itself , - with the fundamental principle , it may be , of a well approved and almost universally recognized science . Thus , mutual jealousy and dislike are needlessly fostered between speculative and practical men , as they are called ; the former are led to despise the short-si* , htedness of those who rely only upon the familiar lessons of daily experience , while the latter regard with contemptuous pity the abstract theorems concocted by a dreamy professor in his closet . Both are right , when they confine themselves within the proper limits of their respective vocations ; both are wrong , when , consciously or unconsciously , they transcend those limits . The lessons of experience are adequate to modify the rules of art , but they can not shake the principles of science ; for science is but a larger generalization of experience , or else a deduction from those primary principles on which the validity of all experience depends . It is a safer course , to say the least , to call in question the applicability of the principle to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all its generality , or to affirm that the science , of which it forms a part , has no // secure foundation . It may turn out , on farther examination , that the supposed exception tends only to confirm the rule . These remarks are particularly applicable when we come to treat of the science of political economy and the art of legislation , with a view to the promotion of great national interests and the growth of national opulence . They are particularly applicable here in America , where our situation , in reference to the main elements of national prosperity , is wholly peculiar . We are separated by a wide waste of ocean from all the other great commercial and manufacturing nations of the earth . Our population , though it has become absolutely large , is small when compared with the vast extent of territory that it occupies . We have the elements of agricultural , manufacturing , and commercial wealth in great abundance ; but many of them are yet undeveloped , and the question , in what order they are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successively , is a serious and difficult one . Besides , the science of political economy to us is one of foreign origin , as it has been but little cultivated by native thinkers . Principles which , if not immediately deduced from the experience of England and France , have been chiefly con sidered in their application to the people of those two countries , need to be defined and limited anew before they are brought across the broad Atlantic . It behooves us to study European systems of political economy with diligence and caution before we make much use of them under circumstances so dissimilar from those which first suggested them . But it also behooves us not to reject the whole science in a pet , because we have discovered that some of its dogmas are not suited to our position , and do not meet our wants . The author of these Propositions concerning Protection and Free Trade is an able and earnest advocate of a protective policy , as best suited to the condition and interests of the United States . In this respect , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arguments , and think that he has very clearly exposed the fallacies and unsound reasoning of those who have maintained that the principles of free trade ought to govern the present course of American legislation . But we do not believe that the science of political economy is responsible for their blunders , their imperfect observation , and their want of skill in reducing scientific principles to practice // under peculiar circumstances . Certainly , it is not politic to maintain , that the American protectionists must begin by attempting to overturn the whole edifice erected by Adam Smith , Ricardo , Senior , McCulloch , and Mill , and proving that these writers are wholly undeserving of credit . Whatever errors Adam Smith may have committed , he must be regarded as the founder of a science , which , for the last half century , in every civilized country on earth , has more directly affected and controlled the material interests and daily pursuits of men than any discovery or pure speculation that has been made since the revival of letters ; and which is even now exerting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economical polity of all nations that are not sunk in barbarism . This assertion may seem to be unwarrantably sweeping ; but it is supported by the high authority of Sir James Mackintosh , who , when speaking of Adam Smith 's great work on the Wealth of Nations , remarked that it is " perhaps the only book which produced an immediate , general , and irrevocable change in some of the most important parts of the legislation of all civilized states . " In a few years after its publication , he went on to say , " it began to alter laws and treaties , and has made its way throughout the convulsions of revolution and conquest , to a due ascendant over the minds of men , with far less than the average of those obstructions of prejudice and clamor which ordinarily choke the channels through which truth flows into practice . " Twenty years have elapsed since Mackintosh pronounced this opinion ; and during these twenty years , the influence of Adam Smith 's science of political economy has been even more conspicuous and direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has shaped the polity of nations ; its principles are embodied on almost every page of commercial law ; it has guided the most important applications of national industry ; it has done more than all other causes united to put a stop to the practice of international war . Though its doctrines have been somewhat modified , and large additions have been made to it , it is still , in the main , what we have called it , Adam Smith 's science . His successors have built mainly upon the foundations which he laid , and the structure has risen in general conformity with the plan which he sketched out . Among all the moral sciences , there is no other which // bears the name of its founder so distinctly engraven upon its front , or which retains so large a proportion of the doctrines that he first promulgated . It is a misfortune , then , for any proposed measure or act of public policy , that it can be supported only in opposition to the doctrines of Adam Smith , and by discrediting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We certainly do not believe that such a course is necessary before we can offer a satisfactory defence of what is properly called the American policy , of offering adequate protection to domestic manufactures by duties which shall restrict the importation of foreign goods . Yet Mr. Phillips has adopted this course , and , as it seems to us , with needless asperity of language . He has thereby , we think , only weakened the cause which he is endeavoring to support , and created a prejudice which lessens the effect of his own arguments . He has done so much , by his previous writings , to illustrate and defend the principles of economical science , that we can not now suspect him of a wish to overturn the whole edifice for the mere purpose of establishing his favorite policy upon its ruins . Yet his language , if strictly construed , seems more than once to indicate such an intention . It is hut fair , however , to quote from the Preface to the work now before us the explanation which he offers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feelings . " I should be happy to believe that there is little at stake , and that the doctrines of free trade do not tend directly to the distress , decay , and political subordination and degradation of this country , and the too great entanglement of its industry and interests with those of other nations . But it has not happened to me in thus devoting my attention more particularly to these inquiries , as it did some thirty years ago . Being then imbued with that economical creed which is taught in our public seminaries , I had occasion to attempt its vindication , against the aggressions then supposed to be made on commerce by the useful arts , through protective legis. lation ; and I had the good fortune or misfortune , on investigating the subject anew , to convert myself to the opinions I had under . taken to combat . I came out with the thorough conviction that the science , which seemed so luminous to those at the feet of the Gamaliels , consisted very much of groundless postulates and sophistry . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at having been imposed upon . It is possible that this senti // ment may sometimes tinge my phraseology . If it does so , I will rely upon your accepting the cause as my apology , if you are not on the side of free trade ; if you are upon that side , you will take it in good part , without any apology ; for no persons are less sparing than the advocates of that doctrine , in applying uncomplimentary epithets to such as can not say Shibboleth. ' " pp. 4,5 . Reactions sometimes go too far . A change of opinion , if radical and sweeping , is likely to be defended with some degree of personal feeling intermingled with the desire to serve the interests of science and the cause of truth . In no other way can we account for the warmth of feeling and severity of expression which characterize such passages as the following . " I more especially and hopefully address these propositions , not only to those who have not examined the subject , but also to persons who , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incipient cogitations upon social phenomena and social destiny , have too easily acquiesced in the enormous sophisms and inconsistencies of Adam Smith and his echoes , and are free from pride of opinion , esprit du corps , or other bias , to hinder them from revising their opinions candidly. " pp. 110 , 111 . " If you doubt whether I am giving a genuine specimen of the logical deductions of the economical science of Adam Smith , and Mr. Walker , and the agents of foreign manufacturers in our seaports , it is because you have not read the secretary 's report , an the treatises of free-trade economists , and the profound articles on this subject in the free-trade periodicals ; and I accordingly have the honor of initiating you into that transcendent science . p. 180 . " This signal commonplace of free trade that capital withdrawn from one employment will be turned to account in some other is characterized no less by cool contumely to misfortune , than outrage to the common sense of mankind . You meet with it in all the free-trnde essays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 107 . " I speak of the theory of free trade as being , at the outset , a dreamy hallucination , made up of fallacious , sophistical assumptions , the reproduction and reiteration of which , at this time of day , after so many unanswered and unanswerable expositions and experimental demonstrations of its utterly false and shammy character , call to mind the profound Mr. Jenkinson 's learned discourse on Sanconiathon , Berosius , and cosmogony , to which one // might fairly give the reply of the IRev . Mr. Primrose , I beg pardon , sir , for interrupting so much learning , but I think I have heard all this before ; ' and request the teacher of these mysteries of his science , ' to spare himself and us the repetition of those general , abstract , indefinite , mystical , transcendental theorems , and set about giving us some reason , practical or theoretical , for assenting to some one , at least , of those eleven fundamental propositions , to all of which he presumes our assent . " pp. 108 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter words ; " and we do not think they aid the argument much . The writer 's indignation so far blinds his vision that he sometimes , quite unconsciously , misrepresents the very doctrine which he so vehemently censures . If he had read a little further , or more carefully , he would have found Adam Smith warmly eulogizing the very measure which he is here sharply scolded for opposing . For example : - " The Irish are suffering the evils of deficiency of employment , and of the consequent partial distribution of food and other products , so that many can obtain only enough to protract the agonies of death . Let alone , ' say the professors of the free . trade school , the evil remedies itself ; ' that is , the people die . " In Cromwell 's time , the Dutch had got the start of the English in the carrying trade , and carried for them as well as for others . Let alone , ' say Adam Smith , etc. , down to Mr. Treasurer Walker , who would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cromwell and his Rump Parliament thought it safer to cure it themselves , and so passed the Navigation Act ; by the operation of which they drove the Dutch out of , not only the carrying for themselves , but also that for other nations . " p. 48 . We had supposed even the most careless reader of the Wealth of Nations must remember that , from his general argument against restraints upon importation , Smith excepts " two cases , in which it will be generally advantageous to lay some burden upon foreign , for the encouragement of domestic , industry . " " The first is , when some particular sort of industry is necessary for the defence of the country . The defence of Great Britain , for example , depends very much upon the number of its sailors and shipping . The act of navigation , therefore , very properly endeavors to give the sailors and shipping of Great Britain the monopoly of the trade of their own country , in some cases by // absolute prohibitions , and in others by heavy burdens upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the provisions of the act , and the reason , ( jealousy of the Dutch , who were then the great carriers of Europe , ) why it was passed , Adam Smith goes on to say : - " When the act of navigation was made , though England and Holland were not actually at war , the most violent animosity existed between the two nations . It bad begun during the government of the Long Parliament , which first framed this act , and it broke out soon after in the Dutch wars during that of the Protector and of Charles II . It is not impossible , therefore , that some of the regulations of this famous act may have proceeded from national animosity . They are as wise , however , as of they had all been dictated by the most deliberate wisdom . National animosity at that particular time aimed at the very same object which the most deliberate wisdom would have recommended , - the diminution of the naval power of Holland , the only power which could endanger the security of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of much more importance than opulence , the act of navigation is , perhaps , the wisest of all the commercial regulations of England . " * It is evident , then , however obnoxious Adam Smith may be to the censure of Mr. Phillips in other respects , that in regard to the policy of the navigation act , the two entertain precisely the same opinions . In this particular , Mr. Phillips is only buffeting the comrade who is helping him to trim the sails of the ship , having the same harbor in view And we may remark in passing , that " the second case , " in which Adam Smith admits that " it will generally be advantageous to lay some burden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry , " is one which , when properly considered , and carried out to the full extent of the principle involved in it , will cover a great part of the ground for which our author here manfully contends , fancying all the while that he is fighting against the great founder of political economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nearly a century , has surrounded his name . Such a battle in the dark , when the foot-lights are again turned towards the stage , is apt only to excite the merriment of the spectators . // Among all the peculiar doctrines maintained by Adam Smith and his disciples , that which most kindles the ire of our author is the laissez-faire , or " let-alone " principle ; and construing it , as he seems to do , into a censure of " whatever laws you pass , or neglect to pass , either economical , civil , or criminal , " and thereby into a deprecation of all activity on the part of the government , and almost into a denial of the blessings of any social union among men , we do not wonder at the fierceness of his indignation . He may well say , - " It is the pickpocket , the cheat , the impostor , the man of false pretences , who says universally , Laissez-nous faire , Leave us alone . The millions of the industrious invoke the laws and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable them to help each other . " p. 8 . " The let-us-alone doctrine is for the marauder , the bee that plunders another 's hive , not for the one that collects its stores in the fields . " p. 11 . " A nation ought to act as a sensible individual would , if he were a nation . This shallow truism is all the truth that can be extracted from this grand fundamental proposition of Adam Smith . I think , then , we may safely say that the let-alone doctrine is based upon a miserable fallacy . " p. 24 . Apart from any measure of respect which even the uninitiated in economical science may believe to be due to the name of Adam Smith as a thinker and a moralist , we think that few intelligent students of his work will admit that the let-alone principle , as set forth and advocated by him , amounts either to the monstrous disorganizing and anarchical maxim , or to the shallow truism , into which it is here resolved . We believe , and shall endeavor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and highly valuable truth , most applicable to the circumstances and exigencies of our own times , and one which is perfectly consistent with what we consider to be both the English and American doctrine , that infant manufactures , in any country , ought to be nursed and protected against foreign competition , until they are able to compete with those of other lands upon equal terms . It is most unfortunate that our author 's lucid , cogent , and coruprehensive argument in behalf of this doctrine should be needlessly deformed and weakened by these idle thrusts against the authority of political economy as a science , and against // the reputation of its illustrious founder . We would gladly sit at his feet , or follow in his track , while he draws forth , in a style of almost unrivalled vigor and terseness , the nurnerous considerations in favor of the universal adoption of this doctrine here in America . But this may not be till we have attempted , however imperfectly , to vindicate American protectionists from the reproach of flying in the face of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the master thinkers both of the last century and of our own times . We must therefore crave the indulgence of our readers for going somewhat far hack , and endeavoring , however imperfectly , in what space remains to us , to prove that there is such a science as political economy ; that it rests upon a sure basis , and consists of many well ascertained and well defined general laws and principles ; that among these is what is usually termed the laissez-faire , or let-alone , principle ; and that the assertion of this principle , and of all the others with which it is usually classed , is quite consistent with an energetic support of the policy of granting adequate protection to infant manufactures . As the field thus marked out may he too extensive to he traversed within our present limits of time , the subject may he taken up again on a future occasion . The most obvious , though certainly not the most important , difference between a civilized community and a nation of savages , consists in the vastly greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort and enjoyment . These means , including the necessaries , conveniences , and luxuries of life , are chiefly material objects , - such as manufactured goods , articles of food and clothing , the useful and the precious metals , and ornaments or things designed to gratify the taste and the senses . Some , however , are immaterial , and yet are just as much objects of desire , just as much objects of barter and sale , as cloth and bread . The legal knowledge and acumen of a lawyer , for instance , the medical skill of a physician , the vocal powers of a remarkable singer , the mimetic talent of an actor , the practised hand of an ingenious and thoroughly trained artisan , - all command a prize in the market quite as readily as any goods in a shop . When an occasion arises , we buy the services of a lawyer , just as we buy a ticket to a concert , or an instru // ment of music for a drawing-room . Now , the aggregate of all these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoyment , and which are objects of frequent barter and sale , is what we usually call wealth ; and individuals or nations are denominated rich or poor according to the abundance or scarcity of these articles which they possess , or have at their immediate disposal . Two questions may be asked as to the production of these articles of wealth - ( 1 . ) By what mechanical processes are they manufactured or obtained ? To answer this query is the business of a man of physical science , a chemist , a mechanic , a farmer , or the like ; as political economists , we have nothing to do with it . But , ( 2. ) we may ask , On what principles do men readily exchange these articles for each other , and what motives , what general laws , regulate their production , distribution , and consumption ? Political economy undertakes to answer this question , and is therefore properly considered as one of the moral sciences . It depends , quite as closely as politics and ethics , upon the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce to general laws the habits and dispositions of men , so far as they are manifested in their efforts for the acquisition of wealth , as it is to develop from observation and consciousness the laws of our moral condition . The study of ethics and of intellectual philosophy , strictly so called , does not exhaust the study of human nature . We have yet to learn what are the principles of human conduct in reference to the outward means of supporting man 's life and satisfying all his wants and desires . Political economy is founded on observation of the manner in which the independent members of any society act towards each other in the attempt to create or acquire these means . It begins with the supposition , that man is disposed to accumulate beyond what is necessary for the immediate gratification of his wants , and that this disposition , in the great majority of cases , is in fact unbounded ; that man 's inclination to labor is mainly controlled by this desire ; that he is constantly competing with his fellows in this undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industry are most profitable , and eager enough to enter them , so that competition constantly tends to bring wages and profits to a level . The science , then , is more closely allied with the philosophy 35* // of the human mind than with natural history or the physical science of the outward world . It has been called Catallactics , or the Science of Exchanges ; ' and , agreeably to this notion , man himself has been defined to be an animal that makes exchanges ; ' " as no other , even of those animals which , in other points , make the nearest approach to rationality , has , to all appearance , the least notion of bartering or in any way exchanging one object for another . " With regard to the articles that constitute wealth , it is to be remarked , that far the larder portion of them are perishable , or quickly consumable . Some of them , like the immaterial products , are consumed at the instant that they are produced ; others , like articles of food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . The fashion and the fabric of manufactured goods soon decay , the former being even more shortlived than the latter ; tools and machinery wear out ; houses and other buildings need constant repairs , and , at stated intervals , must be wholly renewed . Hardly any thing but the solid land itself , the great God-given , food-producing machine , is permanent ; and the exchangeable value even of the land , ( the only quality of it which we have to consider in this science , ) quickly diminishes , and almost wholly disappears , if it be not " kept in heart " by the constant application of labor and capital , or maintained in value by the continued prosperity of the community who live upon it . Some land in State Street is now worth $40 a square foot ; but if the other items which constitute the wealth of Boston , the ships in her harbor and the goods in her shops , were not perpetually renewed , that land would deteriorate in price with fearful rapidity ; and when the city should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decaying village , that land would not be worth $40 an acre . Wealth , then - and we may crave attention to the proposition , for it is an all-important one - wealth must be perpetually renewed , or it quickly diminishes and disappears . The stock of national wealth is like the flesh , blood , and bones of a man 's body , which are in a state of constant flux and renovation ; physiologists tell us , that our bodies are entirely renewed about once in seven years . But the riches of an opulent community are not so long-lived even as this . Let labor universally cease in that community ; let every // man , woman , and child in it rest with folded arms , or do nothing but eat , drink , and be merry , and those riches would melt and waste like snow under a July sun . National wealth , then , may be more fitly compared to a given portion , a section , of the waters of a running stream , bounded by a few rods in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing , yet in one sense is always the same , so long as the supply from above is maintained ; but if the springs in the upper country should be suddenly dried up , the efflux below would drain the channel in an hour . And herein is one striking exemplification , among a thousand others , of the inordinate folly and ignorance of those who cry out against the institution of property , and call for an equal distribution of all the wealth of a community among all its members . " Riches have wings " in a far more immediate and practical sense than these people are at all aware of . They always talk as if the national wealth was a fixed and imperishable quantity , like the land , the sunlight , and the air , - but as if , unlike these , it was monopolized by a few , though sufficient for the wants of all . Their blunder is quite as great as would be that of a raw countryman , who , after waiking the whole length of Quincy Market on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalls presented almost precisely the same array of meats and vegetables , in the same order , should conclude that there had been no change , and that , as here was a permanent stock of food enough for all , xvhile some families in the city were sufferin0 from hunger , a general and equal distribution of this stock , without compensation to the owners , should be ordered , under the idea that it would make any future want of provision impossible . The possibility that this great store might all be consumed in one day , and that the dealers ; deterred by this spoliation , might not supply the market at all on the next day , would never occur to him . This great and pregnant truth , that the whole stock of national wealth is in a constant and rapid process of consumption and reproduction , is quite generally lost sight of , because we see that the fortunes of individuals , the aggregate of which constitutes the national stock , are comparatively permanent , and , as it seems , do not need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere compe // tency , and then C invested , ' as the phrase goes , with ordinary care and judgment , a man 's property will continue apparently without change , all the while yielding its regular income or increase . If its owner be not a spendthrift , an inebriate , or a simpleton , it will supply his wants and gratify his tastes , and still grow by a steady and sure process of accumulation , the savings of income being added to the capital , without ever encroaching upon his leisure , or requiring him to superintend a change of its form . How can this fact be reconciled with the principles that have just been stated respecting the nature of all wealth ? The answer to this question , the solution of this problem , brings us at once to the heart of our subject . It is the property , the ownership , that is unchanged , and thus the fortunes of individuals remain intact ; the articles which are the subjects of that property , which are owned , are constantly changing , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coöperation , and even without his knowledge . Barring casualties , unlucky investments , and the like , which , being few and infrequent , may be left out of the account , no man 's property is consumed without being replaced by the very act of consumption , unless he himself , consciously and wilfully , consumes or expends it unproductively , that is , upon the gratification of his own tastes and appetites , without looking for a return or replacement . To invest one s savings is to lend them ; not having time , inclination , or perhaps ability , to use them reproductively to advantage , - that is , to superintend the constant changes of form which they must undergo , or quickly perish , - we lend them to others , who can and will direct their transformations , on condition of receiving a small portion of the profits of these changes . For it is also the nature of wealth , when well managed , to grow , or increase , by each change of form . Mobilitate viget , viresque acquirit eundo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single instance , - the simplest one that can be found . If the earnings of an ordinary laborer for a year amount to $300 , he may expend them all upon food , clothing , and amusement ; in this case , he spends them all unproductively , - that is , without expecting a return or replacement of them . At the year 's end , all the advantage which remains to him from his year 's labor is , that his strength , health* and spirits are renewed or replaced , // so that he can now go to work and earn another year 's wages . But suppose that he is frugal and ambitious to grow rich . He will then contract his daily expenses , drink nothing but water , give up all amusements , and thus , at the end of the year , find that his health and spirits are even greater than before , and that he has saved perhaps $100 , or one third of his earnings . What will he do with this $100 ? In a rude state of society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Turkish pacha , property being insecure , he would probably obtain it in the form of gold or silver coin , and bury it in the corner of his cellar or garden . There , sure enough , it would remain without change , and therefore without income or increase . But in this country , in England , France , or any commercial and manufacturing community , he would put it in the savings ' bank ; that is , he would lend it to the bank , which , for shortness , we will suppose to be a bank both of savings and discount . In consequence of this loan , the bank will be able to discount or lend $100 more to one of its customers . Suppose a baker wishes to extend his business , but has not capital enough of his own to buy more flour with ; he borrows this $100 of the bank for four months , and with it he immediately purchases twenty barrels of flour more than he could otherwise have purchased . What he borrows of the bank is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed to him across the counter , but the twenty which the bank directors say to the flourdealer , deliver this man twenty barrels of flour , and we will pay you for it . The flour-dealer complies , and immediately carries back the bill to the bank , and is paid for it , either in hard specie , in that amount carried to his credit , or in any other form that he may prefer . We may put aside , then , in future , any consideration of the bank bills , for they are nothing but " tickets of transfer , " or orders from the bank to any merchant , asking to deliver the bearer a certain amount of goods , and the bank will pay him for them . But let us follow the laborer 's $100 of savings ; in what shape do they now exist ? Evidently they have now become twenty barrels of flour , which the baker gradually transforms into many loaves of bread , and sells them to his customers . Before the four months expire , the bread is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 are now fairly consumed . But has their value disappeared ? By no means . The baker 's cus-* tomers have paid him for this bread at least $120 , so that he can now repay the hank the $100 that he borrowed , with the addition of $2 for four months ' interest , and put $18 into his own pocket as the reward of his labor . The bank , being again in funds , can now lend , we will suppose , $102 worth of leather for four months to an enterprising cordwainer , who begins immediately to manufacture it into boots and shoes . Before his four months have expired , these are all sold , ( half of them , perhaps , are half worn out , ) and he has received , we will suppose , $225 for them , so that he can now repay the bank its loan of $102 , besides $2 and a fraction , for interest , pay his workmen probably $100 , for a good deal of labor was needed for the consumption of that amount of leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own pocket . At the end of eight months , then , the bank has a little over $104 , to let out for another period of four months . A paper-maker borrows this , buys rags with it , makes paper out of them , sells it , and with the proceeds he pays the bank $106 and a fraction . The year has now expired , and our frugal laborer , having occasion to make a different use of his savings , goes to the bank for them , and receives $ 104.50 , the institution retaining nearly $2 , as compensation for its own agency in the affair . Thus the laborer finds , that , by some process incomprehensible to him , the $100 , which he deposited in the bank for a year , has hatched $4.50 , which it certainly would not have done , if it had been simply locked up in the vault for safekeeping . Could he have followed that process , he would have seen his $100 successively becoming , or assuming the shape of , flour , bread , leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of these forms , in turn , he would have seen it entirely consumed or used up . The flour , leather , and rags have been manufactured into corresponding articles , the bread has been eaten , the shoes are half worn out , and the paper is covered with writing or printing , so that a new supply of each is called for . There has been a net gain at each stage of the transaction , and the total gain has been equally distributed among all the parties to it , compensating each for his labor or frugality. // If any one thinks that the instance here analyzed is a trivial or exceptional one , so that it throws little light upon the general theory of wealth , we refer him to the last annual return made to the legislature by the Savings Banks in Massachusetts , which shows that the amount now deposited in these institutions exceeds $12,000,000 , that it yields an average annual dividend of nearly 6 per cent. , and the number of depositors exceeds 71,600 , so that the average amount to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This aggregate of savings , - made up , be it remembered , by the labor and frugality of Irish domestics , small mechanics , operatives in great manufacturing establishments , day-laborers in the country , and the like , - is more than enough to build and keep in motion all the factories in Lowell ; for the aggregate capital of all the great manufacturing companies in that city falls short of eleven millions . We return to the principle first enunciated , and which now seems to be fully established , - namely , that the whole wealth of a civilized and trading nation is in a constant and rapid process of consumption and reproduction ; and that the apparent stability and unchangeableness of the fortunes of individuals offer no exception to this principle . The instance analyzed also proves , that a gain - a profit - an addition to the national wealth - is made only at and by these successive changes of form . What is immovable or unconsumable is also necessarily unproductive . We consume in order that we may produce , and we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote Scripture on such a topic , " that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die . " The wealth which is literally locked up or buried , only rots or rusts , and we might just as well bury only stones or sand in its place . But money or wealth is not locked up when placed in banks , institutions for savings , " moneyed corporations , " as they are called , and the like . These institutions are nothing but contrivances for collecting it , setting it in motion , and making it circulate around us like the atmosphere which we breathe . It supplies the lungs of industry , keeps it alive , renders it efficient , and makes all the parts or members of the body politic and social contribute to the sustenance and growth of the whole . The twelve millions in our Savings Banks , and the thirtyfive millions of capital in our banks of deposit and circula // tion , ( we speak only of Massachusetts , ) do not rest there , but are at this moment circulating around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mechanics with tools and our tradesmen with goods , building and freighting our ships , brin* , ing to us the productions of all habitable climes , hurrying from one task to another with indefatigable ardor , and assuming a thousand different forms and hues , according to our necessities and our desires . We have a right to assume , then , that the theory of wealth is a large and complicated one , embracing many curious and difficult problems , and resting upon many general principles or laws , the discovery and development of which constitute a distinct and important science , - the science of political economy . One of these laws , or general facts , the circulation of capital , - has now been pointed out and briefly elucidated ; and it may readily be perceived that it is a fruitful one , pregnant with important conclusions and inferences respecting the institution of property , and the modes of favoring industry and increasing national wealth . If the science has been successfully cultivated , many more such general laws must have been discovered in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the merchant , and the philanthropist . As expounded in the books , whether by Adam Smith , Ricardo , Sismondi , or McCulloch , it may , or may not , be well founded and trustworthy in all its parts . Authorities differ on many points . But these men have not been studying a mere chimera , or wasting their energies in a vain pursuit . There are general laws affecting the production and distribution of wealth , whether they have been discovered or not ; and a knowledge of these laws is a very different thing from the practical knowledge , the acquaintance with details , and the natural shrewdness which enable a man to acquire property , and to take good care of it when acquired . And this leads us to remark , that political economy is not , as some suppose , the art of money-making , any more than meteorology is the art of predicting the weather . It is no art at all , hut a science ; for its immediate end is knowledge , riot action , or the guidance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere and the weather , irregular as they are in their occurrence , and obscure as to their immediate causes , must depend on the general princi // pies of gravity and the equilibrium of fluids , and must be referable to general laws , which are legitimate objects of investigation . He may have studied these laws successfully , and still not be so able as an old sea-captain is , who never opened a book on meteorology in his life , to tell what the weather will be the next hour , or the next day . It is a point of as much interest and real importance to know how a storm occurs , as to know when it will occur . So , after one of those storms in the commercial world which are called commercial crises , ' we may reasonably seek an explanation of the phenomenon , or the cause of its occurrence , though this knowledge should not enable us to tell when another and similar disturbance will happen . The general principles of any science are obtained onlxr by abstraction , - by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which practically belong to the case , and thus so far simplifying it that we can reason about it with facility . The conclusions at which we arrive by this process are very comprehensive , hut do not admit of immediate application . They are true only with certain qualifications and restrictions . They are involved in all the phenomena to which they relate , and have a share in producing them ; but they do not constitute the whole of these phenomena . Now , all legislation which is designed to affect the economical interests *of a country , or which relates immediately to its commerce , agriculture , or manufactures , is in truth an application of the principles of some system of political economy to practice . It is often a very rash and injurious application of them , because the circumstances which actually limit the principles are lost sight of , and the abstractions by which they were obtained are forgotten . Mischief results ; and practical men , seeing that the consequences do not square with the theory , call in question the science itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Hence arises an unhappy dissension between theory and practice , to the lasting detriment of both . The political economists themselves are somewhat to blame for this result , by pressing too eagerly the adoption of their favorite doctrines , without regard to the particular circumstances of each case . The general doctrine of Free Trade , for instance , which is unquestionably correct when applied to // two nations which are similarly situated in every respect , which have grown up under the same institutions and the same laws , and in which the profits of capital , the wages of labor , and the ratio of population to territory are on nearly the same level , is extended by a hasty generalization to two conatries that are contrasted with each other in all these respects , and in its application to which , to say the least , the correctness of the principle is very doubtful . We have in this country the largest extension of the system of free trade which the world has ever witnessed ; we have free trade between Maine and Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet heard it doubted that this liberty of commerce was equally beneficial to all these States . But before the system is carried out between England and the United States , we may reasonably inquire whether it will not necessarily tend to an equalization of profits and wages in the two countries , and whether it is desirable here that the rates of both should be reduced to the English standard . We do not now undertake to decide the question ; politicians and other wise men differ about it . But we may say , that the question does not relate to the correctness of the general principle in economical science , but only to its applicability under particular circumstances . That all bodies gravitate to the centre of the earth is a general law , which is not disproved by the floating of a cork in a basin of water . We may reasonably ask in both cases , whether the apparent exception may not be found , on a closer examination , to confirm the rule . Another prejudice against economical science has arisen from an error of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it to the causes affecting the increase of national wealth , the other interests of a people being undervalued or wholly neglected . The English economists of Ricardo 's school have most frequently fallen into this error ; looking merely to the creation of material values , they have tacitly assumed that this was the only interest of society , the only end which legislation should have in view . The proposition on which they act , though they seldom directly enunciate it , is , that the augmentation of national wealth is at once the sign and the measure of national prosperity . We may admit that it is so , if the wealth be distributed with some approach // to equality among the people . But if the vast majority of the nation is beggared , while enormous fortunes are accumulated by a few ; if pauperism increases at one end of the social scale as rapidly as wealth is heaped up at the other ; then , even though the ratio of the aggregate wealth to the aggregate population is constantly growin , larger , the tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a remedy be not applied , society will rush into degradation and ruin . There is a danger , from which no civilized community is entirely free , lest the several classes of its society should nourish mutual jealousy and hatred , which may finally break out into open hostilities , under the mistaken opinion that their interests are opposite , and that one or more of them possess an undue advantage , which they are always ready to exercise by oppressing the others . Twenty years ago , Archbishop Whateley pointed out the full extent of this danger in a single pregnant question - " Can the laboring classes - and that , too , in a country where they have a legal right to express practically their political opinions - can they be safely left to suppose , as many a demagogue is ready , when it suits his purpose , to tell them , that inequality of conditions is inexpedient , and ought to be abolished ; that the wealth of a man , whose income is equal to that of a hundred laboring families , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred poor families the less to be sustained ; and that a general spoliation of the rich and an equal division of property would put an end to poverty forever ? " Under these circumstances , we may ask further , can we safely neglect to explain and teach the great truths which political economy has demonstrated , that all classes of society are inseparably bound together in a community of interest ; that the prosperity of each depends on the welfare of all ; that the national industry must be meagre or profitless in its results , if it has not capital or concentrated wealth to cooperate with it ; that an equal division of property would in fact destroy or dissipate that which was divided ; and that the only equality of condition which human nature renders possible is an equality of destitution and suffering ? We need not apolo0ize for the science which treats of the creation of wealth , on the ground that it relates only to one of the lower interests of humanity , and that it is not of so // much moment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is for it to be wise , free , instructed , and virtuous . It is true that wealth is one of the lower elements or supports of civilization ; and that the comparative quantity of it is but an imperfect index of national worth and national happiness . But it is also true , that wealth is that element of civilization which supports all the others , and that , without it , no progress , no refinement , no liberal art , would be possible . Without property , without large accumulations of wealth , no division of labor would be possible ; and without the division of labor , each man must provide by his own toil for all his bodily wants . He must plant , sow , and reap for himself . He must be his own tailor , shoemaker , housewright , and cook . The scholar could no longer devote himself exclusively to his books , the man of science to the observation of nature , the artist to the canvas or marble , the physician to the cure of diseases , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bound alike by the stern necessity of daily brutish toil on the most repulsive tasks . National wealth is a condition of progress , a prerequisite of civilization ; it is not in itself ennobling , but it is that which vivifies and maintains all the other elements and influences which dignify humanity and render life desirable . Even if popular ignorance and prejudice upon this subject were not dangerous to the state , a liberal curiosity would not rest without some knowledge of the laws affecting the creation and production of wealth , - laws which are , in truth , as constant and uniform as those which bind the material universe together , and evince the wisdom and goodness of the Creator quite as clearly as any of his arrangements in the organic kingdoms . Blanco White , speaking of the inattention of the ancients to the philosophy of wealth , compares their state of mind to that of children in the house of an opulent tradesman , who , finding the comforts and necessaries of life supplied to them with mechanical regularity , never inquire into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they ever do think about it , suppose that breakfast , dinner , and supper succeed one another by the spontaneous bounty of nature , like spring , summer , and autumn . It is true , that men are usually selfish in the pursuit of wealth ; but it is a wise and benevolent arrangement of Providence , that even // those who are thinking only of their own credit and advantage , are led unconsciously , but surely , to benefit others . The contrivance by which this end is effected , this reconciliation of private aims with the public advantage , is often complex , farreachin* , , and intricate , and thus more strongly indicates the benevolent purpose of the Designer . In the instance already given , we have seen that the wealth of an individual , perhaps a sordid and covetous one , invested by him with a view only to his own advantage and security , and to spare himself the trouble of superintending it , still circulates through the community without his knowledge , supporting the laborer at his task , supplying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their designs , and assuming with facility every shape which the necessities or the convenience of society may require . We borrow , with some abridgment , a simpler and more striking illustration of the same great truth from Whately . " Let any one propose to himself the problem of supplying with daily provisions of all kinds a city like London , containing ahout two millions of inhabitants . Let him imagine himself a head commissary , intrusted with the office of furnishing to this enormous host their daily rations . A failure in the supply even for a single day might produce the most frightful distress . Some , indeed , of the articles consumed might be stored up in reserve for a considerable time ; but many , including most articles of animal food and many of vegetable , are of the most perishable nature . As a deficient supply of these , even for a few days , would occasion great inconvenience , so a redundancy of them would produce a corresponding waste . The city is also of vast extent , - a province covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies should be so distributed as to be brought almost to the doors of all the inhabitants . The supply of provisions for aa army or garrison is comparatively uniform in kind ; but here , the greatest possible variety is required , suitable to the wants of the various classes of consumers . Again , this immense population is extremely fluctuating in numbers ; and the increase or diminution depends on causes of which some may , others can not , be distinctly foreseen . Again , and above all , the daily supplies of each article must be so nicely adjusted to the stock from which it is drawn , to the scanty or abundant harvest , importation , or other source of supply , to the interval which must elapse before a fresh stock can be furnished , and to the probable abundance of the new supply , that as little distress as possible may be felt ; - that , on 36 * // the one hand , the population may not unnecessarily he put on short allowance of any article , and , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famine , which must happen if they continued to consume freely when the stock was insufficient to hold out . " Now let any one consider this problem in all its hearings , and then reflect on the anxious toil which such a task would impose on a board of the most experienced and intelligent commissaries , - who , after all , could discharge their office hut very inadequately . Yet this object is accomplished , far better than it could be by any effort of human wisdom , through the agency of men who think each of nothing beyond his own immediate interest ,  --  who , with that object in view , perform their respective parts with cheerful zeal , and combine unconsciously to employ the wisest means for effecting an object , the vastness of which it would bewilder them even to contemplate . " It is really wonderful to consider with what ease and regularity this important end is accomplished , day after day , and year after year , through the sagacity and vigilance of private interest operating on the numerous class of wholesale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches attentively the demands of his neighborhood , or of the market he frequents , for such commodities as he deals in . The apprehension , on the one hand , of not realizing all the profit he might , and , on the other , of having his goods left on his hands , - these antagonist muscles regulate the extent of his dealings and the prices at which he buys and sells . An abundant supply causes him to lower his prices , and thus enables the public to enjoy that abundance ; while he is guided only by the apprehension of being undersold . On the other hand , an actual or apprehended scarcity causes him to demand a higher price , or to keep back his goods in expectation of a rise . Thus he codperates , unknowingly , in conducting a system which no human wisdom directed to that end could have conducted so well ,  --  the system by which this enormous population is fed from day to day . " I say no human wisdom ; ' for wisdom there surely is , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this instance , there are the same marks of benevolent design which we are accustomed to admire in the anatomical structure of the human body . I know not whether it does not even still more excite our admiration of the beneficent wisdom of Providence , to contemplate , not corporeal particles , but rational free agents , cooperating in systems not less manifestly indicating design , but no design of theirs ; and though acted on , not by gravitation and impulse , like inert matter , but by motives addressed to the will , yet accomplishing as regularly and as effectually an // object they never contemplated , as if they were merely the passive wheels of a machine . The heavens do indeed declare the glory of God , ' and the human body is fearfully and wonderfully made ; but man , considered not merely as an organized being , but as a rational agent and as a member of society , is perhaps the most wonderfully contrived product of divine wisdom that we have any knowledge of . " Whateley 's Lectures on Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large induction from such cases as this , that political economists rest their most comprehensive and most noted maxim - the laissez-faire , or " let-alone " principle - the doctrine of non-interference by the government with the economical interests of society . True , these interests are in the hands of individuals , who look only to their own immediate profit , and not to the public advantage , or to the distant future . They are not only selfish ; they are often ignorant , short-sighted , and unconscious of much of the work that they do . But society is a complex and delicate machine , the real author and governor of which is divine . Men are often his agents , who do his work , and know it not . He turneth their selfishness to good ; and ends which could not be accomplished by the greatest sagacity , the most enlightened and disinterested public spirit , and the most strenuous exertions of human legislators and governors , are effected directly and incessantly , even through the ignorance , the wilfulness , and the avarice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marring it . The attempts of legislators to turn the industry of society in one direction or another , out of its natural and self-chosen channels , here to encourage it by bounties , and there to load it with penalties , - to increase or diminish the supply of the market , to establish a maximum of price , to keep specie in the country , are almost invariably productive of harm . Laissez faire ; " these things regulate themselves , " in common phrase ; which means , of course , that God regulates them by His general laws , which always , in the long run , work to good . In these modern days , the ruler or governor who is most to be dreaded is , not the tyrant , but the busybody . Let the course of trade and the condition of society alone , is the best advice which can be given to the legislator , the projector , and the reformer . Busy yourselves , if you must be busy , with individual cases of wrong , hardship , or // suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe . The limitations of this let-alone principle are nearly as obvious as the principle itself . The office of the legislator is not , by his own superior wisdom , to chalk out a path for society to move in , but to remove all casual and unnatural impediments from that path which society instinctively chooses for itself . It is to give wider scope and more facile action to the principle we have just been considering , rather than to hedge and narrow it by artificial limits or petty restrictions . Human laws , if wisely framed , are seldom mandatory , or such as require an active obedience ; they are mostly prohibitive , or designed to prevent such action on the part of the few as would impede or limit the healthful action of the many . Vice and crime are stumbling-blocks in the path of the community ; they obstruct the working of the natural laws , the ordinances of Divine providence , by which society is held together , and all well-meaning members of it are made to cooperate , though unconsciously , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , is not to create , but to prevent , interference with the natural order of things . Legislation directed to this end is only a legitimate carrying out of the laissez-faire principle . The enforcement of justice in the ordinary transactions between man and man , which often requires further legislation than is needed for the mere prevention of open vice and crime , is another instance of the legitimate exercise of authority by the government . An individual may not erect a powder manufactory in the midst of a populous village , nor carry on any operations there which would poison the air with noxious exhalations . His neighbors would have a right to call out to him , " let us alone ; you endanger our lives , and prevent us from pursuing our ordinary occupations in safety . " These are internal impediments to the natural action of society , and as such , the government is bound to put them out of the way ; its action for this purpose is widely distinguished from the enactment of sumptuary laws , the establishment of a maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other obvious infringements of the laissez-faire principle . But it is also the duty of the legislature to guard society against external dangers and hinderances . Men are // separated into distinct communities , the action of which upon each other is not so much restrained by law , or by the natural requisitions of justice , as is that of individuals dwelling in the same community . The law of nations is a very imperfect code , and , from the want of any superior tribunal to enforce its enactments , it is very imperfectly observed . War is either a present evil to he averted or alleviated , or it is a possible future event , the occurrence of which is to be guarded against . For either of these ends , the action of individuals within the community may need to he restrained ; for the safety of all , the freedom of all to pursue their lawful occupations without let or hinderance , is not to he imperilled through the avarice or recklessness of a few . Accordingly , not mere restraints upon importation , but an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are among the legitimate measures , a necessity for which is created by national dissension and hostility . Independent communities are not always at war with each other ; hut they are always rivals and competitors in the great market of the world . This feeling of rivalry is whetted by the different circumstances under which they are placed , by the peculiarities in the condition of each , and by the opposition of interests which often grows out of these peculiarities . The legislation of each state is primarily directed , of course , to the protection and promotion of the interests of its own subjects ; and thus it often injuriously affects the interests of other nations . There is , therefore , a good deal of retaliatory legislation on the part of different governments . There is often , on both sides , a keen measure of wits in devising commercial regulations which shall affect , or render nugatory , measures adopted by the rival nation , not exactly with a hostile intent , but with an exclusive view to its own interests , and therefore frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reciprocity treaties , as they are called , are sometimes formed , to obviate the evil effects upon both parties of this keen spirit of competition , when pushed too far . Now , such retaliatory legislation , so far as it operates upon the members of the very community from which it emanates , so far as it limits or restrains the action of all or a portion of them , is not an infringement , but an application , of the laissez-faire principle . It is designed to pro* // cure for them a larger liberty than they would otherwise enjoy ; if it is effectual , if it answers its purpose , it removes an impediment created by a foreign state far more serious and extensive than the obstruction which it imposes . It may , indirectly and incidentally , turn industry from one channel to another , and make some changes in the investments of capital . But this change is effected only by opening one channel , which would otherwise , under the effects of foreign competition , have remained entirely closed , and by rendering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those to which it was formerly limited . If we suppose that the application of native industry and capital is restricted in its range , not by the legislative policy knowingly adopted by a foreign state for this very purpose , but through the superior natural advantages possessed by that state , the same principle still governs the result . By submitting to a small restraint imposed at home , we get rid of a much larger obstacle to our freedom of action , created either by the commercial regulations , finer climate , more fertile soil , more abundant capital , or larger skill and experience of a rival community . The policy of states leads them to seek independence of each other in their economical , almost as much as in their political , relations ; or we might better say , that political independence - that is , the enjoyment of distinct institutions and laws , chosen and established by ourselves - makes it still more desirable and necessary than it was before that we should not be entirely dependent upon foreigners for the supply of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have within our own borders , and under our own control , the means of satisfying all our natural and imperative wants . It is not even desirable , that Massachusetts and Ohio should be rendered so far independent of each other , that each could obtain from its own soil , or by the labor of its own inhabitants , all that it can need ; for these two States are one in most of their political relations . Members of the same great confederacy , living under the same laws , and each exercising its due share of influence in the national legislature , neither has cause to apprehend the hostile or injurious action of the other . The political ties between them are strengthened by their dependence on each other for a supply of many of the necessaries of // civilized existence . But it is desirable that both should be independent , as far as may be , of the great powers of Europe , with whom they can not be sure of continued friendly intercourse for any time beyond the present , and from whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by dissimilarity of customs , institutions , and laws . True independence , in an economical point of view , does not require us to forego all commercial intercourse with other nations ; this would be rather a curse than a blessing . But it does require that each nation should be able to exercise , within its own limits , all the great branches of industry designed to satisfy the wants of man . It must be able to practise all the arts which would be necessary for its own wellbeing , if it were the only nation on the earth . If it be restricted to agriculture alone , or to manufactures alone , a portion of the energies of its people are lost , and some of its natural advantages run to waste . To be thus limited in its sphere of occupation , to be barred out from some of the natural and necessary employments of the human race , through the overpowering competition of forei0ners , is a serious evil , which it is the aim of a protective policy to obviate or redress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , it is surely not open to the charge of being an infringement of the laissez-faire principle , or a restriction of every man 's right to make such use as he pleases of his own labors and capital . Its object is , not to narrow , but to widen , the field for the profitable employment of industry , and to second the working of the beneficent designs of Providence in the constitution of society , by removing all artificial and unnecessary checks to their operation . This view of the effects of a protective policy opens a wide range for comment and illustration . The increase of capital in any country is most rapid , when , from the variety of employments that exist there , most of its inhabitants are engaged in those occupations for which they are peculiarly fitted by nature , and in which , consequently , their labor is most productive . If the labor of one practised and skilful artisan is equal to that of at least three raw hands or rude laborers , then it is very much for the economical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its inhabitants should be skilled artisans , // and as few as possible should be raw laborers . We say " as many as possible ; " because some rude labor is always needed . There must be , in every country , some hewers of wood and drawers of water , - some work that tasks a man 's thews and sinews very severely , while it affords but little employment to his brains , - such work as is often performed by machines and domesticated animals , but which the circumstances of time and place sometimes absolutely require to be performed by men , - usually by men who are capable of nothing else . There is a large proportion of such work required in agriculture , where one skilful and careful farmer can profitably direct the exertions of a dozen or more bands in such operations as ditching , fencing , making hay , and the like . Many , though not so many , laborers of this lowest class are also required in manufactures , where numerous skilled and expert hands require to be waited on by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the former may not be wasted on the coarser operations that are necessary . Thus the bricklayer must have his hod-carrier ; the driver of the steam-engine must have his fireman ; the printing office must have its errand-boys , technically called " devils . " There is work even on board a ship at sea , which can only be performed by boys . Commerce demands a higher average of skill and intelligence from those who are engaged in it than any other of the great branches of industry ; yet even here , in the various operations subsidiary to the transportation and exchange of goods , there is a considerable demand for this lowest kind of exertion . We say a " demand " for it , because the fact that laborers of this class expect only the lowest rate of wages , causes them to be sought for in preference to all others , when the work is such that they can perform it . From various causes , there is an abundance of this kind of labor in the market in almost every country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average capacity , vice , ignorance , and extreme poverty , are among the causes which here keep the supply up to the demand , and in nearly all cases make it go greatly beyond the demand . The only evil to be dreaded is a superfluity of this class of laborers , - a superfluity which sometimes , as at present in Great Britain and Ireland , exists to a frightful extent . Popular education , // as that phrase is commonly understood , meaning the general cultivation of the intellect , though unquestionably a very powerful agent for lessening this evil , is not the only pre- . servative against it . A man wholly uneducated in the common meaning of the word , that is , unable either to write or read , may yet become a very expert workman in the finest and most difficult kinds of manufacture . On the other hand , men may be quite well taught , and still be unable to get any but the rudest sort of work to do , or to obtain employment more than half the time even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very well educated people ; the standard of instruction among them , for all classes , is probably quite as high as it is here in New England . Yet there is as large a surplus of rude labor in Scotland , in proportion to its population , as in England , - probably larger . The loss which a country suffers by having a large portion of its people condemned to this rude labor , when most of them are capable , or may be made capable , of much finer work or more effective industry , is very great ; so great , indeed , that we doubt whether any other single cause of national poverty can equal it . Men are differently constituted by nature , or by those circumstances which in early youth determine the bent of their inclinations and the applicability of their powers to one task rather than another . The labor of a people is effectually used only when the field of employment in the country offers scope for every variety of taste and talent , and when no formidable or insuperable obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task which God and nature appointed him to do . If agriculture alone is pursued , all the mechanical skill of the people is wasted , - all their fitness for commerce , all their enterprise in trade , is wasted . If four millions are obliged to be rude laborers , when three millions of them might be skilled artisans , the labor of one of the latter being supposed to be equal in value to that of at least three of the former , then the value actually created is to the value which might be created , as four is to ten ; in other words , the yearly product of the national industry might be two and a half times as great as it is ; and the yearly unproductive consumption need not be at all increased , since , in either case , there would be four millions of people to be supplied with food , clothing , and shelter . // Of course , and here comes the application of the principle to present circumstances , - the country could afford to pay a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles manufactured at home . They could afford to spend more , for they would have more to spend . For illustration , we will take the two extreme cases of Ireland and Massachusetts . To avoid burdening the memory with statistics , we shall employ the nearest round numbers . The population of Ireland , in 1841 , was about eight millions ; that of Massachusetts , in 1840 , was about three quarters of one million . According to the Irish census of 1841 , which was taken with extraordinary pains and minuteness , the whole number of families in Ireland is one million and a half , of whom one million , or just two thirds of the whole , are engaged in agriculture ; and only three hundred and fifty thousand families , or a little less than one fourth of the whole , are employed in manufactures and trade . lit is obvious that the agricultural population is excessive , for in England , where agriculture is carried to greater perfection than in any other country on the face of the globe , there is but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while in Irelan*l there is one such family to every fourteen acres . Now let us look at Massachusetts ; according to the census of 1840 , there are hut eighty-seven persons here employed in agriculture to every hundred and twenty employed in manufactures , commerce , and the operations subsidiary thereto ; that is , less than five eleveuths in the former , and more than six elevenths in the latter occupation ; while the proportions in Ireland , as we have seen , are two thirds to one fifth . Now contrast the condition of the people in the two countries . The paupers in Massachusetts are about one in fifty of the whole population ; but as nearly half of these are recent English or Irish immigrants , principally Irish , the real proportion is about one in a hundred . In Ireland , numbering the wives and children of the day-laborers on the land , and of those who hire farms not exceeding five acres each , the condition of these small farmers being nearly as bad as that of the day-laborers , we have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighths of the whole population , constituting the class of the agricultural poor . But as it is estimated by the best authorities , that only one half of the Irish // population subsist chiefly or entirely upon potatoes , the number of those who can not fall to a lower stage of destitution than that which they now occupy without absolutely starving , may be safely stated at four millions . Can we , then , attribute this great , this frightful , difference to the different distribution of the bounty of Providence , - to the fact that the Irish are crowded together on land not broad or fertile enough to supply them all with food , while we in Massachusetts are fattening on the spontaneous riches of the earth ? According to the estimate which every enlightened man must form of the effect upon national well-being of what are termed " natural advantages , " this is not very likely to be the case ; but let us look at the facts . Here , where our only natural exports are ice and granite , it is notorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own consumption . We import nearly all our wheat , the chief article of our breadstuffs , and also buy from the other States large droves of cattle . But Ireland raises more food than is necessary for her sustenance , and exports annually vast quantities of provision to England . Her export of cereal grains , chiefly oats , and of other edible products of the soil , steadily increased , from less than eight millions of bushels in 1817 , to twenty eight millions of bushels in 1838 . The exportation of beef , pork , butter , and other animal products has also gone on increasing , though in a lower ratio . It is certain , then , that the penuriousness of nature is not the source of the difficulty ; it is not fertile land which is wanting , but wealth ; and the people do not produce that , because the field of employment is so limited that nothing but rude labor is possible . There is no opening for the exertion of skill and enterprise , and whatever natural qualifications the people may possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole native population of Massachusetts being occupied with tasks that require skill , care , and ingenuity , we depend for a supply of rude labor almost exclusively upon immigrant foreigners . These do all the coarse work in building our railways and canals , and in the several other occupations that require nothing but muscular strength . The rude labor , to which alone they have been accustomed , has so incapacitated them for higher tasks , that it is now an established principle in our large manufactories , we are told , that the // machines can not profitably be worked if more than one third of the oI ) eratives be foreigners . It is not only more economical to pay the higher wages required by native workmen foreigners generally , and the Irish in particular , can not be employed at all , except in that small proportion to the whole number of hands which will make it possible to restrict them to the lower or less difficult tasks . Because our own people are so generally trained to the finer and more productive branches of industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drud6ery by machines . The locomotive steam excavators , that are often employed on the line of a proposed railroad , and the various contrivances that have been patented for cutting and hoisting ice on our ponds , are instances of this sort of labor-saving machinery . The superfluity and consequent cheapness of rude labor in foreign countries render these expedients unnecessary , and the work is profitably done by hand . Consider the rapid growth of capital in this state , which is the result of this most effective application of its industry , and also the immense unproductive consumption of the people , - their ample supply , not only of the necessaries , but of the comforts and luxuries of life ; and contrast these with the poverty and destitution of Ireland . The productive part of the consLimption leads to the increase of the national wealth ; the unproductive part is an index of the general well-being of the community . In Ireland , the people are literally too poor to create a demand for any thing but potatoes ; and the country therefore affords hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but little opening there for the mechanic arts , or for the many small occupations which are created by a due regard for the comforts and conveniences of life . The field of employment for skilled industry is consequently limited almost to a span , and the bulk of the people are driven back upon rude labor in agriculture , - to ditching , cutting turf , and planting potatoes ; the meagre returns from such toil being hardly sufficient to keep them from starvation . The United States , on the other hand , afford a better market for manufactured goods than any other country of equal population on the globe ; because the universal prosperity of the community enables them to consume more . If the relation of cause and effect in this proposition be reversed , // so as to say that the people consume more because they produce more , it will amount to the same thing , and be equally favorable for the purposes of our argument . More wealth is created , more is consumed , and the amount of enjoyment is thereby increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our manufactured goods , as a return for the privilege of manufacturing them at home , and thereby having a field of employment for our skilled labor . But what does this tax amount to ? The average duty levied by the present tariff on our chief articles of import is less than thirty per cent . But as one of the chief objects of a protective duty is to guard against the injurious fluctuation of prices in foreign markets , whereby we might be deluged with imported goods one year , and be very scantily supplied with them the next , the duty is fixed with reference to the lowest price at which they are ever sold abroad , and not with reference to the average price . The effect of a protective duty of thirty per cent. , then , at the utmost , is to raise the average price fifteen per cent . Whenever we have occasion for any of these small articles , we are obliged to spend a dollar for what might be obtained for eighty-five cents , if we would buy of foreigners ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were willing to give up all our home manufactures , all opportunity for earning high wages by the exhibition of skill and ingenuity , and to confine the whole people to the comparatively rude pursuits of agriculture , thereby overstocking the market with food , and reducing the gains of farmers all over the country . Ireland has acted upon this rule , laid down by most political economists , - always to buy in the cheapest market , whatever may be the effect upon domestic enterprise . Grain and other provision can be raised most cheaply in Ireland , owing to the low rate of wages there ; manufactures can be produced to best advantage in England , owing to the abundance of English capital . Ireland , therefore , raises food to buy English manufactures with ; and the present condition of the Irish people is the consequence . They have the advantage , it is true , of the offer of the manufactured goods at prices fifteen per cent . less than what they command in America ; - an advantage which would be more sensibly felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at any price . 37* // The proposition , we think , can be laid down as a general one , that a country , the population of which is chiefly or altogether devoted to agriculture , can not become wealthy , whatever may be the fertility of its soil or the favorableness of its situation . Of course , its inhabitants must buy manufactures with food ; that is , they must exchange the products of rude labor for the products of skilled labor ; that is , again , they must give the labor of three persons for the labor of one person . The general principle of economical science is , to cause the industry of a country to take that direction in which it can be applied to the greatest advantage . Now the fertility of the soil is one advantage , and the capacity of the people for the higher departments of labor , their skill and enterprise , is another . There is no reason for allowing either of these advantages to remain latent or unworked ; and in choosing between them , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fortunate as this country is in the extent of its territory and the richness of its soil , this advantage is as no thing , - nay , it would turn out to our positive detriment , - if , in consideration of it , we should sacrifice the talents and the energies of our people , - if we should doom our whole population to the rude labor of turning up the earth , for the sake of the trifling advantage of purchasing our manufactured goods at a little lower price . One mode in which the encouragement of skilled labor , leading to the interfusion of manufactures and commerce with agriculture , favors the increase of national capital , is , that it concentrates the population in cities and towns . Agriculture is necessarily diffusive in its effects ; the laborers must be distributed over the whole face of the territory which they cultivate . A few large cities spring up at great distances from each other , as an outlet for the commerce created by the exchange of the surplus agricultural products for manufactured goods and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continental Europe , the wheat-plains of Poland and southern Russia , find an outlet at the cities of Dantzick and Odessa ; and we may remark in passing , that the poverty and general low condition of the inhabitants of these districts show the effects of confining a whole population to the rude labor of tilling the ground . It may be that , from their low capacity , and their want of edu // cation and general intelligence , they are incapable of any thing better . If so , the fact only strengthens our argument ; wherever the capacity exists , if it be not developed , if a field of employment be not offered to it , the same results must follow . Manufactures and commerce , on the other hand , requiring a great division of labor , and also that the partici* pators in the work should be near each other , necessarily create a civic population . They will only flourish in cities and towns , and they are the only means of creating cities and towns . This principle , perhaps sufficiently obvious in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of this Union . Our southern and southwestern States are almost exclusively agricultural ; and south of the northern boundary of Virginia and Kentucky , there is but one city , New Orleans , of the first class , numbering over 100,000 inhabitants , and hut two cities of the second class , Charleston and Louisville , each numbering over 25,000 . These cities , of course , have sprung up from the same causes which sustain Dantzick and Odessa ; they afford an outlet for the surplus produce of the vast agricultural district which depends upon them ; manufactures have hardly contributed at all to their growth . If we reckon as civic population those only who dwell in cities having at least 12,000 inhabitants each , Massachusetts alone , with a total population of only three quarters of a million , has a greater civic population than all these States , who number in the aggregate over six millions . Our civic population is nearly one half of our whole number ; theirs is about one twentieth of the whole . The cities in this State have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable for surplus agricultural produce . Wherever there is a considerable fall of water , affording power to move machinery , there a new city springs up , though the soil in the neighborhood should be as barren as the desert of Sahara . But , under the demand for agricultural produce created by that city , the dry sand and the hard rock are converted into gardens of fruit and vegetables ; while the plain of eastern Virginia , once almost unsurpassed for fertility , its powers being now exhausted , is relapsing in part into its primitive wild condition , - absolutely becoming a jungle for wild beasts to dwell in. // Cities and towns are the great agents and tokens of the increase of national opulence , and the progress of civilization . The revival of effective industry , which preceded , and in part caused , the revival of learning in Europe , took place through the agency of the free towns and great trading cities , which sprang up most numerous in Germany and Italy , where they afforded a refuge for the arts and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow given to the feudal institutions of the continent . Commerce and manufactures , to which their walls afforded protection against the chances of war and the rapacity of the warlike nobles , * gradually introduced order and good government , and with them the liberty and security of individuals , among the inhabitants of the country , who had before lived almost in a continual state of war with their neighbors , and of servile dependency upon their superiors . By affording a great and ready market for the rude produce of the country , they gave encouragement to its cultivation and further improvement . " The word civilization itself as if to indicate the origin and home of the thing , is derived from civis , the inhabitant of a city . Sismondi attributes the greater humanizing and civilizing influence of the colonies of the ancients over those of the moderns to the fact that the former founded cities , while the latter spread themselves over much land . In the town , man is in presence of man , not in solitude , abandoned to himself and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mediterranean , be says , might also be called the history of the civilization of the human race . The Egyptians , the Phcenicians , the Greeks , and the Romans successively formed colonies upon the same general plan . Each of these nations became in succession the leaders , the masters , of the civilized world , in refinement , learning , and the arts ; and the colonies which they established were the means of diffusing these blessings among the rude tribes within whose territories the new settlements were formed . When the mother country became too populous , . when the inhabitants of its wall-enclosed cities became straitened for room , detachnients of them were sent out to found new homes for themselves on the coasts of other lands . The colony was to take care of itself , to be independent of the mother country , from the outset . Hence , to protect themselves // against the savage tribes among whom they came to dwell , they were obliged , as the first step , to build a city and encircle it with fortifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not wander so far from its precincts during the daytime but that they could at any hour hear the trumpetcall , which , like the alarm-hell of modern times , might summon them back to the defence of the walls . Hence they cultivated only a narrow territory , lying within sight og or at a short distance from , the city ; and to obtain food from this restricted space for their whole number , they were obliged to exhaust all the arts of cultivation upon it ; it was tilled , and it bloomed , like a garden . For greater security , a portion of it was generally enclosed within the fortifications . This pomcerium , or cultivated space under the walls , was usually divided into small strips , and allotted to the several heads of families among the citizens . A portion of the colonists devoted themselves to tillage , and raised food enough , or nearly enough , for the whole city . A larger portion within the walls applied themselves to the mechanic arts and to cornmerce , exchanging their manufactured goods for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the native inhabitants of the soil , when they could open peaceful intercourse with them , or with the denizens of other shores , perhaps of the mother country , to which they sent their ships . As they needed only a narrow strip of territory , which they often obtained by fair purchase from the aborigines , the hostility of the latter was not excited ; and the mutual benefits of trade being soon felt , the natives came to regard the colonists as their benefactors and best friends . A knowledge of the arts , a taste for the comforts and luxuries of life , learning , and religion , were thus diffused among them ; and in their simplicity and gratitude , they often reverenced the authors of their civilization as superhuman beings , and paid them divine honors . Many , if not most , of the gods and goddesses of ancient mythology were originally only the founders of artbringing , **32;729;TOOLONG colonies , whose beneficent influence , handed down to grateful remembrance by tradition , - by the spoken , not the written word , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , was opulent and refined from the be0inning ; founded by the most enterprising citizens of the mother country , who brought their // wealth , their cultivated tastes , and their industrious and adventurous habits along with them , it became almost at once a rival of the parent city in learning , industry , and the arts . Temples and theatres were built ; the drama flourished ; schools of eloquence were established ; manufactures of costly and elegant fabrics were begun ; and commerce started into life with all the vigor of youth and the large resources of manhood . Brief as this sketch is , the classical reader will recognize in it , we think , the principal features of those colonies which the Phcenicians established along the northern shore of Africa , the Greeks along the coasts of Asia Minor , Sicily , and Magna Gr*ecia or Southern Italy , and the Romans in Gaul and Spain . Carthage , the great commercial and manufactur .. ing city of ancient times , the rival of Rome , may be taken in its history as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture which , many years after its destruction , the Roman poet drew of its supposed origin , of the scene which it presented while the walls of the city were building , we recognize what was the idea , even so late as Virgil 's time , of the mode of founding a colony . " Conveniunt , quibns ant odium crudele tyranni , Aut metus acer erat ; naves , qu* forte paratre , Corripiunt , onerantque auro ; portantur avari Pygmalionis opes pelago : dux fcemina facti .

They are often planted by those who do not intend to reside there permanently , but simply wish to gather again in a new country the wealth which they had dissipated in an old one , and then to return to their former home in order to enjoy it . Thus relieved from all fear of attack froni the aborigines , their first care is to get possession of as much land as possible , this being the most obvious and plentiful source of riches . Individuals or jointstock companies obtain grants of land measured by the league ; and their rapacity provokes the vengeance of the natives , at the same time that it leads to their own isolation and defencelessness . The territory which they acquire is out of all proportion to their wants , their physical strength , or their capital ; they cultivate only here and there a very fertile spot , where the powers of the soil are soon spent by a succession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which they become accustomed through their dependence on the extent and natural richness of their land , is soon lost all remembrance of the agricultural art and science which they brought with them from their old home . Widely separated from each other , amply supplied with food by the bounty of nature , but destitute of the manufactured articles on which depend the comforts and even the decencies of life , out of the reach of the law , and beyond the sphere of education , they rapidly approximate the condition of the savages whom they have just dispossessed . They become " squatters , " " bushmen , " " backwoodsmen , " whose only enjoyments are hunting and intoxication , whose only school-room is the forest , and whose sense of justice is manifested only by the processes of Lynch law . They are doomed to the solitary , violent , brutal existence , which destroys all true civilization , all sympathy with other men , though it increases strength of body , adroitness , courage , and the spirit of adventure . The want of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are , we fear , the most striking traits in the character of the whole population of our Mississippi valley . Their homes even in that fair region are but homes of yesterday ; they had only pitched their camps on the banks of the Ohio and the Wabash , while on their way to the Sacramento and the Columbia . The truant disposition , // which carried them over the Alleghanies , hurries them onward to the Rocky Mountains . We do not go so far as an eminent thinker of our own day , who has expressed in eloquent language his fears , lest these constant migrations should lead our countrymen back to barbarism ; but it is certain , that the " pioneers of civilization , " as they have been fondly called , leave laws , education , and the arts , all the essential elements of civilization , behind them . They may be the means of partially civilizing others , but they are in great danger of brutalizing themselves . Strangely enough , the only colony of modern times , founded on the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is one commenced by a set of half-crazed fanatics in our own far-distant territory of Utah or Deseret . Here , as well as at their former place of ' settlement in Illinois , the Mormons appear to have begun their colony by founding a city , within or near which their whole population is to be collected , so that the mechanic arts and all branches of manufacture may be established at the same time that they make their first attempts in agriculture . The name of their present chief city in Deseret is Nexv Hierusalem , and it is situated on the right bank of the Western Jordan , which empties into their Dead Sea . We borrow the following account of it from an Historical Discourse , delivered sometime during the past year , by Thomas L. Kane . " Its houses are spread , to command as much as possible the farms , which are laid out in wards or cantons , with a common fence to each ward . The farms in wheat already cover a space greater than the District of Columbia , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements for bountiful irrigation , after the manner of the cultivators of the East . The houses are distributed over an area nearly as large as the city of New York . They will soon have completed a large common storehouse and granary , and a great sized public bathhouse . One of the many wonderful thermal springs of the valley , a white sulphur water of the temperature of 1020 Fahrenheit , with a head of the thickness of a man 's body , ' they have already brought into the town for this purpose . " It is remarkable , that one of the latest improvements or discoveries in economical science , Mr. Wakefield 's theory of colonization , consists in the recognition of the fact , that the // ancient mode of planting colonies is far preferable to the modern one . Mr. Wakefield perceived , that a country can not have a productive agriculture unless it has a large town population , who may supply the agriculturists with manufactured articles , while the agriculturists supply them with food . Both parties are thus furnished with a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they most need in exchange for it . He showed that the modern fashion of establishing new settlements , - " setting down a number of families side by side , each on its own piece of land , and all employing themselves in exactly the same manner , - though under favorable circumstances it may assure to those families a rude abundance of mere necessaries , can never he other than unfavorable to great production or rapid growth . " The situation of Oregon hardly five years ago affords a striking illustration of this truth ; the settlers , for want of a market , were obliged to feed their horses with the finest wheat , while their own dwellings were destitute of all the comforts of life except food . Wakefield 's " system consists of arrangements for securing that every colony shall have , from the first , a town population bearing due proportion to its agricultural , and that the cultivators of the soil shall not be so widely scattered as to be deprived by distance of the benefit of that town population , as a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free emigrants scarce in New Holland , the government found it convenient to make liberal gifts of territory ; and accordingly , tracts varying in size from 10,000 to 50,000 acres were granted to various individuals . We borrow from one of the recent numbers of this Review a brief outline of the system : Mr. Wakefield argued thus : - " The welfare of any commu nity depends very much upon such a division of labor as shall fill every trade , profession , and employment with good men , and not overload any of them . If land in any country is so cheap that all are able to become landholders , there will be no labor . ers , no farm.hands , or mechanics ; a semi.barbarism will follow ; no growth in wealth or civilization will take place , and the coun try will be stationary or retrograde . If , therefore , you would have a colony progressive and civilized , you must put your lands so high as to keep a proper proportion of the inhabitants in the labor-market seeking employment , and yet not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate as can use it to advan. // tage with the help of such laborers . If , then , England wishes Australia to grow in riches and goodness , let her sell the lands at a fixed price , never taking less , and in fixed quantities , never selling less ; and let her apply the revenue arising from these sales to the transportation of free , honest laborers to the points where they are needed . In this way , the labor-market of New Holland will be supplied ; the expense of supplying working hands will be paid by the lands of the colony ; no more land will be taken up than can be worked to advantage ; population will be concentrated , wealth will accumulate , and knowledge and virtue advance . " Mr. Wakefield 's theory was good , but a practical difficulty obstructed its application . The government , adopting his views , put their lands up to a high price ; and the emigrants , consequently , instead of purchasing them , or of remaining as laborers on the lands purchased by others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on the best land they could find , without paying any thing . In those vast unsettled regions , they knew very well that they were out of reach of the sheriff . Thus , the very measures adopted for concentrating them , and keeping them within the range of civilization and law , led to their wider dispersion and utter lawlessness . It is curious that the United States system of disposing of the public lands , adopted in all its essential features as far back as 1800 , has worked better than any other plan which has yet been devised . The land is carefully divided by the government ' surveys into townships six miles square , each of these being subdivided into thirty-six sections , of one square mile or 640 acres , each . All is held at a minimum price of $1.25 an acre ; and the sales are made at public auction as rapidly as the progress of the population seems to require . Lands which will not bring $1.25 an acre at the public sale , are still held by the government subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the minimum price . Any person can select a quarter , or even an eighth section ,  --  160 or 80 acres , - wherever he can find one surveyed and not yet sold , and by making a record of his intention to occupy and settle it himself he can secure what is called the " pre*imption right ; " - a right which , partly by the force of law and partly by custom , amounts to a privilege of purchasing that land at the minimum price of $1.25 an acre , whenever the government shall think proper to sell it , which it will do when // the settlement is so far advanced as to render it probable that most of the land in the vicinity will bring that price . Thus the actual settler in truth obtains his land on credit , though all actual sales are for cash . He has credit till the actual sale is ordered ; and some years may intervene , during which he may proceed to clear and cultivate his land , and actually obtain enough from it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overbid him , and that he can not be obliged to pay more than $1.25 an acre for it , however great may be his improvements . Five per cent . are reserved from the proceeds of the sales , to be expended , - three fifths for making roads to the newly settled territory , and two fifths for the support of seminaries of learning therein . We say this system has worked well , the only evil experienced under it being , that speculators will sometimes buy up large tracts not subject to preemption right , at the minimum government price , and hold them for an indefinite period , hoping that , as the population gradually close up and concentrate around them , they may again be brought into market at a much advanced price . While thus held , they remain un occupied , - broad patches of wilderness among the settlements , - obstructing communication between the surrounding lands , and barring out occupation and improvement . But there is a check to this evil in the fact , that such lands are subject to state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the United States ; and the taxes being proportioned to the rise in value of the property , it is not for the interest of the speculators to retain the land a long time . But our brethren of the Western States make a great mistake when they clamor for a reduction of the minimum price at which the public lands are now held , and even demand that they shall be offered , in limited quantities , as a free gift to actual settlers . Their object , of course , in making these demands , is to stimulate the spirit of emigration to the West , so that the population there may more speedily become dense , and the value of the lands already settled may thus be enhanced . The object is a good one ; but if there is any force in the considerations now adduced , the means adopted will tend rather to check than promote its attainment . It is surely not for the interest of sparsely settled States , like Indiana , Illinois , and Michigan , that the great wave of emigra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll over them , to be arrested at last by the farthest limits of Iowa and Minnesota , or perhaps to pass much farther , and , dashing against the side of the Rocky Mountains , to throw its spray over their summits into Oregon and California . But we maintain that any great reduction in the price of the public lands will surely have this effect . The most eligible land in the three States first mentioned has already been taken up by individuals , that portion which yet remains in the hands of government being either less fertile , or more distant from navigable streams and other means of communication , or situated in a less salubrious or convenient region , than the tracts first selected for purchase . They have long been in the market , and have not yet found a buyer . Even now , most of the emigrants pass by them , seeking public lands which are more remote from their former homes , but which , in every other respect , are superior to these long-neglected spots , which a former generation of emigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not affect this relative eligibility of the nearer and more distant lands . Reduce the price to nothing - give away the lands altogether ; and the emigrant will still pass on , pushed forward by the emigrant 's fond illusion , that the farther from home , the nearer to El Dorado . Again , what is most needed for an increase of the prosperity of the West , - of that portion of it , at least , which lies on this side of the Mississippi , - is , not that the lands yet in the possession of government should become private property , but that the population should be concentrated on the tracts already owned by individuals , though in great part still covered by the primeval forest . To enhance the value of these broad regions , the people must be massed together , towns and cities must be established , manufacturing and commercial industry must be added to agricultural , and the hut of the backwoodsman must give place to the well-furnished abode of civilized and enlightened man . It would be an ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to offer lands in their immediate vicinity at a nominal price , or at no price at all . The passion for owning land , which converts nearly all the new settlers in our Western States into farmers , however ill fitted for such occupation by their // previous pursuits , is as injurious to agriculture as to the other great branches of industry . The land is held by those who , from defect of experience or want of capital , are unable to develop its resources , or even to remove the forest from a tithe of their domains . Corn , fuel , and meat are abundant , because prodigal nature affords so many facilities for the production of them , that the skill , enterprise , and knowledge of the cultivator are little needed , and are therefore imperfectly called forth . But man does not live by bread alone ; and when this alone is supplied , almost without labor and without stint , he learns to do without many of the requisites even of a low stage of civilization , and allows the wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a market and the consequent surplus of agricultural produce reduce its price so low , that many families find it needless to raise more than is wanted for their own consumption . The difficulty is felt , though its true cause is not ascertained ; and a general call is made for improving the means of communication , so as to give access to distant markets , when the real want is that of a market near home . This want can be satisfied only by bringing the people together , and turning one half of them from agricultural to manufacturing and mechanic pursuits . The farmer would then find the number of his competitors diminished , the number of buyers of his produce increased , and the articles needed for his domestic comfort cheapened in price ; because most of them would be manufactured in bis immediate neighborhood , and the expense of transportation from a great distance would be subtracted from their cost . As it is , the State too often bankrupts itself in the gigantic enterprise of creating a system of railroads and canals , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. tion on the other side of the Alleghanies , instead of laboring to create such a population within its own territory . Indiana and Illinois , whose united territory measures about ninety thousand square miles , and whose inhabitants , ten years ago , numbered nearly 1,200,000 , had not one town , in 1840 , which contained five thousand inhabitants , and but two towns having over four thousand each . Has it been a benefit to these States , that the cheapness of the public lands has recently borne the tide of emigration onward into Iowa and Minnesota , instead of arresting it by th' left bank of the 38* // Mississippi ? In our opinion , the interests of these States , and of the emigrants themselves , would be most effectually promoted by raising the price of the public lands to a point which would really keep them out of the market for twenty years to come .
