NAPOLEON BONAPARTE. * BY JOHN S. C. ABBOTT EYLAU AND PRIEDLAND . ON the fields of Jena and Auerstadt the Prussian monarchy was destroyed . Frederic William had nothing left but a remote province of his empire . To this he had escaped a fugitive . From the utter wreck of his armies he had gathered around him a few thousand men . It was with extreme regret that Napoleon had found himself compelled to leave the congenial scenes of peaceful life in Paris , to repel the assault of his banded foes . Had he remained in France until Russia , Prussia , and England had combined their multitudinous hosts , he would have been undone . With his accustomed energy he sprung upon Prussia before Alexander had time , with his hundred thousand troops , to traverse the vast plains between St. Petersburg and Berlin By the most extraordinary skill in manmuvring , and in the endurance of fatigue and toil almost superhuman , he threw his whole force into the rear of the Prussians . He thus cut them off from Berlin and from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the effusion of blood he again implored peace . His appeal was unavailing . The roar of battle commenced , and the armies of Prussia were overwhelmed , crushed , annihilated . As soon as the terrific scene was over , Napoleon quietly es -- tablished himself in the palaces of the Prussian monarch . The kingilom was entirely at his mercy He then sent Duroc to find Frederic William , again to propose the sheathing of the sword . The unhappy king was found more than five hundred miles from his capital . He was far away beyond the Vistula , in the wilds of Prussian Poland . He had gathered around him about twenty-five thousand men , the shattered remnants of those hardy battalions , whom Frederic the Great had trained to despise fatigue , dangers , and death . The Russian host , amazed at the sudden catastrophe which had overwhelmed its ally , threw open its arms to receive the fugitive king . Frederic , animated by the presence of the proud legions of Alexander , and conscious that the innumerable hordes of Russia were pledged for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he repelled the advance of Napoleon , resolving with renewed energy again to appeal to the decisions of the sword . Nothing now remained for Napoleon but resolutely to meet the accumulating hostility which still threatened him . Frederic , from the remote provinces of his empire , was endeavoring to resuscitate his army . Alexander , thoroughly aroused , was calling into requisition all the resources of his almost illimitable realms . He hoped to collect a force which would utterly overwhelm the audacious victor . England , with * Entered , according to Act of Congress , in the year 1853 , by Harper and Brothers , in the Clerk 's Office of the District Court of the Southern District of New York . her invincible navy proudly sweeping all seas , was landing at Dantzic and Konigsberg troops , treasure , and munitions of war . The storms of winter had already come . Napoleon was a thousand miles from the frontiers of France . His foes were encamped several hundred miles further north , amidst the gloomy forests and the snow-clail hills of Poland . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to fall upon him , in the spring , with overwhelming numbers . England , exasperated and alarmed by this amazing triumph of Napoleon , now adopted a measure , which has been condemned by the unanimous voice of the civilized world , as a grievous infringement of the ri , *hts of nations . It is an admitted principle , that when two powers are at war , every neutral power has a right to sail from the ports of one to the ports of the other , and to carry any merchandise whatever , excepting arms and military supplies . Either of the contending parties has , however , the right . to blockade any particular port or ports by a naval force , sufficient to preclude an entrance . England , however , having the undisputed command of the seas , adopted what has been called a paper blockade . She forbade all nations to have any commercial intercourse whatever with France or her allies .. She had also established it as a maritime law , that all private property , found afloat , belonging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful passengers captured upon the ocean , were to be made prisoners of war . The French Minister for Foreign Affairs , made a very able report to the Government upon this subject , which was concluded in the following words " The natural right of self-defense permits us to oppose an enemy with the same arms he uses , and to make his own rage and folly recoil upon himself . Since England has ventured to declare all France in a state of blockade , let France , in her turn , declare that the British isles are blockaded . Since England considers every Frenchman an enemy , let all Englishmen , in the countries occupied by the French armies , be made prisoners of war . Since England seizes the private property of peaceable merchants , let the property of all Englishmen be confiscated . Since England desires to impede all commerce , let no ships , from the British isles , be received into the French ports . As soon as England shall admit the authority of the law of nations , universally observed by civilized countries ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war are the same by sea and land ; that the right of conquest can not be extended either to private property or to unarmed and peaceable individuals ; and that the right of blockade ought to be limited to fortified places actually invested -- your Majesty will cause these rigorous , but not unjust measures , to cease ; for justice between nations is nothing but exact reciprocity . " In accordance with these principles , thus avowed to the world , Napoleon issued his famous ordinance , called from the city at which it // was dated , The Berlin Decree. * He declared , in his turn , the British Islands blockaded ; all English property found upon the Continent confiscated , all Englishmen , wherever taken , prisoners ; and excluded all English manufactures from the ports of France and of her allies . This retaliatory measure has been admired by some as a profound stroke of policy . By others it has been denounced as a revolting act of despotism . It certainly was not presenting the other cheek . It was returning blow for blow . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped to be able soon to render the Continent independent of the factories and the workshops of the wealthy islanders . France owes to this decree the introduction of sugar from the beet root . Says Napoleon , " I found myself alone , in my opinion on the Continent . I was compelled , for the moment , to employ force in every quarter . At length they began to comprehend me . Already the tree bears fruit . If I had not given way , I should have changed the face of commerce as well as the path of industry . I had naturalized sugar and indigo . I should have naturalized cotton * The following is a copy of this most celebrated docu Silent : In our Imperial Camp , B un , Nov. 26 , 1806 . Napoleon , Emperor of the French and King of Italy , considering , 1 . That England regards not the law of nations , recognized by all civilized states . 2 . That she holds for an enemy every individual belonging to a hostile power , and makes prisoners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the crews of trading ships , and even captures merchants traveling on account of commercial business . 3 . That she extends to merchantmen , and to the property of individuals , the right of conquest , which is only applicable to what belongs to the hostile state . 4 . That she extends to commercial towns and to ports not fortified , to havens and to the mouths of rivers , the right of blockade , which , according to the practice of civilized nations , only is applicable to fortified places . 5 . That she declares blockaded , places before which she has not even a single ship of war , though no place is blockaded until it is so invested that . it can not be approached without imminent danger . 6 . That she even declares in a state of blockade , places which her whole force united would be unable to blockade , the entire coast of an empire . 7 . That this monstrous abuse of the right of blockade , has no other object than to prevent communications between different countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the ruin of the industry of the Continent . 8 . That such being evidently the object of England , whoever deals in English merchandise , on the Continent , thereby favors her designs , and becomes her accomplice . 9 . That this conduct , on the part of England , which is worthy of the early ages of barbarism , has operated to the advantage of that power and to the injury of others . 10 . That it is a part of natural law to oppose one 's enemies with the arms he employs , and to fight in the way he fights , when lie disavows all those ideas of justice , and all those liberal sentiments , which are the results of social civilization . We have resolved to apply to England the measures which she has sanctioned by her maritime legislation . The enactments of the present decree shall be invariably considered as a fundamental principle of the Empire , until such time as England acknowledge that the law of war is one and the same , by land and by sea : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doscription whatsoever , nor to the persons of individuals I and many other things . " Two days after the publication of the Berlin decree , Napoleon wrote to Junot , " Take especial care that the ladies of your establishment use Swiss tea . It is as good as that of China . Coffee made from chicory is not at all inferior to that of Arabia . Let them make use of these substitutes in their drawingrooms , instead of amusing themselves with talking politics like Madame de Stael . Let them take care also that no part of their dress is composed of English merchandise . If the wives of my chief officers do not set the example whom can I expect to follow it It is a contest of life or death between France and England . I must look for the most cordial suppoet in all those by whom I am surrounded . " In reference to the unrelenting hostility with which Napoleon was assailed nearly every moment of his life , he often remarked , " I can not do what I wish . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live day by day . " It was reported to Napoleon that the troops , comfortably housed in the cities and villages of Prussia , were very reluctant to move to frigid bivouacs upon the icy marshes of the Vistula . not belonging to the profession of arms , and that the law of blockade ought to be limited to fortified places actually invested by competent forces . Accordingly we have decreed and do decree as follows : 1 . The British Islands are declared in a state 01 blockade . 2 . All trade and intercourse with the British islands is prohibited . Consequently letters or packets addressed to England , or to any native of England , or written in the English language , will not be conveyed by post , and will be seized . 3 . Every native of England , whatever his rank or condition , who may be found in the countries occupied by our troops , or by those of our allies , shall be nuade prisoner of war . 4 . Every warehouse , and all merchandise and property of any description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce of English manufactures or colonies , is declared good prize . 5 . Trade in English merchandise is prohibited ; and all merchandise belonging to England , or the produce of her manufactures and colonies is declared good prize . 6 . One-half of the produce of the confiscation of the merchandise and property declared good prize by the preceding articles , will be appropriated to the indemnification of the merchants for losses they have sustained through the capture oftrading vessels by English cruisers . 7 . No vessel , coming directly from England or her colonies , or having been there since the publication of the present decree , will be received in any port . 8 . Any vessel which , by means of a false declaration , shall contravene the above article , shall be seized , and the ship and cargo shall be confiscated , as if they were English property . 9 . Our prize-court of Paris shall pronounce final judgment in all disputes that may arise in our empire , or the countries occupied by the French army , relative to the execution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final judgment in all the said disputes that may arise throughout our kingdom of Italy . 10 . Our minister for foreign affairs will communicate the present decree to the Kings of Spain , Naples , Holland , and Etruria , and to our other allies , whose subjects , like our own , are suffering from the injustice and barbarism of the maritime legislation of England . 11 . Our ministers for foreign affairs , war , marine , 6-nance , andpolice , and ourpostmasters-general , are directed , according as they are severally concerned , to carry the present decree into execution . ( Signed ) NAPOLSiON. , // To one who reported to him the despondency of the army , Napoleon inquired , " Does the spirit of my troops fail them when in sight of the enemy * " " No , Sire , " was the reply . " I was sure of it , " said Napoleon . " My troops are always the same . I must rouse them . " Walking up and down the floor , with rapid strides , he immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day you were on the field of Austerlitz . The Russian battalions fled before you in dismay , or , being surrounded , yielded their arms to the victors . The next day they sued for peace . But we were imposed upon . Scarcely had they escaped , through our generosity , which was probably blamable , from the disasters of the third coalition , than they organized a fourth . But the ally upon whom they chiefly relied is no more . His capital , fortresses , magazines , arsenals , two hundred and eighty standards , seven hundred field pieces , and five fortified cities , are in our possession . The Oder , the Wartha , the deserts of Poland , the storms of winter , have not arrested your steps for a moment . You have braved all , surmounted all . Every foe has fled at your approach . In vain have the Russians endeavored to defend the capital of ancient and renowned Poland . The Eagle of France soars over the Vistula . The brave and unfortunate Pole , on seeing you , dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their memorable expedition . Soldiers ! we will not sheath our swords until a general peace is established , and we have secured the rights of our allies , and restored to our commerce its freedom and its colonies . On the Elbe and the Oder , we have reconquered Pondicherry , and our establishments in India , the Cape of Good Hope , and the Spanish colonies . Who gave the Russians the right to hold the balance of destiny , or to interfere with our just designs ! They and ourselves , are we not still the soldiers of Austerlitz B ' Bourrienne says , " When Napoleon dictated his proclamations , he appeared for the moment inspired , and exhibited , in some sort the excitement of the Italian Improvisatori . In order to follow him it was necessary to write with inconceivable rapidity . Frequently , when reading over to him what he has dictated , I have known him smile , as in triumph , at the effect which he imagined any particular passage would produce . " This address electrified the whole army . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heard . The corps in the rear , by forced marches , pressed forward with alacrity , to reach head-quarters . Those nearer the Emperor , forgot their fatigues and their sufferings , and longed to engage the enemy . The love of the soldiers for their chieftain was so enthusiastic , and their confidence in his wisdom was so unbounded , that though hungry , barefooted , and exhausted , the whole mighty host crowded eagerly along . The storms of approachirig winter howled around them . The wheels of their ponderous artillery sank axle deep in the mire . Still through rain and snow , and miry roads , they followed their indomitable chief , recounting with pride , the fatigues which they had already endured , and eagerly anticipating the heroic deeds they were yet to perform . Before leaving Berlin Napoleon wrote to the Minister of War . " The project which I have now formed is more vast than any which I ever before conceived . From this time I must find myself in a position to cope with all events . " He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy of style marking all his productions , which the annals of eloquence have rarely equaled , never surpassed . " The monarchs of Europe , " said he , " have thus far sported with the generosity of France . When one coalition is conquered , another immediately springs up . No sooner was that of 1805 dissolved than we had to fight that of 1806 . It behooves France to be less generous in future . The rights ofnations , launching a commercial interdict against one quarter of the globe , must be struck with the same interdict in return ; and it must be rendered as rigorous as the nature of things will permit . Since we are doomed to war , it will be better to plunge in wholly , than to go but half way . Thus may we hope to terminate it more completely and more solidly , by a general and durable peace . " The labors of Napoleon were perfectly Herculean , in preparing for this winter campaign . It was four hundred miles from Berlin to Warsaw . This was a dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drifting snows of a northern winter . The Russians and Prussians could present an hundred and twenty thousand men upon the banks of the Vistula . The partition of Poland by Russia , Prussia , and Austria , has been pronounced by the unanimous voice of the world , the most atrocious act which has disgraced modern Europe . As soon as Napoleon entered that part of Poland which had been annexed to Prussia , in this infamous deed of rapacity , the Poles gathered around him with the utmost enthusiasm . The nobles of the dismembered empire , thronged his head-quarters . They hailed him as the saviour of their country . They pledged to him their fortunes and their lives , if he would rescue Poland from their oppressors . The populace rent the skies with enthusiastic shouts , wherever the great conqueror appeared . They were clamorous for arms , that they might fight the battles of freedom , and regain their independence . Napoleon was extremely embarrassed . A deputation from Warsaw waited upon him , entreating him to proclaim the independence of Poland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne . They assured him that the Poles , as one man , would rally , with admiration and gratitude , beneath his banners Napoleon said to them , " France has never recognized the different partitions of Poland . Nevertheless , I can not proclaim your independ // ence unless you are determined to defend your rights with arms in your hands , and by all sorts of sacrifices , even that of life . You are reproached with having , in your constant civil dissensions , lost sight of the true interests of your country . Instructed by misfortune , be now united ; and prove to the world that one spirit animates the whole Polish nation . " After the deputation had withdrawn , Napoleon remarked , " I like the Poles . Their enthusiasm pleases me . I should like to make them an independent people . But that is no very easy matter . The cake has been shared among too many . There is Austria , Russia , and Prussia , who have each had a slice . Besides , when the match is once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My first duty is toward France . I must not sacrifice her interests for Poland . In short , we must refer this matter to the universal sovereign , Time . He will show us by-and-by what we are to do . " The situation of Napoleon was indeed critical . He was hundreds of leagues from the frontiers of France , and enveloped in the snows of winter . Russia , with her countless hordes and unknown resources , was threatening him from the North . Prussia , though conquered , was watching for an opportunity to retrieve her disgrace and ruin . Austria had raised a force of eighty thousand men , and was threatening his rear . This Austrian force was professedly an army of observation . But Napoleon well knew that , upon the slightest reverse , Austria would fall upon him in congenial alliance with Russia and Prussia . England , the undisputed monarch of the wide world of waters , was most efliciently co-operating with these banded foes of France . By proclaiming the independence of Poland , Napoleon would have gained a devoted ally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flag . But , by liberating Poland from its proud and powerful oppressors , he would have exasperated , to the highest degree , Russia , Prussia , and Austria . Thus the probabilities of peace would have been infinitely more remote . Napoleon was contending for peace . He told the Poles frankly , that he could not involve France in any new quarrels . " I am not come hither , " said he , " to beg a throne for my family . I am not in want of thrones to give away . " Through December 's dismal storms ; through a country more dreary than imagination can well conceive , filled with gloomy forests , fathomless morasses , bleak and barren plains , Napoleon led his troops to the banks of the Vistula . Wherever he met his foes he scattered them before him with whirlwind power . Sometimes over a space of seventy-five miles in breadth , Napoleon 's army was fighting its way against THE MARCH TO THE vJsTULA. // qwq games occupied the minds of the soldiers , and confirmed their health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortresses , left in the rear , were continually defiling along all the roads from the Rhine . The soldiers were soon comfortable and happy in their well-provisioned homes . Napoleon , regardless of his own ease , thought of them *alone . He was every where present . His foresight provided for every emergence . His troops witnessed with gratitude his intense devotion to their com fort . They saw him riding from post to post , by day and by night , drenched with rain , spattered with mud , whitened with snow , regardless of rest , of food , of sleep , wading through mire and drifts , groping through darkness , and breasting storms . Napoleon said , My soldiers are my children . " No one could doubt his sincerity who witnessed his vigilance , his toil , his fatigue . Not a soldier in the army questioned his parental love . Hence the Emperor was loved in return as no other mortal was ever loved before . The soldiers , to their surprise , found that the generous foresight of Napoleon had provided them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines were established , that they might be fully supplied with good food and warm clothing . The sick and wounded in particular were nursed with the most tender care . Six thousand beds were prepared at Warsaw , and an equal number at Thorne , at Posen , and at other places on the banks of the V istula and the Oder . Comfortable mattresses of wool were made for the hospitals . Thirty thousand tents , taken from the Prussians , were cut up into bandages and bedding . Over each hospital Napoleon appointed a chief overseer , always supplied with ready money , to procure for the sick whatever luxuries they needed . A chaplain was appointed in each hospital , to minister to the spiritual wants C- . ENcAMPMENT ON THE vISTULA . // qwq // qwq grily into the faces of assailants and assailed , as the bands of battle in exultant victory or in terrific defeat , rushed to and fro over the plain . The tempestuous air was soon so filled with smoke , that the day was as dark as the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed upon each other . Even the flash of the guns could not be seen through the impenetrable gloom . Horsemen plunged to the charge unable to discern the foe . Thus the deadly conflict continued , one hundred and forty thousand men firing into each other 's bosoms , through the morning , and the noon , and the afternoon , and after the sun had gone down in the gloom of a winter 's night , Napoleon galloped up and down the field of blood regardless of danger , ever presenting himself at those points which were most threatened . In the midst of the battle Napoleon was informed that a church , which he deemed a position of essential importance , had been taken by the enemy . He pressed his spurs into his horse and galloped , with the utmost speed , into the midst of his battalions , who were retreating before vastly superior numbers . " What !

We must have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Animated by this voice , an enthusiastic shout of " Vive lEmpereur ! " rose above the thunders of the conflict . The soldiers instantly formed in solid column , and , through a perfect storm of bullets and shells , forced their way upon the enemy . The Emperor espied a few paces from him an old grenadier . His face was blackened with gunpowder . His clothes were red with blood . His left arm had just been torn from his shoulder by a shell , and the crimson drops were falling from the ghastly wound . The man was hurrying to fall into the ranks . " Stay ! stay ! my good fellow , " exclaimed the Emperor , " go to the ambulance , *nd get your wound dressed . " " I will , " replied the soldier* " as soon as we have taken the church . " He then disappeared in the midst of the smoke and the tumult of the battle . The Duke of Vicenza , who witnessed this scene , says the tears gushed into the eyes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The battle had now raced for eighteen hours . The snow was red with blood . The bodies of the wounded and the dead covered the plain . Thousands of the torn and bleeding victims of war , through these long , hours had writhed in agony in the freezing ir , trampled by the rush of frenzied squadrons . Their piercing shrieks rose above the roar of artillery and musketry . Eylau was in flames Other adjacent villages and farm-houses were blazing . The glare of the conflagration added to the horrors of the pitiless storm of the elements and of war . Women and children were perishing in the fields , having fled from their bomb-battered and burning dwellings . Still the battle continued unabated . As the twilight of the stormy day faded into the gloom of night , Napoleon , calm and firm , stood beneath the shelter of the church which he had retaken . The balls were crashing around him . Grief pervaded every face of the imperial staff . With consternation , they implored him to place himself in a position of safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Infusing his own inflexibility into the hearts of all around , he still impelled his bleeding columns upon the foe . More than thirty thousand Russians , struck by the balls and the swords of the French , were stretched upon the frozen field . Ten thousand Frenchmen , the dying and the dead , were also strewed upon the plain . Ten thousand horses had been struck down . Some had been torn in pieces by cannon balls . Others , frightfully mutilated , were uttering piercing screams , and were wildly plunging over the plain , trampling the wounded beneath their iron hoofs . It was now ten o'clock at night . Nearly one half of the Russian army was destroyed . A fresh division of the French now appeared on the field . They had been marching all day , with the utmost haste , guided by the cannon s roar . The Russians could endure the conflict no longer . Proud of having so long and so valiantly withstood the great Napoleon , they retreated , shouting victory ! Napoleon remained master of the blood-bought field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again sought such repose as could he found upon the gory ice , beneath that wintry sky . Napoleon was overwhelmed with grief . Never before had such a scene of misery met even his eye . According to his invariable custom , he traversed the field of battle , to minister , with his own hands , to the wounded and the dying . It was midnight-dark , cold , and stormy . By his example , he animated his attendants to the most intense exertions in behalf of the sufferers . His sympathy and aid were extended to the wounded Russians as well as to those of his own army . One of his generals , witnessing the deep emotion with which he was affec*rI , spoke of the glory which the victory would give him . " To a father , " said Napoleon , " who loses his children , victory has no charms . When the heart speaks , glory itself is an illusion. ** As Napoleon was passing over this field of awful carnage , he came to an ambulance , or hospital-wagon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gore , presented a horrible spectacle to the eye . A soldier was resisting the efforts of the surgeon , who was about to cut off his leg , which had been dreadfully shattered by a cannon-ball . " What is the matter ? " inquired the Emperor , as he rode up to the spot . Seeing , at a glance the state of the case , he continued , " How is this surely you , a brave mustache , are not afraid of a cut " No , your Majesty , I am not afraid of a cut . But this is a sort of cut that a man may die of . And there is poor Catharine and her four little ones . If I should die- " and the man sobbed aloud . // " Well , " replied the Emperor , " and what if you should die Am I not here ! " The wounded soldier fixed his eyes for a moment upon Napoleon , and then , with a trembling voice , exclaimed , " True ! true , your Majesty ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my limb . God bless the Emperor ! " A dragoon , dreadfully torn by a cannon-ball , raised his bead from the bloody snow , as the Emperor drew near , and faintly said , " Turn your eyes this way , please your Majesty . I believe that I have got my death wound . I shall soon be in the other world . But no matter for that-Vive l'Empereur . " Napoleon immediately dismounted from his horse , tenderly took the hand of the wounded man , and enjoined it upon his attendants to convey him immediately to the ambulance , and to commend him to the special care of the surgeon . Large tears rolled down the cheeks of the dying dragoon , as he fixed his eyes upon the loved features of his Emperor . Fervidly he exclaimed . " I only wish that I had a thousand lives to lay down for your Majesty .

Seizing a pen , he hurriedly wrote the following lines . Calling a courier to his side , he dispatched him , at his fleetest speed , to convey the note to Josephine : " EYLAU , 3 o'clock in the morning , Feb. 9. 1807 . " My Love ! - There was a great battle yesterday . Victory remains with me , but I have lost many men . The loss of the enemy , still more considerable , does not console me .

The dawn of the morning exhibited , upon that frozen field , perhaps the most frightful spectacle earth has ever witnessed . Nearly forty thousand men , awfully torn by cannon balls , were prostrate upon the blood-stainud ice and snow . A wail of anguish rose from the extended plain , which froze the heart of the beholder with terror . Dismounted cannon , fragments of projectiles , guns , swords , horses dead or cruelly mangled , rearing , plunging , shrieking in their agony , presented a scene of unparalleled horror . Napoleon 's heart was most deeply moved . His feelings of sympathy burst forth even in one of his bulletins .

" Napoleon remained eight days at Eylau , healing the wounds of his army , and gathering supplies for the protection and comfort of his troops . He was daily hoping that Frederic William and Alexander would demand no more blood ; that they would propose terms of peace . It is a fact admitted by all , that Napoleon , in his wars , thus far , was fighting in self-defense . He was the last to draw the sword and the first to propose peace . In this campaign , before the battle of Jena , Napoleon wrote to Frederic , entreating him to spare the effusion of blood .. This appeal was disregarded . Scarce had the sun gone down over that field of carnage and of woe , ere Napoleon wrote again , pleading for humanity . Again was his plea sternly rejected .

They were silent . He then , magnanimously triumphing over pride of spirit , and almost violating the dictates of self-respect , condescended a gain to plead for the cessation of hostilities .

" I desire to put a period to the misfortunes of your family , and to organize , as speedily as possible , the Prussian monarchy . Its intermediate power is necessary for the tranquillity of Europe . I desire peace with Russia ; and , provided the cabinet of St. Petersburg has no designs upon the Turkish Empire , I see no difficulty in obtaining it . Peace with England is not less essential to all nations .

At all events I entreat your Majesty to believe in my sincere desire to re-establish amicable relations with so friendly a power as Prussia , and that I wish to do the same with Russia and England . " The allies considered this renewed proposal of Napoleon but an indication of his weakness . It encouraged them to redoubled efforts . They resolved to collect still more numerous swarms of Cossacs from the barbarian North , and , with increased vigor , to prosecute the war . Napoleon had also made proposals to Swedeu for peace . His advances were there also repelled . The King of Sweden wrote to the King of Prussia , " I think that a public declaration should be made in favor of the legitimate cause of the Bourbons , by openly espousing their interests , which is plainly that of all established governments . My opinion on this point is fixed and unalterable . " This arrogant assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own form of government , and elect its own sovereign , rendered peace impossible . Even had Napoleon , like Benedict Arnold , turned traitor to his country , and endeavored to reinstate the rejected Bourbons , it would only have plunged France anew into all the horrors of civil war . The proudest and most powerful nation in Europe would not submit to dictation so humiliating . Napoleon truly said , " The Bourbons can not return to the throne of France but over the dead bodies of one hundred thousand Frenchmen . " The Bourbons did finally return , in the rear of the combined armies of despotic Europe . But the Allies crimsoned Europe with blood , and struck down nearly a million of Frenchmen in mutilation and death , ere they accomplished the iniquitous restoration . But where are the Bourbons now ? And who now sits upon the throne of France ? This is a lesson for the nations . Just before the campaign of Jena , Napoleon thus addressed the legislative body in Paris : " Princes , magistrates , soldiers , citizens , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our country . Weakness in the executive is the greatest of all misfortunes to the people . Soldier or First Consul , I have but one thought ; Emperor , I have no other object-the prosperity of France . I do not wish to increase its territory , but I am resolved to maintain its integrity . I have no desire to augment the influence which we possess in Europe , but I will not permit what we enjoy to decline . No state shall be incorporated with our Empire ; but I will not sacrifice my rights , or the ties which unite us to other states . " Napoleon , finding that there was no hope of peace , and having driven his encmies to the banks of the Niemen , prepared to return to his winter quarters upon the Vistula . He thus addressed his army : " Soldiers ! we were beginning to taste the sweets of repose in our winter . quarters , when the enemy attacked the first corps on the Lower Vistula . We flew to meet him . We pursued him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick awl the wounded . More than six thousand were thus transported over two hundred miles , to their warm hospitals on the banks of the Vistula . Austria now wished for an excuse to join the allies . She was , however , bound by the most solemn treaties not again to draw the sword against Prance . Napoleon had cautiously avoided giving her any offense . But she could not forget the disgrace of Uhn and Austerlitz . As an entering wedge to the strife , she proffered her services as mediator . Napoleon was not at all deceived as to her intentions , yet promptly replied : " The Emperor accepts the amicable intervention of Francis II . for the re-establishment of peace , so necessary to all nations . He only fears that the power which , hitherto , seems to ha*re made a system of founding its wealth and greatness upon the divisions of the Continent , will draw from this step new subjects of animosity , and new pretexts f9r d , issensions . However , any way that can encourage the hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by France , which , as all Europe knows , was dragged , in spite of herself into this war . " At the same time Napoleon called for a new levy of 80,000 men . But five months before he had called out the same number . He wished to display such a force that the allies would see that his defeat was impossible , and that they would consent to peace , without further shedding of blood . I-fe wrote to Cambaceres : " It is very important that this measure should he adopted with alacrity . A single objection raised in the Council of State , or in the Senate , would weaken me in Europe , and will bring Austi*ia upon us . Then , it will not be two conscriptions but three or four , which we shall be obliged to decree , perhaps to no purpose , and to be vanquished at last . " A conscription , announced and resolved upon without hesitation , which perhaps I shall not call for , which certainly I shall not send to the active army , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cause Austria to drop her arms . The least REMOvING THE WOUNDED . // hesitation , on the contrary , would induce her to resume them , and to use them against us . No objection , I repeat . but an immediate and punctual execution of the decree which I send you . That is the way to have peace , to have a speedy , a magnificent peace . " Having dispatched this decrec to Paris , Napoleon sent a copy to Talleyrand , requesting him to communicate to the Austrian government , without circumlocution , that the Emperor had divined the drift of the mediation ; that he accepted that mediation , with a perfect knowledge of what it signified ; that to offer peace was well , but that peace should be offered with a white truncheon in the hand ; that the armaments of Austria were a very unsuitable accompaniment to the offer of mediation . " I thus , " said he , " exl ) lain myself with frankness , to prevent calamities , and to save Austria from them . If she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage to show them the depots , the camps of reserve , and the divisions on the march . They shall see that independently ofthe 100,000 French already in Germany , a second army of 100,000 men is preparing to cross the Rhine , to check any hostile movements on the part of the court of Vienna . " These measures , so eminently sagacious , prevented Austria from uniting with the allies , and thus , for the time at least , prevented an accumulation of the horrors of war . The Bourbons of Spain were also watching for an opportunity to fall upon Napoleon . Believing it impossible for the French Emperor to escape from his entanglements in Poland , surrounded hy myriad foes , the Spanish court treacherously summoned the nation to arms . Napoleon was a thousand miles beyond the Rhine . England had roused Spain to attack him in the rear . The proclamation was issued the day before the battIe of Jena . That amazing victory alarmed the perfidious court of Ferdinand . With characteristic meanness , the Spanish government immediately sent word to Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance , in case he should stand in need of them . The Emperor smiled , and affecting to be a dupe , thanked Spain for its zeal , and requested the loan of fifteen thousand troops . The troops could not be refused . Napoleon wrote to have them received in the most friendly and hospitable manner , and to be abundantly supplied with provisions , clothing , and money . They were stationed in the garrisons of France , arid French soldiers , drawn from those garrisons , were called to Poland . These repeated acts of perfidy led to the final dethronement of the Bourbons of Spain . Their overthrow promoted the ruin of Napoleon . Their continuance upon the throne would also have secured that ruin . It was written in the book of divine decrees that Napoleon must rise and fall . Human energy and wisdom could not have averted his final discomfiture . I-lad Napoleon joined hands with the feudal kings , and reigned the sovereign of the nobles , not of the people ; the defender of privilege , not the advocate of equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he would also have lost the heart of France . He fell magnificently ; but his memory is embalmed in the love of the French people . It never will perish . " St. Helena , " says Napoleon , was written in the book of destiny . ' ' The cheerless months of departing winter passed rapidly away , as both parties prepared for the renewal of the strife . Napoleon shared the encampment of his troops . He taught them patience and fortitude , by enduring himself every privation which they were called to experience . His brother Joseph , in a letter , complained of hardships in Naples . Napoleon laughed at his complaints . " The officers of our staff , " he wrote in reply , " have not undressed for these two months , and some not for four months past . I myself have been a fortnight without taking off my boots . We are amidst snow and mud , without wine , without brandy , without bread , eating potatoes and meat , making long marches and countermarches , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under grape , the wounded having to be carried away in sledges , exposed to the air , two hundred miles . " Napoleon established his head-quarters in a wretched barn , at a place called Osterode . " If , instead of remaining in a hole like Osterode , " says Savary , " where every one was under his eye , and where he could set his whole force in motion , the Emperor had established himself in a great town , it would have required three months to do what he effected in less than one . " Here Napoleon not only attended to all the immense interests which were gathered around him , but he also devoted incessant thought to the government of his distant empire . The portfolios of the several ministers were sent to him , from Paris , every week . Upon the day of their reception he invariably attended to their contents , and returned them with minute directions . The most trivial as well as the most important matters were subject to his scrutiny . There had been composed , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were recited in the theatres . He requested other verses to be substituted , in which he was less praised , but which gave utterance to noble thoughts . " The best way to praise mc , " said he , " is to write things which excite heroic sentiments in the nation . " With great care he studied the proceedings of the French Academy . At one of those meetings the memory of Mirabean was violently assailed . Napoleon wrote to Fouchd : " I recommend to you , let there be no reaction in the public opinion . Let Mirabeau be mentioned in terms of praise . There are many things in that meeting of the Academy which do not please me . When shall we grow wiser ? When shall we be animated by that genuine Christian charity , which shall lead us to desire to abase no one ? When shall we refrain from awaking recollections which send sorrow to the hearts of so many persons ? " With intense interest he watched the progress of education . In reference to the institution for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It is there proposed to train up // women , wives , mothers of families . Make believers of them-not reasoners . The weakness of the brain of women , the mobility of their ideas , their destination in the social order , the necessity for inspiring them with a perpetual resignation , and a mild and easy charity-all this renders the influence of religion indispensable for them . I am anxious that they should leave the institution , not fashionable belles , but virtuous women that their attractive qualities may be those of the heart . " He urged that they should study " history , literature , enough of natural philosophy to he able to dispel the popular ignorance around them ; somewhat of medicine , botany , dancingbut not that of the Opera-ciphering , and all sorts of needle-work . Their apartments , " he wrote , " must be furnished by their own hands . They must make their chemises , their stockings , their dresses , their caps , and they must be able , in casc of need , to make clothes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful women . I am certain that I shall thus make them agreeable and attractive . " He was informed that Madame de Stabl had returned to Paris , and that she was striving to excite hostility against his government . He ordered her to be expelled . Some of his friends urged him not to do so . He persisted , saying that if he did not interfere , she would compromise good citizens , whom he would afterward be compelled to treat with severity . Of Madame de Stael Napoleon said at St. Helena : " She was a woman of considerable talent , and of great ambition ; but so extremely intriguing and restless , as to give rise to the observation , that she would throw her friends into . the sea , that , at the moment of drowning , she ' might have an opportunity of saving them . I was obliged to banish her from court . She was ardent in her passions , vehement and extravagant in her expressions . She combined all her resources to make an impression upon the general of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she wrote to him when afar off . She tormented him when present . If she was to be believed , the union of genius with a little insignificant Creole , incapable of appreciating or comprehending him , was a monstrosity . Unfortunately the general 's only answer was an indifference , which women never forgive , arid which , indeed , " Napoleon remarked with a smile , " is hardly to be forgiven . " " Shortly after my return from the conquest of Italy , " he continued , " I was accosted by Madame de Stael at a grand entertainment given by M. Talleyrand . She challenged me , in the middle of a numerous circle , to tell her who was the greatest woman in the world . I looked at her , and coldly replied , She , Madame , who has borne the greatest number of children . ' Madame de Stadl was at first a little disconcerted . She endeavored to recover herself by observing , that it HEAD-QUARTERs AT OSTERODE. // was reported that I was not very fond of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am very fond of my wife . ' I can not call her a wicked woman ; but she was a restless intriguer , pos *essed of considerable talent and influence . " Again he said of Madame de Stael : " Her house had become quite an arsenal against me . People went there to be armed knights . She endeavored to raise enemies against me , and fought against me herself . She was at once Armida and Clorinda . After all , it can not be denied that Madame de Sta*l is a very distinguished woman , endowed with great talents , and possessing a very considerable share of wit . She will go down to posterity . It was more than once intimated to me , in order to soften me in her favor , that she was an adversary to be feared , and might become an useful ally . And certainly if , instead of reviling me as she did , she had spoken in my praise , it might no doubt have proved advantageous to me . Her position and her abilities gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris is well known . Notwithstanding all she has said against me , and all that she will yet say , Lam certainly far from thinking that she has a bad heart . The fact is , that she and I have waged a little war against each other , and tbat is all . " He then added , in reference to the numerous writers who had declaimed against him : " I am destined to be their food . I have but little fear of becoming their victim . They will bite against granite . My history is made up of facts , and words alone can not destroy them . In order to fight against me successfully , somebody should appear in the lists armed with the weight and authority of facts on his side . It would then perhaps be time for me to be moved . But as for all other writers , whatever be their talent , their efforts will be in vain . My fame will survive . When they wish to be admired they will sound my praise . " Vhile at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and untiring energies . To the Minister of the Interior he wrote : " An effective mode of encouraging literature , would be to establish a Journal , of which the criticism is enlightened , actuated by good intentions , and free of that coarse brutality which characterizes the existing newspapers , and which is so contrary to the true interests of the nation . Journals now never criticise with the intention of repressing mediocrity , guiding inexperience , or encouraging rising merit . All their endeavor is to wither , to destroy . Articles should be selected for the journals , where reasoning is mingled with eloquence , where praise for deserved merit is tempered with censure for faults . Merit , however inconsiderable , should be sought for and rewarded . " Again he wrote : " You should occupy yourself with the project of establishing an University for literature-understanding by that word not merely the belies-ic/f res , but history and geography . It should consist of at least thirty professorships , so linked together as to exhibit a living picture of instruction and direction , where every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know at once whom to consult-what books , monuments , or chronicles to examinewhere every one who wishes to travel should know where to receive positive instructions as to the government , literature , and physical productions of the country which he is about to visit . " " It is a lamentable fact , that in this great country a young man , who wishes to study , or is desirous to signalize himself in any department , is obliged for long to grope in the dark , and literally to lose years in fruitless researches , before he discovers the true repositories of the information for which he seeks . I desire such institutions . They have long formed the subject of my meditation , because , in the course of my various labors , I have repeatedly experienced their want . " A vast number of plans for the Temple of the Madelaine were sent to him . He wrote : " After having attentively considered the different plans submitted to my examination , I have not felt the smallest doubt as to which I should adopt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a temple which I desire , not a church . What could you erect as a church which could vie with the Pantheon , Notre Dame , or above all , with St. Peter 's at Rome Every thing in the temple should be in a chaste , severe , and durable style . It should be fitted for solemnities at all times , at all hours . The imperial throne should be a curule chair of marble . There should be seats of marble for the persons invited , an amphitheatre of marble for the performers . No furniture should be admitted but cushions for the seats . All should be of granite , of marble , and of iron . With this view , searches should be made in all the provinces for quarries of marble and granite . They will be useful , not merely for this monument , but for others which I have in view , and which will require thirty , forty , or fifty years for their construction . Not more than $600,000 should be required . The temple of Athens cost not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars have been absorbed , I know not how , in the Pantheon . But I should not object to the expenditure of a million of dollars , for the construction of a temple worthy of the first city in the world . " Thus arose the exquisite structure of the Madelaine . Napoleon reared it in honor of the Grand Army . He however secretly intended it as an expiatory monument to Louis XVI. , Maria Antoinette , and the other victims of the Revolution . He intended thus to axinounce it , and to dedicate it , as soon as the fervor of revolutionary passion had sufficiently abated . Napoleon learned that M. Berthollet , a man whom he particularly esteemed for his scientific attainments , was in some pecuniary embarrassmnent . He immediately wrote him , " I am informed that you are in need of thirty thousand dollars . My treasurer has an order to place that sum at your disposal . I am very glad to find this occasion to be useful to you , and to give you a proof of my esteem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he paid for liberally and read with care , that there was a quarrel in the Opera . There was a disposition to persecute a poor machinist in consequence of the failure of some decorations which he was preparing . Napoleon wrote to the Minister of Police , " I will not have wrangling any where . I will not suffer M- to be the victim of an accident . My custom is to protect the unfortunate . Whether actresses ascend into the clouds or ascend not , I will not allow that to be made a handle for intriguing . " Severe and , as Napoleon thought , mischievous attacks were made , in two of the public journals , upon the philosophers . He wrote , " It is necessary to have discreet men at the head of those papers . Those two journals affect religion even to bigotry . Instead of attacking the excesses of the exclusive system of some philosophers , they attack philosophy and human knowledge . Instead of keeping the productions of the age within bounds , by sound criticism , they discourage those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foresight and energy had soon provided the army with all the comforts which could be enjoyed in a rude encampment . The Russians , on the other hand , were almost starving . They wandered about , in marauding bands , pillaging the villages , and committing the most frightful excesses . Sometimes , driven by hunger , they came even to the French encampments , and begged bread of the French soldiers . By signs they expressed that for several days they had eaten nothing . The soldiers received them as brothers , and fed them bountifully . To promote industry in Paris , Napoleon gave orders for an immense quantity of shoes , boots , harnesses , and gun carriages to be made there . To transport these articles from France to the heart of Poland , through hostile countries , infested by prowling bands of shattered armies , he devised a plan as ingenious and effective as it was simple . He had been impressed , in the quagmires through which his army had advanced , with the little zeal which the drivers of the baggage-wagons evinced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously , with great success , given a military organization to the artillery-drivers . He now resolved to do the same with the baggage-drivers . These men , who had previously been but humble day-laborers , now became a proud corps of the army , with the honorable title of Battalion of the Train . They were dressed in uniform . A new sentiment of honor sprang up in their hearts . It was a two months ' journey from Paris to the Vistula . They protected their equipages , freighted with treasure , and urged them on , with the same zeal with which the artillerymen defended their guns , and the infantry and cavalry their flags . Animated by that enthusiasm , which Napoleon had thus breathed into their hearts , they now appeared insensible to danger or fti4igue . Such were the multitude of objects to which Napoleon directed his attention . The eyes of all Europe were fixed upon him during his encampment amidst the snows of Poland . His enemies were awed by his energy and his achievements . His distant empire was as perfectly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending his days in his cabinet at the Tuileries . Though thus laden with a burden of toil and care , such as never before rested upon a mortal mind , rarely did he allow a day to pass without writing a line to Josephine . Often he sent to her twice a day a brief note of remembrance and of love . The following are a few of his letters : " PosEN , December 2 , 1806 . " It is the anniversary of Austerlitz . I have been to an assembly in the city . It rains . I am well . I love you and desire you . The Polish ladies are all French , but there is only one woman for me . Would you like to know her I might indeed draw you her portrait ; hut I should have to flatter the portrait itself quite too much , before you could recognize yourself in it .

That is an unkind thought . I do not thank you for so unfavorable an opinion . You also tell me that that neglect must be caused by some dream of another . Arid yet you add that you are not jealous . I have long observed that angry people insist that they are not angry ; that those who are frightened say that they have no fear . You are thus convicted of jealousy . I am delighted . As to this matter you are wrong . I think of any thing rather than that . In the deserts of Poland one has little opportunity to dream of beauty . I gave a ball yesterday to the nobility of the province . There were enough fine women , many rich , many badly dressed , although in Parisian fashion . Adieu , my love . I am well . Entirely thine .

All my life I have sacrificed tranquillity , interest , happiness , to my destiny . " The Emperor was exceedingly attached to the little Napoleon , to whom he often refers in his letters . He was the son of Hortense and of his brother Louis . The boy , five years of age , was exceeding beautiful , and developed all those ' energetic and magnanimous traits of character which would win , in the highest degree , die admiration of Napoleon . The Emperor had decided to make this young prince his heir . All thoughts of the divorce were now relinquished . Early in the spring of this year the child was suddenly taken sick of the croup , and died . The sad tidings were conveyed to Napoleon in his rude encampment at Osterode . It was a terrible blow to his hopes and to his affections . He sat down in silence , buried his face in his hands , and , for a long time , seemed lost in painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon was now the most powerful monarch in Europe . But he was without an heir . His death would plunge France into anarchy , as ambitious chieftains , each surrounded by his partisans , would struggle for the throne . Mournfully and anxiously he murmured to himself , again and again , " To whom shall I leave all this . " - Napoleon was ambitious . He wished to send down his name to posterity , as the greatest benefactor France had ever known . To accomplish this he was ready to sacrifice comfort , health , his affections , and that which he deemed least of all , his life . He loved Josephine above all other created beings . He deceived himself by the belief that it would be indeed a noble sacrifice to France , to bind , as an offering upon the altar of his country even their undying love . He knew that the question of the divorce would again and again arise . The struggle , now resumed in his heart , between his love for Josephine and his desire to found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was fearful Strong as was his self-control , his anguish was betrayed by his pallid cheek , his restless eye , his loss of appetite , and of sleep . To Josephine , apprehensive of the result , the bereavement was inexpressibly dreadfuL Overwhelmed with anguish , she wept day and night . This little boy , Charles Napoleon , Prince Royal of 1-Jolland , died at the Hague , 5th of May , 1807 . He was the elder brother of Louis Napoleon , now Emperor of France . Upon receiving the intelligence of his death , Napoleon thus wrote to Josephine . " May , 14 , i807. can appreciate the grief which the death of poor Napoleon has caused you . You cumin understand the anguish which I experience .

I embrace you with my whole heart . " NAPOLEON . " While Napoleon was encamped upon the snows of Poland , waiting for the return of spring , all his energies of body and of mind were incessantly active . Often he made the rounds of his cantonments , riding upon horseback ninety miles a day , through storms and snow , and mire . He was daily in correspondence with his agents for the recruiting of his army , and for the tractsportation of the enormous supplies which they required . He kept a watchful eye upon every thing transpiring in Paris , and guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long winter nights he was ruminating upon the general policy he should adopt in disarming enemies , in rewarding friends , in forming alliances , and in shielding France from further insults . England now made the desperate endeavor to force Turkey into the alliance against France . Failing entirely to accomplish this by diplomacy , she resorted to measures which no one has had the boldness to defend. * An English fleet forced the Dardanelles , scorning the feeble batteries of the Turks . The squadron anchored in front of Constantinople , with its guns pointed at its thronged dwellings . The summons was laconic : " Dismiss the French minister , surrender your fleet to us , and join our alliance against France , or in one half hour we will lay your city in ashes . " But Napoleon had placed in Constantinople an embassador equal to the emergence . General Sebastiani roused all the vigor of the Turkish government . He beguiled the foe into a parley .

In lest than a week 917 pieces of cannon and 200 mortars were frowning upon the batteries . The squadron was now compelled to retreat . With difficulty it forced its way back through the Strait , pelted all the way by the feeble batteries of the Turks . The English lost in this audacious expedition two hundred and fifty men . The Turks , thus influenced , became more cordially allied to France . Napoleon was extremely gratified at the result . Twenty-five thousand of the allies , had entrenched themselves in Dantzic . The conquest of the city was a matter of great moment to Napoleon . The conduct of the siege was entrusted to Marshal Lefebvre . He was a brave officer , but an ignorant man . He was extreme- * " Mr. Wellesley Pole , in the absence of Mr. Arbuthne.t , the British Minister , " says Alison , " who was sick of fever , presented himself before the Divan , in his ridingdress , with a whip in his hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not instantly acceded to , a British fleet would enter the Dardanelles. and lay the capital in ashes . Intimidated by this bold language and by the haughty air of the person who used it . and secretly aware of the weakness of the defenses of the capital , the counselors of Selim recommended a temporary concession to the demands of the allied powers . " ThiM is surely a novel exhibition of diplomatic courtesy , and one which would perhaps have more influence in Turkey than in some other latitudes . // ly impatient of the slow progress of the engineers , and was restless to head his troops and rush to the assault . Napoleon with his headquarters about a hundred miles from Dantzic , kept up a daily correspondence with his marshal upon the progress of the works . It frequently , during the siege , became necessary for Napoleon personally to interpose to settle disputes between Marshal Lefebvre and his officers . The following letter to the impetuous soldier finely develops the prudence and the candor of the Emperor : " You can do nothing but find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the pleasure of the first-coiner . You wanted troops . I sent you them . I am preparing more for you ; and you , like an ingrate , continue to complain without thinking even of thanking me .

Do you imagine that we were as brave in 92 as we are now , after fifteen years of war ? Have some indulgence , then , old soldier as you are , for the young soldiers who are starting in the career , and who have not yet your coolness in danger . The Prince of Baden , whom you have with you , has chosen to leave the pleasures of the court , for the purpose of leading his troops into fire .

It is not worth while , for the sake of a few days , which , besides , I know not how to employ just now , to get some thousand men killed , whose lives it is possible to spare . Show the calmness , the consistency , the steadiness which befit your age . Your glory is in taking Dantzic . Take that place , and you shall be satisfied with me . " On the 26th of May , Dantzic capitulated , after a terrific conflict of fifty-one days . From the abundant stores which the allies had gathered there , Napoleon immediately sent a million of bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snows were melting and the frost yielding to the returning sun of spring , it was hardly possible for either army to resume hostilities . The heavy cannon could not be drawn through the miry roads . Though Napoleon was fifteen hundred miles from his capital , in a hostile country , and with Russia , Prussia , Sweden , and England combined against him , his genius , his foresight , his indefatigable activity , supplied his troops with every comfort . The allied army was , on the contrary , suffering every privation . The starving soldiers , to appease the cravings of want , desolated extended tracts of country with violence and plunder . The allied army now consisted of 140,000 men ; of which 100,000 could be speedily concentrated upon a field of battle . Napoleon , with 400,000 men dispersed along his extended line of march , and stationed in the fortresses of his wide frontier , could , in a few days , concentrate 160,000 men upon any spot between the Niernen and the Vistula . With his accustomed vigilance and forecast , early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army to take the field , and to be daily exercised in preparation for the resumption of hostilities . Early in June , the allies made a sudden rush from their entrenchments , hoping to surround and to overwhelm the division of Marshal Ney . This was the signal for Napoleon 's whole army , extended along a line of one hundred and fifty miles , to advance and to concentrate . They did advance . The opposing hosts every where met . The roar of musketry and of artillery , the rush of squadrons , and the clash of sabres resounded by day and by night . Napoleon had matured all his plans . With iron energy , he drove on to the result . By skillful maneuvering , he every where outnumbered his foes . Over mountains , across rivers , through defiles and forests , he pursued the retiring foe . Field after field was red with blood . Mothers , with their babes , fled from their homes , before the sweep of this awful avalanche of woe . In each village the Russians made a stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flashed around the doomed dwellings . The crash of cannon-balls , the explosion of shells , the storm of bullets speedily did its work . From the smouldering ruins the panting , bleeding Russians fled . In the blazing streets , horsemen and footmen met , band to hand , in the desperate fight . Ten thousand homes were utterly desolated . Women and children were struck by bullets and balls . Fields of grain were trampled in the mire . Still the storm of war swept on and swept on , mercilessly , unrelentingly . Regardless of prayers and tears , and blood and woe , barbarian Russians fled , and ferocious Frenchmen pursued . Every vile man on earth loves the army , and the license of war . No earthly power can restrain the desperadoes who throng the rank and file of contending hosts . From such an inundation of depraved and reckless men , there is no escape . The farm-house , the village , the city is alike exposed . Humanity shudders in contemplating the atrocities which are perpetrated . The carnage of the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war . Napoleon was indefatigable in his efforts . His energy appeared superhuman . He seemed neither to eat , nor sleep , nor rest . He was regardless of rain , of mud , of darkness , of storms . Horse after horse sunk beneath him , as , with his staff , like a whirlwind , he swept along his lines , rousing animating , energizing his mighty hosts , advancing over a space of fifty leagues . // It was on the 5th of June , that the storm of war commenced . Day and night it continued unabated , as the Russians , fighting with desperation , sullenly retreated before their foes . On the 10th , the allies had concentered , upon the field of Heilsberg , on the banks of the River Alle , 90,000 men . Here they planted themselves firmly behind entrenchments , fortified by five hundred pieces of heavy artillery . These were loaded to the muzzle with grape-shot , to mow down the French , advancing over the open plain . In utter recklessness of life , 30,000 Frenchmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muzzles of these guns . Murat and Ney headed the desperate assault . Napoleon was not there to witness a scene of butchery so inexcusable . The Russian batteries opened upon the bare bosoms of these moving masses , and whole heads of columns were swept away . Still on and on the impetuous host rushed , with oaths and shouts , wading through blood , and trampling over piles of the slain . They pour over the entrenchments , sabre the gunners , shout victory . Suddenly , the tramp of iron hoofs is heard . Trumpets sound the charge . A squadron of horse , ten thousand strong , sweeps down upon the French with resistless plunge . The shout of victory sinks away into the wail of death . The French who had scaled the ramparts were overwhelmed , annihilated . Thus the tide of battle ebbed and flowed all day long . Night came . Dense volumes of smoke canopied the field of demoniac war with the sulphurous gloom of the world of woe . By the light of the cannon s flash the surges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black sky . A dismal rain began to fall , as if Nature herself wept over the crimes of the children of earth . Midnight came . The booming of the guns gradually ceased , as the soldiers , utterly exhausted with a conflict of twelve hours , threw themselves amidst the dying and the dead , upon the stormdrenched and gory ground . Late in the night Napoleon came galloping upon the field . He was exceedingly displeased at the senseless butchery to which his impetuous generals had led the men . The dawn of a gloomy morning of wind and rain revealed to both armies an awful spectacle . The two hostile hosts were within half cannon shot of each other . The narrow space between was covered with eighteen thousand of the dead ahd wounded . All the dead , and many of the wounded , had been stripped entirely naked by those wretches , both male and female , who ever , in great numbers , follow in the wake of armies for such plunder . These naked bodies , crimsoned with gore , mutilated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war strippe ( l of all its pageantry . By mutual , instinctive consent , both parties laid aside their guns , and hastened to the relief of the wounded and to the burial of the dead . How strange the scene Russians and Frenchmen were now mingled together upon the same field , in perfect amity , vying with each other in deeds of kindness . Each army then resumed its position to renew the fight . The Russians rallied behind their entrenchments ; the French upon the open 1 ) 1 un . Napoleon , ever anxious to spare the needluss effusion of blood , so skillfully manceuvred. preparing to attack his foes in the rear , that the Russians were soon compelled , without the firing of a gun , to abandon their position , and to continue their retreat . All the night of the 12th of June the Russians were precipitately retiring . Though dreadfully fatigued , they continued their flight the whole of the next day . They were compelled to make another stand upon the plain of Friedland . Their doom was sealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , and had so skillfully drawn together his forces , as to render their escape impossible . Early in the morning of the 14th , the battle of Friedland commenced . The division of Lannes was in the advance . The Russian army fell upon it with the utmost energy , hoping to secure its destruction before the other divisions of the French army could come to its relief . Napoleon was ten miles distant when he heard the first deep booming of the cannon . He sent in every direction for his battalions to hasten to the scene of conflict . At noon Napoleon galloped upon the heights which overlooked the field . As he saw the position of the enemy , hemmed in by the bend of the river , and his own troops marching up on every side , a gleam ofjoy lighted up his features . " This , ' he exclaimed , " is the 14th of June . It is the anniversary of Marengo . It is a lucky day for us . " The French , during the morning , had been contending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withstood the assault of the whole Russian army of 80,000 . As Napoleon appeared upon the heights , General Oudinot , plunging his spurs into his horse , hastened to the Emperor , exclaiming , " Make haste , Sire My grenadiers are utterly exhausted . But give me a reinforcement , and I will drive all the Russians into the river . " The clothes of the intrepid soldier were perforated with balls and his horse was covered with blood . Napoleon glanced proudly at him , and then , with his glass . carefully and silently surveyed the field of battle . One of his officers ventured to suggest that it would be best to defer the battle for a few hours until the rest of the troops had arrived and had obtained a little rest . " No , no ! " Napoleon replied , energetically . " One does not catch an enemy twice in such a scrape . " Calling his lieutenants around him , he explained to them his plan of attack , with that laconic force and precision of language , which no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pointing to the little town of Friedland , and the dense masses of the Russians crowded , before it , he said , emphatically , " Yonder is the goal . March to it Without looking about you . Break into that thick mass , whatever it costs .
