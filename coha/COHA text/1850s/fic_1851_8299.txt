Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : THE CRUSHED MOUSE . from The crushed mouse ( 1851 ) I bear the trouble in my heart , of one Who hath extinguished life ;  --  yet not the sin Of malice preconceived . And I confess Without the form of witnesses ,  --  or weight Of circumstantial evidence , to spread Close covered guilt before the jury-box Where sit the twelve grave burghers , puzzled sore Between the lawyers , and the bench , to give A righteous verdict . Now , the facts are these :  --  The time of rest drew near ,  --  and as becomes A careful housekeeper ,  --  I took my round To see the bolts well drawn , and windows safe That all might sleep secure . A closet door Was left ajar ,  --  and somewhat hastily I closed the latch . But when the morrow came , Lo ! in its crevice caught , a tiny mouse Lay pressed and lifeless . And I did the deed !  --  ' T was all in vain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , transparent ears , and lay Its fairy paw in my warm hand , and wish The heart might beat once more ,  --  for I had forced The life that God had given , out of that cell Which all man 's wisdom ne'er could reconstruct Or vivify . Yes , I ,  --  whose care it was , To keep a conscience pure from stain of blood , Save of some gorged musquito ,  --  or perchance In childhood 's thoughtless hours ,  --  some gadding fly , I , who had bade the spiteful wasp go free , Whose sting still quivered from my swollen arm , Swept down the web , and let the spider go , Spared the piratical black ant , that wrecked My cupboard 's wealth ,  --  I , who had turned aside That even the hateful snake might pass unharmed , And won from shouting boys , the hunted toad , Marked out for torture ,  --  gave all monstrous things , Cockroach , and dragon-fly , and poplar worm , Wide passport ,  --  had at once destroyed the boast Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesh Of subtlest net-work nerves , and in those veins Staunched the warm tide , that on from brain toilleg . Bore innocent joy .  --  And what was thine offense Poor martyred mouse ?  --  Merely to taste of what We well could spare , and rear in secret nook , Thy light-heeled offspring .  --  But ' t is vain to mourn Thy fate , or my misdeed . And so farewell ,  --  Slight atom of a much enduring race , Entrapp 'd by cats and men . The feline claw Bared of its velvet , hath been ever swift To clutch thine ancestors . Scarce might they The silent rapture of the nibbled cheese , In some dark pantry , ere the whiskered foe With glaring eyeballs from his ambush sprang Awful as Jeffreys ,  --  to condemn unheard , To spurn the plea for mercy , sport with pain , And like a demon , glut himself with blood . Say , ye who read the future ,  --  Statesmen wise ! Who ' mid the wonders of our age have seen The imprisoned water moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human thought Darting from zone to zone , and ancient crowns Fall from anointed brows ,  --  is there no time In this world 's history , when the seals shall turn And the oppress 'd and uncomplaints mouse , Find some oasis , where the savory cheese Shall swell like mountains and no can be near ?
