txt EDMUND BURKE . FAME , which is only the just appreciation by the public of the mental and moral value of the individual , is seldom awarded in a just measure to the great conservative intellect by the age in which it is produced . While the Reformer is certain to be applauded if successful , because his object is definite and clear to every one , the Conservative , whose influence is felt rather than seen , must content himself x* ith but a small measure of that public approbation which he feels to be his due . There is something in the idea of progress which seems to every dissatisfied mind so closely related to improvement , that the one term is constantly used for the other ; and so few are contented , that almost every one is an advocate for change . Whoever therefore attempts to moderate this passion of mankind for novelty , especially in politics , is sure at first to be misunderstood : to the enthusiast he seems cold to the best interests of his race ; while those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his defense . However great may be the influence of his teachings upon his age , very few will care to acknowledge it , or to confess that they themselves had gone too far . They yield with reluctance to the voice of prudence , and are not apt to celebrate the hand that restrained them . The silent respect of the prudent part of his contemporaries is all that the conservative receives , to repay him for his unpopularity with the remainder ; and he can only look for a full appreciation of his policy among a posterity that has witnessed its good effects . Of all men he is most dependent upon his own self-approbation , and a conviction of the impartial justice which he will receive in future ages . These reflections will naturally be suggested by the life of Edmund Burke . He was the great conservative intellect of his nation , in an age of unexampled political progress and excitement . To him England owed her preservation from revolution , and the invention of a*policy which led her safely onward in prosperous reform , unaffected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He warned her of the certain results of her conduct towards America , and preserved her from its worst effects . He saved India from further oppression , although he could not revenge her wrongs upon her chief oppressor . He was ever the advocate of prudence , notwithstanding his own natural vehemence of disposition ; and when the patriotic statesmen of England were deceived by the flattering opening of the French Revolution , he alone was able to foretell its conclusion . Yet all the services of Burke to his country never won him its entire regard . He was never understood . The force of his character is felt far more strongly now than then . He could never obtain the chief place in the ministry ; his measures were almost always defeated in the Commons ; the American war which he denounced became popular ; Hastings , whom he impeached , was acquitted ; and he died at the moment when the French Republic had struck terror into the heart of England and of Europe by the glory of its victories and the energy of its policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded to the centre . The mere loss of office indeed would not have moved him , except as it deprived him of the means of carrying out his favorite measures , but the disastrous consequence of his defeat was seen in the declining state of his native land . He believed that he had been born in the last stages of the declining glory of a vast empire ; that all his efforts to preserve it from dismemberment and destruction would be unavailino* that the age of honor // qwq rected . As the compiler of the " Annual Register , " Burke gained much of that general knowledge of the true condition of the world which gave such force and truth to his views of the proper policy of England , nor could he in any way have better prepared himself for his future career than by this apparently useless and humble drudgery . Literature was the school in which Burke studied , hut it is not probable that he would ever have attained any high distinction as a literary man . He could never have been a Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written nothing purely literary that would have given him a lasting fame , or that shows any peculiar excellence above the Cumberlands , Hawkesworths , and other second-rate writers of the day . The Essay , which is the most labored of all his writings , deserves no more than the praise which Hume gave it of being ingenious . It is so cold and correct that it seems hardly to have come from the same intellect that produced the speech on American Taxation , or the invective against Warren Hastings . It has no vigor of fancy nor any warmth of expression . The Sublime and the Beautiful seem to have had little effect upon the mind of their expounder ; he analyzes them with a coldly critical tone that almost convinces us he had never felt them , and never warms either himself or his reader into a proper conception of his subject . His language is as plain as that of Swift , without the slightest trace of that richness and imagery in which all his speeches so abound . He culls out the finest passages from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustain by the change , and often wholly destroys their beauty by injudiciously separating them from the context . He writes of loveliness without enthusiasm , and grandeur in nature as if he were writing metaphysics . The Essay is certainly ingenious , because it shows marks of wide reading , a correct taste , and a habit of thinking justly , but is wanting in all the higher elements of a great writer . Burke 's mind turned instinctively towards politics as the subject which would best exercise and display its highest powers . The " Annual Register , " though apparently a mere literary drudgery , gave him a widei scope for the display of his peculiar excellences . It is a far greater work than the Essay . It is full of large and liberal speculations , of noble reflections , and of warm enthusiasm upon various political topics . Burke 's passion for pure literature was not strong enough to have given him uncommon success in any of its departments . When he attempted a history of England , he produced only a cold and methodical abridgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters upon political , subjects , in which he is rather an orator than author . The Letters on the French Revolution and a Regicide Peace , except for their length , might have been delivered successfully in the House of Commons . The former gained a wide and sudden popularity from the occasion on which it was written , but as a literary production , although his best , could never of itself have gained him a lasting fame . The arts and eloquence of the orator constantly outshine the peculiar traits of the man of letters . It is a grand and noble appeal against the tendencies of the age , addressed to a wider audience than could be collected within the walls of Westminster , and uttered with a fulness of expression and a warmth of imagination that was better fitted to produce a strong instantaneous impression than to satisfy the demands of reflection and taste . The literary studies of Burke , however , were the best preparation to which his mind could have been subjected to adapt it to his future career . Had he been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less influence as orator and statesman . The Essay served to render him familiar with pure models , and the Register gave him an infinite fund of facts . When he came into the House of Commons , he had gone through an amount of mental exercise , such as probably no other member beside could boast . He was without doubt the most learned man in that assembly . Every portion of the globe had become familiar to him . Aft-lea , Asia , and America had long been his peculiar study ; he knew the habits and condition of their people , the nature of their resources , and the prospects which awaited them in the future . He had become familiar with the secrets of European history , and was well acquainted with the politics and literature of the ancients ; and all this knowledge he must have gained during those years of silent preparation while he labored in obscurity as essayist , magazine writer , and compiler . When Burke had at length succeeded in lifting himself fi-om obscurity , he found his // further progress rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading men of the age than he produced an instantaneous impression of his own greatness . One power he possessed , peculiarly well adapted to reveal the force of his intellect . He was unequalled in conversation . All his contemporaries bear witness to this fact , from Johnson , who did not fear his rivalry , to Walpole , who was overpowered by it . No one had a finer flow of language or a more constant novelty of thought . All those noble and wide views of things which had risen in his mind during his season of study he was now enabled to pour forth among a society that was worthy of receiving them and capable of admiring their author . The talent and aristocracy of the empire were gathered in London when Burke made his first appearance in society ; he was surrounded by those who possessed and those who bestowed fame ; he had access to their houses and familiar circles ; every where his superiority was felt and the charms of his conversation allowed . His conversation , however , was not of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a wit nor a buffoon ; he had few anecdotes , and little mirth . He was only a man of large and generous spirit ; taking noble views of all things ; uninfluenced by selfishness ; talking not for vanity or for triumph , but anxious chiefly to convey information to every one he met with , and to render the opinion of his conternporaries as peculiar and as elevated as his own . It is sometimes regretted that his conversation could not have been preserved like that of Johnson , but it is not likely that a Boswell could ever have preserved the eloquence of Burke . Johnson , who spoke axioms and antitheses , was a fit mark for Boswell ; but Burke , whose charm consisted in the warmth of his language and the generosity of his thought , must have passed the understanding of that faithful follower . There was probably little in his conversation that is not in his speeches ; the thoughts which he agitated in private circles he enlarged and impressed upon the public . His information was of that general kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thoughtful men who held the first place in their nation either in politics , letters , or rank . He had sufficient literature to give him a place in the literary club , and no pedantry to render him unacceptable to the members of the House . On all questions of general policy he had read and thought more than his contemporaries ; lie could inform the politidian , and direct the minister ; he was learned in the manners and spirit of royalty and nristocracy , and felt a sympathy with true greatness , whether of rank or genius ; he knew much of art , its history and excellences ; his love of poetry was encouraged by an earnest spirit ; and on these and all other topics he could speak with a force of language that moved his hearers even more than the thoughts themselves . With such conversation , Burke could not fail to be understood by the gifted circles in which he moved . He had the means of forcing a conviction of his own greatness , or at least of the promise which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary and political circles of his day he walked without a rival , even before he had entered the House . The wild Irishman , whom the English wits had laughed at for his nation and his eccentricities , soon rose into the polished man of the world , without losing any thing of that original truth and ardor which had forced him into notice . He was always too honest to comprehend the common art of rising by servility and complaisance , and too impetuous ever to have made use of it . Whatever advance he made by their aid , he certainly had never used his conversational powers to flatter the vanity of the great , to detract by insinuation from the value of his rivals , to advocate bad measures because they were acceptable to his friends , or for any purpose but to aid the prosperity of his country and to extend the gldry of her name . In his conversation , Burke was always sincere . He spoke only what he meant ; and in an age when diplomatic insincerity was fash*nable , and when words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal thoughts , this young Irishman never for an instant fell into the prevailing vice ; none of his enemies ever suspected him of this , and their silence is conclusive . In society he was calm , serious and resolved , and all men who knew him acknowledged the grandeur of his character , the vigor of his imagination , the fulness of his information , the generosity of his impulses , and the purity of his heart . By this time Burke had made several // powerful friends , He was married to the daughter of Doctor whose house he had gone during an illness and general decline of his health , produced by his literary labors . He had gone as under-secretary to Ireland with Hamilton , with whom , however , he had quarrelled* had written several political pamphlets , which had obtained some attention ; was introduced by Johnson to Mr. Fitzherbert , and through him obtained the friendship of the Marquis of Rockingham . By the liberality of the latter he was enabled to obtain a seat in Parliament , and when the Marquis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation of Grenville , Burke began to take a leading share in the political movements of the day . The great question of Colonial Taxation had now begun to agitate the nation . The Grenvilles and the advocates of arbitrary taxation had fallen for a moment before the just remonstrances of the colonies and their friends in Parliament against the Stamp Act and its principles . Burke and his party came into office for the purpose of quieting the internal dissensions of the empire , and of winning back the confidence of the colonies in the mother country . No man in England was better acquainted with the condition of the colonies than Burke . Besides the information which he gained concerning them as a general student , the design which he had at one time entertained of emigrating thither had led him to acquaint himself with many circumstances which he might otherwise have overlooked . How well he understood the character of the people will be seen in the following thoughts : " In the characten of the Americans , " says he , " a love of freedom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as an ardent is always a jealous affection , your colonies become suspicious , restive , and intractable whenever they see the least attempt to wrest from them by force , or to shuffle from them by chicano , what they think the only advantage worth living for . This fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the English colonies , probably , than in any other people of the earth . " The whole speech upon conciliation with America is so true an exposition of the condition and motives of the colonists , that it might have been delivered by Hancock or Adams . The noble spirit of Burke found something congenial to itself in the determination of the sincere and earnest Americans to maintain their liberties at all hazards ; for he knew them to be no mere politicians struggling for a favorite measure , but men driven by a strong necessity to claim their just share in a government which was oppressing them . Burke understood , too , the real strength and importance of the colonies . He had watched their growth with constant interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great prop of the empire when the elder country should have sunk into decline . His bold imagination warmed with the prospect of that greatness which they were certain to attain . He already saw , in fancy , the wilderness sink before civilization ; the great rivers lined with cities that should rival the glories of the old world ; their inland seas teeming with commerce ; and a new race of Englishmen peopling that fertile country with a people remarkable for virtue , honor , and religion . He professes himself amazed at the wonders which the settlers in the new world had already wrought . More than two millions of intelligent and thriving inhabitants had sprung up in the wilderness ; they had proved their skill in agriculture by supplying the mother land with food during a late scarcity , which , but for their aid , would have ripened into famine ; their commerce , in those branches of it which they had been permitted to exercise , had increased to an astonishing extent ; their fisheries surpassed in value those of every other nation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had begun to excel in ship-building , and were unsurpassed in seamanship ; in intellectual pursuits they were far advanced , and had addicted themselves chiefly to the graver studies of law , morals , metaphysics , and theology , which were particularly suited to encourage the spirit of freedom . With such information Burke entered upon his parliamentary and ministerial career ; but the very knowledge which he possessed of the real power of the colonies , together with his natural conservatism , kept him as far from the extreme liberality of Chatham as he was from the arbitrary opinions of Grenville . He could not at first consent to weaken the tie of allegiance which bound America to England , by yielding any portion of the prerogative of Parliament . His policy was to waive the whole question of taxation ; to repeal the Stamp Act ; to treat the colonies // 317 with leniency ; and still to assert the supreme power of Parliament to regulate the affairs of every part of the empire . Such a course , however , proved now unavailing . The repeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they demanded the settlement of the principle upon which they were in future to be governed . This principle Burke was not yet prepared to allow . His conservatism had not yet permitted him to feel its justice ; and it was some years later before he was able to throw aside the centralizing prejudices which led him to overrate the power of Parliament . The ministry with which Burke was connected retired from office ; they were succeeded by the motley administration of Pitt , who was himself displaced in time ; and finally commenced the destructive , but more lastino ' Lord North . * , ministry of The new ministers were ignorant of every thing relating to America , and had resolved to continue so . They never could understand what the colonists fought for , or how they could dare to oppose their king , or to face a British army . The king was , no doubt , the real author of their policy ; for the obstinate dulness of George III . could alone have remained , for seven years , blind to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless , a dull king that planned those measures which gave freedom to America , which plunged her people in bloodshed and confusion , only to make her arise , after seven years of sorrow , the most prosperous of nations . To the deep sensibility and warm ima0 ination of Burke , the wrongs of the colonies , and the danger which hung over the empiie , were sufficient motives to enlist all his powers in opposition to the ministerial policy . Ia March , 1775 , he offered a set of resolutions which show that he had become a convert to the principles of the Americans . His object was conciliation , but his resolutions contain an admission of the legal right of the colonies to tax themselves so long as they possessed no representation in Parliament . These conciliating propositions , although rejected at the time , have since formed the basis of British policy towards its dependencies . And now began that struggle , the most remarkable in the history of politics , between the brilliant minority in the House of Commons who sustained the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to render the contest hopeless . On the one side stood the king , the people , and the nobility ; on the other a band of resolute and gifted men , who strove with all the resources of the intellect to convince their I countrymen of the dangers of the crisis , and the fatal imprudence of their rulers . The House of Commons had never before produced such an array of varied talent as was now displayed by the opposition . The best intellect of the nation arrayed itself on the side of America . By the side of his friend Burke stood Fox , the most ready and vigorous of debaters , whose clear thoughts shone through his pure English without a shade to obscure their brilliancy . The oratory of Fox resembled that of the ancient Greeks ; he was careful never to wenken its force , either by too great warmth of language or of fancy . In writing , he was nice even to effeminacy in the choice of his words ; but when he grew warm in debate , this purity only lent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierce the minds of his audience . This was the peculiar strength of Fox . His ideas are not so remarkable for their newness , as for the novelty of that clearness with which they were enunciated . But besides this , he had a fine impressive countenance , a daring nature , and a perseverance that sustained him against constant defeat . The gentleness and modesty of his manner in private life formed a fitting contrast to his ardor and energy in public ; and he yielded only to Burke in eloquence and general knowledge . The name of Sheridan natur* ily follows that of Fox and Burke among the defenders of the colonies . The play-writer Vand the manager of a theatre , Sheridan took an almost equal place with the great statesmen of his time . He was of . sucha rare union of powers , that it is vain to hope for such another . Nature will hardly again combine in one intellect so much wit and humor , so much eloquence and feeling , such generosity and such prodigality , such elegance of taste and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sorrows of her early friend , poor Sheridan . Besides these leaders , the opposition numbered among its members Conway , Barr6 , Towashend , the younger Pitt , the Earl of Shelburne , Burgoyne , Lord Camden , Lord Thurlow , and Dunning , names that in every // other age would have held the first rank even in the House of Commons . Of these , William Pitt attracted much notice from his youth , the fame of his father , and the early maturity of his powers . He was the great master of words and oratorical periods , and in the heat of debate never lost the fulness or smoothness of his sentences . Without any of the ardor of deep feeling , or the bold impulse of imagination , he was always elevated , earnest , and eloquent . His mind did not produce many great thoughts , but it brought forth moderate ones in such a manner that they seemed great . He had Johnson 's power of elevating trivial ideas by the force of his style , and of always maintaining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a singular influence upon the multitude . His father , the Earl of Chatham , was now in the decline of his powers , but the last exertions of that wonderful genius were dedicated to the cause of freedom . He was never more eloquent than when , at the close of a consistent life , he endeavored to arouse a listless audience in the House of Peers to the dangerous condition of the empire , the horrors of a civil war , and the revolting nature of those measures by which alone that war could be carried on . In fine , this celebrated opposition was worthy of the cause which it sustained , and of that nation which it aided in bringing into existence . For who can doubt but that the patriots of our Revolution , amid the gloom of their situation , must have gained new vigor from the thought that they were watched with approving eyes by the greatest intellects of England , and must have heard with exultation of those efforts of unrivalled eloquence which were daily poured forth in the British Houses of Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest , was assailed in every point that seemed to offer a chance of suc&amp;ess in impressing a sense of their incompetency upon the people . Their mode of carrying on the war was equally reprehensible with the prii*ciple on which it was begun . They had hired foreign troops to attack the English in America ; had formed an alliance with the ed ; they turned churches into riding schools ; destroyed colleges and seats of learning ; and seemed resolved , under the influence of a terrible infatuation , to reduce the country to its original barbarism . All these unnatural measures formed a noble but melancholy theme for the eloquence of Burke and the opposition . In fact , there was never a scene better fitted to call forth the indignation of the British patriot , than that which was beheld in America during the whole administration of Lord North . The great body of the people of England had been led by the ministry to regard the sufferings of their transatlantic brethren with indifference ; but the opposition leaders , who saw the injustice of the contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endeavor to awaken the sensibilities of their fellow-countrymen to a proper feeling of the ill-merited woes of the Americans . They depicted , therefore , those unhappy people , pressed by the savages on the one hand , and by the German invaders and the fleets of England on the other ; their chief cities in the hands of an enemy , their country desolated by treachery ; and they asked why those colonies , which had been one chief source of the prosperity of the parent country , were thus ruthlessly abandoned to the plunderer and the destroyer ? " Who , " cried the venerable Chatham in the House of Peers , referring to the employment of the savages , " who has dared to let loose upon our countrymen in America those horrible bloodhounds of war l " " These circumstances , " wrote Burke of the condition of England in 1777 , " appear to me more like shocking prodigies than natural changes in human affairs . Men of firmer minds may see them without staggering or astonishment . Some may think them matters of congratulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind to the feeling with which the court addresses mean to impress the people . It is not instantly that I can be brought to rejoice , when I hear of the slaughter and captivity of long lists of those names which have been familiar to my cars from infancy , and to rejoice that they have fallen under the sword of strangers , qwq // 819 finding Fort Kniphausen in the heart of the British dominions . " The people of England , however , together with their rulers , listened to the most moving appeals in favor of their suffering fellowcountrymen without betraying the slightest interest in their fate ; and , what was more remarkable , were equally indifferent to their own danb ers and losses from the decline of commerce , the threatening or hostile attitude of the Continental powers , and the constant failure of all the measures used to subdue the independent spirit of the Americans . The war continued popular notwithstanding all the brilliance of eloquence with which it was assailed , and the succession of evils which it continued to inflict upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the characteristic perseverance which has ever marked the Anglo-Saxon race in all their wars and enterprises , and which sometimes , by degenerating into obstinacy , as in the present instance , has ended only in defeat and disaster . A spirit , however , which has led , more than any thing else , to that universal triumph which they and their descendants are daily achieving in all parts of the world over the difficulties of nature and the opposition of rival powers . England clung to her colonies like the ancient sailor to the enemy 's boat : when one hand was lopped ofi he seized the side , with the other ; when that was gone too , he fastened upon it with his teeth , and only gave up his inveterate hostility when the same axe which had cut off his two hands had also severed the head from the body . In like manner , England saw the forebodings of Burke one by one accomplished ; her commerce sank , her debt grew enormous , Europe united against her in an armed neutrality , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflicting upon her a fatal blow , by parting from her for ever those colonies which had been the chief source of her greatness . Peace was restored to the world , but it was a peace upon which the British statesman could not look without shame and regret . The empire was wounded and bleeding in every part , its enemies had triumphed , and men began to lose that confidence in its destiny which the fierce energy of Chatham had every where inspired . Turning in disgust from the spectacle at home , Burke sought another scene of action . His restless mind , ever seeking for an object of greatness commensurate with itself now fixed itself upon the affairs of India . The nature of Burke was formed of two elements , which served to render him a solitary and noble example to his contemporaries . He was a man of unusual strength of imagination , and of remarkable force of feeling . These elements predominated in his character , and influenced all his political career ; but in these he stood among his contemporaries almost alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensuality . The prevailing turn of its intellect was towards skepticism . The idol of the hour was self . Government was administered by placemen , who sought only office ; the church was filled with priests who entered it as a means of subsistence , or a path to the gratification of ambition . The halls of Parliament were trod by men who , whenever they spoke of magnanimity , justice , or freedom , were only urging their personal claims to a support from the treasury of the nation . Among these men Burke rose , of necessity , to a height of independence , from which he could hardly fail to discover the true policy of England . His feeling , his imagination , and his intellect conspired to give him a prophetic power . The policy of England at this moment was of far greater weight than ever before upon the destinies of the world . The British Empire , by means of its continued successes , had extended from the narrow circle of its islands to embrace the most distant and important regions of the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses in America . The French had been driven out of India , and that great peninsula was now exposed to her ambitious designs . Her navy now ruled the seas , and alarmed the unprotected colonies of Spain and holland by its unwelcome visits . Russia had not yet arisen from her steppes to govern Europe , and England , in greatness and in influence , stood unrivalled among nations . This power she chiefly exerted in extending her dominions in India , a country that had long beca the prey of a succession of invaders . Alexander , the Mahometans , the Tartars , the French , and the Portuguese had each in turn indulged their tastes for glory or plunder in the massacre of unoffending ilindoos ; but it was left for England to render that country the scene of prolonged // horror and misery , such as no other land has exhibited . All the crimes of the French revolutionists become light when compared with those of the Anglo-Saxons who invaded India . The millions who died to gratify the ambition of Napoleon are few when contrasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal murder , to build up the iron despotism of Warren Hastings . The English entered India as conquerors , and governed it by that title alone . They had , in fact , no other . Had they been discoverers settling upon an unknown continent , they might have justly pretended to its possession ; or had they gone thither as Cortez to Mexico , impelled by religions ardor rather than by the hope of gain , there would have remained an excuse for their enormities . But they have no such palliation . They have ever openly avowed the injustice of their rule . They were not discoverers , for the country had been known for ages . They were not settlers upon a barbarous coast , for India had been the fount from whence ancient civilization had flowed , and had retained its refinement when Rome and Europe had sunk a second time into barbarism . They were simply a band of blood-thirsty adventurers , who destroyed for ever the happiness and prosperity of an intellectual people to gratify the coarsest of human passions , and who plundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as little cause as the buccaneers had ravaged the Spanish Main . The people of India were not far behind their conquerors in government , education , or morals . Their rulers were often men of refinement and information , who watched tenderly over their people . Though despots , they were sometimes such rulers as the purest republic would have chosen . Their taxs were light ; their policy usually peaceful ; the fields were well cultivated ; and the laborer throughout India was at least secure in the possession of a cottage and a field of rice . Vast public works suited to the wants of the climate had been planned and completed by the native princes . The chief want of the country was water , and all through the low land innumerable tanks had been provided at the cost of the government . Bridges , city walls , and highways were every where carefully maintained . Travellers went from place to place with a security and convenience that England itself , in that day when London teemed with robbers , could hardly boast ; and excellent regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such governments the country prospered and grew populous . Fertile territories stretched out on every side , abounding in all the wealth of the tropics , and maintaining innumerable inhabitants in comfort and repose . The cities were well built , busy , and teeming with people . The great highways were trodden by a neverceasing throng of ' traders , pilgrims , and travellers , who could pass in safety and comfort from mart to mart , or to the most distant seats of devotion , under the shelter of a protecting government . The character of the Hindoos was far more pure than that of the depraved English whom they first encountered . They were intelligent , industrious , and prudent . The intellect even of the poor was often highly trained . They were skilled in the law of trade , were excellent merchants or bankers , and excelled the European in their powers of calculation . They were just in their dealings , and careful not to violate the laws . Their little farms were tilled by the labor of a whole family , every member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the manufacture of cotton and woollen they surpassed the English in the delicacy of their fabrics . Although not a commercial people , yet their inland trade was immense , and great fleets of boats floated annually down their navigable streams , exchanging the produce of one section for the manufactures of another . The nobility of India , too , in manners , intelligence , and refinement , were equal and probably superior to the same rank of English . The Brahmin was educated in all the learning of a literature which , in some respects , excels that of any other nation . Indian literat re has never been thoroughly explored , yet all that we have learned of it proves its wonderful variety and extent . It abounds in metaphysical speculations , of which the novelties of Hegel or Schelling are only modern reproductions . Its poetry is full of tenderness , and a power of imagination that Milton has hardly surpassed . Its history is less known , yet who can assert that a Hume or a Macaulay may not have adorned the annals of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of literary labor ? Upon all these departments of learning the high-born Indian // bestowed an amount of study , such as would have found no parallel among the noble graduates of Oxford or Cambridge . Their inclination led them to intellectual pursuits , and their lives were spent in the acquisition of knowledge . Their manners were stately , refined , and impressive ; their morals not worse than those of any other aristocracy ; their dispositions usually gentle and forbearing . Upon this ancient and gifted people a band of plunderers suddenly intruded themselves . At first they came in the disguise of peaceful traders , who modestly prayed from the native rulers permission to erect a factory and a trading post upon the shores *f that vast peninsula which they were soon to conqucr and lay waste . The En*lish merchants were hardly landed before they became transformed into conquerors . Wonderful success attended their earliest enterprises . Whole kingdoms fell suddenly into their grasp . The Indian armies melted away before the first shock of their invaders . One Englishman was equal to a thousand natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly started up into famous generals , whose exploits rivalled those of Alexander , and whose enormous wealth united with their great deeds to render them as powerful as they were conspicuous . India became the land of promise to Englishmen . All who were young , and poor , and healthy , believed that their fortune was gained should they be able to reach the scene of fabled wealth and glory . When these men succeeded in their hope of standing upon that shore , they found that in lawful trade it offered less attraction than their own . They found that the natives were poor , humble , and contented , and that whatever wealth was to be gained in India must be drawn by force from the grasp of suffering millions . Disappointment hardened their hearts , and avarice impelled them to violence . The native princes were made the instruments of robbing their people . They yielded with many groans to the harsh demands of thejavad er . Gold was gathered in minute portions from every side . The reed cottage of the laborer was searched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and money devoted to sacred or useful purposes was diverted to build palaces in England for the VOL . XVI. - 2O .

Had the British Government conquered India , its sufi*iings might have been less . But the organization of the India Company was singularly well fitted to accomplish its work of tyranny . Its deliberations were secret and selfish . It was little influenced by the fear of public reprobation . The only duty which its directors owed to the stockholders was to provide them with handsome dividends . Within their closed doors in Leadenhall street , the managers decided the fate of princes and nations by the same rules which guided them on the exchange . That policy which paid the best was the true one . This spirit was carried out in all their measures . Their officers and servants were so scantily paid that no honest man would consent to serve them long . Their dependants , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wide system of plunder became perfect .

The judge traded in decisions ; the man of influence sold his good word ; the merchant monopolized the food of provinces ; and every year the ill-paid servants of the Company were becoming richer and more avaricious , and cared less for the groans and tears of the famishing people around them . They remitted vast sums to England , and contributed to swell her luxury and magnificence to a height that attracted the envy and wonder of Europe . But fearful was the condition of that people from whom these streams of wealth had flowed . The tyranny of the Company had spread over India like a malaria . Its beauty and its prosperity had withered at the touch . Famine ravaged whole districts where the avarice of the English had refused to repair the tanks which gave water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with woe ; cities once flourishing were burnt and destroyed ; whole communities were reduced to poverty ; noble mothers stood by the wayside offering their children for sale to any one that could maintaia them ; high-born women , who had 21 // qwq appointed aspirations , broken hopes , long years of altercation and unavailing struggle , had embittered the dislike of Francis , but it was as nothing compared with that of Burke . With him it became a ruling passion . No lover in pursuit of his mistress , no author in pursuit of fame , ever endured severer labors than did Burke in carrying on this trial . His merely mental exertions were wonderful . The age had seen several remarkable examples of literary toil . Johnson had produced a dictionary which rivalled the united labors of the French Academy . Gibbon was en gaged upon a work which occupied a lifetime . Yet the labors of both Johnson and Gibbon were rivalled by the untiring researches of Burke . Without reward , through infinite labor , and with much reproach from the nation at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishing the oppressor of India . This fact distinguishes the trial of Hastings from all others . None other ever shed such a clear light upon the history of an obscure people , or diffused such an amount of knowledge . Under the ample researches of Burke , India arose from her obscurity , and stood revealed to the world . 11cr history , her government , her religion , and the condition of her people , all passed in review before his imagination , were condensed in a series of speeches , and were given to immortality . It is wonderful to trace the minute information he obtained to its source , and to consider how many Parliamentary reports he must have read , how many committees he must have attended , and to see how clearly he was enabled to convey what he had learned to the understanding of his hearers ! We have before said that Burke was never understood by his contemporaries . That large and generous heart , which beat full of benevolence towards its race , was doubted and wounded continually . His prosecution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his country . He was charged with petty personal malice by some , with a vain-glorious and overbearing spirit by others . He was assailed with repeated insults , from the coarse assaults of Peter Pindar to the vote of censure passed by the House of Commons . At length the great trial closed , and hastings stood before his country free from blame . All the immense labor which his accuser had undergone was apparently wasted , for the great criminal was yet unpunished . The splendor of his oratory had vainly dazzled the intellect of the noblest audience that the age could have produced . The verdict which he had demanded against Hastings had , in a measure , fallen upon himself , and men pointed him out as a vindictive partisan , who had vainly attempted to destroy judicially a rival politician and public benefactor . What must have been the emotion of Burke at this final defeat ! How must his great soul have swelled with indignation when he saw the tyrant , worse than Verres , go forth not only uncondemned , but followed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not hope to penetrate , all the workings of that mighty mind : that in that hour of humiliation he turned to the bar of posterity and left there his cause ; that he felt sure the time would come when his country would discover and acknowledge the justice of his measures , and would inflict upon his rival a deserved and universal reprobation ; that he received the consolation of a fixed confidence in his own immortality , and beheld through the long coming years his eloquent declamations against national injustice and distant crimes* become the study and the guide of succeeding generations . The effect of the trial of Warren Hastings* upon the sentiment of civilized man has been great . It threw a shield over helpless India which has protected her from much cruelty and injustice . It checked the rapa. city of the Company 's servants , and the cruelty of its governors . Above all , it has taught the European to be just in his deal ings with the Asiatic ; to respect those ancient races which were civilized at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posterity will avenge the wrongs of the weak . In this famous trial we look upon Burke as the champion and the savior of the inferior races , and the invectives which he poured out against Warren Hastings as the noble eloquence of a friend of mankind . By the side of Las Cases or Wilberforce , but far above them in genius , he stands in the highest rank of the benefactors of his species . We hope to conclude our estimate of the labors and services of Burke in a succeeding article .
