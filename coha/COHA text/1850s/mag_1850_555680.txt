ART . IX . - Observations on the Social and Political State of the European People in 1848 and 1849 ; being the Second Series of the Notes of a Traveller . By SAMUEL LAING , ESQ. , Author of a Journal of a Residence in Norway , a Tour in Sweden , &amp;c . London : Longmans. 1850 . Svo. pp. 534 . MR . LAING 's publications can not be ranked among ordinary books of travels . He does not go abroad for the mere purpose of seeing sights , grumbling at innkeepers and modes of conveyance , and chronicling his personal experiences . He is a philosophical observer , a student of the great causes affecting the economical , social , and political well-being of nations . What he sees abroad he brings into frequent comparison with familiar facts at home ; and while professing to treat only of men and things on the Continent , he has more to say about Great Britain than about any other nation in Europe . The peculiarities and effects of English institutions and customs are brought out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , Belgium , and Germany ; and the effects of each are illustrated by what he has seen , in repeated visits to the Continent , of the actual condition of the mass of the people in the several countries through which he has travelled , or in which he has resided . His observations take a wide range . Modes of husbandry , and systems of military defence , pauperism and its causes , laws regulating the descent of property and the collection of taxes , the diffusion of a taste for art and the means of popular education , the recent revolutions and wars in Europe , the circumstances which led to them , and their probable effect on the future condition of the people , the new theories of political and social economy that have been broached , and the value of the experience which has been gained in the attempt to carry them into practice , are among the subjects that lie has considered , and in the discussion of which he has shown great vigor and independence , if not originality , of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory and observation . It may be thought that a work of such a character would afford more instruction than entertainment . But Mr. Laing // is master of a very lively and pungent style , and is so successful in interweaving a great mass of facts , collected by wide and careful research , with his elaborate disquisitions , that his book is by no means a dull one . Among English political economists he is regarded as the leader of a band , already formidable in point of number and ability , who dissent altogether from many of the dogmas of the established church , as expounded by Ricardo and McCulloch . While the latter rest chiefly upon theory and abstract speculation , he appeals mainly to facts ; and the great number of these which he has gathered during his long visits to various parts of the Continent , together with his keen and shrewd strictures upon the arguments and opinions of the old school , have done much to weaken the confidence with which , until recently , those opinions were stated and received . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and notions , which do not seem very defensible in theory , or at the first blush , and which have therefore been keenly criticized by Continental writers . At the same time , he is a radical in advocating many changes in long established and highly venerated institutions , where his inquiries have led him to distrust their present efficacy or their beneficial results . Some of his disquisitions might be supposed to come from an old fashioned English conservative , while others advocate sweeping innovations so earnestly as to expose him to the charge of ultraism in reform . This seeming inconsistency is the best evidence of honesty and independence of thought ; he unquestionably observes and judges for himself , not perhaps without prejudice , but certainly without munch deference for the authority of others . He modestly observes in his preface , that as he has only undertaken " to furnish suggestions , hints , and materials for others to think over , his own views and observations may be weak , crude , unconnected , or even inconsistent with each other , and yet not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The speculations of such a writer are always suggestive , and often curious and important and we shall therefore endeavor in this article to give as full an abstract of them as our limits will permit , without often pausing to question the soundness even of those which appear to us to be objectionable or unsound . In doing this , we shall freely adopt Mr. Laing 's own language , whenever // it can be borrowed with due regard to perspicuity and conciseness . Since the commencement of the present century , or rather , - to count from an epoch which marks a cause as well as a date , - since the first French Revolution , three new elements have entered into , and become predominant in , the social system of the Continent ; - namely , 1 . the diffusion of landed property through the social body ; 2. functionarism , or the establishment of an immense class of government functionaries , to take the place of an hereditary nobility which has died out , or become effete ; and 3. the Landwehr institution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militia and the standing army into one body , and the virtual con .. version of the whole body of the people into trained soldiers . Though Mr. Laing is a stout opponent of the English system of the aggregation of vast landed estates in the hands of a few , to the total destruction or disappearance of the class of yeomanry or peasant proprietors , and therefore augurs much good from the first of these elements , at least in an economical point of view , he thinks that the union of all three has not as yet promoted the well-being , liberty , peace , and good government of the Continental people . Under their influence , and that of the minute and pedantic system of popular instruction and university education with which they are connected , he affirms that the people of Europe are more enslaved than they were in the Middle Ages under their feudal lords . These elements are unknown in the social system of Great Britain , and to their absence the freedom of thought and action , the peace , good order , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascribed . They have been the cause of most of the late social convulsions in Germany , and must lead to others to which the past are but a feeble prelude . Mr. Laing seems fairly chargeable with inconsistency when he attributes so much evil to the union of these three elements , while he Jraces so much good to the first of them , when working singly , - that is , to the minute division of landed property . In France and Prussia , the great estates held under feudal tenures have been broken up hy the act of the government , the land being distributed among its former tenants or occupiers , who were not only released at once from a state of feudal servitude , hut were raised to consideration and 41 * // competency as landholders . In France , this was the act of frantic republicans and reformers , aiming to democratize society in all its elements ; in Prussia , only twenty years later , the most autocratic of sovereigns faithfully copied their example , and established at home the same arrangement and construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous war to put down abroad . The social structure and economy of the two countries , though framed by such different hands , and with purposes so unlike , are now as similar as if they had been cast in the same mould . . " In both countries we see a people of small peasant-proprietors holding the land , no class - scarcely an individual , among them - above the cares of daily provinion for subsistence and superior to others in the social influence of superior industry , intelligence , extensive social action and usefulness , or in property , which is the exponent of these social influences ; a numerous body of civil functionaries living upon this people for the performance of duties partly useless , partly such as a people imbued with public spirit would discharge for themselves in each locality , and extending over them , in their private affairs and movements , a superintendence and interference which a people with any sense for liberty and personal rights would not tolerate - a military organization of the whole population - a government upheld by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army in military spirit , experience , and the use of arms . is not this the present social condition both of France and Prussia - the very same results from the reforms of democracy in the one country , and of autocracy in the other ? This has not been a happy experiment on the reconstruction of society in either country ; and the reason seems to be that , in both the principle which is the basis of all civilized society , namely , the sacredness of property , and of the social influence belonging to property as the exponent of industry , intelligence , and useful action , has been violated - in France by the blind fury of democracy at the revolution , in Prussia by the blind policy or caprice of despotism . In France the experiment , if not more happy as yet in its social results , has been more consistently carried out . rrhe law , by the Code Napoleon , is at least in accordance with the new state of propertyIn Prussia , although the basis of feudality is cut away by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter decay of the social influence of the class of nobles , the feudal procedure , courts of justice , and principles of law are still maintained , and even forced upon provinces which had enjoyed trial by jury , open courts , and the simpler judicial procedure of the Code Napoleon , // before their annexation to Prussia . In both countries , by the general distribution of the land through the social body , society has been brought back to its two primary elements - a governing power above , and a governed mass below . No intermediate class to support the governing power in its necessary rights , and to support the governed mass in their just requirements of freedom and constitutional government , has yet arisen to ward off , by its social influence , the recourse to physical force by the people , and to military despotism by their rulers . " While the land in these two countries has been but recently , and by the act of government , divided into small estates of working pehsant proprietors , in other parts of Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Norway , and in Switzerland , the Tyrol , and Tuscany , such a division has existed from time immemorial ; law and custom never favored the aggregation of land . Great Britain has been almost the only exception in the west of Europe ; the tendency there has always been to unite small estates into large ones , and , especially of late years , to aggregate even small tenant occupancies into large farms . And the conse consequences have been , according to such economists as Laing , Mill , Scrope , and Thornton , the present hideous inequality in the distribution of wealth in the British isles , the irretrievable helotism of the working classes , the increase of pauperism till the charges for its support threaten to destroy the value of the land altogether , and the ever imminent danger of famine , - a danger which , only three years ago , was converted into a frightful reality . Such writers as Malthus and McCulloch account for these evils on the theory of overpopulation ; the people , they say , have multiplied beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how comes it , then , that Belgium , where there are 321 inhabitants to the square mile , suffers very little from these causes , while England , where the land is superior in point of natural fertility , and the people number less than 300 to the square mile , is particularly expbsed to them ? The disproportion becomes still more manifest when we consider , that only one fifth of the English people are directly engaged in agriculture , while three fourths of the Belgians derive all their support from this source . But land produces more rent , if cultivated in large farms . // Unquestionably it does , if by rent we understand only that portion of the produce which accrues to the exclusive benefit of the landlord . In many cases , his estate will give him a larger income if devoted to pasturage than to tillage ; for in the former case , only a few herdsmen are required to perform all the labor that is needed on a thousand acres . But it does not produce so much food ; it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his land into a sheep pasture acts on the same principle which induced the Dutch , a century ago , to burn a considerable portion of the pepper which they imported from Sumatra , where they had a monopoly of the trade , in order to enhance the price of the remainder . The object of all cultivation is to increase the quantity of the marketable produce of the land ; the object of the landowner , who does not till the ground himself , but farms it out to others , is to reserve as large a portion as possible of this produce for himself . If fifty laborers upon his estate will enable him to send a thousand bushels of grain to market , the price of eight hundred bushels being needed to pay the wages of these laborers , - while ten laborers require only one hundred and sixty bushels for their wages , and their work produces five hundred hushels for sale , - his rent in the former case , it is obvious , will be only two hundred bushels , while in the latter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is for his interest , therefore , to employ the smaller number of laborers , and thereby to produce the smaller quantity of food , especially since the inadequate supply in the market will then enhance the price of the grain . lit may he , that the five hundred bushels will seilfor as much as could , under the other supposition , he obtained for the thousand bushels . But is it equally for the interest of the public , in a country teeming with population , that he should adopt this course ? Only half a century ago , the most profitable use which the farmers of Ohio and Western Pennsylvaflia could make of their grain was to distil it into whiskey ; for in this highly concentrated form alone would it bear the expense of transportation to a market at the eastward . The interests of the individual here prompted him to deprive the grain of its nutritious properties and convert it into a poison ; the interests of time public would have counselled quite a different course . // That a larger gross product of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into small properties than when it is held in large farms , is a fact which no English traveller on the Continent can think of disputing . " In Flanders , " says Mr. Laing , " the face of the country resembles a carpet , little patches of ground being covered with a great variety of crops of different shades and hues , not separated from each other by enclosures , and all blooming like a garden from the care and skill of the cultivator . Not a bit of ground is allowed to run to waste , every nook and corner , every patch in the angle of a fence , being searched by the spade and hoe , and *veeded by hand . " The wonders of English farming are accomplished on a large scale , with high finish indeed , but with much necessary neglect or slighting of the nooks and corners , which can not be tilled by machinery , but will yield returns only to manual labor . Spade-husbandry , of course , is less profitable , and even less productive , than husbandry by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . But when the ownership of land is an attribute only of the nobility and gentry , while a large portion of the people are constantly in want of employment and food , precisely the reverse holds ; cultivation by the spade is then true economy , and husbandry on a large scale is criminal wastefulness of the bounties of Providence . The utmost amount which land is capable of producing can be estimated only on the small patches of ground , in the neighborhood of a large city , which are cultivated by the market gardeners . Here , every clod is broken , every shovelful of earth is raked and sifted , every pebble and weed is carefully removed by hand , and an abundance of hoarded manure being applied , while every accident of rain or sunshine is economized or averted , the crops are immense out of all proportion with the little space that is cultivated . A whole country divided into small properties is a constant succession of such gardens . In England , the large farmer , who often pays a rent of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculator on a grand scale ; he wields a heavy capital with great skill and science , economizes human labor to the utmost by the introduction of costly and powerful machines , and either makes or loses a fortune in one season . Too great an attention to details , too careful an economy of corners and patches of land , would be destructive of his interests ; // his operations are of a sweeping character , his returns are counted in the gross . He often makes more money by raising a smaller amount to the acre . To turn all his land into a kitchen garden would require a whole army of laborers , whose wages would eat up all his profits ; the laborers would be fed , but he would sacrifice his capital . The method which he pursues has the opposite effect ; he makes money , while the laborers starve . " In Scotland , it is estimated that more than one half of the land susceptible of cultivation is not cultivated ; that of the 11* millions of acres capable of cultivation , 5* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cultivated . And why is this larger half not cultivated in a country of which the agricultural system and agricultural improvements are held up as a model ? Simply because it would not repay the expense of inclosing , draining , building houses and offices , and bringing it into the state of rentpaying amble land . It is not of a quality to afford a rent to a landlord , profit to a tenant for his capital and skill , and to replace the outlay of money in its improvement , within any period of a lease . Yet such land would subsist a population of small pro . prietors working and living upon it . Having neither rent to a landlord , nor profit over and above their subsistence , to produce , they would earn a subsistence , poor and scanty no doubt at first , but gradually improving and increasing with the improvement of the soil by their labor on it . This uncultivated land could employ and subsist as great a body of agricultural laborers , if they were the owners of the land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other half that is at present cultivated , and paying rent . In England , as in Scotland , as much land in every rural parish is lying useless , in wastes , commons , neglected patches , lanes not required , corners of fields , sides of roads , and such uncultivated spots , as would keep and endow all the poor of the parish . Of the cultivated land of England , how much is producing little or no employment or subsistence for the popu. lation , but is merely under crops of luxury , such as bay and pasture for the pleasure-horses of the upper classes ? how much is laid out in parks , lawns , and old grass fields pastured over by catt1e , horses , and sheep , roaming at large , and returning no manure of any value to the farmer for their food ? and how much arabic land , for the want of that very manure , is in naked fallow , bearing no crop , but resting , as it is called , that is , exhausted , and waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to under-production , consequent on these artificial or conventional circumstances in the use and distribution of land . // There is no natural disproportion between the increase of population , and of food for that population , independent of the fortuitous and artificial circumstances increasing the one and diminishing the other . They would always be in equilibrium with each other , but for such circumstances . " A population of small peasant proprietors are often engaged , to a considerable extent , in domestic or house manufactures . The leisure which remains to the husbandman at certain periods of the year , the necessary intervals of an employment which depends upon the accidents of weather , are thus economized and turned to profit . This is the case especially with the Swiss . Watchmaking , weaving , and other mechanical operations , with them fill up much time that would otherwise be wasted . Lacking the benefits of a division of such labor , their work , of course , costs them more than the price which is set upon it by the regular manufacturer on a large scale ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could not in any other way be turned to account , the values produced are in fact a clear gain ; they cost nothing which the farmer could otherwise dispose of . Thus the wives and daughters of our New England farmers formerly knit woollen stockings for sale , at a rate which , if * they depended solely upon such products for a livelihood , certainly would not keep them from starvation . But their main resource being of a wholly different character , the fruits of these subsidiary tasks were a stock of little comforts and luxuries , which could not be furnished out of the main revenue of the family . The maiden 's dower , her stock of articles to begin housekeeping with , was often supplied in this manner . Now , the daughters of our farmers go into the large factories for a year or two , and save from their wages a much larger sum than sufficed to portion off their grandmothers . But it may be doubted whether their moral and intellectual well-being are promoted by the change . " The exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a variety of operations , - the invention , ingenuity , and judgment called forth , the resources to be found for want of skill , tools , and coöperative aid , make the production of an article , by single-handed or family work , much more intellectual and improving , although the article produced be very much inferior and more costly than if it had been produced by factory // work . The product is better , but not the producer . " The agricultural laborers in Ireland , and even , to a considerable extent , in England , are mere hedgers and ditchers ; lacking the variety of employment which is given to the peasant proprietors on the Continent , through their simple household manufactures , they become brutalized by the incessant repetition of one low task , and by enforced idleness in the intervals of their regular occupation . The same remark is even more applicable to the manufacturing population , among whom the division of labor is carried out to a most pernicious extent . For this reason , among others , Mr. Laing affirms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer suitable founders of new settlements in foreign lands . " This nation of ours is past that stage in its social condition in which a people can throw off agricultural colonies from the main body . Two hundred years ago , when the peopling of the old American colonies was going on , the great mass of the population of the mother country was essentially agricultural ; but every working man could turn his hand to various kinds of work , as well as to the plough . He was partly a smith , carpenter , wheelwright , stone.mason , shoemaker . The useful arts were not , as now , entirely in the hands of artisans bred to no other labor but their own trade or art ; very expert , skilful , and cheap producers in that ; but not used to , or acquainted with , any other kind of work . This inferior stage of civilization in which men were not co.operative to the same extent as now , but every man did a little at every thing , and made a shift with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society very favorable to emigration enterprise , and to colonization . It continues still in the United States , and is the main reason why their settlers in the back woods are more handy , shift better for themselves , and thrive better than the man from this country , who has been all his life engaged in one branch of industry , and in that has had the co.operation of many trades , preparing his tools and the materials for his work . Another advantage for emigration in that state of sopiety which we in Britain have entirely outgrown , was , that the female half of the population contributed almost as much ns the male half to the subsistence of a family , especially an emigrant family ; and produced , by work in the household , what made or saved money . I should like to know if one emigrant father of an English family in ten thousand could say , in our days , to his wife and daughters - // Here , my dears , I have brought you the fleeces of ' our score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will take them and sort the wool , and card it , and spin it , and weave it , and waulk it , and dye it , and shape it , and sew it , and do all other needful operations with it , to make a coat for me , and petticoats for yourselves against winter ; for it is not worth travelling a score miles to sell a few stones weight of wool to the merchant , and the price would go but a small way in buying our woollen clothing . And here , my dears , is our rig of flax , just fit for pulling ; you will turn to and pull it , bind it , steep it , rot it , skutch it , hackle it , spin it , weave it , bleach it ; and if we have more linen than we need ourselves , we can sell a web or two of it to the town's-people . ' The mistress would probably reply - John , I never did any such work with wool or flax , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother , indeed , had all such work done in her family ; and , besides , could brew , and bake , and make cheese , soap , candles , and a thousand things that I and my daughters never did , or saw done ; because , long before my day , such house work went out of fashion in every family , high or low . Home-made cloth was too coarse for the poorest to wear , and cottons , and factory-made cloths of all kinds , were finer , better , and cheaper . We can wash , sew , cook , make the beds , and sweep the house ; but we never learnt to spin , or weave , or knit , or bleach , or dye , or do any work that brings in money ; because the factory did all such work in England far better and cheaper than single-handed women . ' " Mr. Laing shows very conclusively the insufficiency of emigration as a remedy for those fi'i*htful evils in the social condition of Great Britain , which are commonly attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ j ) robably amounts , by this time , to about 28,000,000 ; and the yearly rate of increase being nearly one and a half per cent. , 420,000 persons are added to it every year . The largest amount of emigration was in the famine year of 1848 , when about 270,000 persons are estimated to have left the kingdom of their own accord , and without aid from the government . Not more than 50,000 persons a year , in addition to these private emigrants , could be shipped off at the public expense . Both public and private emigration , then , would not suffice even to keep the population stationary in numbers ; the evils which now exist would not only continue of the same magnitude , but would become more formidable with the lapse of every year , in spite of this palliative , the expense // of which is also shown to be enormous . Private emigration , moreover , only tends to enhance the wretchedness of those who are left at home , and to increase the difficulty of taking care of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who emigrate at their own expense necessarily have some small capital of their own ; at least , they have health , strength , and the capability of work in them ; those who remain are the paupers , the infirm , the sickly , the infants , the aged , the mass of operatives whose previous training has unfitted them for any thing , except for some task equivalent to making the eighteenth part of a pin . " Keep down the redundancy of population by encouraging emigration ii ' exclaims Mr. Laing ; " we might as well try to bale out the North Sea into the Atlantic , by sending all the milkmaids in England to dip their pails into the ocean at Flamborough Head and empty them into Plymouth Sound . " Having enunierated the undeniable advantages and benefits of the small-estate occupancy of land , Mr. Laing proceeds , very fairly , to state the other side of the account , and to mention the evils to which it appears to give birth . It is a stationary social state ; the properties are generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort and decency , according to the idea or standard of living which has been established among such a population for an indefinite period . One generation can not afford to acquire or gratify any higher tastes or wants than those of their fathers . Where landed property has been thus subdivided for ages , - as in Norway , Belgium , and Switzerland , - the man of the nineteenth century is the man of the fourteenth . In such a social state , there are no markets , and no demand for the products of other countries . All are producers of nearly all that they consume ; and , because the properties are of minimum size , there is little or no surplus left to exchange for other commodities . " Each family is a self-supporting , isolated unit , living a kind of Robinson Crusoe life on its own patch of land , producing , in a rough way , all it wants , and going without what it can not produce . " The land , for the most part , is heavily burdened with mortgages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the death of the former possessor . The amount of registered mortgages on landed property in France is stated to have been four hundred // and fifty millions of pounds sterling , in 183* and , in 1840 , it had become five hundred millions . Of course , it must continue to increase so long as the population increases ; for if the owner of an estate , which will only support one family with decency , leaves two sons and two daughters to inherit it , supposing the daughters to be taken off by marriage , one son must buy out the share of the other , and burden the estate with a debt contracted for this purpose . It is true that the near view of this necessary result operates as a powerful check on the increase of the population ; the people are cautious about marrying too early in life , and the number of children in a family is limited . For this reason alone , while the population of England increases at the rate of fifteen per cent . in ten years , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same period , and in Switzerland it is still less . Another evil is , that the co-heirs who sell their portion of the paternal estate are turned loose upon a community which has no employment to give them . Hired labor is not needed in the small-estate occupancy of land ; each little proprietor tills his own domain . The son or brother who leaves home carries a little capital with him , to be sure ; but this is almost sure to be spent unproductively before he can obtain occupation . And even if it be husbanded , one who has a small property of his own will hardly make so steady a workman as another who depends upon his trade alone . Besides , as the agricultural class are too poor to create any demand for articles manufactured by others , as they are obliged to produce all that they consume , the trades and handicrafts can not flourish . But few workmen can find employment in them , and they are forced to depend rather on the foreign than the home market . Owing to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a congregated mass of turbulent , half-employed operatives in every city on the Continent , whom the agricultural body can not absorb . To the existence of such a class Mr. Laing attributes most of the revolutionary agitation and disorder of the last two years , and the present perilous state of half the cal ) itals of Europe . There is a meaning in this fact , which those economists in our own country who wish to depress manufactures for the purpose of encouraging agriculture , will do well to read . // The cultivation of the ground can not absorb all tbe labor in any nation which is advanced beyond the lowest stage of civilization ; and agriculture itself will not flourish , if the establishment of trade and manufactures in the immediate vicinity does not create a demand for its products . These products are of such bulk and weight , that they will not bear transportation to distant markets at a remunerating price ; they can be sold with profit only in the neighborhood where they are raised . When flour is four dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Boston . Turn the manufactures of Massachusetts into Ohio ; let a number of such establishments as exist at Lowell , Laxvrence , Fall River , and Manchester , spring up within a few miles of Cincinnati ; and the Ohio farmer will obtain as high a price for his grain as if he raised it in Massachusetts . These establishments would also take off the surplus of the agricultural population , and the price of grain would not be unduly depressed by the excessive number of those engaged in its production . The floating pop*ilation of Ohio now either remain idle at home , the necessaries of life being so cheap that they can subsist without any regular occupation , or they are swept off by the great current of emigration , which is constantly setting westward . On the Continent of Europe , the corresponding class look to war and revolution as the only open sphere of employment or means of bettering their condition . " The general distribution of landed property in small estates is attended by another social disadvantage . It throws loose upon a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fit only for military service , and to whom war is a necessity , for war only can give them suitable and beneficial employment . This , I am aware , is a very different conclusion from that to which Mr. Cobden and many other able and philanthropic oh . servers , members of the peace congress , have come to , on the same subject . They consider war as an evil which will be speedily abolished in modern society , by that very distribution and diffusion of landed property which I consider a permanent element of warfare in the new state of the European people . They suppose that war never can be the choice of a people generally possessed of property , and having a preponderating influence and voice in their own public affairs ; because property , especially landed property , which can not he removed or concealed , suffers in war equally from friend and foe , by taxation or // devastation ; and where the great mass of the population are landed proprietors , having this obvious interest in avoiding war , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain peace . If Mr. Cobden and the many excellent men who fondly cherish this hope , would examine more closely the actual practical working of the small estate system of land-occupancy in France , where they were recently assembled in their peace congress , they would see that , in almost every peasant-proprietor 's family , there are one or two grown-up young men , the sons and heirs of the laboring proprietor , who have no employment at home until the small estate becomes vacant by the death of their parents . Their additional labor is not required for its cultivation while the parent is able to work ; and it can not afford them bread after they are grown up , for labor not required . It is , however , a secure living to look to , and to fall back upon , after the parent 's death . This mass of population includes a large proportion of all the youth of France and Germany , of an age and habits suitable for military service . In France alone , there are 10,282,946 landed proprietors . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of families with sons grown up , while the parent is still able to work and cultivate his little property , what a vast body of young men we find in this social state , ever ready and eager for military service and warfare ! To learn a trade or handicraft , which can not subsist them until they have acquired it , and which they would have to abandon as soon as their little heritages fall to them , is by no means so suitable to their position in life , even in a prudential view , as to enter into military service , in which they are fed , clothed , and lodged , from the very first day ; are engaged for a term of years which they can very well spare ; and are then free to return to their little heritages , or to re-engage , according to their prospects . Military conscription is not an evil , not even a hardship , in a society in this state . The great body of landed proprietors , living each family on its own little farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying little , and having little to buy with , can give no employment to each other , or to the idle and unprovided for in the social body , as producers and consumers , in time of peace any more than in time of war . There is no market in this social state for the products of the common peaceful arts - no employments to absorb the increase of population . War is a necessary sequence of the social state of those countries in which landed property is generally , and almost equally , distributed - war abroad , or tumult and revolution at home . This is clearly shown in Switzerland . The Swiss youth are scattered over Europe and 42* // America , in various temporary employments , as servants , small traders , innkeepers , adventurers ; and , except the Jews , no people are so generally dispersed over the civilized world as the Swiss . Switzerland manufactures , also , to no inconsiderable extent , for foreign markets . Yet , with all these outlets and employments for her youth , Switzerland furnishes regiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome , and other Italian States , and keeps , in reality , a very large standing army in pro . portion to her population , always on foot , but always in foreign pay . Military service is so suitable and congenial to the social state of her population of small land-holders , that the ranks of these regiments , although serving abroad , are always replenished with ease ; and there remains always a surplus of unquiet spirits at home , ready , from want of other employment , to engage in tumult and war when the cantons quarrel among themselves or with the federal government . In the United States of America , the perpetual stream of emigration from the half-cleared , halfcultivated land of the Eastern States to the uncleared forests of the West , the wild expeditions to Texas , to Mexico , to California , to Cuba , the reckless spirit of enterprise and unprincipled adventure in the American character , the political bluster and agitation always on the boil at their own firesides , and ready to scald themselves and their neighbors , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a state in which temporary employment is more suitable than steady , life.long application to one pursuit , for the youth of a country in which all have a living , a station in society , and landed property to fall back upon , if their temporary pursuits are not successful . " In speculating upon the effects of the abolition of the corn-laws in England , Mr. Laing undertakes to answer the question which has often been asked , why the British farmer , with his greater skill , capital , and economy of production , *cannot raise larger crops , and undersell , at least in the British market , the grain brought from the Continent of Europe , which has heavy charges of freight , warehouse rent , and labor against it . The reason is , that the grain brought from the Baltic was received by the large proprietor from his tenants , in payment of rent , quit-rent , or feu duties ; or it is the surplus produce of the small estate of the peasant propri* etor . In either case , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of a shopkeeper , which some of our bargain-loving ladies are so eager to purchase , it can be sold below cost . The trader has made his profit , the farmer or // peasant proprietor has obtained his living , out of the bulk of the article which was purchased or raised ; the surplus which is left on hand he can afford to sell at any price . If this portion of the crop sells well , it may enable the producer to lay out a little more on the gratifications and tastes of a higher state of civilization ; if it sells badly , or for nothing at all , t does not affect his means of reproduction , nor even his ordinary habits , enjoyments , or way of living . So the great landowner , whose rents are paid in kind , must dispose of the grain which thus comes into his possession at any price that he can get . It has no cost-price to him ; the lowest sum that the export-merchant will give him for it is still a gain ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain to the export-merchant . " There is , necessarily , in every country , a great part of the population not possessed of land , and who live by supplying others with the various articles of their trades and handicrafts . How was this portion of the population prevented , under the old economy of the Continent , from overflowing ? Why were not they in the same state of redundancy , in proportion to subsistence , as our own operatives in the same trades and handicrafts ? This inquiry leads the traveller to the ultimate conclusion , that different principles of political economy are imposed upon different countries by the natural differences of their climate , geographical position , products , and other physical circumstances ; and that every country has in reality a political economy of its own , suitable to those different physical circumstances , and to the interests , employments , character , spirit , wants , and habits of the inhabitants , as formed by those circumstances . " It is evident that in countries in which , for half the year , out-door work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of water for driving machinery , and the supply of fuel for steam power can not be depended upon , and even the transport of goods in canals , rivers , sea.harbors , and by land roads , is prevented for weeks or months in winter , by frost and snow , the same principles of political economy can not be suitable and applicable to their social arrangements , as in countries in which , like Britain , rivers and roads , sea and land , are always open and available for the transport of raw materials , provisions , goods , aI ) d labor , to any point where they are in demand , at any season , and where out.door work may be carried on almost every day in the year . Take the most simple case of two countries of about equal population , but of different climates , Scotland // and Sweden or Denmark , and consider whether , owing to difference of climate alone , the same principles of social and political economy which work beneficially in the one country , could be applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speculations in political economy , and always eager to impose her bantlings on her neighbors , no evil arises in society from the most perfect freedom of trade and industrial action . Every man may apply his capital , industry , skill , time , and labor of hand or head , where and how he pleases , without restriction , without interference , or any right on the part of government to interfere ; and the common man in England is scarcely so free as in Scotland , because he is there under some restriction in his removal to any new domicile , by the effect of poor rate and the law of settlement . Hence , it is concluded by our Scotch political economists , that capital and industry should in no case be interfered with in their free action by an enlightened government ; that the most perfect freedom of trade , capital , labor , and industrial action , should be the principle of all social arrangements in all countries . But , suppose Scotland were to change climates with Sweden , Denmark , Hanover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clyde , the Forth , the Tay , and all harbors on the coast inaccessible , or of very uncertain access , from ice during the winter months ; all transport by land of food , fuel , goods , and of raw materials for manufacturing industry , impeded every winter by snow , for several weeks , or even months ; would it then be a safe practical economy of the state , and one adapted to the well-being of the whole community , to allow such masses of population as those of Glasgow , Paisley , Dundee , and many other places , to be engendered and accumulated , without any interference of the state for their subsistence , employment , or dispersion ? Would non-interference then be a sound and suitable principle in the political economy of the country ? - . - . In our climate , the redundant population in one locality can , at any season , remove to another in which their labor may be in demand ; and neither natural nor artificial impediments prevent them from moving , at any season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , labor in our principal branches of industry is in demand , and may be employed all the year round , according to the state of markets and stocks . The living stream of labor is unimpeded by physical hinderances of frost and snow , and finds its level at all seasons in our climate . In countries to which nature has denied this advantage , - and this is the case , more or less , in all the north and west of Europe , - can the unrestrained freedom of trade and industry , and the non-interference of government with the application and use // of capital in manufactures , be as safely adopted ? Is not climate an element in their social and political economy , which can not be disregarded with safety to the general well-being , while , with us , it is one of no importance ? It is probably this and other physical elements , unfelt in our social state and insular position , which force themselves into the social arrangements of the Continent , and have given rise to , and perhaps justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions of the Continental governments on the free action of trade and capital . " The inapplicability of the English system of unrestricted free trade to a country situated like our own is very clearly implied in these remarks . Political economy is a science of general and abstract principles , the application of which to particular cases must be carefully limited by circumstances . If our population could always be supplied with British manufactures in precisely the same manner in which the English home market is supplied with them , it might be very questionable policy to shut them out by heavy duties on importation . But the circumstance just adverted to , - the possibility , at times , of selling products at less than their cost price ,  --  is enough to teach us caution . English manufactures are now carried on to such an enormous extent , that the maker and vendor of them is often placed in the situation of the shopkeeper with his " remnants , " of the peasant proprietor with his surplus produce , and of the large proprietor with his stock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is necessary for him to dispose of them at any price ; because any price will be either clear gain , or will save him from further loss . Under these circumstances , he will prefer to send the goods abroad . to be sold , rather than to disturb the rates in the home market by flooding it with surplus stock , which is to be got rid of at a sacrifice . Hence , foreigners can often purchase British manufactures at a less price than the English themselves . In the book trade , for instance , the " remnant " of a large edition of some popular English work is often sent to this country , to be sold for the utmost that it will bring , - which is very little , and always much less than the London valuation . The latest numbers of the English Reviews , either the London Quarterly or the Edinburgh , can be purchased here at // about half their price in London ; the publishers sending the surplus copies to the United States with the avowed purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of thereby driving him out of the business . The same policy , if not checked by a protective tariff , and by specific duties instead of those levied upon the ad valorem principle , would drive our manufacturers of cottons , woollens , and iron , out of the business . Scotch pig and English wrought iron have been sold in the American market , for the last three years , at a price less than the cost of manufacturing them in Great Britain ; and the consequence is , that two thirds of the iron furnaces in the United States are now out of blast , and the disbanded workmen are either idling away their time in the streets , or are emigrating to California . Let this policy be continued a few years longer , and the American manufacturing establishments will be altogether deserted , and the buildings pulled down or converted to other uses . When this end is obtained , we shall probably be obliged once more to purchase British goods at British prices . The proper object of legislation , in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prices ; and , for the reason now explained , the home market is always more steady than the foreign one . It is the policy of home manufacturers and dealers to keep it steady . The great division of landed property which has taken place on the Continent having extinguished the social importance of the former great landholders , the gentry and nobles , as a third influential body between the monarch and the people , - what Mr. Laing calls " functionaiism , " or a system of government by office-holders , immensely numerous and carefully arranged and classified , has been contrived to fill the vacancy . This system has attained its fullest develop ment in France and Germany . In the former country , at the time of the expulsion of Louis Philippe , the civil functionaries were stated to amount to 807,030 individuals . In Prussia , in proportion to the population , they are still more numerous ; the object being to give the semblance of nationality to the heterogeneous masses of inhabitants of the several provinces , which have been torn away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ill-jointed kingdom . Prussia is in fact governed by a bureaucracy , very // carefully drilled and disciplined , all moving as one body from the impulse that is received from the centre , but not hedged round by any ancient memories , deriving no strength from associations with the past , and having no root in the affections of the people . The system is an artificial and pedantic one , looking very well in theory , but working very ill , because it represses all freedom of action and thought , and creates a constant feeling of irksomeness and restraint . Mr. Laing characterizes the Prussians , in his usual blunt way , as " the most superintended , the most interfered with , the most destitute of civil freedom and political rights , - in a word , the most enslaved people in Western Europe , and the most educated . " " Every imaginable and real social interest , religion , education , law , police , every branch of public or private business , personal liberty to move from place to place , even from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage in any branch of trade or industry on a small or large scale ; all the objects , in short , in which body , mind , and capital can be employed in civilized society , were gradually laid hold of for the employment and support of functionaries , were centralized in bureaux , were superintended , licensed , inspected , reported upon , and interfered with , by a host of officials scattered over the land and maintained at the public expense , yet with no comnceivable utility in their duties . They are not , however , gentlemen at large , enjoying salary without service . They are under a semi . military discipline . In Bavaria , for instance , the superior civil functionary can place his inferior functionary under housearrest , for neglect of duty , or other offence against civil functionary discipline . In Wurtemberg , the functionary can not marry without leave from his superior . Voltaire says , somewhere , that the art of government is to make two thirds of a nation pay all it possibly can pay for the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the functionary system . The functionaries are not there for the benefit of the people , but the people for the benefit of the functionaries . All this machinery of functionarism , with its numerous ranks and gradations in every district , filled with a staff of clerks and expectants in every department , looking for employment , appointments , or promotions , was intended to be a new support of the throne in the new social state of the Continent ; a third class , in close connection with the people , by their various official duties of interference in all public or private affairs , yet attached by their inte // rests to the kingly power . The Beamptenstand , or functionary class , was to be the equivalent to the class of nobility , gentry , capitalists , and men of larger landed property than the peasantproprietors , and was to make up in numbers for the want of individual weight and influence . " Public officers are necessarily numerous under every organized government in modern times ; the collection of the public revenue alone requires a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , they do not constitute a class by themselves , bound together by a semi-military discipline , and responsible only to the head of the government . The feelings and preferences of the people are respected in the selection of them , and they are usually appointed from the vicinity where their services nre needed . Men are not educated for office , as for a distinct profession , in which they are to continue through life ; but they accept and resign posts of public service , or are turned out of them , as circumstances may require , and consequently are not distinguishable from the body of the people . The vice of the system in France and Germany is its excessive centralization . The officers in all the departments know no other rule of conduct than subserviency to their immediate chiefs , who again look up to their superiors , and these last mechanically obey the impulses received from the seat of government . Personally , they are moved by only two considerations , their pay and the hope of promotion in office . They care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise their functions , and the people care nothing for them . But a government which does not rest upon any feeling on the part of the governed , which is not protected by any sentinient of loyalty , is always insecure . It may appear perfect to the eye at one moment , and at the next it will topple into ruin . Louis Philippe was deposed and set aside as easily and quietly as any chef de bureau . To the people , he was only the head of a department , or of all departments , of the administration ; and the farther he was removed from them in nominal rank , the less they cared for his name or his welfare . The fall even of a poor bigot , like Charles X. , was dignified by the sympathy of a few personal adherents , and even of a small party in the State ; but not one tear of personal // regret appears to have been shed for the sudden and ignominious prostration of his successor . In Norway , which , according to our traveller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic , constitution in Europe , the evils of functionarism are avoided by giving the incumbent a vested right in his office , and thus insuring to him a measure of personal independence . He can not be displaced , except after a formal investigation and conviction of incompetency or misconduct , the trial being held by a different branch of the government from that which appoints him . He must be promoted in his turn , his salary can not be lessened , nor his duties increased without further compensation ; and he can not even be remoVed from one locality to another without his consent ; in support of all these rights , he can appeal to a court which is wholly independent of the executive and of the department in which he serves . Appointments to office are watched as carefully as removals ; vacancies are published in the gazette , lists of applicants are kept , and this list , together with the reasons for appointing the successful candidate , is laid before parliament , who examine every case , and have power to cancel any unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under it , the office-holders are wont to speak , vote , and write in opposition to , or in favor of , measures of government , as freely as other people ; they have really constituted the desirable third element between the crown and the people , . being independent , in some measure , of both , and keeping both in their true constitutional places . The system was probably devised as a means of securing to Norway the ' enjoyments of those rights and institutions which were promised at the time of its arbitrary annexation to Sweden . " In the United States of America , the danger of functionarisin to a free state is counteracted in a way directly the reverse . To avoid permanent , or even long , occupation of office is the principle of their social policy . " But for this arrangement , says Mr. Laing , our government would become *t mere bureaucracy , like that of France or Prussia , existing for the benefit of the governing , not of the governed . He alludes to the fact tha't the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gift , the incumbents of nearly all of them being changed once in four years . That the // Norwegian system is a preservative against the evils of functionarism is evident enough ; but we can not see how it is , that Mr. Laing should attribute precisely the same result to the very different system which obtains in this country . That the office-holders are removable at pleasure , and are actually changed as often as once in four years , is a circumstance which , as it places them entirely at the mercy of the President , is likely to render them very obsequious to his will . They must be his partisans , and show themselves very active and energetic in advocating his cause . Even so very weak an administration as that of Mr. Tyler , which mustered only a " corporal 's guard " of supporters in the House of Representatives , and had no hold whatever upon the people at large , was vehemently defended by the whole corps of his office-holders , from the head of a department down to a village postmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ; but the reason why we are not is , that the government is the least centralized of any in the world . The National government , it is true , has more offices at its disposal probably than all the State governments taken together ; but it has not so many as those which are filled by the direct election of the people The President has one postmaster in every little village ; but the inhabitants of that village choose their own selectmen , their own assessors of taxes , their own schoolcommittee , their own overseers of the poor , their own surveyors of highways , and the incumbents of half a dozen other little offices corresponding to those which , in bureaucratic governments , are filled by the appointment of the sovereign . In all these posts , which are really important public trusts , the villagers are trained to the management of affairs , and acquire a comprehensiveness of view , a practical administrative talent , and a knowledge of business , which are , or ought to be , among the chief objects of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for owing to our republican liking for rotation in office , the incumbents of these humble posts are changed every year or two , till every decent man in the place has had his turn . The fruits of this sort of educa-. tion are perceived by Mr. Laing , though he fails to attribute them to the right cause . " In all the affairs of the United States , men of ordinary edu. cation and common sense have shown themselves capable of dis . // charging very ably all those public functions and official affairs , which in Europe are supposed , from their being wrapped up in forms and etiquette of procedure , to require long training in the bureaux of ministers , very great experience , and much previous study . The Americans have proved , in the cabinet and in the field , that all this false importance claimed by men of office and routine , vanishes , in the management of public affairs , before sound common sense and energy . In their foreign diplomacy , American ministers fresh from the counting-house , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least as successfully as the regularly trained ambassadors of the old European countries . American statesmen and generals have proved themselves equal to those bred in courts and on parades , in bureaux and at grand reviews . Functionaries create the science by which they live , out of their own formalities of office and routine of action ; but this science vanishes in the grasp of men of vigorous common sense applied without delicacy or ceremony to the business in hand . " In Germany , great pains are taken to educate men expressly for office ; but according to the practical vIew of things which is taken by our shrewd traveller , these pains are thrown away . " To hold any function in civil affairs an education at a university is required . A literary culture and many accomplishments and attainments in science and the fine arts are diffused by this connection between university education and civil function , and are found in lower classes of society than with us . The youths who would , in England , be plying the hammer and the file , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair wages by their industry , are philosophers , politicians , and poets , in Germany , cultivating their taste in the fine arts , or their knowledge in various sciences , while waiting for some office which affords them a less income and less independence than the earnings of the industrious English mechanic . It is curious to observe this difference of education between English and German people in the same rank of life , and the different results in each country . The young men of the middle class with us are , from their sixteenth year , in the counting-house , warehouse , or workshop , giving their minds entirely to their trade or business , thinking of nothing else , and strangers to philosophy , literature , or refined accomplishments . Yet their intellectual culture is not dormant ; for they are acquiring experience , judgment , and the habits of acting with , and acting upon , their fellowmen . They come out of this training in the school of real busi // ness , into the world of social and political affairs , with minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or members of parliament , the weightiest national interests with good sense and practical judgment . Our Humes , Cobdens , Brights , have had no other schooling . The Continental youth of the same class go , about the same age , to the university , and come out of their training philosophers , theorists , dreamers , and attach themselves to some department of public business , in which they are formed into state functionaries incapable of thinking or acting out of the conventional forms and routine of the offices they are bred in . The practical education in the affairs of real life is more adapted to our social state , and seems to produce more distinguished public men , than the more literary and speculative education of the youth of the Continent . In France and Germany , the constituent assemblies at Paris and Frnnkfort , composed of philosophers , men of high literary reputation for profound learning and talent , made a very sorry figure in 1848 , 1849 . They wasted eighteen or twenty months listening to spoken pamphlets of their learned members , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ought to be in a perfect constitution . In Germany , this speculative spirit has ruined the cause it espoused . The public mind grew weary of the endless discussion of theories , and the waiting for a practical constitution . The German mind is generally in an ague , in a hot or a cold fit . The hot fit for German unity , a central constitutional German power and a parliament , has passed away like the hot fit a few years ago for Honge 's German catholic church , and has been succeeded by a cold fit , in which all that agitated the public mind but a few weeks before is regarded as a feverish dream . The want of men educated in the world , and formed in the school of real affairs , and the preponderance of men of speculative philosophic minds , professors , scholars , men of the highest talents and attainments in literature and science , but without practice , judgment , or decision in the management even of . the most ordinary business of society , will account for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the characteristic tendency of the German people to theory without action . They lay an egg , and cackle around it as a glorious production , and want the capability of hatching it . " The functionarism of education , the centralization under a department of government of all educational establishments , from the University down to the A , B , C school , the appointment of all teachers , masters , and professors by the state , and the requirement that all who teach shall have gone through a certain course of education and examination , and the prohibition of all teaching // or school-keeping by any other than those licensed , approved of , educational functionaries , has turned out to be a branch of the functionary system , dangerous to the state , and injurious to the character of the people . It has enabled a conclave of professors at the German universities to form the public mind on their own views and theories in politics , philosophy , and legislation , to indoctrinate all the youth of Germany , all who are to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the clergy , all the lawyers , all the schoolmasters and teachers , all of whom must pass through their hands as students , to be qualified for office , with the same wild theories and speculations in religion , philosophy , and political and social science . The youth come out of this preparatory formation of mind for real life , imbued with the very same opinions on all subjects , slaves of the lamp of one g6nie , in philosophy , in religious , political , or literary opinion , and absorbed in exertions to understand the mysticism of other minds . This system has given a dreaming habit of mind to a great proportion of the German youth ; an aptitude to be led by theory , fancy , and speculation , rather than by judgment . It is imminently dangerous to the state , because public opinion is not formed by the public , but by a junta of professors , who have the formation of the public mind . " This train of reflection leads Mr. Laing to speak of the state of things at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are prone to consider all Germany as one great lecture-room , and the population as consisting in about equal parts of professors and students . The most remarkable fact about them is , that the Burschenscliaft , or studentdom , is a distinct and formidable political body . They made the revolutions of 1848 in Germany ; they did nearly all the fighting , and impressed upon the revolutionary governments which they called into being their own character for recklessness and extravagance , and a kind of swaggering and boisterous aspect , which eventually precipitated their fall through the general derision and disgust which it excited . Their political tendencies were manifested not for the first time at this period of universal agitation and revolt . Their clubs and secret associations had long been regarded as dangerous to the state , and the German sovereigns had labored rn vain to discover and suppress them . How have a class of young men , whose only ostensible objects are the pursuits of literature and science , been able to acquire this political influence and notoriety ? Mr. Laing justly remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English or Scotch universities have no moye social or political importance than the class of journeymen tailors , journeymen bakers , or any other class of young men . They are the same in the eye of the law and the police . They form no distinct corps , and are never thought of , even in the smallest university town in Scotland , as a class differing from the other inhabitants in manners , opinions , or privileges . The same remark is applicable to the students in the colleges of the United States . Why have the German university students been so turbulent , so insolent in their treatment of the town's-people , or Philisters , as they term them , and so much inclined to political conspiracies or reforms ? They are not more numerous in comparison with the whole population ; Prussia , with about fourteen millions of inhabitants , has a little over 4,000 university students ; Scotland , with a population of only two millions and a half , has nearly 3,000 . One reason for the difference unquestionably is , that the graduates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost exclusively to the government for employment and support , and therefore have less occasion to think about the manner in which the affairs of the nation are conducted . Other governments do not attach qualification , or even any preference for office , to academical degrees . Those who leave the universities , therefore , are quickly reabsorbed into the mass of the population , from whom they never consider themselves as widely separated . The graduates in Germany remain a class by themselves ; they are either officeholders or expectants of office . Another peculiarity of German university life is , that it is regulated by a discipline and police of its own . There is a distinct judicature for the offences of students against the public peace , and a special academical prison for their punishment . The professors themselves are judges in these academical courts , and are , of course , fearful lest a too rigid enforcement of the law should drive away students to other universities , and thereby diminish the fees for attendance on their lectures . The sounder principle obtains both in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper academical offences ; and if a student breaks the public peace , or commits any other offence against the // laws of the land , he will be brought before the ordinary tribunals , and punished in the ordinary way , - by fine or ignominious imprisonment . When the esprit de corps is fostered to an unnatural extent , as in the German system , commitment to the academical prison is not felt to be ignominious . It is regarded either as a jest , or as matter for boasting . It is a still more significant fact , that , in the German universities , instruction is given almost exclusively by lectures . This mode of teaching was well adapted to the Middle Ages , in which it had its origin , when books and scholars were rare , and could be found only within the precincts of the monasteries and the universities . Oral instruction was then a substitute , the only substitute that could be had , for the study of books . But it is absurd to continue the use of a substitute after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which for a time usurped its place . The land is now flooded with books ; our highways are paved , our houses are lined , with them ; and more knowledge can be gained from a diligent study of them for an hour than could be acquired from lectures for a week . " In the present state of science , a man pretending to teach any one science , physical or intellectual , to 120 pupils in 120 hours , is like the wizard of the north putting a tomtit 's egg into his magic box , and in two minutes producing from it a full grown goose . Yet this is precisely the position of the most able Scotch or German professor , doing faithfully his utmost , in a six months ' course of lectures , of an hour a day , for five days of the week , to impart a science to a class of lads , each of whom has at least two , and often three , other sciences to learn , that is , classes to attend , during the same half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of giving instruction by lectures upon a particular subject or science ; the teaching is not only insufficient , it is positively injurious . An able professor is not willing to give in his lectures merely what the student might find quite as clearly and ably expressed in books ; for the student might then say that he could read the books , and could ponder and inwardly digest them , so that he did not care to have them repeated to him in the form of a lecture . The professor must then rack his brains to be able to say something relating to the subject which can not be // found in print ; he must call upon his fancy and imagination to aid him , so that he may teach in a lecture what does not exist elsewhere , since the work of his judgment and intellect has been forestalled by writers who are on the watch after every discovery and new thought , to put it forth to the world in a book as soon as possible . however able the professor may be , he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to occupy a six months ' course of lectures ; and it must be new every year , for if it be also true and valuable , it will be published before the end of the year , whether the author is willing or not . With the present im. proved modes of presenting and acquiring knowledge , one can learn in a year what it took Newton a lifetime to discover . How , then , is a professor to give in lectures , every year , enough for the student to digest of wholly original matter ? He can not do it ; and it follows , that if what is taught in lectures is new , it is not true ; and if true , it is not new . The German professors labor under this difficulty ; and to their consequent straining after novelty must be attributed much of the fanciful and extravagant character of what is propounded in their lectures , - most of their visionary theories , wild speculations , and insane skepticism . This is the case , at least , with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on history , political economy , law , phi .. lology , literature , and the like . The physical and exact sciences , which may be illustrated by apparatus , experiments , and diagrams , may be profitably taught in lectures ; and the German professors of these sciences , accordingly , are not found to be more wild and visionary than other people . The following remarks of Mr. Laing on the true object of university life and study seem to us eminently just and proper ; and as they show the folly of the attempts , which have frequently been made in the colleges of this country , to make the scheme of a liberal education more comprehensive and practically useful , as is supposed , we copy them without further comment , hoping to return to the subject at a future day . " Education in Germany , as in Scotland , is different in its principle from education in England . What do the English people mean when they send their boys , at ten years of age , to eminent schools , and in due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them home at twenty-three or twenty-four years of age , to enter on their future professions or paths of life , whatever these may he , according to their prospects or fortunes ? Do these English parents act wisely or foolishly ? What a silly , ignorant lad their young man appears to be , with his prosody or his algebra , his longs and s/torts , or his plus and minus , his mathematics or his Greek and Latin , and with his fine fellows , his reading men , or his sporting men , of his college ! What a foolish figure he cuts beside a Continental or a Scotch lad of the same age , from the universities , who knows something of half a dozen sciences , something of half a dozen languages , has some knowledge of chemistry , natural philosophy , political economy , metaphysics , talks well on geology , and all the fashionable speculations of the day , and is acquainted with history , literature , and politics , and is master of many gentlemanly accomplishments ! But wait a little . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The German or Scotch lad is , in general , still where he was at nineteen , still but a lad in mind , still a babbler on the surface of every subject . The English bred lad has gone to his profession or to his station in private or p*ublic life with very little positive knowledge to show for his education , but with a mind well exercised , although , perhaps , on very useless or foolish things , and capable of a severe and intense application to the subject before it , and just , perhaps , because it has been exercised and trained on things dull , dry , and unattractive , and which require patient thinking , or indeed mental drudgery* to acquire them . What have been the most serious studies of the Scotch or German bred student , are now his relaxations . He gathers in , hand over hand , the popular branches of knowledge , the modern languages , and the more abstruse sciences . These are not fatiguing studies to a mind trained to patient application and thinking . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , he enters with intellectual powers which seem almost intuitively to grasp the right views and the necessary knowledge of the subject before him . The two men , at thirty years of age , are prodigiously different . " The long period which the student on the Continent must pass before he can get an appointment , enables a great many of superior minds to go deeper into philosophy and science than the superficial acquirements of the class-room student ; but this long period does not form a practical reflective turn of mind . It produces a man of theory and speculation , not of active habits . The Scotch university education , attempting to teach a science in a course of lectures , can only produce superficial men . The English universities , which do not profess to teach any thing at all , // but merely to exercise and train the intellectual powers in studies , classical or mathematical , which are a valuable means , but are not held out as a valuable end , seem the more sensible and rational institutions . They accomplish what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning to their students . The German and Scotch universities do not accomplish what they profess . The Scotch universities are , at least , innocent institutions , and indispensable , perhaps , for medical science . The German universities are , at present , red-hot foci of exaggerated theories and political speculations , not seats of useful education . " The professors in the German universities educate the functionaries , from the prime minister down to the village schoolmaster ; to adopt Mr. Laing 's illustration , " they hold the trigger by which at any moment public opinion may be made to explode . " " The influence and working of this great social power is remarkably illustrated by the intrigues of the Duke of Augustenburg for separating the duchy of Schleswig from the Danish crown , and annexing it to the duchy of Holstein , to which , as a part of the German empire , he is next heir . The university of Kiel , the professors , students , functionaries , clergy , and the provincial newspapers , were all set to work to preach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to raise a fanatical cry throughout Germany for the annexation of Schieswig to the German duchy of Holstein . The papers of the duke fell into the hands of the Danish government , and are published by the keeper of the royal archives , Dr. Wegener . They clearly prove one of the most foul conspiracies of modern history , to mislead the public mind , by the press and the teachers of the youth , upon the right to dismember the Danish monarchy , and to erect Schleswig and Holstein into one duchy for the benefit of this Duke of Auguste nburg . Prussia itself , and all the German governments , had to follow , not to lead or control , the demoralized frenzy of the Burschenschaft , and to engage in a bloody and disgraceful war for an unjust and unprincipled object , at the bidding of a clique of professors , functionaries , newspaper writers , and students , influenced , and even bribed and paid , by this nobleman to raise a clamor in favor of his pretensions , and excite the public mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portion , about one third of the inhabitants , speak the German language . The professorial influence in Germany was more powerful than the governments , and forced them to engage in this war with Denmark . " // The Landwehr system is the third of the three new elements introduced by the French Revolution into the social economy of the Continent , - a system wholly inconsistent with our notions and habits of individual liberty . The wars of Napoleon demonstrated the inefficiency of the old Prussian system of military discipline , first introduced by Frederick the Great , which had degenerated into a ludicrous particularity of dress and equipment , and a formal precision of drill and parade movements . A general was likely to be beaten while he was instructing his soldiers in the use of buttons , buckles , pigtails , and pipe clay . The officers educated under this plan were tedious old martinets , and were defeated or captured by Napoleon before they had time to powder their hair in the morning . His career of success was uninterrupted till be had drubbed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he was met and foiled with his own weapons . The enthusiasm of the soldiery , the chief secret of his power , was the first element turned against him . All Germany rose as one man in the War of the Liberation , as it was termed , and broke their chains upon their oppressors ' heads . The nobles and the peasants , the shopkeepers and the mechanics , the professors and the students , all shouldered their muskets and joined the holy crusade against the French . They were successful , and their own sovereigns then cheated them out of the promised reward of victory . These same sovereigns thought they bad then made a great discovery ; it was glorious to have the whole nation , instead of a small standing army , to fight their battles for them . It was forthwith determined that the whole nation should be enrolled , armed , and disciplined , - should spend two or three . years of the best part of their lives in learning to be soldiers , and then return to their ordinary avocations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from them again , at any time , to fight the battles of the country . Thus all the inhabitants of the country became one great standing army ; onty a large portion of them were allowed to remain at home a part of the time on furlough , to get their living and maintain their families as they could . If the people could only be persuaded to enter the service with as much enthusiasm as they showed in 1813 , the system would have been an admirable one . But the need of this element of enthusiasm // was not taken into the account . The sovereigns seemed to believe that a compulsory rising of the nation would be as formidable as a voluntary one . " The Prussian army consists of regiments of the line , or standing troops . This is considered the formation.school of the military force or army of the whole population of the country . Every male , without exception , in the whole population is bound to serve three years , between his twentieth and his twenty-fifth years , as a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only exceptions are cases of bodily infirmity , and the clergy , schoolmasters , only sons of widows , and a few others ; and the liability to serve is rather suspended than altogether abandoned by government in those exceptions . Property , rank , occupation , business , give no claim to exemption , and no substitutes or remplacents are accepted of , as in the French conscription system . Every man must serve as a private in the ranks of a regiment of the line , whatever he his social position . The only allowance made is , that young men of property or of the higher classes and professions , who provide their own clothing , arms , and equipment at their own expense , may be permitted to serve in certain rifle or chasseur corps for one year only , instead of three , on a petition with sufficient reasons given for the indulgence required . After the three years ' service in the line , the young man is turned over to his district Landwehr regiment of the ersten Aufgeboth , or , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Landwehr force is considered the proper army ; the troops of the line being its formation-school . It is liable , like the standing army , to serve in or out of the country ; but in time of peace , to save expense , it is only embodied for manaiuvre* and exercise for a few weeks yearly . Its staff only is in constant pay . The division of the second Aufgebotlz , or second for service , consists of all who have served their three years in the line , and their two years in the Landwehr of the first Aufgeboth , and are under forty years of age . These are considered trained soldiers , and mcii settled in occupations , and are therefore , in time of peace , only assemt lei in small divisions , and in their own localities , for a few days%xercise . The Landsturni consists of all not in the service , or discharged from it by the completion of their terms of service in the other divisions ; and it is mustered and organized as well as the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system is , that every Prussian subject , without exception , shall pass through a military training of three years , in the ranks of a regiment of the line , and shall then be available during his whole life as a trained soldier , in one or other of the divisions of the Landwehr force , according to his age and fitness for any military duty . " // The objection to this system is , that it costs much more than its immediate expense to the government . No man can have three years taken out of the best part of his life , to be consumed in playing soldier , without losing much more than the direct value of the time thus expended . He returns to his home in a great measure unfitted for any other occupation . He brings with him the tastes , habits , and morals of the camp ; he can not resume his civic education at the point where he left off three years before ; he can not at once become a good mechanic , a good merchant , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any regular , industrious calling . If the exigencies of the country allow him to remain quiet for a few years , he may , indeed , slowly resume his old habits ; but just as fast as he becomes a good citizen , so fast he unlearns his military education . He can not exist in the two characters at once , both good citizen and good soldier , by any stroke of legerdemain , by any cunningly devised system . The suffering inflicted upon the community by the moral tyranny of this Landwehr system can hardly be over-estimated . " Think of a father and mother , in some country village , who have brought up a son in moral and religious habits , in innocence of evil , and in ideas suitable to their station and to the humble trade he is to live by , being compelled to send him for three years , at his outset in life , to join a regiment of the line in a large , dissipated city , like Berlin or Cologne , and to associate with such companions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave than see him doomed to such a fate . The true defence of a government is in the hearts of its subjects ; the injustice and oppressiveness of such a system would deprive it of a moral power for which no amount of military force could be an adequate substitute . Such powers as England and the United States are strong , because they are identified with the interests of the people living under them , and because the latter are not tutored , and controlled , and disciplined , and interfered with , till they lose all capacity for self-management , and all interest in their own pursuits . Hence it is , that " the baton of the civil constable is the emblem of the social condition and civilization of the English people ; while , on the Continent , it is the loaded field-piece , pointed down the streets .
