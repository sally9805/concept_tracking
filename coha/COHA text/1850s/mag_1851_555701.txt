txt ART . III . - Dix Ans d'Jitudes Historiques . Par AUGTJ5TIN THIERRY , Membre de l'Institut . Quatri*me Edition , revue et augment*e . Paris . 1842 . WHEN a child who has received a new toy , gives hut one moment to the ecstasy of admiration , and straightway proceeds to pull the ingenious machine to pieces , the chances are that be will be made to smart for his diligence ; yet the punishment , whatever may be said of its justice , is very sure to prove ineffectual . The angry parent ought to recognize in himself // the same natural impulse that he is striving to expel from the breast of his offspring . The disposition , the faculty , in us , that never meets an effect without searching for its cause , is common to all . Who will not hear witness to the satisfaction with which he learned how Pope filed down a score of rough verses into the needle-like point of an epigrammatic couplet ; how Johnson used to forge a whole chain of ponderous and polished iamhics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coleridge composed melodious rhymes whilst wandering amidst " the howling wilderness of sleep . " Who that recalls the mood in which he first read Lockhart 's Life of Scott , will hesitate to say , that not one of the wondrous fictions , the story of whose origin it unfolds , is read with a more ahsorhing attention ? But our interest , which may well enough be pardoned for dwelling on the discovered mysteries of the Magician of the North , stoops much lower . After gazing with awe into the penetralia of genius , we are not unthankful for permission to explore the more common chamhers of talent . Of all articles of virtu in the market , none find a readier sale than those autographic scraps which the writer would willingly have kept within his most private portfolio . It is deemed fortunate that the world has not lost the documentary evidence of the secret , once so carefully kept , that the wit which sparkles in huoyant glohules all over The Rivals and The School for Scandal , instead of being the product of an instantaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Curiosity descends even to the homely details of the epistolary art . We are delighted to find that Hume , the most indolent of mortals , seldom accepted an invitation to dinner without taking pains to transcrihe , sometimes more than once , the note in which he signified his acceptance . Certainly , then , it ought not to be thought matter unworthy of inquiry how histories are written ; yet of all those who find curiosities in every other department of literature , how few consider that this , in some respects the most important and the most difficult of all , may equally well reward attention . If we reflect on the amount of labor required for the compilation even of the most unpretending history , and hear in mind that the maker of it has generally no fame to look forward to , and very little profit , we shall be convinced that hardly any // literary labor is so inadequately rewarded as this , and shall wonder how it is that the artist is supported in his work , and encoura 0ed to persevere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why men should take to recording them . Even the genealogist can find little value in isolated facts . A collection of them may be used as canvas , on which the skill and taste of the painter may be displayed , or the lesson of the moralist and the philosopher may he illustrated . The former was the mode adopted by the ancients , who constructed histories as they wrote poems , expecting the same kind of fame as the reward of artistic excellence . In our modern times , political motives have had much influence in the production of books of this class . M. Augustin Thierry began to write with the belief that he , like most of those around him , was devoting his energies to politics . His early readers thought so too . We are told in this volume how both he and they came to be undeceived . In 1820 , he began to publish , in the Courrier Fran*ais , a series of articles entitled Lettres sur l'Ilistoire de France . He wrote with enthusiastic ardor . " Doubtless , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing to view with the distinctness of scenic representation , the people as they existed at each epoch of our history ; but this very illusion lent to my words the more warmth and interest . " The consequences were , that the populace cheered and the government persecuted . " From the appearance of my second letter , I was treated by the journalists of the anti.liberal side as a public enemy . They accused me of aiming at the dismemberment of France , and of shaking the throne in robbing it of five centuries of its age . The censor mutilated many of my pages , and with his red ink quite cancelled the dissertation on the true epoch of the establishment of the monarchy . " A zealous political writer , we may readily believe , was not to be daunted by attacks like these , while encouraged by the approval of a hundred thousand readers ; and NI . Thierry tranquilly kept on his way . But , he tells us , an unexpected mortification succeeded . // political tinge faded off , disclosing the unattractive learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those alone who had a genuine fondness for scientific inquiry . Many letters , expressive of discontent , arrived one after another ; and so bitterly did they speak of the long articies , fit enough for the Journal des Savans , that the persons who had direction of the Courrier , fearing a loss of subscribers , besought me to change my subject . I replied , that I had no desire to employ my pen on any but historical matters ; and , in January , 1821 , I ceased writing for the Courrier Framfais . " It was , then , not the enthusiasm which is inspired by political zeal that formed M. Thierry 's chief support during his protracted and painful labors . We would not deny either the sincerity of his love of progress and hatred of absolutism , or the necessity of allowing such principles to have their influence on the historian as well as the citizen . No one can read our author 's works without seeing in every chapter abundant evidence that he has faith in humanity , perhaps excessive faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gives us clearly to understand , that wherever one race of men are oppressed by another , his heart and voice are on the side of the weaker . Still , liberalism is not the characteristic of M. Thierry 's writings , - not that which entitles them to be treated as belonging to a class of their own . If his political sympathies have added much to the spirit of his works , they have not contributed the method . That method he himself explains in the book before us . Some of our readers may here learn for the first time that the book itself is in existence , although it is now some fifteen years old . The History of the Norman Conquest , however , is known to American readers , and they can not but be ready to hail with pleasure any thing that may throw light on its author 's literary biography . Dix Ans d'Atudes ! How much these words suggest ! For years spent as M. Thierry spends them deserve to be called years of study . A writer on chronology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though that is by no means without merit , insists on the devotion of this very space of ten years as essential to the attainment of such a knowledge of history as every gentleman ought to possess . It would be amusing , and not uninstructwe , to compare his course of study with that pursued by our // historian . The latter would prove on trial not the least laborious , yet the most attractive ; and , if an inference may be drawn from M. Thierry 's own shining example , the most fruitful of results . From 1817 to 1827 , M. Thierry 's labors were divided between two objects , - the history of the English people , and the history of the French people . These terms are of moment . He was not engaged upon the history of the country , France ; nor of the country , England ; nor yet did he occupy himself with the acts of their rulers and great men , their kings , generals , and statesmen . Thierry loves to take races as individual existences , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they were in diligent and thoughtful investigation , his opinions , of course , underwent some change . At each step of his progress he was learning new facts , and at each step , too , his mind was increasing in vigor , and enabling him the better to grasp and estimate what he learned . But during the whole period , he was using his pen ; and he has collected in this book such of these writings as are not embodied in his completed works . The book , accordingly , is made up of two sets of essays , more or less fragmentary . The pieces of each set , being arranged in chronological order , and presented to us ( so we are given to understand ) in the shape in which they came from the mind of the author , the whole collection may well " be of interest both to those who , having witnessed the final result of the author 's labors , may be curious to know each point of the route which he has passed over , and to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its individual developments . " Yet it is not this part of the volume that we have read with most interest . We may undoubtedly see here how broad generalizations , struck out from the heated imagination of youth , have subsequently , in obedience to the dictates of experience and truth , been contracted to narrower limits and shorn of something of their glow . And we may even learn to accept with more confidence the final conclusions of a writer who has made so frank an exhibition of his early errors , and who has immediately , on recognizing that they were errors , so heroically abandoned them . After all , however , the Thierry of 27 is the Thierry of 17 ; and though an acute critical comparison of these fragments might // bring to view a more regular and clearly marked progression of mind than a cursory reading has made apparent to us , we can certainly point out assertions towards the close of the decennium quite as heterodox as any that precede them . What shall he said , for instance , to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word Parliament has done the history of England more harm than the thing itself has done the country good ? " The part which we value most is the Preface . In the compass of these fifty pages , we have an autohiographical sketch of remarkable vividness . The whole should be read , and in its own sinewy , untranslatable language . The scholar places himself before our view with his toils , his discouragements , his sufferings ; and he communicates to us something of the untamable enthusiasm and resolute fixedness of purpose which , we are confident , even harder trials could not have suhdued . Whether it he that there is a peculiar picturesqueness in this description , or that the circumstances themselves contain a suggestive power through their likeness to occurrences in the inner life of every man who has felt the hope ( and who has not at some time heen stirred by that dreamy and strangely exhilarating aspiration ? ) that he might have strength to leave behind him something " which the world should not willingly let die , " we know not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one which we can not contemplate without an earnest sympathy . It teaches , at least , how unreasonable is that popular notion which would confine our interest to genius struggling after the grander walks of life . We have here no ambitious young soldier ; no orator panting for an occasion ; no politician , eager only for advancement ; but one who , intent on none of these things , would win fame by picking history out of a parcel of monkish chronicles . We see him roaming restlessly through libraries , cramped by perpetually seeing around him evidences of what has been done , while tormented with doubt as to what he himself is to do . Suddenly a vision of order bursts on the chaos . " One day , when reading attentively some chapters of flume , I was struck with a thought which appeared to me a ray of light , and closing the book , I cried , All this dates from a Conquest ; - there is a conquest at the bottom 1 ' Instantly I conceived the // p*oject of remaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new point of view . " Then had to come that trying reaction , when the mind , after an unnatural excitement , falls back upon itself , - a trying revulsion , because it is the test of the spirit 's worth . It is not strange for any one to feel the intoxication of ambitious desire , nor do any man 's faculties , when thus quickened , fail to shape out for him a plan which seems to insure success to him who shall be able to follow it . At the subsidence of this tumultuous agitation of mind , comes first a sensation of weakness , - a fear that too mighty a task has been attempted . This , however , can well enough be borne ; time and rest , and that confidence in self , which is a part of the life of the soul , will cure it . Not here does the trial lie ; but in the after conviction , which , although it begins with a fever and a quaking , is only confirmed hy protracted thought , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling scheme that appeared at once so brilliant and so sure , is a vain phantasm . The traveller did not falter when the mountainous way that stretched before him seemed lofty and difficult ; hut now the path itself is sunken , and leaves an abyss . At this point it is , that the weak spirit gives up in despair , and either preys morbidly on its own energies , or turns to the common business of the world , content to exist an undistinguished unit amidst a million others , and expecting to inscrihe its name on no more enduring monument than a tomhstone . Thierry approved himself a man of another stamp . Not discouraged because history was too stubborn to he bent into the shape which his imagination had conceived , he plunged the deeper into those mocking records , determined that they themselves should teach him the way to be original and great . He did not throw away his first plan , but kept it in reserve , subject to be modified , as far as need should require , and at some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be put to use . The opportunity did eventually come ; but meanwhile he gave a share of his attention to early French history also . He read with untiring diligence , turning away from no book or manuscript , however repulsive . Occasionally he met something which refreshed him like a fountain in a desert . Such an oasis was Ducange s Glossary , of which he speaks in enthusiastic terms , and // Sharon Turner 's History of the Anglo Saxons . At last , in 1821 , he entered definitively upon his great work . We quote his own account of this important era in his life . " In a word , I resolved , if I may he pardoned the expression , to build my epopee , to write the History of the Conquest of England by the Normans , by mounting up to its first causes , in order subsequently to descend to its latest consequences ; to paint this grand event in the truest colors , and under the greatest number of aspects ; and , as the theatre for such diversified scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries far and near , which bad felt the influence of Norman settlements , or the repercussion of the Norman victory . In this extended framework I meant to find room for all the important questions which had before successively occupied my mind ; - the question , namely , of the origin of the modern aristocracies , that of the character of the primitive races , their moral differences , and their co*xistence on the same soil ; and the question even of the historic method , considered with reference to that form and style which I had recently been attacking in my Letters on the History of France . What I had counselled I wished to put in practice ; at my own peril , I wished to make trial of my theory . In short , I was ambitious to he the exemplar of an Art as well as of a Science ; to he dramatic by means of materials which a sincere and scrupulous learning should supply . I set myself to work with a zeal proportionate to the difficulties of the enterprise. ** What makes M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fervid and imaginative temperament always impels to persevering labor . He informs us how he went from library to library ; " from Sainte Genevit*ve to the Arsenal , from the Arsenal to the Institute ; " in winter , disregarding the freezing atmosphere of some unwarmed ancient gallery , and in summer , patient under the mid-day sun . He describes this part of an author 's life with equal poetry and graphic truth . " The weeks and months , as they rolled rapidly by , saw me in the midst of these preparatory researches , where I was met by none of the thorny discouragements of composition ; where the spirit , hovering over the materials which it is gathering , builds and rebuilds at its pleasure , and constructs with a breath the ideal model of the edifice which , sometime later , must be reared piece by piece , slowly and laboriously . . . . By dint of devouring long folio pages to extract a single phrase , and , in some cases , a single word , out of a thousand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for which I can not account ; that of reading , as it were , by intuition , and of falling almost immediately on the passage that ought to have an interest for me . The vital force seemed to concentrate itself towards a single point . In the species of ecstasy which absorbed all my internal faculties , while my hand was turning over the leaves of the volume , or putting down notes , I had no consciousness of what passed around me . The table at which I was seated was crowded with books and relieved of them , the officials of the library and curious visitors came and went through the hall ; I heard nothing , I saw nothing ; - I saw only the apparitions called up in my soul by what I read . The recollection is still impressed on me ; and since that era of early labor , it has never been my fortune to have so vivid a perception of the personages of my drama , of those men , so contrasted in race , manners , feature , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some chanting to the Celtic harp the never ending expectation of the return of Arthur , others guiding their barks through the tempest with as little care for themselves as the swan that sports on the lake ; others , in the intoxication of victory , heaping up the spoil won from vanquished foes , measuring the land with a line in order to a regular partition , and counting over captive families by the head as so many cattle ; others again , deprived by a single defeat of all that made life of any value , seeming either to submit with resigned patience to the sight of strangers seated as masters at their own firesides , or running in frantic desperation to the forest , to live there as wolves live , in rapine , slaughter , and freedom . " Then follows a beautiful picture of friendship , - of that refined communion of intellect ns well as soul , the capability of enjoying which , more perhnps than any other attribute , is the distinction and the privilege of those whom the combined influences of nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next passage in his life is as full of interest and instruction as any thing that precedes . " Thus passed the year 1821 , whose most trifling incidents have a charm for me as I recall them , perhaps because this year answers , in the mysterious union which was then forming between the author and his work , to the first month , the sweetest month , of marriage . I entered , in 1822 , on a period of toil harsher and less attractive ; I began to write . Here it is , indeed , - in this realm where Fancy no longer bears rule , but , in its stead , calculating Thought , - in this intellectual process , by which we endeavor to make clear to the eyes of others objects // that we have seen very clearly ourselves , - it is here that weariness and chagrin meet the writer . The difficulty of finding an outward form for the ideal work generated in my mind was the greater because I rejected , with a deliberate purpose , the assistance which ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reproduce in my history either the manner of the philosophers of the last century , or that of the chroniclers of the Middle Ages , or even ( whatever my admiration of them ) that of the narrative writers of antiquity . I proposed to myself a sort of composite method , by which , if my strength should be adequate , I might unite to the epic movement of the Greek and Roman historians , at once the simplicity of coloring of the legendary style , and the severe reason of the moderns . " The History of the Conquest was finished and published in 1825 . Some idea of the general conception to which the author has here given body and form , is furnished by the quotations we have been making . Perhaps no reader of the history stood in want of such explanation . Yet the mere title unquestionably suggests a quite inadequate notion of the nature of the work ; and a person with no other understanding of it than this gives , might be excused for the surprise which he should manifest , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates denoting that this , which purports to be a history of the Norman Gon quest of England , extends over a space of time measured in centuries . He would be tempted to exclaim , Hoxv is this ? Does not every schoolboy know , that Duke William won the battle of Hastings , and changed his coronet into a crown , in the year of our Lord one thousand and sixty-six ? True ; but M. Thierry proceeds to tell us , what every schoolboy does not know , that when the bones of the great bastard had long been ruouldering in the too narrow vault which his sons had purchased for the last resting-place of him who bore the title of Lord of England , Normandy , and Bretagne , the conquest begun by that crafty head and potent arm was still unfinished ; that , for generations thereafter , the Celts , the Saxons , and the Northmen were not fused together , but co*xisted as separate and rival races and that many subsequent political commotions , as to whose causes philosophers have been disputing with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be referred to the continuing struggle of those ancient and forgotten , yet most mighty elemeats . The best description of the work is the summary one 28 * // which the author himself has given ; - English history considered in the light of the conquest ; and we have in this enough to account for its most striking pec'uliarities . Whatever may he thought of the plan in other respects , it has some obvious advantages . Before the author 's strength has been wearied , or his imagination dulled , by toiling through details , he surveys the whole field , as Descartes surveyed the heavens , with the eye of genius . At once , a theory flashes on his mind . He seizes and retains it , and , after some necessary modifications , takes it with him through his subsequent labors . It is his guide , - a ready-drawn outline , that le*ives him nothing further to do than to find materials for the filling up and the coloring . That part of his duty which ordinarily occasions the historian most embarrassment is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first hand , he is contented to serve as a mechanical annalist , and to jot down notes for the benefit of a successor . The discriminating faculty needs tasking to its utmost . If we suppose all that is false and mistaken got rid og how shall the trivial be discerned ? That which he is anxiously seeking , not mere truth , but important truth , is whimsical and has a very Protean taste in costume . Now , it hides under rags ; again , it is present , where one would still less expect it , amidst the pompous inanities of a court pageant . M. Thierry escapes all this perplexity . He carries with him from the start a test which informs him , with prompt and unerring fidelity , what must be taken and what passed by . Nothing is inserted doubtfully or at random ; there is a reason for every sentence . The narrative is no patchwork of ill-fitting fragments . We who read are in danger neither of being jarred by conflicting statements , nor of having to plod through the morass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the author 's care to take no fact which does not agree with and illustrate it . Hence the work is symmetrical , duly developed in every part , like a piece of statuary . In short , according to this method , the choice of materials is no longer left to the hesitating and unequal decision of judgment , but is given over to the determination of taste , - a faculty which acts instinctively and harmoniously . But the inquiry meets us , - nor is it undeserving of consideration , - how far can this be called the true method of writing history ? // It would be neither just nor expedient to require of the historian , that he should enter on each investigation with a perfectly unbiased mind . If history has a philosophy , it is a science . They , then , who devote themselves to it have a right to the privileges of other scientific laborers . Now , no discovery , or rather none of those grand generalizations that have shed a lustre on the path of science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that path . Bold conjecture , not less than careful experiment , is an essential part of that process which now , as heretofore , is most promising of great results . We are accustomed to talk of the historian 's duty to set down facts accurately and faithfully ; yet in truth , historians , in every case , at least , where they are not dealing with contemporary events , encounter no facts , but a host of statements in regard to which it is a question whether they be facts or not . At each step , a problem appears before even the most humble historian , and as he hurries onward in quest of the solution , he experiences all the exhilarating influence which accompanies the effort to solve any problem . No matter whether our writer be engaged on the annals of an empire or of a village ; no matter whether the doubtful point relate to a sovereign 's honor or to the longevity of a country squire ; - there is a doubt , and he constructs a theory . The theory may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , and that to a third ; and perhaps , at the close of the investigation , as much uncertainty may exist as at first . Still , the inquirer has had enjoyment , keen and exquisite . In this pleasure we may recognize the secret source of that continuing and overflowing supply of this useful species of literary production on which we remarked at the outset . The fact is quite inexplicable on the common supposition , that writers of history are a race of dull , plodding creatures ; than which , indeed , nothing is farther from the truth , for no class of men whatever includes more enthusiasts . But do we not find many a history lamentably unentertaining ? Undoubtedly we do ; and for the reason that the author so frequently does not know how to make us sharers of his own excitement . Instead of an account of the successive problems on which he has been engaged , he can give us but the string of dry answers which , in the nature of things , need not be much more amusing than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's game-book , severed from the charades and anagram to which they belong . Sentence follows sentei*ce , and we never suspect that the proposition in each is the result nd reward of a most animated investigation . M. Thierry , instead of thus dividing his strength among an innumerable multitude of objects , seizes such of those objects as suit his purpose and fits them in places already provided in his scheme . *aking all the minute hypotheses which , in their single and unconnected state , are adequate to enliven the toil of the common historian , he makes them member* of one grand hypothesis . His history differs from theirs in the s me way that Caleb Williams differ* from a bundle of magazine stories . There is another and more important view to be taken of this subject . History - meaning by the term , all events collected - can afford us , on mere ohserv'stion , no more distinct and comprehensive understanding than a *avage has of the movement of the heavenly bodies , or of electrical and chemi* cal phenomena . In complexity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact with fact , a wo1id of pure matter can not be compared to one in which there are not only material agents at work , but appetites and passions , - spiritual forces indefinite , innumerThle , and of endless diversity . So there is good reason why this universal life , this aggregate of millions of individual existences , should appear a chaos to eny one who , raising himself out of the moving mass , pauses to contemplate its heaviags . Yet , as in the grosser world there are uniformities which strike the rudest observer , so there are in the other or moral world , though far less marked , constant , and numerous . We are able to recognize , at least , that the confusion does not result from the absence of cause , but from the presence of a multitude of intermingling causes , which at times combine in the production of phenomena , at times meet in direct antagonisrri . But how are these countless agencies to he separated ? And these compound effects , by what method may they be apportioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question will be the Philosophy of History . The difficulty once clearly discerned , we are in a condition to appreciate the attempt which has been made towards its solution by the school of which , we suppose , M. Augustin Thierry may b considered a found*r , as he is confessedly one // of its brightest ornaments . The process they adopt is something like this : In history , and even in the limited portion of the living universe that comes beneath our immediate observation , certain uniform sequences may be distinguished . One of these is expressed in the proverb , - like father , like son . This hereditary succession of physical and mental qualities is not invariable ; yet the probability of resemblance , appreciable in any particular case , becomes much stronger and more manifest when we apply it to a community ; and the fact that the doctrine receives additional confirmation the broader and more general we make it , is unquestionable proof that it is founded in nature - that it is , in the scientific sense , a law , or intimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that descends from generation to generation , and undergoes little change at any one step . Now , say Thierry and his associates , this individualized aggregate , which has the attribute of possessing character , - this organic existence , Nation , ( from natus , born , and implying descent from a common ancestry , ) does not mean the collection of human beings that may chance to be spread over some given section of the earth 's surface , - over this island , or that peninsula , or which we may find dwelling under a certain common government . No , they urge ; the races of men are what the philosopher must look to . For so much of the way the process is mainly inductive ; but the other logical engine now comes into play . Towards the close of the eleventh century , there were in England , it can not be questioned , at least three distinct races . From previous records we derive a tolerably clear conception of their several characters ; and we know that the relations in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were such as would naturally make them tend to act in different ways . Here , then , we have certain forces ; and if they are adequate to the production of the phenomena we afterwards meet , why not consider them the causes of those phenomena ? To take an example : the controversy between Becket and Henry II. , which shook England and all Christendom , is one of the most interesting , and perhaps most obscure , events in medheval history . We see a man who was lifted from the dust by the mere I ) leasure of the powerful monarch whose wrath he now braves , stand his ground in the contest // like an equal , and this without having at any time the very hearty support of the Hierarch whose battle he is ostensibly fighting . The chronicles inform us , too , of concurrent insurrections throughout England ; the very throne seemed to he rockin * , . That the danger was not unreal is put beyond doubt by the conduct of Henry himself , both in the submissions he made during Becket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he descended after his death . Thierry discerns in all this the Saxons rising and making common cause with the stubborn priest , whose triumph they believed to have a connection with their own relief . The records of the times seem to give much countenance to the explanation , and our assent is quite independent of the fact , alleged by Thierry on perhaps insufficient grounds , that Becket was himself of Saxon origin . But the same reign furnishes another remarkable opportunity for our author 's application of his theory . Henry 's continental subjects were no more homogeneous than his English ones ; and far less tranquil were they under his rule . In Bretagne , and especially in the Provinces stretching towards the Mediterranean , the standard of revolt was continually rising . The insurgents had always in their camp one or another of the King 's headstrong sons . These wars have usually been treated as mere family quarrels ; yet so unnatural does it seem that children should wantonly take up arms against a father at once kind and sagacious , that chroniclers and minstrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafty and malignant tempter , Bertrand de Born , the famous Troubadour . Men , however , even bad and unscrupulous men , do not commonly act like devils from the mere love of mischief ; and Bertrand must be supposed to have had some deeper motive . Though an accomplished courtier , he belonged to the subjugated Celtish stock . From such data , it is not strange that Thierry should infer that this person was actuated by a stern , reflectin* patriotism , and that his efforts were accompanied and made important by the instinctive struggles of a people restless under a foreign yoke . Bertrand appears to him a man devoting all his wonderful powers , in the spirit of savage heroism , to one object - and that the freedom of his country , to be effected by sowing disseusion among its lords . The character of the Celts is // plausibly adduced as favoring the hypothesis , - a people brave enough in the field , but distinguished for a mental activity disposing them to prefer to attain an end by other means than animal force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not uncongenial . The scheme , too , of which Bertrand is supposed to have made himself the apostle , however visionary and impracticable , was one that might very well have attractions for a mind like his . To go from Frank to Norman , and from Norman to Frank , inspiring each by his artful eloquence with bitter hostility to the other ; to infuse discord into the very households of the fierce and haughty oppressors ; to arm sons against their father , brethren against each other ; to be the master spirit directing this storm of passion and crime , calmly purposing that the elements of havoc , by exhausting themselves in mutual conflict , should leave the Gallic land a peaceful abode for the old Gallic race , - such a scheme , it is not difficult to believe , might readily suggest itself to a mind deficient in moral balance , but full of enthusiasm and conscious energy . It would seem that no fairer occasion could he found to exemplify the theory which reduces history to a conflict of races , and to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not confirm the speculations of our historian . The authorities he himself cites , and the sources of information thrown open by the diligence of the Benedictine historiographers , leave little room for doubting that the old view is the more correct ; so far as the domestic broils which embittered the declining years of the first Plantagenet were not merely the enacting on a royal stage of those scenes of senseless and unnatural bickering which are too familiar in ordinary life to provoke either the notice or the reprobation they deserve , they are accounted for by the evident interest which the French king had in breaking the power of his overgrown vassal . The Troubadour was rather a tool than a governing spirit . Yet if this part of M. Thierry 's history fails to command our entire assent to its philosophy , it has other qualities which deserve unstinted praise . Let those who , in Lord Littleton , and even in flume , have been unable to appreciate the romantic brilliancy of the reign of Henry II. , read the narrative of our author , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The closing events of the old monarch 's // 332 April , life , the death-scene of his eldest son , Henry Fitz-Henry , as the chroniclers sometimes style him ; the storming of the castle of Hautefort ; the capture of Bertrand , and his appearance before the King , when , in sight of the axe and the block , and all the apparatus of death , the hardy Provensal , who had boasted that " he was master whenever he pleased of King Henry and his sons , " is asked with a bitter taunt what plea he can offer for his life ; the answer of eloquent simplicity and deep art , which turns that hour of hopeless extremity into one of triumph , - all these incidents , each so striking in itself , produce such an effect by their combination that , but for the references and citations in the margin , one can hardly be persuaded that they are historic realities . Nowhere , perhaps , could a better groundwork be found for a historical play . So rapidly do events crowd on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infringement of truth , to adhere to the strictest rule of the unities while the characters , female and male , are so strongly marked and admirably contrasted , that they might be taken from history directly to the theatre . Yet he will be a rash man who shall attempt , though with the assistance of poetic diction and of all the machinery of the drama , to follow M. Thierry . The consideration . of these two instances , and especially of the second , shows very plainly why it is , that the theory of this school of French historians can not be adopted as a theory , however it may be recommended by talent and laborious research . It is inadequate . There are other and independent forces , besides those it includes . The phenomena are far too complex to be so readily analyzed . And even if a nation 's history were nothing more than the result of the action of the several races composing it , the investigation would still be attended with very great difficulties . The phenomenon , reduced to this simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical type ; the elements mingled together produce , not a compound of distinguishable parts , but a new thing with attributes of its own . You can not put a nation into a retort or a crucible . The objection may also be raised , that these very races , which we are told to keep our eyes upon , are not simple elements . This , it is true , might easily be answered , if it could be shown that the law of union alters at the point where races are combined to constitute peoples . // Mineralogy , it can he urged , is a science as well as chemistry . Without being able to analyze quartz , felspar , and mica , or knowing how much silicium , aluminum , &amp;c. , they contain , we may recognize that the three together constitute granite . So likewise , quartz , felspar , and hornhlende in mechanical union make up syenite . These two rocks thus differ with respect to their third constituent . If , now , one whose knowledge goes no farther than this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would he guided at once to the inference that this is the descriptive name of quartz , feispar , and mica , the ingredients of granite , in combination with hornblende , the distinguishing ingredient of syenite ; and he may have , besides , a tolerably accurate notion of the appearance and general character of this yet unseen formation . If we are sure that a certain nation is composed of the race A , and the race B , and the race C ; that a second nation consists of A , B , and D ; and finally , that a third consists of A , B , C , and D , - why should we not be able , from a knowledge of the two first nations , to draw correct inferences as to the character and history of the third ? Because ( if for no other reason ) the analogy fails at the critical point ; when races mingle , they mingle chemically . This last truth does more than show an insuperable difficulty in the practical use of the theory ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophically and in the abstract , the theory is vicious . In other words , it would seem that , if we are to make a science of history , we must resort to some other principle of analysis , and that this one , so far from being an assistance , leads us aside into fruitless labors . But coming down from speculative dreams , which there is very little hope of our ever seeing realized , to the particular subject matter of M. Thierry 's work , the general history of the English people , it is of consequence to know whether , without regard to the point of view from which he looks , he has seen the objects themselves correctly . What is the ongin of that nation whose destiny it seems to be to fill the vacant places of the whole earth ? How much does it owe of its energetic qualities to one of its two sources , and how much to the other ? If we take the records , and trace its annual course from the eleventh century down , we shall find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race which came over VOL . LXXII. - NO. i*i. 29 // with William lost the controlling influence which it plainly possessed immediately after the conquest . On the other hand , the Saxons can not have disappeared . Impressed with both facts , one is tempted to think of the Anglo-Saxon people as a bulky carcass , into which the Norman elements entered as a quickening soul . Some would remove the wonder by telling us that , in our sense of the word , there was no conquest at all and that William ascended the English throne simply as Edward 's lawful successor , - a procedure much like that which takes place when , under the feudal system of inheritance , the lands of John Stiles fall at his death to his twentieth cousin , to the total exclusion of his brothers of the halfblood , which event , though not altogether accordant with our notions of fitness and right , we yet never think of calling a tyrannous usurpation . We can not bring ourselves to any such belief . There may have been no complete conquest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a conquest , properly so called , and overwhelming as a deluge , did at some time occur , we have irrefragable proof . Recognizing the conquest to the fullest extent , Thierry has not permitted himself to believe that the suhjugated people can have yielded to their fate without many an impatient struggle . It is natural to expect that the hardy race of freebooters , whose standard of the war-horse had been a signal of terror to every shore on which it had been planted , would not sink at the first command into submissive slavery . Not one of us hut must have looked for some displays of heroism by them ; but we look in vain for one great and earnest effort made by them to redeem the name and the fortunes of their race . Thierry feels and confesses a high admiration for Scott , who , for reach and penetrating acuteness of vision , is the standing shame of most historians . And an aggravation of the shame it might appear , that a romance writer should show a more ready appreciation of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and events , than those whose business and profession it is to be faithful limners . Yet to this length of censure it is not right to go . No man is hound to equal Shakspeare , nor to equal Scott . It is possible , however , for the historian to take profitable lessons from both . This M. Thierry has done . But it is evident that he who follows a winged guide must needs have a strong and // discriminating head . Scott has little occasion even to see things as they are , much less to represent them to us as they are . When he encounters a chasm , romance lifts him over in impunity ; while the historian , his follower , who can not soar , must halt on the brink , or proceed at his peril . If Scott 's picture is often as faithful a copy of the reality as any picture can be , it is because the true events and characters have more romantic interest than any that could be substituted for them . At the very time that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that historians have been blind to , he has thrown a gorgeous veil over much that the historian ought both to perceive and exhibit Truth and brilliant falsehood are mingled in the composition of all his romances , and in what the merit of them lies we shall find out when we begin to examine , whether those that are confessedly the greatest possess also the largest share of the former element Take The Talisman ; - what more fascinating and delightful narrative I But has it the qualities of history ? In its scenes and incidents , it must be admitted to have little more claim to credibility than the adventures of the Caliph Haroun Alraschid , as detailed by that renowned , but not over-veracious story-teller Scheherazade . And as to the characters , would the Crusaders recognize the portrait of their leader , and the Saracens that of their terrible foe ? Is this Richard , the Lion-heart  --  the chivalrous knight  --  the self-denying captain  --  the generous friend - the ci. - ment lord  --  the same that the chronicles ( Thierry himself their interpreter ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most savage exemplar of a savage age , - a being whose hard and cruel nature is scarcely caricatured in the ballads which tell us that when the monster was hungry , the choice morsel for which he first shouted was a fat Saracen babe ? The Betrothed was published along with the Talisman , whose shelter it much needed , said Constable ; and readers and critics , even the author himself , have agreed with the shrewd publisher in the opinion of its inferiority . Yet according to our judgment , - and we know not that many , on consideration , will differ from us , - out of the whole list of the Waverly romances , none can be pointed out as a more truthful representation of the times of which it treats . There is one of Scott 's works which must have a particular attraction for the historian of the conquest ; and we were not // surprised to find a spirited analysis of Ivanhoe constituting a portion of this volume . We have no need to go further for a very good illustration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can discern that Ivanhoe contains among its dramatis person*e one who may very well stand as a type of the Anglo-Saxon race ; hut his view and ours do not fall on the same individual . if we are right , this representative of the body arid substantial groundwork of the English character is not the choleric , high-spirited Thane of Rotherwood , feeding on the memory of the days of Hengist and Horsa ,  --  not Wilfred , winning the respect of the Normans by adapting himself to their customs , and excelling them at their own warlike arts - not Robin Hood , the gentle highwayman , who plundered the rich to feed the poor - nor yet Athelstane the Unready , ( though he comes nearer , ) who deemed an unstinted supply of venison-pasties , not too strongly flavored with garlic , almost a full satisfaction for captivity . None of these , but the swineherd Gurth is the true type of his race ; and next to Gurth , we should turn to Fangs . Indeed , man and dog ought to be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a noted race well exemplified , - a nature with propensity enough to vice , and some of whose virtues even have quite a vicious aspect ; yet a nature which is the foundation of all that is most valuable in the English character and in ours . We see the Saxon all before us , with a temper tough as his weather-beaten hide , bowing his shoulder obediently to the heaviest burden , never answering a blow till the smart is gone , yet clingin0 to property with unflinching tenacity , enduring hardship with a patience that is sullen , and in the most prosperous times giving little other expression of complacency than a surly growl . Not a particle does he possess of that spirit which has kept the races of the Celtic stock distinct and unsubdued for so many ages in the fastnesses of Wales , in the Irish hoes , and in the misty valleys of the Scottish highlands . The Celt , with many of the qualities of poetry and romance , resists all influences , and retains to the last some portion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , his original barbarism ; the Saxon , quite destitute of the heroic virtues , has few claims on romance , yet so it is that he has won of history a notice such as all the Celts on earth can not obtain . // It is a truth which we are too often disposed to forget , that the passive virtues are those which have most to do with national well-being . The value of these virtues being recognized , it is of little moment whether we attribute them to ori* , inal organization , or to circumstances , or - which is probably most correct - to both influences . The epitome of English history , as we should state it , is very brief and simple . Our race now bears liberty well because it has been trained in endurance , and has profited by it . The people , the AngloSaxons , never could forget , while they were engaged in any contest with their sovereign , that there was another power in the state which they could not choose but regard with awe , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their immediate lord , the Norman noble , they learned to bear the additional measure of freedom allowed them from time to time by their king , without being betrayed into an insolence which is its own destruction . They took what was given them , never rejecting any thing because they could not get more . Yet whatever they received , they kept fast hold of ; their stubborn tenacity surpassed , if possible , their patience . All this , perhaps , would not have brought that about which we see , had not Providence mercifully provided against their getting free from both their masters at once . When the feudal baron fell , unsmitten by any hand but his own , the sceptre was in no feeble grasp . History can scarcely show us another race of princes like the Tudors . During the reigns of the two Henrys and of Elizabeth , England made a vast advance in constitutional liberty ; and that advance , though apparent enough to us , was so gradual , that at the time it was makin most keen-sighted statesmen did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady pace , never breaking into a run , nor even a leap . Yet it by no means follows , that Nil . Thierry is to be blamed for constructing his history on an hypothesis , because we are not satisfied that his hypothesis is capable of philosophical verification . A vigorous thinker of our day , whose work is a guide to investigation in every science , well vindicates hypotheses in physics from the undiscriminating censure of those who are anxious to be accounted Baconians of the strictest sect . Such hypotheses are systems of classification , which connect together the separate facts we obtain , and in this way * // are a very important assistance to tbe discovery of the law , or true natural method . Indeed , tbe bypothesis is not always useless , even after we know the law . For example , we are now very well assured that the earth is not the centre of the universe ; yet astronomy does not disdain , for some of its purposes , to make use of the supposition . A similar justification may he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of association , to join together events upon whose real , philosophical relations we may vainly speculate forever , and which otherwise must he disconnected and comparatively useless . They render no mean service merely as helps to memory . In continued analogy to the case of a physical science , hypotheses are more useful in the history of ohscure periods than of those which are recent and better known . They assist the mind across those dark medieval wastes , and relieve it from the exhaustion on the one hand , which must be the consequence of attemptin* , to obtain a more definite and exact notion , and from that state of blank inapprehension on the other , in which it passes with closed eyes over every thing , because it is able thoroughly to understand nothing . They are not unlike panoramas , which we do not expect to find as accurate as a minute geographical description , but which convey to us , better than the geography , a conception of the general aspect of nature , and especially of her grander features . lit is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do not so mean it ; yet there is other and higher praise to which he is fairly entitled , - for , after all , whatever importance a historian may attach to his philosophical theories , that quality to which he will owe his most permanent fame is the effectiveness of his narrative . This may seem a humble phrase , yet it comprehends that graceful style , that vivid portraiture of men , that dramatic representation throwing audible voices into the printed page , that orderly arrangement , itself the gift either of genius or of the very highest art , that whole array of qualities , each of which gives the historian high distinction , and which , when united , insure him immortality . We do not wish these remarks to be taken as an attempt towards a critical estimate of the History of the Conquest . We began this article merely with the view of giving some // extracts from an interesting volume little known on this side of the Atlantic , and of connecting them together by a few passing comments . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is difficult to resist the temptation which it presents to a wider range of discourse . We do resist as well as we may , and , without pretending to assign M. Thierry 's history its proper station as compared with other historical works , or even to decide between the rival claims of its own several excellencies , we would simply say that the author has been more successful in one of the two purposes with which he started than in the other . It was his aim , as we have seen , to make his work a tribute both to a science and to an art . Perhaps there was an incompatibility in the two services ; at all events , it seems that the votary , though sincerely persuaded that he was all the time paying his chief homage to the severer and more spiritual goddess , yielded up his heart from the first to the fascinations of the beautiful occupant of the other , and , as he chooses to esteem it , lower shrine . That M. Thierry has given us a model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has laid an unexceptionable foundation for the science of history we are constrained to doubt . We would not deny that there are facts which go far to countenance the view of those who refuse to look at history except in connection with ethnology. *1Uhe case of the Jews indeed , which is most referred to , is so unique that , instead of building a system on it , we should rather incline to the old-fashioned faith which regarded it as a standing miracle in fulfilment of prophecy . It is quite unnecessary to have recourse to this peculiar instance to establish the truth , that a race may preserve its characteristics for a considerable length of time . The Irish stand forth in proof ; and it was the contemplation of this people , ( who have a natural connection with a work on the conquests which have taken place in Britain , ) that probably led M. Thierry to rely upon his hypothesis more than he would otherwise have done . We have no disposition to undervalue ethnological truths ; not only are they intrinsically of importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Yet we do object to making history merely the illustration of ethnolo0y . Ethnological facts , undoubtedly , have sometimes a strong bearing upon history ; and of these the historian must take note , as he does of any other important // 340 April , facts . He will find it difficult to discern them , for , when they are thus influential , they stand out strongly marked and unmistakable ; whenever they are not plainly visible , the historian may safely conclude that it is not worth his while to spend much time in searching for them . The task of such recondite investigation had better he left in the hands of the physiologists , to whom it belongs of right , and whose zeal , though recently kindled , and perhaps productive as yet of no very solid results , has brought to light facts sufficiently curious and remarkable to give them a fair claim to 11 the honor that may attend future discoveries . In running over the outline which M. Thierry gives us of his ten years ' labors , the necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not especial reference to English history , notwithstanding their intrinsic value . We can not now leave the hook , however , without recapitulating , aside from any purpose of criticism , a few additional facts in the author 's life as here detailed . His history , immediately on its appearance , procured him a reputation surpassing his hope . But this joy , he plaintively adds , great though it was , had a full and a sad counterpoise . He had bought fame at the price of sight . His own description of the on-coming of his malady , and of the resistance made to it by scholarly enthusiasm , is so poetic that we can not pass it by . The great task ended , and having become , as he tells us , incapable of reading , he thou ht at last of repose . Notwithstanding the employment of the most powerful remedies , his sight continued to decline , and as the last prescription of medicine , he was directed to travel . He went to Provence , where his old friend , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a work on the early history of southern France , joined him . " Compelled to idleness , " he continues , " I followed my laho. rious companion from city to city , and watched him , not without envy , as he plunged into libraries and collections of old public records to examine every relic of the past . It was thus we occupied many months in traversing Provence and Languedoc . Myself not in a condition to read , - I do not say a manuscript , but the most beautiful inscription on stone , - I still endeavored to derive some benefit from these journeys by studyin* , on the mon uments themselves , the history of the architecture of the middle // ages . I had just sufficient sight to guide my steps ; but when I stood in presence of the edifices or ruins from whose inspection an epoch was to be recognized and a style determined , I know not what internal sense came to the aid of my eyes . Quickened and inspired by what I am willing to call the historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the principal lines , not a single characteristic trait , escnped me ; and the readiness of my coup d'ceil , so uncertain in ordinary circumstances , was a cause of surprise to my attendants . Such are the last perceptions that the sense of sight has given me . One year after , this remnant of joy , so limited and yet of which I had so exquisite an appreciation , was no more allowed me . Sight was all gone . " But his indomitable zeal was not daunted by the necessity of having recourse to the eyes and hands of others , and he engaged in fresh labors ; - like a distinguished historian of our own country , whose resolute contest with a similar affliction has caused us to follow his subsequent course with a more earnest sympathy , and to feel a prouder joy in the triumphs which have crowned it . He undertook , in association with Mignet , a sort of compilation in mosaic-work of original chronicles relating to the history of France , from the fifth to the seventeenth century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they both at length became convinced , it was necessary to abandon . Thea lie published , in a connected form and with thorough revision , his Lettres sur l'hlistoire de France . Afterwards , he thought to join his brother , M. Am6d*e Thierry , in a great national work which should fully unfold and exhibit the origin of the French people . It seems characteristic of M. Thierry to bestow ready praise , untinc-. tured with the least jealousy , upon all his fellow laborers ; but of this brother he delights to speak in terms of the most loyal affection and pride . He warmly tells us what real pleasure the contemplation of this fraternal league afforded him , and how exhilarating and pure was the hope that , by means of it , " the names of both might be carved into the double base on which the edifice of their nation 's history should permanently rest . " Am6d*e Thierry accomplished his part in giving to the world the History of the Gauls ; the other brother , whom we have been following , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was met by an obstacle worse than blindness , and too strong // even for his courageous energy . He had encountered that other calamity , so appalling to most men , without dismay ; he had " made friendship with darkness . " But now , acute pain , attended by prostration of strength , declared the presence of a nervous malady of a serious nature . He was constrained to acknowledge himself vanquished , and this statement closes the account of these ten important years . " Since then , " he adds , " I have found no more like them , and have only been able to glean here and there a few hours of labor among long days of suffering . " It is fitting that we should leave NI . Thierry to tell us in his own words what lesson is to be drawn from his life . That he should use the tone of a man proudly conscious that he has a right to hold forth his example for imitation , can not be thought unpardonable in one who has toiled so faithfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible that the ardor of his temperament , stimulated by the applause of sympathetic friends , the truly national and Gallic cast of his mind , and , more than all , an earnest , continued , and unre-. served devotion to a single aim , may have led him in some measure unduly to magnify his office , and to assign to it a relative importance which we , surveying objects with senses not obscured by so great an elevation , are able to perceive is excessive - still , far from us be any inclination to captious disparagement ; rather let us frankly and cordially declare what an honor it is to any nation that it contains M. Thierry . We may profitably take his exhortation home to ourselves , well knowing that the example set by him and those like him must kindle emulation somewhere* and reckoning it a shame that , while the nations of the Old World are producing such men in what we call their decrepitude , America , in the very prime of its strength , should appear to be giving birth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take pleasure in believing , the interest of science is to be counted in the number of great national interests , I bave given to my country all that the soldier gives it who leaves a limb on the field of battle . Whatever be the destiny of my works , this example , I trust , will not be lost . I would have it serve to combat that species of moral enfeeblement which is the disease of the new generation ; - I would have it lead back into the right path of life some one of those enervated souls who bewailing their // want of faith , and uncertain on what to lay hold , come seeking everywhere and find nowhere , an object of regard and service . What right have they to say , that , in a world like this , there is not air for all lungs , employment for all intellects ? Is there not here calm and serious study ? And does not this offer a refuge , a hope , a career to be run , to every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days without feeling their burden ; he is the maker of his own destiny , he uses life nobly . This I have done this I still would do . Had I to recommence my way , I should choose that path which has led me where I am . Blind , and suffering without hope , almost without respite , I can render this testimony , which , coming from me , will not be suspected - there is in the world something which is worth more than the pleasures of sense , more than fortune , more than health itself , - and this is , devotion to Science .
