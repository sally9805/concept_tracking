SYDNEY SMITH 'S SKETCHES OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY . ENGLISH books find American readers from the one circumstance of a common language , and from no especial congeniality of character between the two nations or common direction of thought . Even in New England coteries , where the mothor country is aped and loved with provincial fervor , the speculative , and speculating Yankee is the mental antipodes of the exact , routine loving Englishman . The New Englander is of pure English descent , and yet there is not a single nation of the North of Europe with which he has as little in common as with the English . Social life , as German and Swedish moralists have of late opened it to us , is in those countries , in a thousand lights and shades the daguerreotype of our own . And even the contemplative , metaphysical mind of the German race is witnessed in our own countrymen in their love of social and political " abstractions . " On the Continent , wherever political convulsions have broken up the old forms of society , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete distribution of knowledge . In France , as the class of small proprietors increases , the national literature becomes popularized . In Great Britain , literature is for men of leisure , ripe scholars , rich and highly disciplined minds , with whom the pursuit of knowledge is the occupation of their life . But with us , knowledge is sought in moments snatched from exertion ;  --  the soil is fruitful but neglected , and the seed consequently should be perfect and adapted to take in*tant root . Science must now be stripped of that veil of mystery which has so long ob*cured its fair proportions , and must be content to be robed in the habiliments of every day life . Heretofore , like the gods on Olympus , its feet have been bidden in clouds impervious to the gaze of mortals , while it only held converse with the privileged few dwelling in the higher regions . Not willingly do these yield up their power and privileges , but civilization has warmed the frozcn depths of society , and from the abyss is heard a sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caprice of fashion that changed the gorgeous and grotesque apparel of a half-barbarous age , into the simple costume of this century Perukues and powdered hair , gold lace and velvets , were discarded because men of cultured mien were found in classes who had neither the means nor the leisure to spend half of their mornings under the hands of the barber , or fortunes in personal endowment . In like manner , thought has forced its way into the ranks of those once only hewers of wood and drawers of water , and they now seek to tear from knowledge its patrician livery , and to make it free to all mankind . No where are these rubbish-barricades greater than in metaphysical science . From the obscurity of its terms , the seeker must waste years in grappling with the obscurities of its language . And yet these difficulties once overcome or partially obviated , there is no science in which the common mind can advance with such freedom and independence ; for its materials are in everyman 's breast , or to be gained in his ordinary intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater power of intellectual vision than is constantly called forth by the practical pursuits of life . In the difficulty of giving intelligible and fixed appellations to phases of mind which are not only of difficult representation , but variable and fleeting when once called up , lie the chief impediments to the diffusion of mental and moral science , and not in a peculiar demand for intellectual subtlety or reach . The disciple can always follow the master , if that 388 p. // master only knows what he means himself , and has the genius to express his meaning definitely and clearly . This merit the book before us undoubtedly possesses , whatever may be its faults in other respects . Whatsoever the author has to say , he says it boldly , in plain serviceable Saxon , and the reader is never befogged by the obscurities of intricate style , nor lost in the hopeless attempt at unfolding shadowy half-expressed ideas . From the cursory manner in which the different subjects are treated , we would have little reason to expect any thing but a bald recapitulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this , we are delighted by a hearty and manly discourse , such as Attic youth listened to long since , amid groves and academic shades . It has all the flavor and life of conversation , partaking of the warmth of the subjeets treated of , and varying in interest with them . Sometimes he becomes grave and clerical , then breaks out into dashing and jovial talk , rather startling in this phase of literature . One page will gleam with the sharpshooting of wit , another fairly tremble beneath the rolling fire of humor . All this is in good taste , and what is more to the purpose , we gain from it a hint of what is the chief deficiency in works of psychological science . In consequence of the sensuous origin of language , there are no means of treating subjects of this nature in the straightforward and precise manner so easily gained in positive science . Mankind first name objects of sense around them , and therefrom* give names , in consequence of some hidden resemblance , to purely mental processes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but between the thought and certain trains of ideas to which the object gives rise . Hence all discussion on the operations and divisions of our minds must be doubly metaphorical . If we would convey a train of ideas conceived with the utmost mathematical and logical accuracy , we are forced to do it by means of a series of similitudes which weaken , and may in other minds entirely pervert the meaning . The only way to surmount this obstacle is to pile analogy upon analogy , metaphor on mctaphor ,  --  to present the thoughtfrom ailpoints of view ,  - -  to paint it grotesque in humor , severe in wit ; with the glow of poetry , and the hardness of common-sense . This our author does , and does well , and without any great profundity this book will reach more minds and take deeper root than many a work of more learning and pretension . It will soften many of those prejudices which regarded mental and moral philosophy as the arctic region of science , chilling , lifeless , misty ; for it displays the warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater popularity of metaphysics he puts in the following plea " The existence of matter is as much a matter of fact as the existence of mind It is as true that men remcmher , as that oxygen united to carbon makes carhonic acid . I am as sure that anger and affection , are principles of the human mind , as I am that grubs make cockchafers ; or of any of these great truths which botanists teach of lettuces and cauliflowers . Those that would cast a ridicule upon metaphysics , or the intellectual part of moral philosophy , as if it were vague and indefinite in its object , must either contend that we have no faculties at all , and that no general facts are to be observed concerning them , or they must allow to this science an equal precision with that which any other can claim . " A great deal of unpopularity has been incurred by this science from the extravagances I or absurdities of those engaged in it . When the mass of mankind hear that all thought is explained by vibrations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such thing as a material world ,  --  that what mankind consider as their arms and legs , are not arms and legs , but ideas accompanied by the notion of outness ,  --  that we have not only no bodies , but no minds ; that we are nothing in short but currents of reflection and sensation ; , all this I admit , is well calculated to approximate in the public mind the ideas of lunacy and intellectual philosophy . But if it be fair to argue against a science , from the bad method in which it is prosecuted , such a mode of reasoning ought to have influenced mankind centuiies ago to have abandoned all the branches of physics as utterly hopeless . I have surely an equal right to rake up the mouldy errors of all the other sciences ; t ? reproach astronomy with its vortices ; chemistry with its philosopher 's stone ; history with its fables ; law with its cruelty and ignorance ; and , if Iwere to open the battery against medicine , I do not know where I should stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood , never slaughtered the human race as the have been slaughtered by rash and erroneous theories of medicine , " // discredit on intellectual science , his wit thus separates the chaff from the wheat . " Bishop Berkely destroyed this world in one volume octavo ; and nothing remained after his time but mind ; which experienced a similar fate from the hand of Mr. Hume in 1737 ; so that with all the tendency to destroy , there remains nothing left for destruction ; but I would fain ask , if there he any one human being from the days of Protagoras the Abderite to this present hour , who was ever for a single instant a convert to these subtle and ingenious follies ' ? Is there any one out of bedlam who doubts of the existence of matter ' ? who doubts of his own personal identity ' ? or of his consciousness ' ? or of the general credibility of memory ' ? Men talk on such subjects from ostentation , or because such wiredrawn speculations are an agreeable excerci*e to them ; but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of life to sound and sober opinions on these subjects . Errors to be dangerous must have a great deal of truth mingled with them ; it is only from this alliance that they can ever obtain an extensive circulation . From pure extravagance and genuine unmeaning falsehood , the world never has and never can sustain any mischief . It is not in our power to believe all that we please ; our belief is modified and restrained by the nature of our faculties , and by the constitution of the objects by which we are surrounded . We may believe anything for a moment , but we shall soon be lashed out of our impertinence by hard and stubborn realities . A great philosopher may sit in his 6tudy , and deny the existence of matter , but if he take a walk in the streets , he must take care to leave his theory behind him . Pyrrho said there was no such thing as pain ; and he saw no proof that there were such things as carts and wagons ; and he refused to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , three or four stout slaves , who followed their master , without following his doctrine ; and whenever they saw one of these ideal machines approaching , took him up by the arms and legs , and , without attempting to controvert his arguments put him down in a place of safety . " We do not think the position he takes as to the progress and practical utility of Moral Philosophy sufficiently high ; while , from its views as to the manner and means of its utility , we differ toto cmlo . " Some very considerable men are accustomed to hold very strong and sanguine language respectingthe important discoveries which are o be made in Moral Philosophy ; but then this appears to be the difference ; that Natural Philosophy is directed to subjects with which we are little or imperfectly acquainted ; Moral Philosophy investigates faculties we have always exercised , and passions we have always felt . Chemistry , for instance , is perpetually bringing to light fresh existences ; four or five new metals have been discovered within as many years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any suspicion ; but no man that I know of , pretends to discover four or five new passions , neither can anything very new be discovered of those passions and faculties with which mankind are already familiar . We are , in natural philosophy , perpetually making discoveries of new properties in bodies with whose existence we have been acquainted for centuries : Sir James Hall has just discovered that lime can be melted by carbonic acid ; but who hopes that he can discover any new flux for avarice ' ? or any improved method of judging , and com-paring ' ? " But these new elements in positive science have been all along known to the senses , but only in the way the senses act , and in combination with other elements . Observation and reflection separate each element from the other principles of matter , and then present it for cognition by the senses in its pure unmixed state . In like manner , the consciousness has no knowledge of our passions and faculties except as a whole , no matter how complex they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their conditions , each combination is resolved into its constituent parts , and each part then held up to the consciousness for appreciation . If this can be done , surely the insight it will give us into the vices , foibles and virtues of men , will constitute a species of knowledge far above all wisdom that men have hitherto heaped up , and a dim reflection in its penetration of the piercing vision of God . " There may , indeed , " he says , " be speculative discoveries made with respect to the human mind ; for instance , Mr. Dugald Stewart contends that attention be classified among our faculties . Now , if attention be a faculty , it is certainly a discovery , for nobody had ever so classed it before Mr. Stewart ; but whether it be so , or only a mode of other faculties , it is of no consequence in practice ; for nobody has ever been ignorant of the importance and efficacy of attention , whether it be one thing or whether it be the other . " // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a knowledge of its true function would throw much light upon the course to be followed in its education . For instance in the study of mental science , power of abstraction , or attention , and vigor of the generalizing faculty are both necessary . Should attention be a primitive form of the mind , and not a mere mode of the reasoning faculty we would hardly plunge at once into the turbid depths of metaphysics , but gradually strengthen the mind to the required pitch by turning it to those studies in which little generalization is necessary , but which require a certain degree of abstraction ; and , at the same time , by a parallel course cultivating the reflection by pusruits , calling for only a moderate degree of concentrated thought . But if attention be , as we suspect , a faculty that operates on the emotions , passions , and desires , as well as the intellect , then we have before us an element of enormous weight in all estimates of human character , and so far from . a knowledge of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be no clear comprehension of the workings of the human soul without admitting this or a similar independent power . As an instance of the manifestation of this faculty , and in proof of the usefulness of a knowledge of mental science , we would mention a fact stated by medical writers concerning the different treatment of insanit4 ' in different nations . Amon* the French , melancholy , or monomania , is often cured by the removal of the individual from the scenes and external causes of his malady . Among the Germans such a course is sure to aggravate the disease . The French are deficient in power of concentrated attention , while the Germans possess this characteristic in a marked degree . Now , if attention be only a mode of intellect , then it gives no explanation of this singular fact ; but if it be a distinct faculty , we obtain at once a clue to the whole phenomena , and a new principle is established for discriminative treatment in individual cases . It would produce a fixedness of emotion , a dwelling not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the external world would seem dim and dream-like , leaving nothing real but the exaggerated conceptions of a diseased fancy . The sufferer in this case carries his world with him , and may change his skies but not the agony that rends his soul ; while distance only adds fuel to the imagination . Here the actual cautery of habit is a severe , but the only remedy . But where there is a deficiency of this faculty , the character takes its hue from the circumstances and events of the moment ; and by leaving behind the exciting causes , new scenes and events soon displace mental confusion and uproar . What our author says of the efficiency of this science as a mentul discipline should be received with a degree of caution . The same mental processes are exercised as fully in the ordinary occupations of men . Not only the judge , the advocate , the politician , the preacher , but every man in the varied exigencies of life , call into play the same intellectual powers as the metaphysician . Besides , we doubt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of character , which can only be gained in the actual battle of life . If we would acquire constraint of our volitions , and the manliness of self-control , we can only do it by mixing in the strife and temptations of the world . But the bow may be kept too long bent ,  --  the tension may become too great , and then the complete rest from more distracting thoughts afforded by the absorption of mental science , is welcome and useful . The soul of man , torn by care , ambition , passion , folds its wings on the shores of intellect , and sleeps . The following will commend itself to the reader , in these days when opinion is a power above all laws , the Fate above Jove ; - when a vague and ill-defined maxim will convulse a continent , and warring abstractions rend an empire in twain . " Next to this we have the abuse of words , and the fallacy of associations ; compared with which , all other modes of misconducting the understanding are insignificant and trivial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you prepared to give a clear account of words which you use so positively , and by the help of which you form opinions that you seem resolved to maintain at all hazards * Perhaps 1 should attonish many persons by putting to them such sort of questions : - Do you know what is meant by the word Nature ? Have you definite notions of Justice ? How do you explain the word chance * What is virtue * // jositions on such sort of subjects , and prepared to kill and to die in their defence . They never , for a single instant , doubt of the meaning of that which was embarras4ng to Locke , and in which Leibnitz and Descartes were never able to agree . Ten thousand people have been burned before now , or hanged , for one proposition . The proposition has no meanfl2g . Looked into and examined iii these days , it is absolute nonsense . A man quits his . country in disgust at some supposed violation of its liberties , sells his estate , and settles in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never reflected upon the meaning of the word ,  --  that he has packed up his goods and changed his country for a sound . Fortitude , justice , and candor , are very necessary instruments of happiness ; but they require time and exertion . The instruments L am now proposing to you , you must not despise ,  --  gro.mmar , definition , and interpretation - instruments which overturn the chains of logocracy in which it is so frequently enslaved . * * * * * * * There are men who suffer certain barren generalities to get the better of their undertakings , by which they try all their opinions , and make them their perpetual standards of right and wrong : as thusLet us beware of novelty ; the excesses of the people are always to be feared : or the contrary maxims - that there is a natural tendency in all governments to encroach on the liberties of the people ; or , that everything modern is probably an improvement of antiquity . Now , what can be the use of sawing about a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonist maxims 3 For , of what use is it to tell me that governors have a tendency to encroach on the liberties of the people 3 and is that a reason why you should throw yourself systematically in opposition to the government 3 What you say is very true , what you do is very foolish . The business is , to determine at any particular period of affairs , which principle is in danger of being weakened , and to act accordingly like an honest and courageous man ; not to lie like a dead weio*ht at one end of the beam , without the smalFest recollection that there is any other , and that the equilibrium will be violated alike whichever extreme shall preponderate ' * Of all the subjects discussed in this book , the lectures on Wit and Humor possess the greatest interest , not only from the acuteness with which they are treated , but as coming from one who owned a world-wide renown as the prince of humorists . We have winced beneath the sheen of his blade on this side of the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he chastised both friends and foes , at home and abroad , our national vanity has pardoned him , though he sometimes laid down his rapier with its deadly lunge , and stooped to the hammering invective of his countrymen . After sketching the various theories and definitions of wit laid down by previous writers , he gives his own hypothesis . " Observe , " he says , " I am only defining the causes of a certain feeling in the mind , called wit ; -I can no more define the feeling itself , than I can define the flavor of venison . We all seem to partake of one and the other with a very great feeling of satisfaction ; but why each feeling is what it is , and nothing else , I am sure I can not pretend to determine . " Wit he considers to arise from the surprise occasioned by the discovery of certain relations or congruities of ideas , while humor springs from a similar surprise caused by their incongruities . It must be sheer surprise , however , and unaccompanied by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as awe , compassion , anger , the sense of beauty and sublimity , diminish or completely destroy the subordinate per ception of wit . " Surprise is so essential an ingredient of wit , that no wit will bear repetition ;  - -  at least the original electrical feeling produced by any piece ot wit can never be renewed . * * * The relation discovered , must be something remote from all the common tracks and sheepwalks made in the mind ; it must not be a comparison of color with color , and figure with figure , or any comparison , which , though individually new , is specifically stale , and to which the mind has been in the habit of making many similar ; but it must be something removed from common apprehension , distant from the ordinary haunts of thoun ht , - things which are neTer brought together in the common events of life , and in which the mind has discovered relations by its own subtlety and quickness. * * * * Now , then , the point we have arrived at , at present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is the discovery of those relations in ideas which are calculated to excite surprise . But a great deal must be taken from this account of wit before it is sufficiently accurate ; for , in the first place , there must be no feeling of conviction of the utility of the relation so discovered . If you go to see a large cotton-mill , the manner in which the large water-wheel below works the little parts of the machinery seven stories high , the relation which one bears to another , // into good company . The wit of language , he says , is so miserably inferior to the wit of ideas , that it is very deservedly in bad repute . Sometimes , indeed , a pun makes its appearance which seems for a moment to redeem its species ; but we must not be deceived by them , he says : it is a radically bad race of wit . is extremely surprising to a person unaccustomed to mechanics  --  but there is a sort of rational approbation of the utility and importance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole feeling very different from that of wit . At the same time , if we attend very accurately to our feelings , we shall perceive that the discovery of any surprising relation , even of this kind , produces some slight sensation of wit . * * * * * The relation between iileas which ex- qwq meanings contained in the same phrase : for to make game of them is , by a very extravagant and laughable ignorance of words , to rank them among pheasants , partridges , and other such delicacies ; and the whole pleasure derived from the pun , consists in the discovery that two such meanings are referable to one form of expression . " This definition of wit being attacked at the time with much severity , and the objection raised that there were innumerable cases of relations of facts , which excited surprise , but not the feeling of wit , ( although there was no rational approbation to explain its absence as in the instance of the cotton-mill , ) he unconsciously leaves his first position , and is forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of power or superiority of mind . This superiority is manifested only by the perception of the relations of ideas , a province of the highest powers of the understanding , and not by the perception of the relations of facts , which is one of the lowest . There is no wit in finding a gold watch and seals hanging upon a hedge , for it is a relation of facts discovered without any effort of mind . Any man , he says , can ascertain that a calf has two heads , if it has two heads . The reverend lecturer is getting a little personal with his assailants , and must suspect the flaw in his theory . His hypothesis loses its simplicity , and becomes confused aud un8atisfaetory . Congruities of words are certainly as easily discovered as congruities of facts , and require even less of the higher powers of thought . Yet , he admits the pun as a legitimate form of wit , although of a lower This is a most inconclusive and indefinite explanation to the phenomena of punning . Every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these conditions , and yet differ very materially in the degrees of mirth they excite . Some , indeed , impress us as of the highest order of wit , while others are fairly nauseating in the contempt they inspire . Concerning Humor , our author justly rejects the hypothesis of Hobbes , who defines laughter to be " a sudden glory , arising from a sudden conception of some eminency of ourselves , by comparison with infirmity ( inferiority ) of others , or our own former infirmity . " It is true , Mr. Smith argues , the object of laughter is always inferior to us ; but then the converse is not true ,  --  that every one who is inferior to us is an object of laughter ; therefore , as some inferiority is ridiculous , and other inferiority not ridiculous , we must , in order to explain the nature of the humorous , endeavor to discover the discriminating cause . This dis . // criminating cause is incongruity , or the conjunction of objects and circumstances not usually combined . " To see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company in full uniform , and in such a wig as is worn by grave and respectable clergymen advanced in years , would make everybody laugh , for it is a complete instance of incongruity . Make this incongruous officer eighty years of age , and a celebrated military character of the last reign , and the incongruity almost entirely vanishes : I am not sure we should not be more inclined to respect the peculiarity than to laugh at it . If a tradesman of corpulent and respectable appearance , with habiliments somewhat ostentatious , were to slide down gently into the mud , and dedecorate a pea-green coat , I am afraid we should all have the barbarity to laugh . If his hat and wig , like treacherous servants , were to desert their falling master , it certainly would not diminish our propensity to laugh ; but if he were to fall into a violent pass ion , and abuse everybody about him , nobody could possibly resist the incongruity of a pea-green tradesman , very respectable , sitting in the mud , and threatening all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heightens the humor of the scene ,  - -  the gayety of his tunic , the respectability of his appearance , the rills of muddy water which trickle down his cheeks , and the harmless violence of his rage ! But if , instead of this , we observed a dustman falling into a pond , it would hardly attract attention , because the opposition of ideas is so trifling , and the incongruity so slight . ' It is seldom that we meet with as rich a union of the dramatic and the philosophical as the above , the representation of the thing itself , and along with it the acute analysis ; and , to leave out the emotion of surprise , which he interposes between the incongruity and the feeling of mirth , and to take the incongruity itself as its true conditions , we believe that it is an approach to the real theory both of wit and humor . If we examine closely into the meaning which our author attaches to the term surprise , we find that he has confounded the emotion which goes by that name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit or humor being attached to , or arising from it , with the mere suddenness with which the mind shifts from one train of ideas or feelings , to another at variance with it . Now , if we adopt the hypothesis , which our author subsequently disputes , but with little effect , that there is no huntor , but that of character , that is of emotion ( meaning thereby all those mental states which are not intellectual , ) and consider still further that wit is only another term for intellectual perception , and unattended by laughter , we may perhaps find the key of the whole mystery . In this view , the incongruity which is the condition of humor , is merely the sudden and racking revulsion from one state of feeling to another which is in some respect opposed to it . It is convulsive , often painful , even when yielding a great degree of enjoyment , and , when extreme , produces hysterical laughter . It is a harsh wrenching of the soul from its equilibrium , a sudden collapse from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all perception of character is emotional . As our author says above of the feeling of wit and flavor of venison , we can only define their conditions . The reason why we can not define them by the intellect alone is because we can not perceive them by the intellect alone . For instance in the case of the respectable tradesman in pea-green , it is his forlorn and helpless condition compared with his intense ferociousness , his piteous appealing distress still struggling with the importance of well-fed and well-feeling respectability . All this is represented on our own consciousness , and we enter intuitively into the feelings of the sufferer , but only in a slight degree , and the consequence is mirth . It may be asked why the object of our amusement is not himself convulsed with laughter since our own proceeds from a mere reflection of his feelings . But rage and agony fill his soul , and emotion does not interpenetrate emotion but in each degree commingles in proportions , the more of one the less of the other . Were his nerves of feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be manifested in the shape of a painful hysterical giggle . We believe that no instance of wit or humor , producing laughter , can be shown , in which character can not be proved to be the essential element . The scene described by our author , to refute such a theory , and considered by him as entirely devoid of " character , " appears to us to be full of it . // seen in my life was the complete overturning of a very large table , with all the dinner upon it . What of character is there of seeing a roasted turkey sprawling on the floor 3 Or ducks lying in different parts in the room , covered with trembling fragments of jelly 3 " A fortunate intimacy with these dainties veils their absurdity , but a first sight of animals served up for food would be full of caricature . When the subsequent familiarity would be removed by the novel positions into which such an accident would throw them , the mirth-producing causes would be manifest . We are feasted , reader , on roasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparison of the creature 's present helplessness with the perfect gravity and composed look with which he first looked from the tree-top , under which we afterwards ate him . Wit , then , we would consider as a confused and inaccurate term , having no distinct meaning , unless it be the old and obsolete one implying a high degree of all the powers of the understanding . There is satisfaction and even acute pleasure attending the exercise of these powers , but it is serene ; bright but cold like the upper regions of air ; while the pleasure of mirth is warm and tempestuous , like the earthdwelling emotions which are its conditions . But the intellect notices these conditions as objects , by language , as facts , and through reason . Intellectual incongruities therefore , when they refer to these objects , necessarily , but accidentally , present emotional incongruities . This view of the subject would remove the stigma which our author attaches to incongruous facts as a vehicle of humor . If these facts are the effects , or serve as the representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Words too , which are partly sensuous or founded on tones which are the natural language of emotion , often produce the effects of the highest degree of wit . Puns consequently are legitimate wit , where they are not the mere jingling of words , but present at the same time incongruous feelings . In the instance , given by our author of the boy who made game of the patriarchs by persisting in considering them partridges , the humor is found in the incongruity of the dignity belonging to that early form of au thority , with the frightened feebleness of a bevy of patriarchs cowering and quniling before the arrow of the hunter . The drollery of the thing is heightened by the contrast of the real stupidity of the boy with the cleverness which such an interpretation would attribute to him . The above hypothesis will explain the close connexion between genius and wit . As the author correctly states , almost all the great poets , orators and statesmen of all times have been witty . Cmsar , Alexander , Aristotle , Descartes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shakspeare , Demosthenes , Boileau , Pope , Dryden , Fontenelle , Jonson , Wailer , Cowley , Solon , Socrates , Dr. Johnson ; and so has been almost every man who has made a distinguished figure in the House of Commons . He considers , consequently , that wit is a strong evidence of a fertile and superior understanding . Observation will hardly bear him out in this . The humorist is not necessarily a man of genius ; but genius will often stray into the regions of humor , for when human life and human conduct hold such a large share in our knowledge and our attention , restless thought will ever delve in this mine . The wit manifested by men of intellectual ability is consequently often accidental , for , from their quickness of thought , they perceive the intellectual incongruity of jarring feeling , and thus stumble into humor . Like the pieces of flesh thrown over by the merchants into Sinbad 's vale of diamonds , so thickly the gems are strewn , that the most careless cast from the strong hand will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the lecture on wit and humor , from the reputation of the author in this respect , and from the curiosity that would be felt for the views of one who so well exemplified them in hi* writings . But as we turn over the leaves we meet every where the flavor of the Attic salt . It charms us the more through the rest of the book , from its unexpectedness , most writers on such subjects as Taste , Beauty , Instinct , or the Faculties of man and beasts , deeming it proper to pull a sort of metaphysical gown and wig over their style . Hear this " Every body possessed of power is an object either of awe or sublimity , from a justice // of the peace up to the Emperor Aurungzebean object quite as stupendous as the Alps . He had thirty-five millions of revenue , in a country where the products of the earth are , at least , six times as cheap as in England : his empire extended over twenty-five degrees of latitude , and as many of longitude : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . I should like to know the man who could have looked at Aurnngzebe without feeling him to the end of his limbs , and in every hair of his head ! Such Emperors are more sublime than cataracts . I think any man would have shivered more at the sight of Aurungzebe , than at the sight of the two rivers which meet at the Blue Mountains in America . and bursting through the whole breadth of the rocks , roll their victorious and united waters to the Eastern Sea . " This is delicious ; and to the purpose too , for the sublime is all the better brought out in this picture by its setting of burlesque . One of the most interesting of these lectures is that on the faculties of animals as compared with those of men . He treats the subject with his characteristic humor , and with a plain common-sense which seems really to aim at making the'subject clearer , instead of plunging it in deeper mystification . This will lose him his title as a great philosopher , but it suits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that of the Peripatetics , which allowed to brutes a sensitive power but denied them a rational one , that of the Platonists which allowed them an inferior sort of reason and understanding , that of Lactantius giving them every thing that men have but religion , that of Descartes making them mere machines destitute of all thought and reflection , not forgetting the theory of the philosophical Jesuit , who considered that each animal had a familiar spirit , and that a devil was roasted with every chicken , dived with every duck , grazed with every ox , and swam with every turbot , he speaks of the usual distinction , drawn between the intelligence of men and of animals , of instinct and reason . - *Now the question is , is there any meaning to the term instinct ? what is that meaning * and what is the distinction between instinct and reason I If I desire to do a certain thing , adopt certain means to effect it , and have a clear and precise notion that those means are directly subservient to that end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt means subservient to that end , and am uniformly found to do so , and am not in the least degree conscious that these means are subservient to that end ,  --  there I certainly do act from some principle very different from reason ; and to which principle it is as convenient to give the name of instinct as any other name . If I build a house for my family , and lay it out into different apartments , separating it horizontally with floors , and give the obvious principles on which I have done so ,  --  here is plainly an invention of meaning , and an app lication of previous experience , which anybody won Id call by the name of reason ; but if I am detected making folding doors to the drawing-room , putting up snug shelves in the butler 's pantry , and making the whole house as convenient as possible , without the slightest knowledge or suspicion of the utility of these things ,  --  there , it is very plain , I am not constituted as other men are.l * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with small cells on both sides , fit for holding their store of honey , and for receiving their young . There are only three possible figures of the cells which can make them all equal and similar without any useless interstices these are the equilateral triangle , the square , and the regular hexagon . It is well known to mathematicians that there is not afourth way possible in which a place may be cut into little spaces , that shall be equal , similar and regular , without leaving any interstices . Of the three , the hexagon is the most proper both for conveniency and strength ; and , accordingly , bees-as if they were acquainted with these things-make all their cells regular hexagons. * * * * * It is a curious mathematical problem , at what precise angle the three places which compose the bottom of a cell ought to meet , in order to make the greatest possible saving or the least expense of materials and labor . This is one of the problems belonging to the higher parts of mathematics , which are called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some mathematicians , particularly by Mr. Maclaurin , by a fluxionary calculation , which is to be found in the ninth volume of the " Transactions of the Royal Society of London . " He has determined precisely the angle required ; and he found by the most exact mensuration the subject could admit , that it is the very angle in which the three planes in the bottom of the cell of the honey-comb do actually meet . How is all this to be explained I Imitation it certainly is not ; for after every old bee has been killed , you may take the honey-comb and hatch a new swarm of bees , that can not possibly have had any communication with , or instruction from the parent . The young of every animal although they have never seen the dam*-will do exactly as all their species have done before them . * // Senior wrangler at Cambridge , ten hours a day , for three years together , to know enough mathematics for the calculation of these problems , with which not only every queen bee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born . * * * If you shake caterpillars off a tree in every direction , they instantly turn round and climb up , though they had never formerly been on the surface of the ground . This is a very striking instance of instinct . The caterpillar finds its food , and is nourished upon the tree , and not upon the ground ; but surely the caterpillar can not tell that such an exertion is necessary to its salvation ; and , therefore , it acts not from rational motives , but from blind impulse . Ants and beavers lay up magazines . Where do they get their knowledge that it will pot be so easy to collect food in rainy weather as it is in the summer * Men and women know these things because their grandfathers have told them so ; ants , hatched from the egg artificially , or birds hatched in this manner , have all this knowledge by intuition , without the smallest communication with any of their relations . Now , observe what the solitary wasp does ; she digs several holes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg , though she certainly knows not that an animal is deposited in that egg ,  --  and still less that this animal must be nourished with other animals . She collects a few green flies , rolls them up neatly in separate parcels ( like Bologna sausages , ) and stuffs one parcel into each hole where an egg is deposited . When the wasp-worm is hatched , it finds a store of provisions ready made ; and what is most curious , the quantity allotted to each is exactly sufficient to support it , till it attains the period of wasphood , and can provide for itself . Here the little creature has never seen its parent ; for by the time it is born , the parent is always eaten by sparrows ; and yet without the slightest education or previous experience , it does every thing that the parent did before it . * * * Insects are like Moli*re 's persons of quality ,  --  they know everything ( as Moli*re says , ) without having learned anything . Les gens de qualite savent tout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , in these opinions , attributes to a blind unthinking instinct , much that belongs to a superior natural perception guided by an inferior but active reason . The boasted reason of man would be powerless but for a certain intuitive knowledge , which serves as its foundation , and furnishes its data . One of these intuitions is that which relates to the forms and outlines ofmatter , a mode of this being the perception of angularity . The bee , when he starts from home on his daily toil , circles among tree-tops and banks of bloom , erratic , seemingly without thought but to satisfy his hunger and his avarice . But the whole diagram of his course is plain before his mind , and when his store is complete , he strikes out in a direct unerring " beeline " for his hive . Books of natural history are full of instances of this trait in animals more common among wild than domesticated . But even domestic animals , though somewhat degraded by civilization , do not entirely lose this power . A horse , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will often make for his distant stable with the same directness as if it was in full sight . Every angle in his journey has been measured intuitively and stereotyped on his memory , the distance between the turns he measures by a knowledge partly intuitive partly the result of experience , and without being able to demonstrate the problem , he understands it . Men have this same knowledge , but crippled by disuse and the substitutes which civilization and reason bring . The Indian and the hunter have it ; and the blind man , by its aid , steps with confidence through his starless night . Every one , who attends at all to the operations of his own mind , must have noticed , when alone in fores* , that he has a tolerably clear consciousness of his position and bearings with regard to the point of departure , though the country may be entirely new to him . People wanting in this power , invariably break their nose when left in a dark room , before they find the match or the bell-rope . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compass and calculation , while the wild-fowl above his head , by intuitive knowledge , not instinct , reach their destination as surely . Reason is often like a crutch to the healthy limb ,  --  it destroys the natural power . Such a faculty , guarding and guiding the steps of animals , and clearer in them than in men , may be the source of the architectural skill of the bee . It is not blind instinct , but knowledge , understandingly and discriminately applied . He builds his hexagons by the same special intelligence that completes the diagram of his daily wanderings , and leads him homewards with the precision of a magnet . Where the hexagon is useless , he discards // it . If a beetle or other large insect gets into the hive , and can not be conveniently removed , the bees first destroy the interloper , and then cover him with a *smooth dome of wax , of irregular shape according to the size and form of the insect . The exception proves the rule ; and we see from this that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of their cells , but the limitation of the use . If we look for instinct , we must seek it in the simpler pursuits of the animal , and not in those occupations that are almost human in their complexity . Instinct teaches the bee his peculiar food , and sends him to gather pollen to build the roof and sides of his house . It teaches the ant and beaver from what materials to construct their habitations , but leaves them , like the bee and man , to the regular processes of intelligence for the skill to build them . But instinct is still allied to thought ; - it is a subordinate perception , a special faculty , narrow and fixed upon a particular point . We should not confound it , as our author does , with the passions and desires which it only directs to their objects . Ants and beavers lay up magazines of provisions ; where do they get their knowledge , he asks , that it will not be so easy to collect food in rainy weather as in summer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for the cloudy days of old age ? Do they not feel deep pleasure in mere acquisition ? And do we not see this passion constantly manifested irrespective of future wants ? It serves an ultimate purpose unknown to the animal , but so it does with man-at least in the latter case , it gives the iacentive which reason could not always give with the same force . To ants and men and beavers , the love of property gives government , and society and laws , and provides for the feebleness of infancy and old age . In the habits of the caterpillar , mentioned by our author , we find a very strik* ing case of instinctive action . But even ber3 the instinct is not altogether blind . His motto is Excelsior , but like all creeping things he is discreet about it . He does not refuse to crawl downward , if necessary . While turning over the pages of this very book , we noticed one of these insects on a dead branch that projected athwart the window . He crept upward , carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On arriving at the end of the branch , and finding none of the juicy harvest , he turned about and marched deliberately down again , at a steady quick jog . His whole movement showed disgust . Here the instinct was not a mere blind impulse , without knowledge of its objects , but was evidently under rational control . The wasp , however , and the unconscious cares of its maternity would seem to be an undeniable case of pure instinct . In the lectures on Taste and the Beautiful , the philosophy of Alison , denying any power in matter to excite originally these emotions , is rejected . On these points the author 's opinions are confused and contradictory . He confounds sensational impressions with the pleasures of mere intellectual perception , and these again with the warmer and very different pleasure excited by the beauty of outward objects . And concerning the power of material objects to arouse emotion , his own views , in different parts of the work , are far from consistent . " Every man is as good a judge of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields in one of the mornings of May , and if you carry with you a mind unpolluted with harm , watch how it is impressed . You are delighted with the beauty of colors are not those colors beautiful * You breathe vegetable fragrance ; is not that fragrance grateful * You see the sun rising from behind a mountain , and the heavens painted with light ; is not that renewal of the light of the morning sublime * You reject all obvious reasons , and say that these things are beautiful and sublime , because the accidents of life have made them so ; -J say they are beautiful BECAUSE Gon HAS MADE THEM so ! that it is the original , indelible character impressed upon them by Him who has opened these sources of simple pleasure , to calm , perhaps , the perturbations of sense , and to make us love that joy which is purchased without giving pain to another man 's heart , and without entailing reproach on our own . " This passage will show some of the errors to which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect , will be inclined to dispute . However much we may mystify ourselves concerning the emotion caused by the grander features of nature , such as the sky , the ocean , streams , mountains , // the beauty of the outward world , and appreciating this beauty in the leaf as much as in the tree , in the brook singing among pebbles as well as in great rivers draining continents , finding it in every ordinary aspect of nature , can ever be satisfied with any theory of association . The author , who has this taste in common with all of his countrymen through the whole length of the island from the Cockney to the Highlander , rejects such interpretation of a sentiment that is next to religion . By refusing this hypothesis , we are not forced to the notion that brute matter can call forth emotions of this high order , for we still have the alternative of the active and living causation that breathes though nature . In the discourse on the active powers of the mind , the author adopts the philosophical views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deriving from it every passion , affection and desire . According to this theory nothing is necessary to make any man whatever he is , than a capacity for feeling pleasure and pain , and the principle of association . " A young child soon after his birth , has not the least desire to do good or harm to any one ; he has no such passions ; and it is our business to explain how he gets them . The food he eats or drinks gives him pleasure ; but observing in process of tii ; ne , that the nurse is always present when he receives his food , the sight of the nurse gives him pleasure , because it reminds him of his food ; yet in process of time the idea of that food is obliterated , and the sight of the nurse gives him pleasure , and , without the intervening idea that she is useful to him , he loves her immediately after his appetite of hunger is satisfied , as well as before : his passion for her , which first proceeded from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves her without the slightest reference to the advantages she procures him . This is the origin of his love for his nurse ; and then , as all kindred ideas are very easily associated together , he proceeds from loving her , to desiring her good ; for , perceiving that other people like what he likes , it is very natural that the idea of his own gratification in eating , should suggest the idea of the nurse 's gratification ; and that he should offer her a little morsel of his apple or his cake , or any puerile luxury which he happens to be enjoying . The association is easy to be comprehended , and seems perfectly natural . Besides , a child begins very early to associate his own advantage with benevolence . Cake , and commendation , the parent of cake , are lavished upon the child who shows a disposition to please others . Cuffs , and frowns , and hard words , are the portion of a selfish and a malevolent child : he begins with loving benevolence for the advantage it affords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not born with love of anything , but merely with a capacity of feeling pleasure ; which he first feels for the milk , then for the mother , because she gives him that milk , then for her own sake ; then , as she makes him happy , association gives him the idea of making her happy ; and he gains so much by benevolence , that he loves it first for the advantages it affords , then for its self . Reverse all this , and you will have the history and progress of the malevolent passions . A young child hates nobody . If you were to pinch or scratch him , he would feel pain ; but if you were to do it often , he would associate the idea of you with the idea of pain , and would hate you , first on account of the ideas you suggested , then hate you plainly and simply without any cause . Again : a child is deterred from doing anything . by threats and by pain ; and he perceives that other persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas with prevention ; threatens and beats whoever contradicts him ; and cherishes resentment as a means of gratifying his will , and effecting whatever object he has in view . It is quite impossible that a child can be born with any feeling of resentment . He can never tell that to prevent another child from beating him , is to beat him again ; it would be an enormous thing that he , who does not know black from scarlet , should be acquainted with the dominion which pain has over the mind , and make use of it to accomplish his purposes ; and yet , such is the opinion that they adopt , who consider this passion as innate , and coeval with our existence . " They adopt no such opinion ; - they no more consider that the child uses this natural weapon of anger from any calculation of its utility , than that it should draw its mother 's milk for the sake of the health and strength it gains from it . But such opinions are held by the advocates generally of the selfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of association is very near akin . And in fact , these two systems are strangely intermingled by our author , as will be seen throughout the whole of the above extract . He presents however , in a lively manner , the main features of a doctrine , barren indeed , but attractive from its simplicity . The hypothesis assumes that all pleasure is // gratification the child feels at receiving his food is similar to the gratification he receives from the presence of his nurse ; and that the pain of a bruise or hurt is similar to the pain attending the passion of resentment or terror . Fear it considers the expectation of pain , and hope the expectation of pleasure . INo one will deny that pleasure or pain may be the causes or conditions of affection and resentment , and that these latter feelings might lie dormant without th' action of the first to bring them into life ; but the doctrine of Hartley regards it as merely a transfrrence of emotion . A feeling of complacency it makes , not only the foundation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his most malign passions are only extreme degrees , not of annoyance proceeding jfrom pain , but of the pain itself . The best refutation of this doctrine , so recommended by our author , he gives to us himself in his sketch of the philosophy of Epicurus . " In the first place , the plan of solving all the phenomena of the passions by the dread of bodily pain and the love of bodily pleasure , is very simple and beautiful ; and I have no doubt that several of the passions commonly supposed to be original , may be proved to be put in motion by these springs of the machine but it will not do for all ; for how shall we explain compassion by it * I learn what pain is in another man by knowin* what it is in myself ; but I might know this without feeling the pity . I might have been so constituted as to rejoice that another man was in agony ; how can you prove that my own aversion to pain must necessarily make me feel for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking my own leg , and I will avoid it by all means in my power ; but it does not necessarily follow from thence that I should be struck with horror because you have broken yours . The reason that we do feel horror , is that nature has superadded to these two principles of Epicurus , the principle of pity ; which , unless it can be shown by stronger arguments to be derived from any other feeling , must stand as an ultimate fact in our nature . " Some of the supicious appearances about the Hartleian system , our author points out himself , and with an ingenuousness that is truly admirable in a science where bigotry and partisan feelings have gone to such furious extremes , and where zealous theorists have even sought to roast each other alive . " I have heard it said , as an objection against this theory , that there is a neatness in it , an arrondissement , which gives it a very great appearance of quackery and imposture . This is very likely ; but I am not contending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but merely that it is true . At the same time , there is a great deal of merit in the observation ; for discoveries in general , especially upon such very intricate subjects , are more ragged , uneven , and incomplete ; here there is little light and there a great deal of darkness ; in one place you make a great inroad , and there you are stopped by impenetrable barriers ; but here is one master.key which opens every bolt and harrier ; a philosophy which explains everything , and leaves the whole subject at rest for ever . All these are certainly presumptive evidences against the theory ; but if it perform all that it promise , those presumptive evidences , are , of course , honorably repelled . " This is manly and honest , and in the midst of the special pleading that all men make for their pet theories , it is as refreshing as a " meadow-gale in spring. ** The careless air , and the book is full of like instances , veils a deep truth . Men that reason closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is the true metaphysical or scholastic cast of mind , fall invariably into a sort of intellectual bondage to theory . Starting from varied hypotheses , on insecure premises , they are led irresistibly to conclusions wide as the poles asunder . Thrown thus into doubt , torturing to such eager minds , they willingly let circumstances incline them to some favorite doctrine . Shutting their eyes to all else , which their concentration of thought , an element in their acuteness , easily enables them to do , they proceed to measure the universe by their Procrustean systems . They seek truth along the track of preconceived theory , built upon premises too often insufficient , and permit themselves to receive no hues from the numberless influences that bear upon all social and moral questions . They shun the drudgery of induction , but delight to roam through the ramification of hypothesis . It is their natural channel of thought , and their mind sports on its current with ease and delight . We repeat that the clearness with which the author treats his cloudy subject , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not devoid of interest themselves , but , from their apparent dryness , repulsive to the general reader , must render this book in time deservedly popular . Its errors must be viewed with leniency , for it was never meant by the author for publication , but written by him while still a young man and delivered as lectures to a large and mixed audience of both sexes . The necessity before such an audience of giving vivacity and sustained interest to matters , where to sustain attention was indispensable , was well suited for developing the shrewd-. ness , and rich vein of the lecturer . But we can easily see how their evident want of profundity rendered him averse to giving these lectures to the public , while even friendly critical authorities were for a time doubtful of their success but clear and broad views , and perspicuous expression of thought , are as rare a genius as profundity , and a thousand times more quickly appre-. ciated and trained to utility .                @ @ @ @ @
