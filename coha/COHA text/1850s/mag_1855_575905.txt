VOL . VJ. - OOT. , 1865. - NO . XXXIV . ORIGINAL PORTRAITS OF WASHINGTON . THE retuni to this country of a portrait of Washington , claimed to be from life , and to have been executed at Philadelphia , in 1795 , by Wertm ( iller , a Danish artist of eminence in his day . and the fact that an engraving from this picture has been adopted as the frontispiece to Irving 's new Biography of Washington , have led to a general discussion , not only of the merits of the portrait itself , but of those previously recognised as authentic , the comparative resemblance of each , the ability of the different artists , and the history of their work . The interest thus awakened in the subject , has induced us to devote a few pages to its illustration , as a theme of curious artistic suggestiveness , and one which , from its associations , has a national charm . The earliest portrait of Washington is more interesting , perhaps , as a memorial than as a work of art ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old comrades . The/continental dress*ind youthful face make it illustrative of the first experience of the future commander , when , exchanging the surveyor 's implements for a major 's commission , he bivouacked in the wilderness of Ohio , the leader of a motley band of hunters , provincials and savages , to confront wily Frenchmen , cut forest roads , and encounter all the perils of Indian ambush , inclement skies , undisciplined followers , famine VOL. vi. - 22 and woodland skirmish . It recalls his calm authority and providential escape amid the dismay of Braddock 's defeat . and his pleasant sensation at the first whistling of bullets in the weary march to Fort Necessit*y . To Charles Wilson Peale we owe this precious relic of the chieftain 's youth . His own career partook of the vicissitudes and was impressed with the spirit of the revolutionary era ; a captain of volunteers at the battles of Trenton and Germantown , a State representative of Pennsylvania , a favorite pupil of West , an ingenious mechanic and a warrior , he always cherished the instinct and the faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties of the camp , never failed to seize auspicious intervals of leisure , to depict his brother officers . The resolution of Congress by which this portrait was ordered , was passed T*I*re the occupation of Philadelphia . Its progress marks the vicissitudes of the revolutionary struggle ; commenced in the gloomy winter and halffamished encampment at Valley Forge , in 1777 , the battles of Trenton , Princeton , and Monmouth intervened before its completion . At the last place Washington suggested that the view from the window of the farm-house opposite to which he was sitting , would form a desirable background . Peale adopted the idea , and represented Monmouth Court House , and a party of Hessians under // guard marching out of it. * The picture was finished at Philadelphia , but Congress adjourned without making an appropriation and it remained in the artist 's hands . Lafayette desired a copy for the King of France , and Peale executed one in 1779 , which was sent to Paris ; but the misfortunes of the royal family occasioned it sale , and it became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to this country and presented it to the National Institute , where it is now preserved . Chapman made two copies at a thousand dollars each ; and Dr. Craik , one of the earliest and warmest personal friends of Washington , their commissions as officers in the French war having been signed on the same day 1754 , declared it a most faithful likeness of him as he appeared in the prime of his life . The characteristic traits of Peale 's full-length portrait of Washington , now at Arlington House , and the era of our history and of Washington 's life it embalms , make it doubly valuable as the initiative in a series of pictorial illustrations , each of which , independent of the degree of professional skill exhibited , is essential to our Washingtonian gallery . Before Trumbull and Stuart had caught from the living man his aspect in maturity and age , the form , knit to athletic proportions by self-denial and activity , and clad in the garb of rank and war , and the countenance open with truth and grave with thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow of early manhood , was thus genially delineated by the hand of a comrade , and in the infancy of native art Of the fourteen portraits by Peale , that exhibiting Washington as a Virginian colonel in the uniform of the colonial force of Great Britain , was painted in 1772 , at Mount Vernon , and is the only entire portrait before the Rovelution extant . A few octogenarians , in the city of brotherly love , used to speak , not many years since , of a diminutive family , the head of which manifested the sensitive temperament , if not the highest capabilities of artistic genius . This was Robert Edge Pine . He was considered a superior colorist , and was favorably introduced into society there by his acknowledged sympathy for the American cause , and a and project such as was afterwards partially realized by Trumbull ; that of a series of historical paintings , illustrative of the American Revolution , to embrace original portraits of the leaders , both civil and military , in that achievement , including the statesmen who were chiefly instrumental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought a letter of introduction to the father of the late Judge Hopkinson , whose portrait he executed , and its vivid tints and correct resemblance still attest to his descendants the ability of the painter . In the intervals of his business as a teacher of drawing and a votary of portraiture in general , he collected , from time to time , a large number of " distinguished heads . " Of these portraits , the heads of General Gates , Charles Carroll , Baron Steuben , and Washington , are the . best known and most highly prized . Pine remained three weeks at Mount Vernon , and his portrait bequeaths some features with great accuracy ; artists find in it certain merits not discoverable in those of a later date ; it has the permanent interest of a representation from life , by a painter of established reputation ; yet its tone is cold and its effect unimpressive , beside the more bold and glowing pencil of Stuart . It has repose and dignity . In his letter to Washington , asking his cooperation in the design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime at Annapolis painting the portraits of patriots , legislators , heroes , and beauties , in order to adorn my large pictures ; " and seems to have commenced his enterprise with sanguine hopes of one day accomplishing his object , which , however , it was reserved for a native artist eventually to complete . That his appeal to Washington was not neglected , however , is evident from an encouraging allusion to Pine , and his scheme , in the correspondence of the former . " Mr. Pine , " he says , " has met a favorable reception in this country , and may , I conceive , command as much business as he pleases . He is now preparing materials for historical representations of the most important events of the war . " f Pine 's picture is in the possession of * MS . Letter of Rembrandt Peale to George Livermore , Esq . Sparks ' Writings of Washington . // the Hopkinson family at Philadelphia . The fac-simile of Washington 's letter proves that it was taken in 1785 . A duplicate was purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brevoort , of New York . The reader of Haydon 's autobiography will remember the awkward predicament in which that egotistic but impassioned devotee of " high art " found himself , when attempting to take a cast in plaster from the person of a Herculean model , whom he nearly suffocated by the experiment . To the same crude process was the head of onr august chief submitted in 1783 . Franklin introduced to him , by letter , a Bordentown gentleman , Joseph Wright , who painted both his wife and himself at Rocky Hill , near Princeton , in that year , and , afterwards , etched a profile of the latter from his own drawing . Both portraits were thought like ; and Congress , then sitting in Philadelphia , with the intention of securing a. reliable statue , employed this artist to take a mould , in plaster of Paris , of Washington 's face . But the trepidation of the operator caused him , in removing the mould , to let it fall , and , though it was utterly ruined , the President declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this artist , in reference to a portrait he executed for the Count de Solms , illustrates the desire for military fame , which was an instinctive and an hereditary trait of Washington 's character , apparent in his eagerness to take part , when quite young , in frontier warfare , and subsequently in Braddock 's expedition , notwithstandinghis mother 's remonstrances , to which , in all other interests , he was ever obedient . After directing the painter to forward his bill , he adds : " you will not be deficient in execution , *s the Count designs this for his gallery of military characters . " But the most interesting work of this artist is a portrait of Washington , executed for Mrs. Elizabeth Willing , of Philadelphia . This lady was an intimate friend of the first President , as his familiar letters to her on subjects of general and personal concern , and to her husband , on agricultural matters , evidence . This picture came by direct inheritance into the possession of John Haxe Powell , the nephew of Mrs. Willing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at whose house , in Newport , we lately had the pleasure of examining it . It bears Original Portraits of Washington . 339 date Philadelphia , 1784 . There is something at once inelegant and truthful in the impression it conveys ; no attempt is visible to modify the somewhat unsymmetrical torso , or to give artificial ease to the attitude ; it strikes the beholder as a most honest but wholly unembellished portrait , one of those bold , faithful imitations of nature whose very lack of ideal finish yields prima facie proof of authenticity . The attitude is erect , the lips closed with determination , the eye clear and unfaltering , the hair shorter than in any other portrait , and the nose so distinctly outlined an*t decided in its form as to claim special notice . Perhaps no portrait of Washington bears such convincing marks of genuine individuality , without a particle of artistic flattery . There is something honest in the mere look of the right hand ; resolution and great calmness are the predominant traits . Bushrod Washington always spoke of this portrait as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Canova 's fellow workmen , in the first years of his artistic life , was a melancholy enthusiast , whose thirst for the ideal was deepened by a morbid tenacity of purpose and sensitiveness of heart . The political confusion that reignc*l in Europe for a time , seriously interfered with the pursuit of art ; and this was doubtless a great motive with Giuseppe Ceracchi for visiting America ; but not less inciting was the triumph of freedom , of which our land had recently become the scenea triumph that so enlisted the sympathies and fired the imagination of the republican sculptor , that he designed a grand national monument , commemorative of American independence , and sought the patronage of the newlyorganized government in its behalf . Washington , individually , favored his design , and the model of the proposed work received the approval of competent judges . With a view to its execution , Ceracchi made the only series of marble portraitures from life of the founders of the government ; his busts of Hamilton , Jay , Trumbull , and Governor George Clinton , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in New York ; the latter , especially , was remarkable , both in regard to its resemblance to the original , and as a work of art . His most important achievement , however , // was a bust of Washington , generally considered the most perfect representation of the man and the hero combined , after Stuart 's master-piece . The fate of this valuable effigy was singular . It was purchased by the Spanish Ambassador , as a gift to the Prince of Peace , then atthe height of his power at Madrid ; before the bust reached Spain , Godoy was exiled , and the minister recalled , who , on his arrival , transferred it , unpacked , to Richard Meade , Esq. , of Philadelphia , in whose family it remained until two years ago , when , at the adininistrators ' sale of that gentleman 's fine collection of paintings , it was purchased by Gouverneur Kemble , and can now be seen at his hospitable mansion , on the banks of the Hudson . This bust gives Washington a Roman look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mouth than any other work . The design of a statue was only realized on the arrival of Houdon , who accompanied Dr. Franklin to the United States . He remained at Mount Vernon long enough to execute a model of Washington 's head , and familiarize himself with every detail of his features and the traits of his natural language ; but that implicit fidelity , now evident in the busts of our own l'bading sculptors , was not then in vogue , and the artists of the day were rather adepts in ide*alizing than in precise imitation of nature ; therefore , the result of Houdon 's labors , though , in general , satisfactory , can not be used with the mathematical exactitude , as a guide , which greater attention to minutia would have secured . There is a little drawing by Stuart , in which the minute discrepancies between london 's bust and the original head are noted . On leaving , he presented Washington with the bas-relief which used to hang over his chair in the library at Mount Vernon . He completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast of the head is still at Mount Vernon , and the statue itself is the cherished ornament of the Capitol at Richmond , and has been declared , by one of Washington 's biographers , to be " as perfect a resemblance , in face and figure , as the art admits ; " while , on the other hand , a critic of large and studious observation , who was well acquainted with the appearance of the original , says that , as a likeness , the head is inferior to Ceracehi 's bust . The costume is that Washington wore as commander-inchief ; it has been assailed with the usual arguments-its want of classical effect , and its undignified style ; but less conservative reasoners applaud the truth of the drapery , and the work is endeared as a reliable and unique representation of the man  --  the only one from life , bequeathed by the art of the statuary . In 1847 , Mr. Charles Fox proclaimed the discovery of an original portrait of Washington , in the possession of a respectable family of Boston , claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this artist was Fullerton , who , with his brother , ranked high among the juvenile patriots of his native town , was a visitor to Gage 's camp , and traced the features ot ' his country 's hero as he appeared reviewing the troops on Boston Common ; after a voyage to India for his health , he came home only to die , and was buried in the old grave-yard of King 's Chapel . Mr. Fox had this portrait engraved by G. G. Smith , and obtained a certificate of its value , as a correct resemblance , from H. G. Otis , John Wells , David Ellis , and other well known , venerable citizens of Boston . There are , indeed , certain familiar lines in the profile , and a general , though vague , similitude to the acknowledged likenesses ; but as a work of art it is stiff and hard : the eye is larger in proportion , the muscles of the lower jaw less firm , and the nose more straight , than in the majority of previous and subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curious relic . A letter of Washington 's , dated at NewYork , in 1789 , courteously acknowledges an introduction brought him from Cambridge by Edward Savage , in which he is respectfully solicited to sit to that painter , who had offered to execute his portrait as a gift to Harvard College . It is probable that the opportunity was gained , by this very mediocre painter , entirely on account of the institution whence the request emanated ; for the work of Mr. Savage , still in the collection of the university , compares quite unfavorably with the heads of the old worthies , portrayed not only by Copley , but his very inferior successors in New England . It has the attraction , indeed , which belongs to every representation from the life of an illustrious character , whose effigy can never be // seen with indifference by American eyes . It bears an obvious resemblance to the Wertmuiler portrait . But it is a hard and heavy production , utterly . deficient in genuine expression and skillful finish . This picture dates soon after " *Vashington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from whose burin proceeded that formal but once favorite print , called The Washington Family , th' original of which was by Savage , and long preserved at a Museum in New York . He was originally a print publisher , and chiefly engraved portraits executed by himself . He owes the distinction he enjoyed to the low state of the arts and the paucity of artists in his day , and is now remembered only as having been the first teacher of Jarvis , and the painter of an ordinary likeness of the first American President . One of the few accomplished foreign ladies who graced the republican court , during his administration , was Madame de Brdhen , sister of the French minister , who possessed considerable talent for drawing . She made two profile heads of Washington , one of which he gave to Mrs. Bingham , and the other was taken to France by the artist and handsomely engraved . In a letter to her brother , from Mount Vernon , in 1790 , Washington expresses his gratification at the receipt of several proof impressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look of an etching from a Roman medallion ; the outline is serene and noble , but the wreath round the brow gives it a half classical and half French air , not easily associated with the head of an American hero . It is , however , a graceful tribute from a countrywoman of Lafayette . If this portrait agreeably symbolizes the days when Washington held councils of war with Rochambeau and D'Estaing , corresponded with Gouverneur Morris on the events of the French Revolution , and became the courteous sitter to a fair Parisian limner , the portrait in the collection of the Earl of Buchan is a no less pleasing token of the appreciation in which his high example was held in the land of Bruce . In Washington 's correspondence we find the evidence of a strong desire to meet the wishes of this nobleman , who paid him a significant compliment , by sending the letter , asking for his portrait , and introducing Archibald Robertson , a painter from Aberdeen , in a box made from the very oak that sheltered Wallace after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he writes to the Earl in transmitting the picture , " does no discredit , I am told , to the artist , of whose skill favorable mention has been made to me . " The miniatures of the President and his wife , executed in 1790 , by this artist , and belonging to the family , have been pronounced more remarkable for high flnish than as likenesses . Among the secondary effigies of Washington may be mentioned , also , two portraits by James Peale , and a bus-relief in wax by Mrs. Wright , now in the possession of H. P. Beck , Esq. , of Philadelphia . In some of the reminiscences of the American stage , the name of Gallagher , a scene painter , occurs ; he was one of those adventurers who bring the palette and pencil to account in any manner which will afford subsistence . He executed portraits when he could find a subject , but seem* to have chiefly relied upon theatrical scenery and signboards . In 1789 , he made a likeness of Washington . Another limner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city in 1780 , Du Cimitiere , made a portrait which the family thought good , and which , for a while , had some circulation abroad , through engraved copies executed in Paris . Eceleston , a Virginian , modeled his head in 1796 . Robert Fulton , in that transition period of his enterprising life , when art disputed the empire of his mind with science , full of patriotic enthusiasm for so illustrious a subject , painted Washington , in 1782 ; but his ineffective labors as an artist were soon forgotten in the signal triumphs of his mechanical genius . In the following year , William Dunlap , then a youthful tyro , performed the same office , with limited success , at Rocky Hill , N. J. Although what may be termed the incidental labors of the artists of the day , many of them deficient in the higher qualifications for portraiture , to embody and transmit the countenance of Washington , have ceased to have any value except to the antiquarian and the virtuoso , an exc eption should be made in favor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the President 's appearance before Congress , when assembled in Philapelphia , watched his opportunity , and caught so true a profile // from the unconscious subject , at a moment when his features were most expressive , that a leading journal of the day declares it the most spirited and correct off-hand likeness ever made . It afterwards became widely known , from being admirably transferred to a collection of earthen pitchers ; these , in process of time , grew rare ; and , when a crate of them was accidentally discovered in 1801 , they were eagerly sought as memorials , and the heads carefully removed and framed for preservation , under the name of " the pitcher portrait . " * In 1798 there also arrived , for the second time , in New York , an artist of less aspiring genius than practical views . Although of an English Roman Catholic family , and educated in France , the look and bearing of James Sharpless were those of a courteous Quaker . To his pencil we owe , in numerous instances , the only correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention who framed the Constitution ; his sketches of Gouverneur Morris and Rufus King are memorable ; and his graceful pastiles may yet be seen in some of our oldfashioned mansions . The profile likeness of Washington , by Sharpless , is a valuable item of the legacy which art has bequeathed of those noble and benign features ; he evidently bestowed upon it his greatest skill , and there is no more correct facial outline of the immortal subject in existence ; a disciple of Lavater would probably find it the most available side-view for physiognomical inference ; it is remarkably adapted to the burin , and has been once , at least , adequately engraved ; it also has the melancholy attraction of being the last portrait of Washington taken from life . The memory of Sharpless and his career in America were pleasantly revived , within a short time , by the visit to our shores of an English gentleman , baying in his possession an oil portrait of Washington by this artist , which , for many years , was the cherished ornament of a London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted , for a considerable period , as agents of the illustrious Virginia planter , and subsequently of the great republican chief . The owner of this precious relic was one of the many victims of the railway speculations that , not long since , brought such financial disasters upon Great Britain . His account of the Sharpless portrait traces its history with authentic minuteness . It was well known by the habitu*s of Mr. Cary 's dwelling , where it hung over the fireplace-the object of frequent discussion-at a time when good likenesses of Washington were rare in England . The artist was a relative* of the merchant , and it is probable that the latter commissioned Sharpless to execute the work , or obtained it by direct purchase . It fell into the hands of a confidential employ of the house , from whose son the more recent owner bought it , having learned the value which , in this country , at least , would attach to an original portrait of Washington . It was exhibited at a meeting of the New York Historical Society , and elicited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The venerable Dr. Van Pelt , especially , attested its correctness . In a letter to the owner , he describes the sentiments of love and awe towards Washington that filled his heart in boyhood , and the vivid emotions with which he first beheld him . " I got by the side of him , " he says , " taking the buttons of his military coat between my fingers , and intent on looking at him , he putting his own arm around my neck . I observed distinctly the features of his face , his bland , dignified , majestic countenance , his erect , tall , towering person , his graceful movements and amiable demeanor . " The declaratio*a of such a witness , that this portrait is " faithful , excellent , lifelike , " establishes its value . It resembles Stuart 's head , but has " a latent fire in the eye , " a character , vigor , and breadth which proclaim it an original . Its worth and interest are also increased by the painter 's high reputation and attractive qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection ; and he strove to represent him not less from delight in the subject than in order to possess himself of a reliable memorial of one in whose praises he was singularly eloquent . No artist more completely felt the difficulties of the task ; none was ever inspired with more reverence for the man . " It is not in the grasp of any painter , " he // writes to his family , " to hold the dignity and mightiness of the great subject ; " and elsewhere he expatiates upon the uniform kindness and the noble condescension of Washington . One remark is worthy of notice , as an indirect but striking tribute to that habitual self-control , the cost of which , in discipline and inward struggle , we have yet thoroughly to realize . " There was , " says Sharpless , " a concealed , though not unconquered passion working within him , which rendered him a somewhat painful sitter . On this account , " he adds , " I felt the necessity of making a dash at him before any ennui could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superior animation of the portrait . The first outline by this ingenious man was made in 1796 , by the pentograph , and is , therefore , mathematically correct . Of his two colored crayons , one is the profile before described , and the other a neat front view . Of his American collection , so endeared to him that he refused to part with a single specimen , using , to importunate applicants , Stuart 's old excuse-that they were not quke finished-there now exist in England , two portraits of Washington , one a profile , another of Mrs. Washington , one of John Adams , and one of Jefferson and Madison . Rembrandt Peale , when quite young , became the companion of his father 's artistic labors . In compliment to the latter , Washington sat for a likeness to the novice of eighteen , who says the honor agitated more than it inspired him , and he solicited his father 's intercession and countenance on the memorable occasion . Of the precise value of his original sketch it is difficult to form an accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce a portrait of Washington has attained a high and permanent famet He availed himself of Stuart 's best points , and always worked with Houdon 's bust before him . This celebrated picture is the favorite portrait of a large number of amateurs . Rembrandt Peale is said to be the only living artist who ever saw Washington . In the pamphlet which he issued to authenticate the work , we find the cordial testimony , to its fidelity and other merits , of Lawrence Lewis , the eldest nephew of Washington ; of the late venerable John Vaughan , of Bishop White , Rufus King , Charles Carroll , Edward Livingston , General Smith , Dr. James Thatcher , and Judge Cranch . Chief Justice Marshall says of it : " It is more Washington himself than any portrait I have ever seen ; " and Judge Peters explains his approval by declaring , " I judge from its effect on my heart . " No artist enjoyed the opportunities of Colonel Trumbull , as the portrayer of Washington . As aid-de-camp , he was familiar with his appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era . At the commencement of the revolutionary struggle , this officer was among the most active , and essentially promoted the secure retreat of the American forces , under General Sullivan , from Rhode Island ; he , therefore , largely partook of the . spirit of those days , came freely under the influence of Washington 's character as it pervaded the camp , and had ample time and occasion to observe the commander-inchief in his military aspect , and in social intercourse , on horseback , in the field , and at the hospitable board , in the councils of war , when silently meditating his great work , when oppressed with anxiety , animated by hope , or under the influence of those quick and strong feelings he so early learned to subdue . After Trumbull 's resignation , and when far away from the scene of Washington 's glory , he painted his head from recollection , so distinctly was every feature and expression impressed upon his mind . In the autumn of 1789 ho returned from Europe , and began his sketches of the chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures that adorn the Rotunda of the Capitol , and the originals of which , invaluable for their authenticity , may now be seen in the gallery at New Haven . Here is preserved the most spirited portrait of Washington that exists  --  the only reflection of him , as a soldier of freedom , worthy of the name , drawn from life . The artist 's own account of this work is given in his memoirs : " In 1792 I was again in Philadelphia , and there painted the portrait of General Washington , now placed in the gallery at New Haven , the best , certainly , of those that I painted , and the best , in my estimation , which exists in his heroic and military character . The city of Charleston , S. C. , instructed Mr. W. R. Smith , one of the representatives of South Carolina , // to employ me to paint for them a portrait of the great man , and I undertook it con amore , as the commission was unlimited , meaning to give his military character at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the battle of Trenton , when , viewing the vast superiority of his approaching enemy , the impossibility of again crossing the Delaware or retreating down the river , he conceives the plan of returning by a night march into the country from which he had been driven , thus cutting off the enemy 's communication and destroying the dt*p6t of stores at Brunswick . " There is a singular felicity in this choice of the moment to represent Washington , for it combines all the most desirable elements of expression characteristic of the man . It is a moment , not of brilliant achievement , but of intrepid conception , when the dignity of thought is united with the sternness of resolve , and the enthusiasm of a daring experiment kindles the habitual mood of self-control into an unwonted glow . As the artist unfolded his design to Washington , the memory of that eventful night thrilled him anew ; he rehearsed the circumstances , described the scene , and his face was lighted up as the memorable crisis in his country 's fate and his own career was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wild hope , and the hazardous but fixed determination of that hour ; and , as the gratified painter declares , " looked the * " The result , " he says , " was , in my own opinion , eminently successful , and the General was satisfied . " The gentleman who was the medium of this commission to Trumbull , praised his work ; but , aware of the popular sentiment , declared it not calm and peaceful enough to satisfy those for whom it was intended . With reluctance , the painter asked Washington , overwhelmed as he was with official duty , to sit for another portrait , which represents him in his every-day aspect , and , therefore , better pleased the citizens of Charleston . " Keep this picture , " said Washington to the artist , speaking of the first experiment , " and finish it to your own taste . " When the Connecticut State Society of Cincinnati dissolved , a few of the members purchased it as a gift to Yale College. * Although the concurrent testimony of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait , now in the gallery at New Haven , as the most faithful likeness of Washington in his prime , this praise seems to refer rather to the general expression and air than to the details of the face . Trumbull often failed in giving a satisfactory likeness ; he never succeeded in renderthe complexion , as is obvious by comparing that of his picture in the New York City Haliwith any or all of Stuart 's heads ; the former is yellow , and gives the idea of a bilious temperament , while the latter , in every instance , have the florid , ruddy tint , which , we are assured , was characteristic of Washington , and indicative of his active habits , constant exposure to the elements , and Saxon blood . The best efforts of Trumbull were his first , careful sketches ; he never could elaborate with equal effect ; the collection of small , original heads , from which his historical pictures were drawn , are invaluable , as the most authentic resemblances in existence of our revolutionary heroes . They have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enlarged copies . " Washington , " says Trumbull , in describing the picture , " is represented standing on elevated ground , on the south side of the creek at Trenton , a little below the stone-bridge and mill . He has a reconnoitering glass in his hand , with which he is supposed to have been examining the strength of the hostile army , pouring into and occupying Trenton , which he has just abandoned at their appearance ; and , having ascertained their great superiority , as well in numbers as discipline , he is supposed to have been meditating how to avoid the apparently impending ruin , and to have just formed the plan which he executed during the night . This led to the splendid success at Princeton on the following morning ; aud , in the estimation of the great Frederic , placed his military character on a level with that of the greatest commanders of ancient or modem times . Behind , and near , an attendant holds his horse . Every minute article of dress , down to the buttons and spurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was carefully painted from the different objects . " Although not so familiar as Stuart 's , // numerous good copies of Trumbull 's Washington , some from his own , and othcrs by later pencils , have rendered it almost as well known in this country . Contemporaries gave it a decided preference ; it recalled the man who was " first in the hearts of his countrymen , " ere age relaxed the facial muscles and modified the decisive lines of the mouth ; it was associated in their minds with the indignant rebuke at Monmouth , the brilliant surprise at Trenton , and the heroic patience at Valley Forge ; it was the Washington of their youth , who led the armies of freedom . Ask an elderly Knickerbocker what picture will give you a good idea of Washington , and he will confidently refer you , as the testimony of his father has taught him , to Trumbull 's portrait in the City HalL When Lafayette first beheld a copy of this picture , in a gentleman 's house in New Jersey , on his visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he uttered an exclamation of delight at its resemblance . To trace the history of each of Stuart 's portraits of Washington would f rove of curious interest . One of his etters to a relative , dated the 2d of November , .1794 , enables us to fix the period of the earliest experiment . " The object of my journey , " he says , " is only to secure a portrait of the President and finish yours . " One of the succeeding pictures was bought from the artist 's studio by Mr. Tayloe , of Washington , and is at present owned by his eon , B. Ogle Tayloc , Esq. ; another was long in the possession of Madison , and is now in that of Gov . E. Coles , of Philadelphia . The full-length , in the presidential mansion , at the seat of government , was saved through the foresight and care of the late Mrs. Madison , when the city was taken by the British in the last war . Another portrait of undoubted authenticity was offered to and declined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Boston gentleman ; and one graced the hospitable dwelling of Samuel Williams , the London banker . The feature usually exaggerated in poor copies , and the least agreeable in the original , is the mouth , resulting from the want of support of those muscles consequent on the loss of teeth , a defect which Stuart vainly attempted to remedy by inserting cotton between the jaw and the lips ; and Wilson Peale more permanently , but not less ineffectually , sought to retrieve by a set of artificial teeth . We have seen in Western New York a cabinet head of Washington , which bears strong evidence of Stuart 's pencil , and is traced directly by its present owner to his hand , which was purchased of the artist and presented to Mr. Gilbert , a member of Congress from Columbia County , New York . While Congress was in session at Philadelphia , in 1794 , Stuart went thither with a letter of intrdduction to Washington , from John Jay . He first met his illustrious subject on a reception evening , and was spontaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Familiar as was the painter with eminent men , he afterwards declared that no human being ever awakened in him the sentiment of reverence to such a degree . For a moment , he lost his self-possession-with him an experience quite unprecedented  --  and it was not until several interviews that he felt himself enough at home with his sitter to give the requisite concentration of mind to his work . This was owing not less to the personal impressiveness of Washington-which all who came in contact with him felt and acknowledged - than to the profound respect and deep interest which the long anticipations of the artist had fostered in his own mind . He failed , probably from this cause , in his first experiment . No portrait-painter has left such a reputation for the faculty of eliciting expression , by his social tact , as Stuart . He would even defer his task , upon any pretext , until he succeeded in making the sitter , as he said , " look like himseli2 ' To induce a natural , unconscious , and characteristic mood , was his initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anecdotes of his ingenuity and persistence in carrying out this habit . More or less conversant with every topic of general interest , and endowed with rare conversational ability and knowledge of character , he seldom failed to excite the ruling passion , magnetize the prominent idiosyncrasy , or awaken the professional interest of the occupant of his throne , whether statesman , farmer , actor , judge , or merchant ; and his fund of good stories , narrated with di*amatic effect , by enchaining the attention or enlisting the sympathies , usually made the delighted hstener self-oblivious and // demonstrative , when , with an alertness and precision like magic , the watchful limner transferred the vital identity of his pre-occupied and fascinated subject , with almost breathing similitude . In Washington , however , he found a less flexible character upon which to scintillate his wit and open his anecdotical battery . Facility of adaptation seldom accompanies great individuality ; and a man whose entire life has been oppressed with responsibility , and in whom the prevalent qualities are conscience and good sense , can scarcely be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as self-control and reflection . On the professional themes of agriculture and military science , Washington was always ready to converse , if not with enthusiasm , at least in an attentive and intelligent strain ; but the artillery of repartee , and the sallies of fancy , made but a slight impression upon his grave and reserved nature . He was deficient in language-far more a man of action than of words  --  and had been obliged to think too much on vast interests , to " carry America in his brain , " as one of his eulogists has aptly said , to readily unbend in colloquial diversion . By degrees , however , the desired relation was established between himself and the artist , who , of several portraits , justly gave the preference to the Lansdowne picture and the unfinished one now possessed by the Boston Athemeum . They , doubtless , are the most perfect representations of Washington , as he looked at the time they were executed . The freshness of color , the studious modeling of the brow , the mingling of clear purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dignity in the whole head , realize all the most intelligent admirer of the original has imagined-not , indeed , when thinking of him as the intrepid leader of armies , but in the last analysis and complete image of the hero in retirement . It is this master-piece of Stuart that has not only perpetuated , but distributed over the globe the resemblance of Washington . It has been sometimes lamented that so popular a work does not represent him in the aspect of a successful warrior , or in the flush of youth ; but there seems to be a singular harmony between this venerable image - so majestic , benignant , and sereneand the absolute character and peculiar example of Washington , separated from what was purely incidental and contingent in his life . Self-control , endurance , dauntless courage , loyalty to a just but sometimes desperate cause , hope through the most hopeless crises , and a tone of feeling the most exalted , united to habits of candid simplicity , are better embodied in such a calm , magnanimous , mature image , full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or melodramatic attitude . A letter of Stuart 's which appeared in the N.Y . Evening Post , in 1833 , attested by three gentlemen of Boston , with one from Washington making the appointment for a sitting , proves the error long current in regard both to the dates and the number of this artist 's original portraits . He there distinctly states that he never executed but three from life , the first of which was so unsatisfactory that he destroyed it ; the second was the picture for Lord Lansdowne ; and the third , the one now belonging to the Boston Athenmum . The finishing touches were put to the one in September , 1795 , and to the other , at Philadelphia , in the spring of 1796 . This last , it appears by a letter of Mr. Custis , which we have examined , was undertaken against the desire of Washington , and at the earnest solicitation of his wife , who wished a portrait from life of her illustrious husband to be placed among the other family pictures at Mount Vernon . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist commenced the work , and Washington agreed to sit once more . It was left , intentionally , unfinished , and when subsequently claimed by Mr. Custis , who offered a premium upon the original price , Stuart excused himself , much to the former 's dissatisfaction , on the plea that it was a requisite legacy for his children . Simultaneously with the Lansdowne portrait , the artist executed for William Constable that now in the possession of his grandson , Henry B. Pierrepont , Esq. , of Brooklyn , L. I. Motives of personal friendship induced the artist to exert his best skill in this instance ; it is a fac-simile of its prototype , and the expression has been thought even more noble , of higher significance , and true to the traditional character of the subject , than the Athenmum picture . It has the eyes looking off and not at the spectator , as in the latter portrait . Mr. Constable , the original proprietor , was aid to General Washington ; and // when Lafayette visited this country in 1824 , upon entering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he eiclaimed , " that is my old friend , indeed ! " Colonel Nicholas Fish and General Van Rensselaer joined in attesting the superior correctness of the likeness . The only adequate engraving of the Athenmum picture is the exquisite and faithful one by Joseph Andrews . Mr. Sparks has noted a curious anecdote in relation to Stuart and Washington , which preserves one of the few authentic instances where the chief 's remarkable self-control lapsed into temporary excitement " One morning , " he says , " as the artist approached the house , the street-door and inner-door were open , so that his eye was led directly into the parlor , and , just as he was about to ascend the steps , he saw Washington seize a man by the collar , and thrust him violently across the room . This being an awkward moment to enter the house , he passed on a short distance , but immediately returned and found the President sitting very composedly in a chair . After the usual salutation , his first words were , Mr. Stuart , when you went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , and gave directions that it should remain so , to prevent it receiving any injury , but , when I came into the room this morning , the face was turned outward as you now see it , the doors were open , and here was a fellow raising a dust with a broom , and I know not but the picture is rained . ' It so happened , however , that no essential harm was done , and the artist proceeded with his task . " To obtain the last sitting* the painter is said to have promised , if successful , to present the portrait both of the General and Mrs. Washington to him when finished ; and the result was so satisfactory that the artist determined never to complete the pictures , and thus secure them for a legacy to his family . They remained in the identical state in which they left his easel , the vivid tints unimpaired , the details of each head faithfully worked out , but the shoulders and bust only sketched , and the rest of the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet no finished trophies of American art have been pondered with a more critical and fond gaze by the artists who have subsequently depicted Washington , or with more reverent admiration by the generations of his countrymen who know their peerless benefactor only through history and their faithful resemblance . This master-piece is , however , said to have been rejected when offered to the government ; and it long hung on the door of Stuart 's painting-room on Fort Hill , in Boston . Stuart first painted the full length for Lord Lansdowne , subsequently owned by Mr. Williams , of London . He always declared , that , although ho made twenty-two copies of the original , he could never reproduce it perfectly . The history and comparative merits of these portraits form a curious speculation . If all the facts were known , and all the traits critically noted , the record would prove quite a suggestive artistic chapter . In the opinion of many not incompetent judges , the full length in Fanenil Hall is the best , after those owned by Messrs . Williams and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured by a mere accident . A mediocre English painter , Winstaley , had the audacity to propose to Stuart , at Germantown , to visit his studio in Philadelphia , and give a stroke or two of his riding whip to some copies he had painted of the famous portrait , in order that it could be said they received the last touches from Stuart 's own hand , he to share in the profits as well as the imposture . The indignant painter threatened to throw his impertinent visitor out of the window ; but the latter , not a whit discouraged , afterwards drove a thriving trade with his spurious collection . Among his victims was a Federalist merchant of Boston , better versed in politics and commerce than the fine arts . who purchased and gave one of these literally " counterfeit presentments " to the rrown Hall ; the deception once known , the wits of the democratic party so overwhelmed the unlucky donor with their merciless gibes , that , in mere self-defense , he paid Stuart six hundred dollars for the painting which now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdote , the artist , between his pinches of snuff , used to complain of his involuntary patron for having paid him in uncurrent notes on which there was a large discount . Mr. Bingham , of Philadelphia , earnestly pleaded with Stuart to allow him to pay for Lord Lansdowne 's commis // sion , that he might enjoy the honor and gratification of presenting it to that nobleman . This request was acceded to , but the artist was subsequently much annoyed by discovering several engraved copies of this work , of inferior execution , on a book-seller 's counter , in Philadelphia , to whom they had been sent , with a pompous advertisement , by a print-seller in England . The President of the Pennsylvania Academy previously refused Winstaley permission to copy the portrait belonging to that institution , without the artist 's consent ; but the law of copyright , especially in regard to works of art , was then unsettled , and Stuart was doomed to suffer incalculable wrong , both in his purse and reputation , by the unauthorized and inadequate reproduction of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the possession of Mr. Pierrepont , of Brooklyn , is remarkable for its animated expression ; that in the State House at Newport , Rhode Island , is admired by critics for the apt and careful moulding of the brow and the purity of the coloring ; the drooping angle of the eyelids is also a noticeable peculiarity . As a work of art , it offers a great contrast to two portraits from the same hand , in the neighboring Redwood Library , executed in boyhood . Of these two invaluable copies , the first , as before stated , was painted for Mr. Constable , and the second presented by the artist to the favorite town of his native State . The usual objection to Stuart 's Washington is a certain feebleness about the lines of the mouth , which does not correspond with the distinct outline of the frontal region , the benign yet resolved eye , and the harmonious dignity of the entire head ; but this defect was , as we have seen , an inevitable result of the loss of teeth . In view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period , and the age of Washington , we can not but congratulate ourselves that we have so pleasing and satisfactory a portrait , and exclaim , with Leslie , " how fortunate it was , that a painter existed in the time of Washington , who could hand him down looking like a gentleman ! " Dr. Marshall , brother of the Chief Justice , said that Washington did not resemble Pine 's portrait , when he knew him , and that Wertmuffler 's had too French a look , but that Stuart 's was " prodigiously like . " A more decided and magnetic expression is , indeed , desirable ; a more emotional phase would reveal the heroic fire that lay beneath that calm look ; but it was no fault of the painter that this was not attained . After several attempts to bring that noble but restrained soul to the surface , to make that calm eye flash and those patient features light up with excitement , Stuart , one day , after making every preparation for his sitter , left his studio a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrupulous punctuality and exaction of it in all with whom he had to do , the artist waited in an adjoining room until he heard a loud exclamation and the rapid steps that told of a chafed mood . Then he entered , respectfully greeted Washington ( who sternly resumed his seat ) , seized his palette , and , after a few toliches , apologized by confessing he had practiced the ruse to call up a look of moral indignation , which would give spirit to his delineation . Opinions are quite diverse in regard to the Wertmuller portrait . There are many points of executive merit in the original not completely rendered in the engraving ; the air of the head , the grave and refined look , well-arranged hair , neat ruffles , and old-fashioned coat , sprinkled at the shoulders with powder , at once give the somewhat vague yet unmistakable impression of " the portrait of a gentleman . " There is an expression of firmness and clearsightedness , and an erect , brave attitude which reveals the soldier ; and there is more animation than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latter trait is probably that which led to the selection of this picture as an illustration to Irving 's Biography . It offers a contrast to the adolescent head by Wilson Peale , and the venerable face by Stuart , to be attached to the succeeding volumes . Of the history and claims of the original work , the following statement of a Paris correspondent gives the facts credited by the admirers of the portrait : " It was painted b*r the celebrated Wert. muller , in 1795 , at Philadelphia , who went to ; the United States for that express purpose ; and has not only the merit of being a magnificent painting , but the only portrait of him taken at that period-at a time before age had left its marks-indeed , in the prime andvigor of his life . The picture was at one time taken to Washington , when the price was held at // 1855 . Wind and Rain . Minister at Brussels , made an offer ; but I have induced the owners to hold on until I can hear from the patriotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wertmuller was derived from a superb picture of Dame , which , for some time , occupied a nook , curtained from observation , in the studio of the late Henry Inman , of New York , and had been exhibited in Washington City , thirty years ago . There was fine drawing and rich color in this voluptuous creation-enough to convey a high idea of the skill and grace of the artist . With this picture vividly in the mind , it is difficult to realize that the chaste , subdued portrait of Washington was from the same hand . Yet granting the assertion that Wertmilller executed such a portrait from life , there seems reason to question the originality of that from which the engraving in Irving 's Biography is taken . A writer in the Evening Post , of the 17th of March last , states that a French gentleman , M. Le Grand , being under obligations to the eminent lawyer Cornelius J. Bogart , presented exactly such a picture , believed to be an original , to his daughter , which is at present owned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this country is said to have been given by Washington to Baron Wahrendorf , a Swedish nobleman , who was here from 1795 to 1797 , and who took it to Sweden , where it remained in his family until the death of its head , when it became the property of Mr. Cazenove , from whose estate it was transferred to the present owner . On the other ha*I , it is confidently asserted , that Washington invariably noted in his diary his sittings to portrait painters , and that no entry appears in reference to this picture . Its claim to originality is , therefore , questioned ; with the impatience of the whole subject , however , that Washington confessed he may , at last , have ceased to record what became a penance , and were the picture satisfactory in other respects , we should not be disposed to complain that it was skillfully combined from other portraits . But , in our view , the engraving , at least , has intrinsic faults . It is neither the Washington familiar to observation as portrayed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression about the mouth , not visible in Stuart 's or Trumbull 's heads , and out of character in itself ; the eyebrows are raised so as to indicate either a supercilious or a surprised mood , both alien to Washington 's habitual state of mind ; it is impossible for the brows to be knit between the eyes , and arched over them at the same time , as in this engraving ; the eyes themselves have a staring look ; the animation so much wanted is here obtained at the expense of that serenity which was a normal characteristic of the man ; we miss the modesty , the latent power , the placid strength , so intimately associated with the looks as well as the nature of Washington ; the visage is too elongated ; compared with the Athenienra portrait this picture has a common-place expression ; it does not approach it in moral elevation ; we should pass it by in a gallery as the likeness of a gentleman and a brave officer , but not linger over it as the incarnation of disinterested , magnanimous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impressive , and superior aspect to Washington , and divided him , by an infinite distance , from the mob of vulgav heroes-@@79932 THE KANSAS QUESTION . I N the year 1850 , it was decreed by .1 . conventions of the whig and democratic parties , representing three-fifths , at least , of the people who concern themselves with politics , that the compromise measures were a final settlement , " in principle and substance , " of the question of slavery . Mr. Webster , who had contributed so much talent and reputation to their success , congratulated himself , and the country , as he drew near his death , that there was then no part of the territory of the United States in which this subject had not not been determined and disposed of by positive law .. The President of the nation , even , in his first message , was impelled to speak of those measures as having " given renewed vigor to our institutions , and restored a sense of repose and security to the public mind throughout the confederacy ; " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he had power to avert it , during his administration . " Yet , those measures had scarcely been promulged at the outermost limits of our empire , their great advocate of Massachusetts was hardly cold in his grave , the President himself was but warm in his chair , when the agitation of the slavery question broke forth anew , with a universality and earnestness of feeling never before equaled . It seemed as if all the warring winds of opinion were loose , and , as a distinguished senator aptly quoted , " Eurns Notusque runat , creberque procellis , Africus Slavery became at once the real and vital question of the day . It vibrated in every heart , and burned on every tongue . Older issues were dropped in the intense excitement it occasioned ; the ancient rallying , cries , once so potent in marshaling the electoral lieges around the standards of their leaders , grew as charmless as the blasts of fish-horns , and the freshest of political frenzies , which , a yeat. before , swept over the land like a torrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foam by the opposing waves of this greater agitation . Thus , the hopes of a long era of political quiet , engendered by the recon ciling action of Congress and the conventions , were dashed to the ground , and the flames of former feud , extinguished for a brief time , were kindled once more into a livelier energy and glow . But there is a peculiarity in the revived commotion , which it is impossible not to remark . During the earlier periods of anti-slavery excitement , it was mainly confined to men of ardent temperaments and extreme opinion , to abolitionists , strictly so-called ; but , as things are now , it is shared by men of tempered and conservative disposition . The cautious and the wise-heads silvered over with age , and hearts which experience has taught to beat in measured pulses-are joined with more enthusiastic spirits in a common cause . It is , indeed , no exaggeration to describe the feeling at the North as general . If we except the smalljoint-stock association which draws the udders of the federal government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the elder Bourbons , forget nothing and learn nothing , there is not a thinking man among us who is not absorbed in this topic of the domination and spread of slavery . Whence this change ? Why are the halcyon expectations , which crowned the compromises as a halo , dispersed ? Why are minds , the least quick to catch the impulses of the times , carried away by a prevailing sentiment ? Why are they compelled into coalition with those for whom , a little while ago , they felt no sympathy , and whose plans of policy generally they disapproved ? There is an effect , as we see , and there must be a cause . Is it that the hereditary antislavery sentiment of the North has received some new and mysterious access of violence , like a fever which recurs in a more malignant type ? Is it that the people of the North have been suddenly seized with some irrational ammosity towards their brethren of the South , and rush forward , blindly , to the perpetration of au unprovoked injustice ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent movement . It is a legitimate fruit of circumstances  --  a natural and normal development of events , which any sagacious student of cause and effect , in the moral sphere , might have predicted , // and which , indeed , was predicted by many in the deepest lull of 1850 . In the first place , there can be no finality in politics , except in the cstablishment of justice and truth . Where society is divided on a principle , and that principle involves , beside its moral issues , vast practical interests , no parliamentary device or legislative expedient can put a stop to the discussion of it -- -no compromise or temporary adjustment of it can settle it forever . The very attempt to settle it , in this way , though it may succeed in quelling an existing vehemence of agitation , will , in the end , provoke a still more vehement reaction . For the mind of man is , in its nature , vital and irrepressible ; you may force it down , but you can not keep it there ; its inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spring , perhaps , it will tear into shreds the cords by which it was bound . When the compromisers of 1850 , therefore , undertook to suppress , in effect , the discussion of slavery , they undertook what was plainly impossible ; and much of the exacerbation which has since arisen must be referred to a natural revolt against that impracticable enterprise . But , in the second place , there is to be remarked a special cause for the late outbreak of anti-slavery feeling , and particularly for its appearance among those classes which have not heretofore manifested a strong tendency in that direction . It is this : that a gigantic fraud , as they esteem it , has been committed in the name of slavery  --  a surreptitious and dishonorable act has been perpetrated in its behalf , which has aroused a keen sense of wrong , which has brought with it a humiliating consciousness of vassalage on their part , and filled the dullest understandings with apprehensions for the security of our future liberties . The Kansas-Nebraska bill , which repealed the Missouri Compromise-sprung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress not chosen in reference to it ; hurried through the forms of legislation , under whip and spur , by a temporary majority ; alleging a falsehood in its very terms , and having the seizure of a vast province , secured to freedom by thirty years of plighted faith , as its motive-was the fatal signal which , after astounding the nation by its audacity , rallied it to battle . The repeal of a statute , which for nearly half a century had been regarded as irrepealable , and which , whether rightly or not , had come to be invested in general reverence with somewhat of the sacredness of a constitutional compact-the repeal of it , too , without having been called for by a single soul , under a false pretense , and by an arbitrary enforcement of parliamentary rules , struck the people everywhere with surprise , and those of the North particularly with consternation . A few months before it occurred , the very abettors of the transaction had pronounced it impossible . The committee of the Senate which reported it had pronounced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at that time , have pronounced it equally impossible , had his opinion been asked ; yet it was repealed by the simple declaration , which all the world knew to be untrue , that it had been rendered inoperative by the legislation of 1850 ! Marvelous assurance , but still more marvelous suc-cess ! We shall not inquire here whether the Missouri Compromise was originally proper or not ; averse as we are to compromises in general , we are not sure that it would not have been better for all sides to have settled the dispute at that time on a basis of principle , and at all hazards ; but , inasmuch as the South had reaped its share of the benefit proposed by the bargain-inasmuch as its continuance involved , to a considerable extent , the good faith of the South , we are clear , that the disturbance of it by the South was neither honorable nor wise . In accepting the responsibility of the deed , it has , so far as those interests are concerned , which led to it , both lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurned the offer of the territories , when it was made , it would have achieved a moral triumph far more valuable to it than any other immediate success can be . But the virtue of its representatives was not equal to the occasion  --  the spirit of Henry , Wythe , Macon , Jefferson , was not theirs . Or had it , after the act was consummated in Congress , withheld its approval , and manifested a willingness to allow the North a fair chance in the appropriation of land , so long consecrated to freedom by its own consent , there would have been a color of equity in its proceedings , which would have gone far in tempering the horror and // reprobation which the original offense provoked . But here again the South proved unworthy of its opportunities . It has sustained and abetted the lawless invasion of Kansas , by the armed marauders of Missouri . It has sent thither its agents , or allowed them to gowhich is the same thing-in order to subjugate the peaceful settlers , and to impose a peculiar social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acting in the name of the South , is a usurping body . The people of Kansas , overruled by violence at the elections , are not its constituents . It reflects no popular sovereignty , only the sway of the mob ; and they who support its cause , support the ascendancy of the bowie-knife and the rifle over the ballot-box and the law . Under this condition of facts and events , it was very natural that public opinion at the North should be stung into a keen and vivid resentment . Averse as it may have been , as a whole , to any interference with the internal relations of the South ; willing , as it has shown itself , to accept any settlement of difficulties which did not involve an actual approval of the Southern system - hoping that , under a geographical demarcation of the respective regions of slavery and freedom , the causes of dispute would be gradually supplanted by the advancing enterprise , if not by the Christianity and democracy , of the nation-or be reduced , at least , to the smallest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that repeal , and in the conduct by which it has been followed up , nothing less than a rooted determination to extend the peculiar social usages of the South , over the whole West , in the face of contracts and laws , and to the exclusion of freedom . But how , in the name of humanity , could the North listen to the avowal , or witness the incipient steps in the execution of such a scheme , without loudly and sternly protesting against it , and resolving to resist it to the end ? The immediate effect of this repeal , grounded as it was on the absurd doctrine which ascribed full sovereignty and independence to an inchoate political body , and invested a remote dependency of the organism with the most vital functions of the brain and heart , has been to introduce confusion and civil war into the whole system . But the history of this part of its operation is so well and so honestly though rudely told , by the editor of the St. Louis Intelligencer , who resides near the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery , that we reproduce it . Writing in the latter part of August , he says : " The emigration to Kansas has been entirely checked . Emigrants from the northern or free states have ceased to go to Kansas , because they can find as good land elsewhere , not cursed by mob law nor ruled by nonresident bullies . Emigrants from the southern states do not go to Kansas , because they will not put their slave property in peril , by t*king it to a territory where there is a strong free soil element , threatening the security of slaves . Any man of sense might have foreseen the result . Alabama and Georgia may hold public meetings , and resolve to sustain the slaveholders in Missouri in making Kansas s slave state . But their resolutions cornprise all their aid-which is not material ' enough for the crisis . When slaveholders of Alabama and Georgia emigrate , they go to Louisiana , Arkansas , and Texas . They do not come with their slaves to Missouri or to Kansas . Call they that backing their fs-iends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri and Kansas as plague spots of the nation . The southern emigrants shun Missouri and Kansas , because here is the battle-ground between slavery and free soil The result is , Kansas , the fairest land under the sun , is neglected and idle ; occupied only by a few honest and earnest but disheartened pioneers , and lorded over by a dozen or two feudal t*ants of Missouri , who curse by their presence the land they have desolated . In *Iay last the editor of the Intelligencer was in Kentucky , and he met numerous of the most respectable and wealthy farmers of that state , such as form so large a portion of the population of Missouri , who inquired earnestly about the condition of things in Kansas and in western Missouri . They spoke of the intention they had of removing to Kansas or western Missouri , but said they had abandoned it utterly , for the reason that they would never think of taking their families to a region where law was set aside , presses mobbed , and men driven from the country by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of law to anarchy . In a recent trip through several northwestern states we found that the same circumstances were most industriously and fntally used to divert emigration to those states , and to prejudice Missouri and Kansas with every class of people . The most aggravating stories of insults and outrages committed *by Missourians on the persons of emigrants from the old world or from the free states , who are found ascending the Missouri river , are circulated in the newspapers all through the free states ; and it is impossible to conceive of the deep hatred thus generated towards our whole state in the nor*ern half of the Union . " Between these fires Missouri is leading on her languid existence . St. Louis is retarded in a most woeful way . Our railroads creep at snail 's paco We build ten miles while other western states build one hundred In every // Oct. , department of life we feel the paralysis .

Missouri did not demand that repeal . The South never asked it . Atchison solicited it-and , in a moment ot political insanity , the South consented to the wrong , and made the wrong her own . This was the suicide of slavery . Every step since taken has deepened the wrong and enhanced the danger . The free states organized Aid Societies , and sent their men to make Kansas free . It had been free soil by solemn compact for thirty-five years , and they naturally were incensed to see its character changed . The South would have been far more in dig nant if a slave territory had been thus , by an unex*ected act of Congress , been converted into tree soil . The free states had a right to be in. dignant that a life-long compromise had been repealed  --  and the y had a right to keep Kansas free as it had been , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the citizens of Missouri , headed by Atchison and Stringfellow , denounced the northern emigrants as paupers and hirelings , ' because they were sent west with the mone.y of a society ; and so they had county meetings in Missouri and raised money , and sent Missourians to Kansas to make Kansas a slave territory ! Were these Missourians hirelings ' too ? And did these two wrongs make one right ? Atchison and Stringfellow , with their Missouri followers , overwhelmed the settlers in Kansas , browbeat and bullied them , and took the government from their hands . Missouri votes , elected the present body of men , who insult public intelligence and popular rights by styling themselves the Legislature of Kansas . ' This body of men are helping themselves to fat speculations by locating the seat of government ' and getting town lots for their votes .

Tbey have caUed a convention of the people of Kansas , to meet in September next , and frame a constitution for their government . This movement will * *ous***in Kansas , and it bring to northern states that have been for the time stagg*red and confused by the untoward events in K ansas . The next Congress will find , then , this issae before them  --  a free state constitution presented by one portion of the people of Kansas , and the pro-slavery territorial laws of the present fraudulent legislature .

The proslavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional sanction , they are not valid  --  the contest will then be on accepting the constitution presented by the free state people . The free state constitution may p ass the House , but not the Senate . But the effect will be as disastrous to Missouri and the South . Kansas will be left to anarchy . The slavery that is there will flee from it and perhaps even the slave property of western Missouri give way under the panic , and seek safety in the cotton fields and sugar plantations of Texas . " It has been the common opinion with thoughtless persons and thick-headed bullies at the west , that the northern and eastern men will not fight . Never was a greater mistake . The sons of New England and of the middle states do not like to fight . They would rather work , plough , build towns , railroads , make money , and raise families , than fight .

" There is much truth here but the most serious part of the evil , serious to North and South alike , is merely hinted at , and not dwelt upon as it deserves . It is this : that the repeal of the Compromise was the practical triumph of a party , which is the worst in its principles , and the most dangerous in its designs , of any party that ever arose in the Republic . We refer to the filibustering propagandists of slavery , whose unquestionable purpose it is to rule the Union , if they can , and if they can not , to set up a southern slave confederacy for themselves . They are few in numbers as yet , though great in influence , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be prodigiously strengthened by success in Kansas . Let us sketch the rise and progress of certain sentiments , briefly , in order to show the bearing of their schemes . When the Constitution of the United States was formed , slavery existed in nearly all the States , but it existed as an acknowledged evil , which it was hoped the progress of events would , in the course of a few years , extinguish . With the exception of South Carolina , there was not a state in which some decided efforts had not been made towards its alleviation and ultimate removal . It was this feeling , to wit , that it was an evil , and that it would soon be abated , which excluded all mention of slavery // by name from the Constitution , and which led to the adoption of such a phraseology , in the parts referring to the subject , that it does not necessarily imply its existence . The Constitution was made for all time , while the makers of it supposed slavery to be but a transient fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger purpose , and not to the temporary exigency . A jurist from the interior of China , who knew nothing of the actual condition of our country , or Justinian , could he nrise from the dead , would never learn , from the mere reading of that instrument , of the existence of slavery . He would read of " persons held to service , " and of certain " other persons , " who were to be counted only as threefifths , in the distribution of representa tive population : but he would never imagine them , unless expressly told , a species of property . The general sentiment was averse to slavery , and the men of the Revolution were unwilling to recognize it , except in an indirect and roundabout way , and then only , as they expected , for a limited period . For many years subsequent to the Revolution , a similar feeling prevailed throughout the South as well as at the North , that slavery was a most unhappy inheritance from colonial times , and that it ought to be got rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapproval that have ever been uttered against the system , may be quoted from the writings of those who were born and brought up under it ; and whenever it was defended , it was defended on the ground , not that it was right or even desirable , but that it was inevitable . " It is fastened upon us , " said the South , " and we must do the best with it that we can . We are like men in a morass , who can not spring at once to the firm land , but who must work their way thither , gradually , as they are able . We trust that Providence has some good end in thus afflicting uswhat it is we do not see-we discover certain incidental goods in our strange relations ; but we must look to God to justify his own dealings to us in this wretched business . " This was the pervading tone ; few regarded slavery as anything less than a curse , and none held it to he a permanent condition . As for the domestic trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as late as 1816 , denounced it , on the floor of Congress , as " heinous and abominable , " " inhuman and illegal , " and Governor Williams , of South Carolina , spoke of it , in one of his messages , as " a remorseless and merciless traffic , " the result of *insatiable avarice , " and condemned " by enlightened humanity , wise policy , and the prayers of the just . " But the miraculous extension given to the cotton trade , by the contrivance of the gin and by the manufacturing industry of Great Britain , produced a vast change in the opinions of the country . As the slave system spread to an unexampled extent , and the hopes of its ultimate extinction diminished , it was found necessary by the slaveholders , in order to justify to their own consciences their adherence to it , and to shelter their conduct from the indignant moral censure of the world , to invent some plea which should be plausible at least , if not well-founded . In pursuance of this need , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divinely allowed , and could not be , therefore , in itself , wrong . They ransacked physiological science , to establish the inferiority of the black race , and the consequent duty of protecting it and educating it to labor . They began to interpret the designs of Heaven , and to contend that slavery was to be made an instrument in raising the enslaved Africans to a knowledge of the industrial arts and Christianity , and in the subsequent civilization , through them , of the vast continent from which they were originaliy taken . All this reasoning , however , implied no more than a temporary state of slavery , making it probationary or propmdeutic , and not justifying it as a finality or permanent condition . The motives assigned in apology for it , looked to the future redemption of the slave , to his improvement in the methods of civilized life , and of course to his restoration to a condition in which those methods would avail himself and his race . A sterner logic was required to meet the difficulties of the problem , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to universal conscience-at all times a most embarrassing affair . If slavery were right because only of its probable and ultimate benefits to the slave caste , the inference could not be avoided that the time must come when that caste , or the superior // portions of it at least , might be emancipated . The opponents of the slaveholders might justly taunt them , on their own premises , for continuing the system beyond the period requisite for the fulfillment of its alleged purposes . They might reasonably demand that some definite term be put to the time of this educationary discipline ; that the system , in fact , should be resolved into a species of apprenticeship ; and that the lot of its enforced beneficiaries should be illuminated by some hope or prospect , however distant , of final release . For of what use to the slave , or to his race , would be an education protracted to the hour of his death ? Education is a means to some end , and where the end is withheld , the means is. worthless . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit their fellows in Africa , if they were to be held here in perpetual bondage ? Why teach them knowledge , which , in raising them individually above their original savageness , could only render them more keenly sensible that their out-look embraced no future ? It was hard for the slaveholders to reply , and so the holderamong them shiftedtheirgrounds . They began to discover and to aver that slavery was a good in itself-that it was the natural relation of the two races-that negroes could never be anything more , by the fiat of God , than the servants of the white man ; and that a society constructed upon this arrangement , in which the inferior should do all the work , and the superior exercise the protection and guidance , ( beside enjoying the best fruits , ) was the truest and happiest society that could be conceived . It was a heaven-ordained socialismthoroughly articulated and organized , effective and economical as an industrial machine-benevolent as a provision for the poorer classes , so woefully overlooked in other societies , ample in its furniture of motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rendering the interchanges of life between different ranks , whose interests are radically united , a perpetual reciprocation of gratitude , affection , and care . With this change in opinion , from despairing lament or feeble apology to positive vindication , came a corresponding change in tactics , from defense to aggression . While the greater part of the slaveholders accepted the glorifying view of their system , merely as a politic reaction against the bitter reproaches of the civilized world , or as a pleasant couleur de rose dream-land , into which imagination might escape from the too painful reality , there were others , more daring spirits , with whom argument was action , and of whom it might be said " - Straightforward goes The lightnin* 's path , and straight the fearful path Of the cannon ball . " Without caring a whit for the right or wrong , the good or evil of slavery or of anything else , and animated mainly by an insatiable thirst for power and gain , they found it exceedingly convenient to adopt the philanthropic theory . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion . Slavery is a good thing , ought not to be restricted , but diffused ! There was the whole question ! Why limit so excellent a social institution to the few states that are now basking in its genial beams ? Why not spread the benefits of it over the North ? Why be so cruel as to withhold it from the poor benighted Territories , or from languishing Mexico , or from the wilderness shores of the Amazon ? Or why shut off its natural supplies from the teeming founts of Congo and the Gold Coast ? They were consecutive reasoners , you see , these fellows , and practical men , besides ; and , accordingly , they set to work both to remodel the principles and practices of the South . Exploding the old democratic creed , that man had inherent and inviolable rights , which had been the inspiring faith of the glorious days of the Revolution , and trampling down the once cherished conviction of the sovereign supremacy of the states , within their own jurisdiction , and over everything political which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , they proclaimed that only a particular race of men had rights , that the states were nothing more than departments , that slavery was the one supreme and universal interest , and that it might go everywhere and determine every question . Brave propagandists ! It was to you we owed the breaking down of all old and sacred distinctions , to you we owed our wars for the acquisition of new land  --  to you the spirit of encroachment and aggran // dizement which is abroad  --  to you the filibuster expeditions which disgrace our name  --  to you the fugitive slave law , which would convert freemen into bloodhounds  --  to you the incessant agitation of slavery , and an insolence which hangs the fate of the Union on a constant subservience to its behests ! And now , as the latest step in this career of conquest , as the very coup de grace to our national freedom and the independence of the states , comes this erasure of an ancient landmark , which had stood for thirty years , like a long line of coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be broken Grant this triumph and where will you stop ? On what remote boundary of our possible empire , in what era of unknown time , will your god Terminus erect his altar ? Whither shall we fly to escape your frowns , where look for a rescue from your abhorrent domination ? It must not be forgotten , however , that this small but desperate and determined knot of propagandists would never have achieved the influence they have , if the political parties of the country had maintained their primitive rectitude and honor . Had they continued to fight as Washington and Franklin fought , as Jefferson and Adams and Madison fought , for principles and not small expediencies , there is no local faction that could have made head against them for any length of time . But with suc.cess comes relaxation ; with victory , indulgence ; with prosperity and power , corruption . Our parties , once having tasted the luscious spoils of office , made them the end of their life . They lost the stringency and sternness of conviction , the nobleness and purity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debauched , they fell into the hands of men of small ambitions and cold hearts , their creeds became the merest hodge-podge of contradictory maxims , and their conduct a series of contemptible shifts and doublings , and prostitutions . A late foreign writer , observing from an impartial stand-point , and describing the aspect of our affairs , says , with equal justice and force : - " Few things have more surprised the world than the deterioration of the political men of America . When the United States were a mere aggregate of scantily-peopled colonies , when their principal citizens were planters , shop-keepers and traders , trained up in the narrowness and prejudices and petty employments of provincial life , they produced statesmen and negociators , and administrators and legislators whose names will be forever illustrious in history . Now that they form a great empire , that they possess a large class of men born in opulence , to whom all the schools and universities of each hemisphere are open , who have leisure to pursue the studies and to acquire the habits of political life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerable second-rates . " What other conclusion could he draw , when the chair of Washington and Jefferson has come to be occupied by a Tyler and a Pierce , and the diplomacy of a Franklin and an Adams is represented by that of a Soul* and a Borland ? Yet the decay of leaders would be nothing , were there no evidences of a similar degeneracy in the spirit of society , which unfortunately happens to be the case Our civil life exhibits an almost universal demoralization ; there is scarcely a party among us which holds to any consistent theory of government or law , or which can enunciate two principles that are not utterly incompatible and at war with each other ,  --  while political presses , public documents , speeches in Congress , and even the discourses of the pulpit , are filled with arguments* appeals and denunciations , going to show an utter abandonment of the foundation-principle of our nation , which is the rights of man . A gross materialism , the success of trade , the progress of gain , an external expediency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The grand and beautiful theory which lies at the center of our institutions , their noble humanitarianism , their just and magnanimous recognition of the dignity and worth of every human being , their utter and indignant disdain of the spirit of caste , of exclusion , of selfish aggrandisement , - no longer touch our hearts and kindle them into a fine and generous enthusiasm . Great deeds are not done among us . The atmosphere atound us is cold , and ungenial . We speculate how to get rich ; we build railroads and ships , to increase our stores ; we spy out the neighboring lands which promise us luxurious harvests hereafter ; we return the panting fugitive to his life-long doom ; but the heroic // virtues , the chivalric sentiments , the sweet , and tender , and self-forgetful impulses , which constitute the true and only glories of manhood , we lay aside , forgetting them even in our prayers . " Oh ! reverence , " says the poet , " the dreams of thy youth ! " but the fair dreams of our youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh from the hands of its Creator , unpolluted by the stains of time , should be the home of freedom and a race of men so manly that they would lift the earth by the whole breadth of its orbit nearer heaven , that it should be a light to the struggling nations , holding on high , forever , the standard of justice and humanity-and supplanting the despotism under which mankind had withered , by a rich , and noble , and free republican civilizalion , has passed away from the most of us , as nothing but a dream . We yield ourselves , instead , to calculation , money-making and moral indifference . The prophet of the Lord might again cry in our streets , " How is the gold become dim , how is the most fine gold changed ! " It is a dark view of things we have taken ; not darker than circumstances warrant : and yet , not altogether hopeless . Behind the foul and stormy clouds overspreading the lower skies , and which are but earth-born mists , glimpses are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sordid life of politics , shutting out the sunshine for a time , there is a great , true life , which may yet redeem this people . At the South there are many noble , Christian souls , who have not been withered by the blight of slavery , and to whose generous impulses the creed of the vulgar propagandists is as repugnant as the creed of the pirate . They have thought too long and earnestly of the evil they suffer , to disguise its character , and they are too kind and just in sentiment , to wish to impose it on others . In their prayers and struggles against it , lies the hope of a better issue to the awful question than is contained in the violent solution of the more active men by whom they are , for the present , silenced and overborne . It is to their wisdom and piety that we look for a brighter future . Again , at the North , we are not wholly given up to the idolatry of " Timour-Mammon . " Scattered over the broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurture a race to whom the heavenly law , and not the earthly greed , is the rule of duty . They retain the simple honesty , the masculine vigor , the love of liberty and of God , which came to them from the stern old republican stock of England , from those who fought with Cromwell , and read John Milton . Indeed , in no nation of the world do we believe that more inteffigent , upright , self-sacrificing and energetic men and women are to be found than in this-where the best culture of Europe is so widely diffused , where religion is so free and so active , and where the sweet influences of woman are so heartily accepted . But the misery is , that these virtuous and redeeming classes have been elbowed by the politicians , and their rude herd , into obscurity . Shrinking from the clamor , and meanness , and ribaldry of political exertion , they have retired with disgust into their cottages and fields ; into their stores and workshops , into their parlors and libraries , and they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild beasts , who , having mauled and torn each other , turn at last to rend the innocent citizen , and to desolate the peaceful home . We conceive that in pointing out the two evils to which we have referred , namely , the aggressions of slavery and the corruption of parties , we have struck upon the very mother sins of our career . They are the sources to which may be traced every error and iniquity that we have fallen into : not only external offenses against honor and justice , such as Texan forays and Cuban freebooting , but the deeper inward debasement-the decay and meanness of spirit , which could submit to fugitive slave laws , and other outrages , the most insulting ever inflicted upon a free people : and it will be impossible to retrieve the past until the mighty stream of influences which they pour forth is stopped . Unless there is integrity , self-respect , and decision enough in our society to arrest these gangrenes , they will spread until they have corroded the whole body . Unless there is moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful poisons already in the blood , we may be sure that the circulation will carry them soon to every member , till there shall be no health nor life in us . But these two evils are in reality one  --  or are , at least , reciprocally cause // and effect of each other , inasmuch as they have both the same origin-the departure of the n&amp;tion , in feeling and practice , from the idea in which it was founded . Nations , like man himself , have certain ends or ideals of existence , which constitute the inmost ground or essence of their being , and when they depart from these , they either degrade themselves into some lower form , or grow into monsters . Men who cease to be men , become either animals or fiends . Nations , which lose their constituent principles , fall into barbarism , or rush into some diabolic fury . Their salvation lies alone in their adherence to the great thought which gave them their original organic unity . Now , the great thought , the fundamental idea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all men , secured by equal laws , and defended from invasion , either on the part of the state or of individuals , by the whole power of the state . The peculiarity of organization ' by which this liberty was made sure , was that distribution of power whereby every mature locality was rendered free and supreme in whatever concerned itself solely , yet cooperative in more general spheres , so that there was a perfect equilibrium in the centripetal and centrifugal forces of government , as in the solar system . The great object of the arrangement was the security , the elevation , the freedom of the individual , who , regarded as the child of God , as the joint heir with others of the earth , as an immortal spirit , capable of an infinite growth in love , and truth , and beauty , was too sacred not to be hedged round by every defense , and helped forward by every kind nurture and care . He was the Prince of the Great King , for whom all the granaries were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bells to ring out a joyous welcome . We must return to our fundamental principles , to our primitive spirit , to the noble and manly moral tone , which made us giants in our youth , but in the loss of which we dwindle into dwarfs . No single measure of improvement , nor series of measures , can help us , if we do not recover , along with them , the old inward health and soundness . A restoration of the Missouri Prohibition , for instance , at which so many aim , though important as a sign of repentance , and as a restitution for VOL. vi. - 28 wrong done , would be , in itself , but a first step towards the infinitely greater end , the regeneration of the mind of the people on the subject of slavery . There will be no peace , nor purity , nor noble vigor , until , as a federation , we shall have discharged ourselves of all responsibility for a system vitally at war with its objects . The separate states have a larger and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fidelity to its duties ; they must struggle with their own burdens ; we can not help or relieve them , except by their own consent ; but the confederacy has but one single , plain , and inevitable course . It must be free ! how wildly soever interested factions may rage against the attempt to recover the ground that has been lost , deep and wide as are the delusions which are to be scattered , painful as may be the process of healing , even to the dividing asunder of the joints and marrow , the Republic must be free ! The dearest memories of the past , the saddening aspects of the present , the hopes of the future alike proclaim it as the imperative law of duty for us of the present da7 , that the Republic must be free . As in days of yore " Hills flung that cry to hills around , And ocean-mart replied to mart , And streams , whose springs were yet unfound , Pealed far away the startling sound , Into the forest 's heart . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped from our soil , and the recreancy of our hearts retrieved . There is a time in the history of nations , as there is in the life of the individual , and as there was in the life of Christ , when the Devil carries them up into a high mountain , and offers them all the kingdoms of the earth , if they will but worship him . At such a time have we arrived in our national career . The spirit of evil points us to the vast outlying regions of the globe , and he promises that all these shall be ours , with riches , and power and glory , if we will but covet them and take them ,  --  &amp;id think no more of the other spirit , which only whispers in sadness to our inmost soul , that goodness is better than wealth that truth is greater than power , and that the beauty of a humane and benignant life is the brightest glory of man . Let us beware how we choose ! // EDITORIAL NOTES . AME1i*IOAN LITE1I*ATU1*E AND RE1'RINTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent essay , referring to the tendency of modern science to an extreme division , instances medicine as subdividing itself into a distinct ministry , not only of the several organs of the body , oculists , anrists , dentists , chiropodists , etc. , etc. , but almost upon the several diseases of the same organ . A great benefit , he argues , will arise from this development , provided the sub-dividing tendency can be kept within the limits of the generalizing tendency , so as to retain the unity of the sciences . Yet this remark of his suggests another , which is , that in the midst of this increasing scientific multiplicity the possibility of popularizing it grows more and more out of the question . Every day the gulf is widening between the savan and the popular mind , or even the best literary mind . At the late Scientific Convention , for instance , how many of the papers and discussions were quite beyond the apprehension of all but those who bud made science an object of special study ? In the twelve goodly tomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of it will in reality b. too well-done for general public enlightenment and instruction ? Like our own magnificent State Natural History , it will be addressed to the initiated and not to us profane vulgars . Every rich man will have it in his library , and every Lyceum and Mechanics ' Institute ; yet how few , beside scientific men , strictly so-called , will be able to read it , or do more than refer to it at long intervals ? But must men of science give up their minute and extensive researches on that account ? Must they agree to confine their tasks to a prescribed circle of inquiry ? Must they abandon the large outlying regions of nature of which they are still ignorant , and which invite their scrutiny and penetration ? Not at all : for that were to quit the domain of science altogether , und surrender one of the intellectual characteristics and triumphs of the modern epoch . At the same time , something ought to be done to keep the world , the literary world , at least , aufait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed  --  a class of middle men or interpreters-to stand between the original investigator and the public , and to give the best results of the newest inquiry , in a readable and interesting shape . What an excellent railroad volume , for instance , could be made of our state geology , in which the abstruser terms should be avoided , and still the substance be retained . Of course , the savan himself will not do this ; the greater number of simply literary men are incapable of doing it ; and so we say that a new order of writers is required for that specific purpose . We have said that investigators will not generally undertake this task , because it requires a peculiar kind of talent , not always theirs , for its accomplishment : still , a sufficient number of them have undertaken it , luckily , to enable us to illustrate what we mean , by their own successful labors . In the first rank of a somewhat special , but nervous and lucid treatment of their subject , we should place the " Chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haste of a hand urgent to return to its more legitimate labors , yet feeling a duty to its science and the public , and laying before the world an exposition of the very science which might have been first chosen to show the impracticableness of exposition . Brilliant in manipulation , Liebig hastens into the arena of commerce , puts himself en rapport with the business world , and after showing an enviable faculty of expression , returns with equal facility to the minute labors of the laboratory . So with the comparative anatomist , Owen , incomparable in logical and generalizing powers , he has laid before the learned world , in language as clear as his subject would admit , the most abstruse of researches . In Geology , again , we have another great example ; the popular volumes of Hugh Miller , which , lacking in little of the soundness and the technicality exacted by the man of science , for they almost need the use of a glossary , have still been more read than any thoroughly scientific books we can quote . These , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest the order of sound popular writers who have // recently placed ihemselves between the public and the closets of the philosophers . Schiciden , in the Biography of Plants , has become a kind of Liebig of Botany , and an able though daring innovator to boot . In his wake stand Henfrey , Unger , and Schouw . Then , can we forget the success of Guyot 's " Earth and Man , or Physical *eography of the Globe , " or , the broad and all-embracing Cosmos , and the more special manuals of Lycli ? The name of Lardner has long held a peculiar place in physical science : not endowed with any inventive power , without having in any marked degree contributed to the direct advancement of science , but possessed of practical talent and of lucidity of description rather than of eloquence , his name for many years prominently figured in England as an oracle , is always more or less as the mouth-piece of everything pertaining to natural philosophy ; the explanation of which , and his possession of an unusual faculty of elucidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the busypurveyor of the numerous popular tracts , and text books to the English public . It is to the enterprise of Doctor Larduer the public is indebted for a scientific discourse of a much more lofty character ; that of Sir John Herschel , published in the Cabinet Library . We might add a dozen or two more names to those we have mentioned , not forgetting , among the rest , the admirable papers of Professor Schele de Were , and others , contributed to our own Magazine ; but that we have said enough to show what we mean . It was but lately we asked one of our ablest professors , why the most lovely of pursuits , Botany , which , by dint of classification , has been effectually mummified into the dryest of all subjects-why it was not all written upon from some such half dozen stand points as : The connection of plant life with temperature and latitude , with geological zones of soil : and with plants as influenced by maritime climate , aridity , mechanical conditions , etc. , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clerogens , and-so-forth , together with the further moderate subdivision of no less than about one hundred and thirty families ; and , while he professed the intention of carrying out some such plan , at some future leisure period , one could net help seeing that , in his mind , all this was already pretty much realized , in these fearfully condensed tables of analysis which botanists hold up to you , as masterpieces of condensation and labor-saving obscurity . The man of science , when addressed upon this point , says to you , " Why , my dear sir , if , in a subject like that of the description of nature , we were to undertake the task of popularizing , by making our writings what is more in accordance with literary style , in exchange for our usual succinctness of description , so voluminous is the field of our investigation , that we should almost cover the earth with letter-press . " Then , gentlemen naturalists , we say to you , cover the earth with letterpress , and we will tell you why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Household Words , " now reaching its twelfth volume . You will there learn how much the mass of the reading public will bear to have an idea amplified , turned over in every possible angle of regard , thoroughly exhausted , and the style even diluted , so that clearness and interest may be gained through abundant exposition , rather than mere brevity and condensation with its accompanying meagerness and obscurity . There you will see how little , with the reader , depends upon a numerical array and crowding together of facts , and how much in that which is truly literary in the mode of their presentation . In the collected works of De Quincey , amounting to eight or ten volumes , in which the quality of verbal extension is almost as marvelous as that surfacing property ascribed to some of the malleable metals , the public has not yet expressed itself as at all encumbered . If ten volumes , then , of De Quincey , why not fifty of Agassiz , if they do but excel in literary charm at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas . Look , again , at the collected works of a Herder , of Richter , at the " Memoirs of George Sand , " already reaching seventeen volumes , and not yet complete ; consider whether the world has ever groaned under the prolific pens and the fertility of those popular names ? Are they not rather blessed for their bequests , and likely to be read for all time to come ? And why shoul&amp; not science be made equally popular ?
