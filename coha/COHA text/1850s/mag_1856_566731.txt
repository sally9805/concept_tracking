txt ART . 1. - THE HYPOTHESIS : ITS PLACE IN REASONING . Theory of the iVforal System , including a Possible 1 ? eason* why Sin exists . Hartford : F. A. Brown . 1855 . WE have i this book another instance of theorizing in theology . Ever since men began to think deeply and systematically on religious subjects , works of a similar character have been written , and doubtless , such will continue to appear from time to time , so long as we see through a glass darkly in this earthly state , and great interesting problems of moral science remain unsolved . Kor would we rebuke these attempts to account for the facts in our moral system and vindicate the ways of God to man . It may be objected that these explanations are nnnecessary. - . that it becomes us to trust in God , to confide in his wisdom and rectitude where his ways are unsearchable ; to find our repose in this assurance , that the Judge of all the earth will do right , and not in the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this theorizing on religious subjects . They content themselves with knowing that clouds and darkness are round about Jehovah , that he is a God who hideth himself , and whose ways are past finding out , and they YOL. xix. 32 // would not have the temerity to attempt discovering or elucidating any portion of God 's ways upon which obscurity may rest . We have charity and a measure of sympathy for this class of persons . They conceive that these theories and speculations savor of irreverence , of presumption , of distrust towards God ; that they engender pride of reason and heat of controversy , and vain jangling , and minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith . And it must be admitted that there is some reason for these complaints and apprehensions . Such results have often followed the discussion of a theory or hypothesis , and they are to be deprecated . Better forego these speculations than carry them on with an irreverent and bitter spirit . But such discussions are by no means inconsistent with the Divine glory , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility of the reasoner . We would throw open this whole field . We would give full permission to him who feels disposed , and who is convinced that he could not employ his time or talents to better purpose , to study out and propound his theory . Frame and state your hypothesis , only in obedience to the Christian spirit and the laws of sound reasoning . We do not believe God forbids it . His truth will bear investigation . His character and ways will bear scrutiny . Your intellectual powers were giv*u to be employed . God asks not unintelligent irrational faith . And you need have no fear but enough will remain , after all your efforts , to test your confidence and submission . We would not then forbid theories and hypotheses . We would only caution against the abuses and dangers which often attend them but are not inseparable from them . We would only bid you confine your theory or hypothesis to its legitimate uses . And on the dangers and nses connected with this species of argument we shall have something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a review of the book which has suggested these remarks . It claims to be only a theory . It is one added to the many attempts which have been made to account for the eiistence of sin under the Divine Government  --  to account for it in consistency with the Divine perfections . With the details of the theory , and with the degree of plausibility attaching to it , we are not at present concerned . But it is in place to remark , ( and it is no slight commendation of the author , ) that he evidently understands the nature of a theory and has kept it steadily in view throughout his work . His argument is intelligent , clear , consecutive , logical . The hypothesis in his hand is put to its legitimate use . The book is // uncommonly free from the objectionable and mischievous features which often belong to works of this speculative character . It produces on the mind of the reader no impression dishonorable to God , or his truth , or unfriendly to the spirit of devotion . Its aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The precise object which the author proposed to himself he has distinctly stated ; and it will be seen that he claims for his argument only the strength of a supposition or hypothesis-possible , at least , ( and if possible , it has its uses , ) perhaps plausible or even probable . He sets forth his design in these words : " Were we fully acquainted with the plan of the moral universe , and could we obtain that connected view of it which God has , every doubt , difficulty and objection , in respect either to the doctrines of the Bible , or the dealings of Providence , would instantly vanish ; for we should then see how every part is consistent with every other part ; the precise object of each would appear , and the entire system unfold itself before us , even as it lies in the mind of the Almighty , harmonious , benevolent and grand . So if a system can be ima*jined , consistent with itself , and conflicting with no known truth , while it still contains within itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a certain extent , be attended with the same result . And this result will follow just in proportion to the degree of apparent harmony and plausibility imparted to it . . . . The effort has been to construct such a system , and to give it as great an air of probability as the circumstances of the case will permit . But Whether it shall appear to the reader probable , or only plausible , or even highly improbable , be it remembered , that all that is claimed for it , is simply that it lies within the limits of possibility . " ( Introduction , pp. 19-20 . ) In this extract the author discloses his own correct apprehension of the nature and value of a theory or hypothesis ; and we accord to him the credit of rigidly adhering to the laws of such reasoning . We have spoken of a theory or supposition or hypothesis , using these terms indiscriminately . Though perhaps unnecessary , it may yet be well to state our view of this species of argument . Hypothesis ( *ri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken as synonymous . And there may be this difference between hypothesis and theory , that theory is hypothesis favored or confirmed by independent considerations . It not only is supposed to explain the facts , but is sustained by other arguments . This seems to be the distinction , so far as there is any  --  a distinction , however , which we shall not very carefully observe in this essay . Without making any attempt at abstruse // definition or metaphysical nicety , we simply say , that we have in view that kind of reasoning which is introduced to account for or explain some fact . It is often introduced to remove an objection or difficulty . It assumes certain premises which may be true , and *f they are , they furnish a possible solution of the case . They explain the fact or phenomenon . They silence the objector . They relieve the difficulty . This is a mode of argument very extensively employed , as well in natural science as in morals and theology . On opening , for instance , a work on Geology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories . There are certain palpable admitted facts in regard to the structure or condition of our globe . One school in science would explain them by the agency of water , another by the agency of lire . We turn to natural philosophy ; and here also we find controversies about hypothesis . There are arguments to sustain the hypothesis of one electric fluid , and on the other hand , it is claimed that the theory of two fluids better explains the phenomena of electricity . And light , as it comes to the eye , is it material , does it move in right lines ? Or is it produced by an independent medium and propagated in waves ? Each supposition has its advocates . So in astronomy . There is the nebular hypothesis to account for planets in their various stages of formation . There was the old theory of ignorance and the Yatican , which maintained the revolution of the sun around the earth , while the earth was deemed stationary ; and there is the now received theory , the Copernican , that the motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , the earth is the revolving body . The doctrine of chances , in Logic , partakes of the nature of this argument . A certain supposition is made and the chances are calculated in respect to it . Then are the chances calculated in reference to a certain other supposition . And from such calculations it L judged which supposition is the more probable . The hypothesis is a mode of argument often resorted to in Logic and in pure Mathematics . So prevalent is this mode of reasoning . Indeed a certain philosopher seems to have held that the whole material world is only a hypothesis , not actually existing , but only supposed to exist ; and on this theory an attempt has been made to explain the sensations , perceptions , and actions of mankind . This extensive use of the hypothesis shows that it is a species of reasoning natural and legitimate to the mind ; and that it has its worth within certain limits . If it may be carried into extremes and fancies , so it may also be restricted , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth , both in science and in religion . // The hypothesis may be of several kinds , or rather , may involve different degrees of probability . A supposition may be made which is violent , which shocks our consciousness or our reason . We then say the supposition is inadmissible . It answers not the purpose of a hypothesis , but would create more difficulty than it would remove . The hypothesis of a better sort may assume only that which is possible . But it may be mere hypothesis . It may compel from us the admission that all this may be , but at the same time , and just as likely , it may not . There are no arguments to favor the supposition . It may account for the fact , but either of several other theories would account for it just as well . The hypothesis carried farther becomes plausible or probable . It satisfactorily explains the phenomena . It conflicts not with consciousness or reason ; nor with any known truth or fact . It seems to harmonize with the general analogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purpose it has other considerations in its favor . Such a hypothesis is of value . It is at least good until it is overthrown or something better introduced as a substitute . A hypothesis , to be of the highest worth , must be such as , if admitted , will explain the phenomena or relieve the difficulty ; such as may be admitted in consistency with all known truth ; such as is attended with a degree of probability ; and finally , the simpler and more probable the better . When the premises assumed as hypothesis pass from possibility to probability , and from probability to certainty-when the supposition becomes established truth , ( as may sometimes be the case , ) then the argument passes out of the regiou of hypothesis , and out of the mode of reasoning which we have at present under consideration . It may be well to glance at some of the useful ends to which the hypothesis is subservient . Because it positively proves nothing , it is not on this account without its value . For , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory conclusions , both in natural and moral science . Dr. Gregory , quoted by Stewart , remarks that " hypotheses , proposed in the modest and diffident manner that becomes mere suppositions or conjectures , are not only harmless , but even necessary for establishing a just theom ; y . They are the first rudiments or anticipation of Principles . " " It is not to be questioned , ' * says another writer quoted by Stewart , " but many inventions of great moment have been brought forth by authors , who began upon suppositions , which afterwards they found to be untrue . And it frequently happens to philosophers , as it did to Columbus , who first believed the clouds that hovered // about the continent to be the firm land . But this mistake was happy ; for by sailing towards them , he was led to what he sought ; so by prosecuting of mistaken causes , with a resolution of not giving over the pursuit , they have been guided to the truth itself . " Mill , in his system of Logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , science could never have attained its present state ; they are necessary steps in the progress to something more certain ; and nearly everything which is now theory was once hypothesis . " " Kepler 's great laws in astronomy were at first but hypothesis in his mind . It is stated that he made seventy suppositions concerning the orbit of Mars , and tested them by observation , before he arrived at the true one , that the orbit is an ellipse with the sun in one of the foci . This was found to correspond with observation . Then he proceeded to the hypothesis that the orbits of all the other planets are similar . This too was found to accord with the facts of observation . Thus was established his first great law that the planets revolve in elliptical orbits , the sun being in one of the foci . So too it was with Newton 's great discovery of the law of gravitation . Gravitation , as we call it , brings the falling apple to the earth . Why may it not control the motions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposition he tested . It agreed with observation and calculations . Why may not this same law prevail throughout the solar system ? Will facts agree with such a supposition ? The revolutions of every known planet in the system were found to coincide with the theory ; and hence , hypothesis passed into established law . " Of fortunate hypotheses concerning the laws of nature , " says Stewart , " Franklin 's sagacious and confident anticipation of the identity of lightning and electricity is one of the most remarkable . " And Dr. Walker , ( Editor of Reid on the Intellectual Powers , ) affirms that llarvey ' * theory of the circulation of the blood began in a conjecture founded on the doctrine of the final causes . So a theory may be propounded concerning the will , or concerning some doctrine in theology , or concerning God 's moral system ; and around that theory may gather one corroborating circumstance after another , one degree of probability after another , until finally the mind may settle down upon it , as the true and sati*factory explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of investigation and leads on to discovery . Hypothesis passes from the possible to the probable , and from the probable to ascertained truth , when hypothesis has had its perfect work and the mind rests in the assurance of discovered truth . // 487 But where theory does not accomplish an end so satisfactory , it still has its uses . In religious matters , it may relieve the mind of a believer . The Christian may have difficulty in reconciling the admission of sin , into a moral system , with the Divine benevolence . This is a difficulty which has perplexed and distressed many an ingenuous mind ; as the multiplication of theories on the subject amply shows . Nor do we claim that any theory , however ingenious or plausible , can wholly remove the difficulty . Only confidence in God , the grace of a regenerate heart , hath this recompense of reward . But propound to that distressed mind some hypothesis according to which sin might originate consistently with the holiness and benevolence of God , and your hypothesis , be it only possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many an inquiring devout spirit has believed God perfect in his character and ways , while here was the existence of sin an actual and to him inexplicable fact . He believes in both the benevolence of God and this awful ruin under his government . He believes the two things consistent , but longs to see how . He devises some theory which allows him to say so much as this ,  --  ' According to my theory there may be no incompatibility between the two ! In this method ' - it may be the theory of Realism , or the theory of individual preexistence , or the theory of the book before us , or any other- ' I can see God 's ways vindicated . It may not be the true way , or the best way , or satisfactory to others , but it is a method allowable , and in it I find a dawning of light and comfort , a foundation of intellectual repose . Again : TIme hypothesis , which really establishes nothing , may suffice to silence the objector . He may often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The atheist broaches the supposition that the universe may be the work of chance . We oppose him with the supposition that it may be the product of Infinite Wisdom , and then compare the probability attaching to each hypothesis . The Infidel offers the hypothesis that Christianity may be the work of designing men . We confront him with the theory that it may have had a divine origin , and then inquire which supposition is the more reasonable or probable . The Skeptic throws out his conjecture ( for it can by no possibility be anything more ) that there may be no future state of retribution . We throw out with equal authority our hypothesis that there may be a hereafter . If either is only a bare hypothesis , then one has no advantage over the other ; except it be on the principle that in a doubtful case it is wise to be on the safe side , prepared for the worst . But if one hypothesis be more probable than the other , then are we bound // to embrace the one to which belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine of two natures in Christ , we reply , It may be that the Divine Spirit could be united with humanity as well as mind and matter could be united . To him who cavils at the doctrine of regeneration , . we reply , that as the blowing of the wind is a fact , , whether susceptible of explanation by us or not , so regeneration may be a reality , though we can not explain the process . Or we may go farther and state our hypothesis : be it that which makes man active or that which makes him passive in regeneration , if only it be such as is possible or admissible , it cuts off the objector from all right to cavil at the doctrine , thereafter , as impossible or absurd . This value attaches to any one of several hypotheses , in a case where either would furnish an adequate solution . If , for example , several theories are proposed to show how the human will may be free , and yet all its determinations be foreordained and foreseen of God-if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we need not stop to ascertain which is the true hypothesis before confronting the objector . We may safely say to him , that we have propounded a solution which he can not deny may be true , according to which human liberty and divine decrees are not incompatible . Hence he is not authorized to declare the holding of these two doctrines at the same time to be absurd . lie must not pronounce them irreconcilable , for our theory , if it has proved nothing else , has shown this , that the two views may be harmonious . This we say is the value of either among several hypotheses , each of which would answer the purpose of establishing a possibility . If there is only one hypothesis admissible , it may be said , that its value is on this account enhanced , because it is the only solution to which we can resort , the only hinge on which a question turns . It should be remarked in this connection , that a hypothesis may be of force against one objector and one species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the argument of Butler 's Analogy . It would be unjust to call that work simply a hypothesis or theory . And yet it may be viewed in this aspect . The main drift of his argument may be thus expressed , as against the Deist : If you can admit God the Author of Nature and Providence , notwithstanding the diffi* culties in the way of such an admission , why not admit that God is the Author of Revelation , when there are no greater or more numerous difficulties attending this admission ? This species of argument would be perfectly sound and conclusive // 18*3. like Hypothesis : its Place in Reasoning . as against the iDeist ; but against the Atheist it would have no force . It does not meet the latter on common ground . It assumes that which he denies . You can not press him with the difficulties of Nature as compared with those of Revelation for he does not allow that God is the Author of either . So , if you attempt to account , as is often done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the theory or hypothesis that the influence of this atonement may reach to other races on other planets , the argument would hold good for one who admits this plurality of worlds ; but with one who denies the existence of other races and other inhabited worlds , the supposition would have no weight . While treating of the uses of a hypothesis , it should also be remarked that argument may often be put in this form with great frrce . For example , we may present it to the Infidel as our theory or hypothesis , that Christianity had a divine origin ; that thus we account for its miracles , its history , and the prophecies concerning it . And , as he rejects this theory , we call upon him to give us his hypothesis . Here are certain undeniable facts which it is as imperative upon him as upon us to explain . Christianity is an existing fact  --  a system of vast extent and power . Account for it , for its origin , spread , duration , triumphs ; its apostles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originated that character and life ? ) its effects , to instruct , convict , comfort , reform , revolutionize . Give us your theory to account for all this . We have given you ours . Imposition , fanaticism , priestcraft , kingcraft-give us some theory which will rationally account for those palpable and momentous facts . Probably the infidel is never more puzzled than when called upon in this manner to account for the rise and extension of Christianity . There may be difficulties connected with the theory of its divihe origin , but the infidel must see that there are more and greater difficulties connected with any other theory on the subject . There may be difficulties in admitting the truth of the Gospel , but there are greater difficulties in denying its truth . So in arguing with the Atheist . Here are all the existences of creation , and all the adaptations we see in nature . Whence came they ? Our theory is that they had a Divine author . This is more than theory or hypothesis ; it is an established , necessary conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it forward only as our theory . The supposition on which we account for these existences and adaptations is the doctrine of an Eternal Being of infinite perfections-the Creator . This supposition will account for the facts . This is our theory . And we suspect that the Atheist is // never more confounded ( save when the Spirit of that God whom he denies , convicts him of his guilt ) than when he is called upon to give his explanation of these palpable facts-his explanation in place of the one which he rejects . So might one be reasoned with who denies the genuineness or divine origin of revivals of religion . Here are marked facts in the experience of men . They are to be explained . We hold the theory of Peter , " This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel : And it shall come to pass in the last days , saith God , that I will pour out of my Spirit . " This theory will explain all the facts . Another theory will explain some of the facts , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or caviler rejects it . Give us then your theory . And in the attempt , if he be intelligent and candid , he will find it irnpossible , on any supposition of his own , to account for al ? the facts without conflicting somewhere with his own consciousness , or experience , or observation ; or with some settled principle of mental philosophy , or common sense . But these illustrations will suffice to show how a hypothesis , or an argument thrown into the form of a hypothesis , may be made very pungent and convincing . Allusion was made in the early part of this Article , to the apprehensions felt by some in reference to theories or hypotheses ; and it was conceded that these apprehensions are not altogether unreasonable . It is fit , therefore , that we give some attention to the dangers connected with this method of reasoning , and saggest a few cautions to be observed . It should be granted , perhaps , that there is some danger of irreverence towards Scripture and the God of Scripture . In arriving at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is danger that we shall not interrogate nature with sufficient deference and patience ; that we shall not bow in submission as we ought to facts , but with presumption and rashness advance to our deduction . So , in moral and religions reasoning , when we leave the domain of definite , revealed truth , there is danger that we shall be self-confident . As , in the process of theorizing , we rest upon our own powers , there is danger that we may arrogate to ourselves an authority , a sort of infallibmhty , growing out of pride of reason , which shall move us to treat disparagingly the Word of God . The self.sufficiency of the theorizer may proceed to the degree of setting aside somne ascertained fact , or revealed truth . A conflict between a known truth and a hypothesis , is fatal to the hypothesis . And yet , not unfrequently , the author becomes wedded to his theory , and he wIll try to explain away // the fact or deny the collision , rather than acknowledge the discrepancy . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scripture , there is danger of his attempting to explain away the doctrine that his theory may stand . *e will make Scripture and the sound laws of interpretation bend to his theory instead of framing his theory in deference to their authority . He has persuaded himself that his philosophy is correct . This must stand , whatever else is obliged to give way before it . Even a Thus saith the Lord ' must be modified or explained away , and Scripture must be wrested and handled deceitfully . We do not say that any such dishonesty in regard to facts or doctrines , is necessarily connected with the use of the hypothesis . And yet there is a temptation in this direction . There is danger that he who has devised some ingenious theory and brooded over it , and committed himself to it , ( and particularly if he has published his theory to the world , ) will be biased in his examination of those facts or doctrines which militate against it . Would that this declaration of danger were not so amply sustained by history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered more than from the uncandid use made of them , and the unfair interpretations put upon them by persons who had some preconceived theory to sustain . Their object seems to have been , not to test their theory by Scripture , but to find support , or to manufacture it , for their theory from Scripture . A man adopts , for instance , the hypothesis ( it can be nothing more ) that it is inconsistent with the divine benevolence to pyinish the sinner . And now see how he will explain away the passages which declare future retribution . He assumes that the Gospels are not inspired ; now see how he explains away the miracles . He assumes that Christ was a mere man ; and now he is ready to limit or explain away his divine titles , and attributes , and works , and the clearest attestations to his divinity . Even in controversies between men substantially sound in the faith , we can not but discover sad evidence of prejudice and frailty , as we see them propound interpretations , evidently biased by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who has thus identified himself with a theory , to look upon texts which have a bearing upon it with a quite dispassionate mind . Of course , all this which is now stated , implies that in such a case undue authority is attached to the theory . It is held as established and immutable truth to which all other must conform . Instead of this , it should be held as what it is ) supposi // tion or hypothesis , maintained if you please until disproved or shown to be improbable ; but always held in subordination to evidence , to be modified or rejected , should new light and evidence so require . Had this caution been conscientiously observed , we are persuaded the Word of God would , in many an instance , have received different treatment at the hand of expositors and controversialists . As irreverence towards God and scripture is sometimes connected with a theory or hypothesis , so are arrogance and uncharitableness towards one 's fellow-men . It is not unfrequently the case that a person who advances a new theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shed that light after which men have groped so long , and which he was in the providence of God , raised np to communicate , sets forth his philosophy in a tone of arrogance and self-sufficiency , which is quite unwarranted . As if he were setting forth , not his own speculations , but some verity of divine revelation . And connected with this spirit will be uncharitableness . He has invented his theory . He has expended upon it thought and pains . It is dear to him , and very satisfactory . Tie is confident it ought to be as conclusive and precious to all others . He scarce knows any difference between it and Scripture . Consequently , if any person appreciates not its worth , it must be owing to some intellectual deficiency or moral obliquity . The author of the theory sees not how his neighbor can be sensible and honest , and yet reject or lightly esteem that theory . He says so . He denounces his opponent , calls him hard names , perhaps even calls his piety in question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed doctrine ; he is only questioning some philosophy of a doctrine , some additions and explanations of art , or man 's device . Uncharitableness in defense of a theory may be carried to the point of persecution . It was the theory or hypothesis of the old popish infallibles that the earth stood still and the sun revolved around it . Galileo held a different theory . He supposed the earth the moving body . The disciples of Aristotle , Inquisitors and Jesuits , denounced him as a heretic . The old philosopher was sentenced to imprisonment and then to exile . And his experience was not more severe than has been that of many others who have suffered inward tortures and crucifixion , whe*jhe matter in question was only a theory . If any one would e reminded of the bitterness and persecution which a conflict of theories may engender , let him consider the fierce contests of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , between the Nominalists and Realists . They would wage war and shed blood over the question , // " What is the precise meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tree , for instance . Is there an actual existence in nature corresponding to this general term ? Or has every tree some individual peculiarities of which the general term " tree " is divested . Has there ever existed a generic man , ( Adam , ) something else or something more than an individual ? The Nominalist had his theory , the iRealist his . And out of such questions actually grew persecutions and wars . Look at two good men , Luther and Zwiugle , who differed in their theories about the mode of Christ 's presence in the Eucharist , ( both admitting the fact of his presence , ) and on account of this difference of theory entertaining an enmity which was life-long . If now it is said that in some instances like these , men suppose they are contending for more than hypothesis or speculation , even for doctrine , or that on which doctrine rests , then is there manifest need for the caution we are about to state , viz , to distinguish clearly , and never lose sight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is danger that he who begins with stating a hypothesis , will proceed to advoeate it as a theory , and end with holding and urging it as an article of doctrine . Broaching it at first as a possibility , he regards it afterwards as a certainty . Beginning with it as a speculation , he converts it into a dogma and inserts it into his creed . Beginning with it as a human opinion or conjecture even , he ends with installing it as of divine authority . And as he thus proceeds to deify his theory , he waxes indignant against those who do not magnify his notions with him ; until when he has exalted his views to their apotheosis , the rejecting of them is blasphemy . Hence the persecution of which we have spoken . Hence Jewish persecution against those who rejected the traditions of the elders . Hence Papal persecution against Protestants . Hence much of the asperity and strife betwen religious controversialists of modern times . How much heat and enmity would have subsided , had the combatants only stopped long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contending for a truth of Scripture , or for some hypothesis , theory , or philosophy ? For , some doctrine , or for some favorite explanation of doctrine ? " Here is a distinction of vast importance , and were it always observed , it would save much denunciation and uncharitableness . Is your opponent only propounding a theory or hypothesis ? Does he positively assert nothing ? Then , of course , you have nothing to absolutely deny ; any more than the opponents of Plato ( in a case quoted by Cicero and Whately ) had a right to deny the actual // existence of a ring of marvelous property , which the philosopher only supposed by way of illustration . If your adversary is only advancing some hypothesis , some possible solution , affirming nothing , then surely you have no authority ( quoad hoc ) to pronounce him a heretic . So , also , if his hypothesis conflicts , not with some known fact or Scriptural declaration , but with some favorite hypothesis of your own , he should not be condemned for that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not mistaken , this is a point which needs to be guarded . We suspect men have denounced theories as unscriptural , when the simple truth was that those theories were inconsistent , not with Scripture , but with some other theory . It should also be well considered and remembered on both sides of a controversy , that the inferences from a hypothesis or theory are only of the same nature with that from which they rise ; and are not necessarily a part of revelation . After following out a theory and reaching the inferences , men are apt to lose sight of the point from which they started and proceed to assert or denounce , as if by this time they had become invested with Divine authority ; forgetting that the superstructure can be no more solid than the foundation . The inference from a hypothesis can not be more certain than the hypothesis upon which it is built . This subject of inferences is of no small importance , as is well known to those who have observed controversies even a little . Let care be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as such and not as heretical declarations . Let equal care be taken to claim for similar inferences of your own only that possibility or probability to which they are entitled . Sharply distinguish then between hypothesis and assertion , between doctrine and the philosophy of doctrine . The doctrine is revealed from God . As to that there is an end of questioning and strife . If now you wish to give an explanation or philosophy of doctrine , you are at perfect liberty to do so , only remember that you are treading on different ground . You have not now the authority of high Heaven for what you say . Carry yourself accordingly . Treat your opponent accordingly . Let it always be observed by both believer and sceptic that here are two different things . There is the fact and the hypothesis to account for it . There is the doctrine and the theory or philosophy of the doctrine . Keeping this in view will often save the believer from uncharitableness and rebuke the sceptic for his unbelief . As there is danger on the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be danger of confounding doctrine with hypothesis ; as the sceptic does // when he says that religion is all hypothesis and theory . And possibly his confusion is owing in some measure to the confusion just adverted to on the part of believers and controversialists . He sees them contending for theories as if they were doctrines ; he sees them denouncing each other for theoretical differences as for rejecting an article of revealed truth ; he sees them losing sight of these momentous distinctions . - Consequently he throws away all distinctions himself , and says all religion is only a hypothesis . But there is a difference between ascertained truth and a theory respecting it . There are different theories respecting the nature and propagation of light , yet no one is on this account skeptical respecting the existence of light . There are different hypotheses to account for the existence and phenomena of storms , yet the storms themselves are a very palpable reality . And in such cases men are at no loss to distinguish between the fact and the philosophy of the fact . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may discuss them , but meanwhile we must not allow the fact itself to be drawn in question . So between the revealed doctrine that the dead shall be raised and a theory on the question , " With what body do they come ? " a clear distinction is to be observed . There is the doctrine of the Trinity . The doctrine itself we must admit on Divine authority ; the philosophy of the doctrine is debatable ground . The reality of Heaven is one thing . Its precise nature is another . So of hell . The fact of our connection with Adam , and our depravity and death in consequence , is not to be denied . The nature and mode of this connection may afford room for discussion and theory . That holy angels have not fallen while holy Adam did , we accept as a revealei truth . If now you give us your hypothesis to account for the difference , ( as is done in the " Theory of the Moral System , " ) we are ready to hear it as your hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it appears probable . That the fallen angels were not redeemed while man was , we receive as a truth on the authority of Scripture . When now you proceed to give the hypothesis by which you account for the distinction God made between us and them , we are willing to hear you respectfully , only you must remember that you are now on different ground from the sure word of Revelation . The atonement too , we are informed concerning its reality and efficacy for our own race . We are taught certain things concerning the impression it makes upon principalities and powers in heavenly places . And now if you please you may travel beyond the sacred record and tell us what you sup . pose to be its effect upon the universe of worlds , provided only // you advance your views as a supposition or theory . We may admit that you are on legitimate ground ; but you must at the same time admit that you are not on Scriptural ground ,  --  your position is non-Scriptural , though perhaps not anti-Scriptural . Scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( save piety itself , ) than to understand and practically keep in view the true nature and uses of the hypothesis or theory . It is important for every believer , in order to the intelligence and soundness of his faith , that he first understand what is positively revealed doctrine : and then that he draw a broad line of discrimination between that and human opinions . The declaration of Scripture is certain . The hypothesis , theory , philosophy , may be possible , reasonable , probable even . But it has not the seal of God upon it . Of course , this clear discrimination is of consequence to the controversialist . He should know whether he is contending for some doctrine of God 's Word or for some theory respecting that doctrine . And with equally clear discrimination should he be able to determine for which of these objects his opponent is doing battle . If the matter we question be a truth of Holy Writ , then is he bound to be , not harsh and denunciatory , but positive and uncompromising . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation or theory , on which the Scriptures are silent , then should he remember that here good men may differ . Of none the less importance is this subject to the preacher . Let him determine which he is preaching . If it be the express Word of God , let him preach it as such with all the authority of high Heaven . But if , instead of positively revealed doctrine , it be his philosophy of doctrine , ( and such philosophical explanations may be at times not unimportant , ) let him apprehend what he is doing , let him apprise his people what he is doing . Let him teach his hearers to accept the one because God declares it , and this is reason enough ; and to accept the other as possible , or probable if it so commends itself , with that qualified acceptance which is due to the suppositions or deductions of fallible men . " The prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream ; and he that hath my Word , let him speak my Word faithfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is the sum . The use of the hypothesis or theory is not forbidden . It is not necessarily mischievous . It prevails in Science . It has its uses in Theology . It may silence an objector . It may relieve a difficulty and confirm the believer . It may result in some satisfactory and established conclusion . But see to it that in advancing // or pressing your theory there be no savor of irreverence towards Go 4 and Scripture , either in your views or in your manner of presenting them . See to it that you maintain as true and settled no theory which conflicts with a known fact in t*Tature or doctrine of Revelation . Guard with the most jealous care against harmonizing Scripture with your theory , instead of harmonizing your theory with Scripture . Abuse not Scripture to make it subservient to your Philosophy . Attach no undue authority to your hypothesis , lest you be arrogant or uncharitable to your fellow-men . Distinguish with the utmost care between doctrine and hypothesis ; that you may advance your own hypothesis with becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothesis differs from yours with courtesy and charity ; that you forbear anathematizing as a heretic him who rejects your theory or philosophy , as if he were rejecting an essential of revealed doctrine . Make the distinction . You need to as an intelligent Christian . You need to as a controversialist . You need to as a preacher . Use then your liberty . Propound your hypothesis or theory . Put it to its legitimate use . Avoid its dangers . And ever remember that lie who has only a theory to maintain should be reverent towards God , modest and charitable towards his fellowmen.
