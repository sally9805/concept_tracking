Proceedings at the Ceremony of laying the Chief Corner Stone of the Normal and Model Schools and Education Of/ices , at Toronto , July , 1851 , by the EARL on ' ELGIN , Governor-General of Canada . BOUNDING on our northern frontier , froffi the northeast corner of Maine to an uncertain distance beyond Lake Superior , and extending northward into a dense wilderness , lies a country whose history has often been intimately connected with our own , and which now , from its recent elastic bound in the career of prosperity , is again forcing itself on our atten. * tion . More than three hundred years ago , James Cartier , departing from St. Malo , in France , crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian village on the island of Montreal . From the top of a mountain , which he named Mount Royal , he looked down on a beautiful country , and while surveying it and the broad river approach .. ing him from the southwest , the natives by his side told him that , in its course , long before reaching them , it ran through // three great lakes ; that , beyond these , was a sea of fresh water , to which they knew no bounds ; and that , over the mountains , was another great river , which ran to the southwest through a country free from snow and ice . Then and thus , for the first time , came to Christian ears information of the existence of the great Lakes and of the river Mississippi . More than seventy years afterwards - twelve years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth-Champlain , the lieutenant of De Monts , laid the foundation of Quebec , and discovered the lake to which his name has been given . To establish a trade in furs with the natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successors ; no colonists were sent over , or came over , to cultivate the earth ; a few Recollets , mendicant monks of the order of St. Francis , came and built a convent ; and a pious governor , in 1665 , anxious only to convert the Indians from their worship of idols , sent over , at his own expense , five Jesuits charged to perform that duty . Afterwards , more Jesuits were sent , the Recollets were excluded , for a time , from the settlement , and the exercise of any mode of religious worship but the Roman Catholic was strictly prohibited . This infant colony , in a remote wilderness , received especial favor from the pious and charitable of the mother country . In 1635 , the college of Quebec , sometimes called the Jesuits ' college , was founded by Ren6 de Rohaut , and received subsequently large endowments from the government , and also from the Jesuits , to which order its founder belonged . A few years afterwards , the H6tel Dieu , a hospital for the sick poor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Ursuline convent , by Madame de la Pettrie , a widow , who , though rich and young , left her beautiful country , and devoted her fortune and life to the education of the females of the colony . Trade with the natives , the conversion of the Indians , and the exclusion of all religions but one , being the chief objects of those who shaped , in its infancy , the destiny of the colony , it received from them , it is evident , none of the elements of progress . In 1663 , fifty-five years after the arrival of the first settlers , the number of inhabitants did not exceed three thousand . The feudal system being , at this period , in full force in Europe , the public land was granted in Canada , to be held // on the same tenure as in some parts of France . Tracts of all sizes , from one square mile to a hundred or more , were given by the king to faithful servants or to favorites , the gift conferring nobility and certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seigniory or lordship , as on those to whom it should be transmitted by inheritance , or assigned by sale or gift . On the death of the seignior or lord , one half of the land , with the title and privileges , descended to the eldest son ; and he also took an equal share , with the other children , in the other half . When a seigniory was sold , the king was entitled to one fifth of the price ; but one third of the fifth was relinquished in case of prompt payment . The seignior was bound on application to concede lands on certain terms to emigrants . The tracts conceded usually contained about one hundred acres , were subject to a rent of a few cents per acre , and to the performance of certain feudal duties and services . The tenant could sell the land to be held by the same tenure ; but one twelfth part of the price belonged to the lord . On the tenant 's death , the children inherited equal shares , all encumbered with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands to emigrants was found , at a later period , to be unfavorable to the prosperity of the colony ; and since the conquest by Great Britain , when any portion of the public domain has been granted , a clear title has been given to the purchaser . From that time to this , public opinion has become more and more hostile to these feudal tenures , and it can not be long before they will cease to exist . The labors of the Jesuit missionaries to convert the Indians , the perils they encountered , the hardships they endured , their unfaltering self-devotion to their vow of obedience , and to their convictions of duty , form a sublime and affecting spectacle . With a breviary suspended from the neck , and a cross , the emblem of their faith , in the hand ; often alone , sometimes in pairs , seldom with any assistants or protectors , they abandoned comfortable homes , and , venturing into the wilderness far from the abodes of civilized man , lived in huts , with only savages for companions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shores of Lake Huron . In 1641 , others advanced as far as the falls of St. Mary . In // 1665 , Father Allouez built a chapel near the western extremity of Lake Superior , and there preached , in the Algonquin language , to twelve or fifteen tribes who understood it ; and before returning to Quebec , he visited the Nipissing Indians , who had been driven , by the Iroquois , into the desolate regions north of that lake. , For this purpose , he travelled in those vast forests nearly five thousand miles , " suffering from hunger , nakedness , incessant toils , and the persecution of idolaters . " How successful the Jesuits were in their efforts to convert the Indians , has never been distinctly shown ; they were certainly more successful than the Protestant missionaries . If they did not convert many to their own faith , it is well known that , by living among them , and treating them with kindness , they acquired great influence over nearly all the tribes in Canada , and in the contiguous territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the inhabitants of New England from savage incursions , during the first half of the last century , and to which our subsequent history affords no parallel , were attributed rather to the intrigues of the Jesuits than to the French authorities . This belief doubtless rendered more bitter the prejudice before entertained by our Puritan ancestors , but now happily passing away , against the Roman Catholics and their religion . Those familiar with our history must remember the vengeance wreaked , by New England soldiers , on the Jesuit , Father Rasle , at Norridgewock . The information brought back by the missionaries who visited the great Lakes , and by Indian traders who made even more distant excursions , induced the French authorities at Quebec to take measures to acquire a title to the territory north and south and beyond those Lakes , and to persuade the Indian tribes inhabiting that vast region to submit to the control of France . For this purpose , in 1670 , Nicholas Perrot was despatched , with instructions to extend his exploralions as far west as possible . He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tribes , and was welcomed by all as the envoy of the great Onnonthio , the appellation by which the French king was known to them . He invited them all to send deputies , the next year , to meet those of the great king at the falls of St. Mary . A multitude // of chiefs attended this congress , coming from the sources of the Mississippi , the Red River , and the St. Lawrence ; and all , with one accord , placed their people under the protection of Onnonthio . A cross , the usual symbol of possession , was planted , and proclamation made that thenceforth the whole country belonged to France . Pursuing the same object , the French government , rn 1673 , despatched Father Marquette and M. Joliet to discover the Mississippi , of which wonderful river they had often heard the savages speak . The story of this bold and hazardous enterprise has been told by historians and biographers , with the eloquence inspired by a favorite theme . Leaving Quebec , with several companions , they proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remotest station which any European had then visited . Departing thence , and carrying their canoes over a short portage , they descended the Wisconsin to the Mississippi , which they first saw on the 17th of June ; and having descended that river as far as the mouth of the Arkansas , they returned to the vicinity of the Lakes . Soon afterwards , the French discovered the mouth of the Mississippi , thus giving them an incontestahie claim , as they thought , to all the valley of that river , as well as to that of the Ohio , and all northwest of it . At this time , the number of whites in Canada was about 8,000 . " Were we to state , " says Garnean , " what brought the Europeans to America , we should say , that the Spaniards came to seek for gold , the English to enjoy civil and religious liberty , and the French to diffuse throughout the land the knowledge of Christianity . " There is some truth in this remark ; and it may he said further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony has an important and enduring influence on its progress and destiny . The first impulse governs the direction in this case , as in others , until a different impulse comes to change it . But the race from which the first immigrants spring has also a powerful , and perhaps more enduring , influence ; for they always act in harmony with the characteristics of this race , though genqrally in subservience to the leading motive of their emigration . In speaking of the three races which have sent colonists to America , it is sufficient for our purpose to distinguish them 23* // as the Iberian , the Gallic , and the Saxon . All have noble characteristics , and each of the two first named would feel degraded if not placed at the head . The Iberian has contributed to history a splendid volume - though many of its pages are reddened with blood - by its heroic achievement in conquering the vast regions south of us in both Americas ; but subsequent volumes tell how nations of innocent men melted away before infuriated avarice ; how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; how at length pride , engendered by success , brought retributive poverty ; and how both together , by the misery they caused , fitly punished the perpetration of savage cruelties and the indulgence of unholy passions . These volumes say nothing of the prosperity and happiness of the colonies founded by the conquering nation ; nothing of the arts and sciences it fostered among them ; nothing of the intellectual , or moral , or religious training pursued to prepare them to act well their parts when , passing from adolescence to manhood , they should take their places among the nations . The Gallic race laid broad plans , and proceeded to execute them with chivalric and benevolent intentions . It labored assiduously in its chosen field , until it became disheartened , at not perceiving the anticipated result , and then surrendered itself to its inbred propensities . It loved to embark in difficult enterprises , the novelty and dangers of which rendered them only the more inciting . It delighted to wander in illimitable forests ; to hunt over vast prairies , and fish in distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and describe what no European had seen before . For the distant and uncertain , allured onward by imagination rather than led by judgment , it neglected the near and attainable . It came in contact with another race , to which , after an honorable strug0le , it yielded , and disappeared in a great measure from the New World . This other race was the Saxon , from which sprang the first settlers of New England , where the blood of that race flows more pure than elsewhere in the Union . They came , as the histor.ian has said , " to enjoy civil and religious liberty , " to think , and to reason , and to act out their thoughts , with perfect freedom and independence . They began by building huts and tilling the soil . They hunted and fished , // never for amusement , but only for the means of living . As soon as they were able , they built boats and meeting-houses , fishing vessels and school-houses , ships and colleges . They neither received nor sought any assistance from abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly extending their boundaries , - building more commodious dwellings , better school-hous*s , and more respectable churches ; and at the time when the Mississippi was discovered , fifty-three years after the landing of the Pilgrims , New England could number 100,000 inhabitants , few of whom had seen , or cared to see , any river more distant than the Hudson , or any lake larger than the Cochituate , or the Winnipiseogee ; but most of them , of adult age , could read and understand the Bible , many were ripe scholars , and not a few were qualified to enact , and did enact , wholesome laws for the government of their fellow-men . Looking around them , they saw only inferiors , - above them , only God ; and they became , as time passed on , more and more conscious of their own strength , and more and more resolute to acknowledge no superior on earth . For nearly a hundred years after the discovery of the Mississippi , no important alteration was made iii the mode of governing Canada , nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or tended to change the character of the population . No common schools , furnishing inlets of knowledge to the mind , were established ; no discussion of religious topics was perniitted ; the faculty of reasoning was not exercised , and , of course , was neither strengthened nor developed . The country held forth no strong attractions to immigrants ; few came ; and those who came brought with them neither new ideas to increase the common stock , nor different habits to modify those which had hitherto prevailed . A portion of the people were engaged in hunting wild animals for their skins and furs ; a few in fishing ; most contented themselves , on arriving at manhood , with concessions from the petty nobility of small tracts of land , or with smaller farms received or inherited from their fathers - all encumbered with an annual rent , and also with uncertain feudal obligations . From these , applying no more than the adequate labor , they obtained just enough for their support . That earnest longing to better one 's condition , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of all prosperity , and , when insatiate , of many crimes , had no place in their bosoms . In 1680 , the population numbered about 10,000 ; in 1720 , about 24,000 ; in 1759 , about 60,000 ; in 1775 , ahout 90,000 . During this period , the intercourse between Canada and the English colonies tended to exasperate the prejudice which already existed between them on account of the dif .. ference in religious belief . Often marauding parties of savages from Canada surprised English villages , and massacred or carried into captivity the inhabitants ; and these inroads were sometimes retaliated by invading armies and fleets . At length , a hundred and fifty years after the arrival of the first immigrants , one of these invasions was successful . Wolf took Quebec , and Amherst completed the subjugation of Canada . A different race became lords of the country ; new habits were introduced , and greater activity and sagacity were displayed in all the departments of business . Undoubt-. edly Canada was benefited by the change , though she yielded slowly to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commotion , moral , intellectual , and physi .. cal , among people of neighboring communities - the love of liberty the cause , and its attainment the object - tended to diffuse among them new ideas and new feelings ; to scatter seeds of change and reform , a few of which were to bear fruit in the remote future . It also added to the population of Canada , particularly of that part of it afterwards designated as the Upper Province , many intelligent and industrious emigrants from New England and New York . A portion of our countrymen , who , when compelled to decide , determined to adhere to the crown , sought refuge there , and transferred to their new home the moral principles and industrious habits which prevailed in the homes they had left . And what is Canada now ? What her soil , her climate , population , resources , and social condition ? The soil of the Canadas , the whole of both divisions being considered , without going farther north than the line of profitable cultivation , will bear a favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tract in Lower Canada lying east of the Chaudiere , and between the St. Lawrence on the north and New Brunswick and Maine on the south , is // the least fertile of the whole , and much of it is unfit for cub tivation . That lying west of the Chaudiere and extending to St. Regis-bounding south on New Hampshire , Vermont , and a part of New York-is , says Col. Bouchette , late Surveyor-General , " a district of excellent and fertile land , and as well for that reason as for its hounding on the United States , promises to become , at no distant day , the most flourishing part of the lower province . " And the increase of population in this region , partly by emigration from the United States , has fully confirmed his prophecy . Through this tract a railroad is now in process of construction from Montreal to Portland . Another large tract , lying northwest of Montreal and east of the Ottawa , is represented to be still more fertile . Canada West has a larger extent of fertile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada East . Of that large tract along its southern border , between the Ottawa and Lake Huron , including the peninsula between lakes Erie and St. Clair , but very little is unfit for cultivation ; most of it equals the best lands of New York and Ohio ; and some of it is even more fertile . High authority states that , near Toronto , one hundred bushels of wheat have been obtained from a single acre . How much *f the vast territory lying farther north and west-among the western sources of the Ottawa , and north of Lake Superior-may be made productive , and how productive , no explorers have yet distinctly informed us ; but it is known that many of those kinds of forest trees , which require a rich soil , grow there in great numbers and to a large size . A gentleman , for several years a resident of Upper Canada , states that that portion of it which lies between Kingston and Sandwich , and extends back from the shores of Lake Erie-from some points forty , and from others a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain she requires , besides producing cattle and sheep , hemp and flax , and yielding iron , copper , lead , lime , marl , and gypsum . Another resident states , " after consideration and calculation , that Upper Canada is capable of supporting , by agricultural pursuits alone , at least five millions of additional inhabitants . " The climate of Lower Canada , like that of all northern regions , is marked by distant extremes of temperature . In winter , the mercury has sometimes fallen , at Quebec , to thirty // degrees below , and in summer has risen to one hundred degrees above , zero . The winter begins about the 25th of November , and usually continues five months ; and during this time , the snow , almost always of feathery lightness , is about four feet deep in the woods . But the air being pure and dry , *xcept near the sea , the cold is not so piercing and uncomfortable as the thermometer would seem to indicate . It is only when most intense , and for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their dwellings . In the last days of April , the snow rapidly melts under a powerful sun , and , the earth being frozen but a few inches deep , vegetation almost immediately begins , and advances so rapidly as to render the spring more exhilarating and delightful than in southern regions , where its progress is slow . The heat of summer , short as the season is , is sufficient to ripen all kinds of grain ; but the crop , especially of Indian corn , may not be so large as in more genial climates . At Quebec , apples attain niaturity , and are raised in abundance . In Upper Canada , in conformity to a general law of the North American climate , which becomes milder as the degrees of longitude increase , the cold is not by any means so severe , or the winter so long . At Toronto and beyond , grapes and peaches attain perfection . Of the origin of the population of Canada , something has already been said . Before 1760 , all the emigrants . were French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , the whole population was estimated at 60,000 . Afterwards , no emigrants came from France , but many have come from other parts of the world . Of the inhabitants of Lower Canada , an enumeration was made in 1844 ; of those of Upper Canada , in 1848 ; and in both , the country of their nativity was ascertained . Judging from these enumerations , the present popu* lation is not far from 1,500,000 ; of whom about 600,000 derive their origin from France ; 550,000 from Great Britain ; 250,000 from Ireland ; 60,000 from the United States ; and 40,000 from continental Europe . When the census of Upper Canada was taken , in 1848 , an attempt was made to ascertain the numbers belonging to the various religious denominations . Judging from the returns , which are supposed to be only an approximation to the truth , those belonging , at the present time , to the church of Eng // land may be set down at about 200,000 ; to the church of Rome , about 125,000 ; to the church of Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wesleyans , Presbyterians , Methodists , Baptists , &amp;c . The numbers of the various sects in Lower Canada have not been ascertained . In Lower Canada , the Catholic clergy are supported by endowments and tithes granted before the conquest , and guaranteed by treaty between England and France . The clergy of the church of England are supported , in part , by the Church Missionary Society of Great Britain , and in part , by their own congregations . In Upper Canada , one seventh of the ungranted lands have been set apart for religious purposes , and are called " Clergy Reserves . " The income derivable from this source is appropriated , to the church of England two fifths ; to the church of Rome one fifth ; to the church of Scotland one fifth ; to the Wesleyan Methodists one fifth . The clergy of other denominations rely for support on their own congregations . Within the last few years , by the construction of canals , and by other favorable events , the industry of Canada has been stimulated and her resources have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Erie , and of course from Lakes Huron and Michigan , vessels and steamers , bearing three hundred and fifty tons each , can now descend to the ocean and return . To enable them to do this , the Welland Canal , passing by the Falls of Niagara , and connecting Lake Erie with Lake Ontario , has been constructed ; and also several short canals along the St. Lawrence , where falls in that river occur , - all with capacious locks , and all together measuring over ninety miles . Besides these , the Canadians enjoy the benefit of two other canals ,  --  the Ridean Canal , one hundred and twenty-eight miles long , and connecting Kingston on Lake Ontario with Bytown on the Ottawa ; and the Chambly Canal , eleven miles long , which connects Lake Champlain with the St. Lawrence near Montreal . The prosperity of the colony is shown by the increase of her trade . In 1840 , she exported about $1,475,000 ; in 1850 , about $13,290,000 . Her imports have increased in nearly the same ratio , being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the imports from the United States amounted to $7,404,000 , and the exports thither to $5,813,000. // 272 The Condition and Prospects of Canada . April , Through the canals on the St. Lawrence , in 1850 , passed 7,166 vessels and steamers , of which 6,8527 were British and 339 American , and the aggregate tonnage was 547,322 tons ; and through the Welland Canal , 4,761 vessels and steamers , of which 2,692 were British and 1,799 American , and the aggregate tonnage was 587,100 tons . Many of the descending vessels hring to American ports on the St. Lawrence helow Buffalo the produce of Canada West , destined to New York and Boston ; and many , ascending , carry commodities furnished by the same cities . The resources of Canada are soon to he still further developed by the construction of railroads , which are much better . adapted to the country and the climate than canals . Many charters have been granted , hut two roads only , we believe - and they are short - have been completed . Of these , one extends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Montreal , to St. Johns , on the waters of Lake Champlain ; and the other , extending from Queenston below , to Chippewa above , the Falls of Niagara , is used for horse power , and only in summer . Recently , two important roads have been projected , and so large a portion of both has been already constructed , as to render their completion within a year or two certain . One of these roads , The Great Western , will he ahout two hundred and thirty miles long , and will extend from Niagara Falls , passing at some points forty and fifty miles north of Lake Erie , through interior townships unsurpassed in fertility , to Windsor , opposite Detroit ; at its eastern end , connecting with a line leading to the Hudson , and thence hy diverging routes to New York and New England ; and at its western end , the river intervening , with a line passing through Michigan to the farther West ; thus enabling a passenger to go , by railroad , from Boston , and even from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic and St. Lawrence , leaves the south shore of the river , just below Montreal , and , as located and partly built , passes through a part of Canada East , through the northeast corner of Vermont , through New Hampshire north of the White Hills , and through Maine to Portland . This road is built and in use to Skipton , about eighty miles from Montreal , at which place it will probably be joined by a road from Quebec , thus affording to both cities // an easy access , by the shortest route , to a convenient port on the Atlantic . Of the other end of this road , about ninety miles , extending from Portland to Gorham in New Hampshire , have been finished and are now in operation . Of many other roads projected several have been commenced , and there is hardly a doubt that these will be completed in a few years at most . We hope the builders will derive profit from their investments . If they should not , it must console and reward them to witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The imperial government having surrendered to the provincial legislature the power of imposing duties on the trade of Canada with other countries , and appropriating the proceeds , the latter has proposed to the United States to enter into an arrangement , hy which the natural products of each country shall he admitted by the other free of duty . And it is understood that , should the proposition be accepted , the British government would grant to us the free navigation of the St. Lawrence . The administration favors the.proposition , but it has not yet been allowed by Congress . The principal arguments urged against it are the assumptions that it would involve a considerable loss of revenue , and that it would allow to Canadian farmers a free competition , in agricultural products , on our own soil , with our own farmers , to the disadvantage of the latter . That the arrangement contemplated would diminish the revenue of both countries is probable , but not certain . Permitting free trade in some articles may lead to the increase of trade in articles paying duty .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty , the producer or consumer ? - be decided either way , the farmers on each side will be both , and , as producers or consumers , will gain what their government loses . To the other assumption it may be replied , that , if our farmers should lose by competition on this side of the line , they may gain by it on the other ; if they lose by the importation of wheat , which for reasons often stated is at least doubtful , they may gain by the exportation of other articles . On this question , able statesmen and practical men differ , and it can be decided only by experience . The revenue which our treasury now receives from this source may amount to a third or a half of a million . // But a valid reason may be assigned in favor of our assent to the proposition . The intercourse between the two countries is now impeded - almost prevented-by our revenue laws . Neighbors , living in sight of each other , can not exchange wheat for cattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or violating the laws of the land . Remove this impediment ; allow and encourage a constant intercourse between the inhabitants on both sides . of the line , by making that intercourse profitable , and they will regard each other , not as strangers , and , it may be , as enemies , but as neighbors and friends ; and whatever quarrels or conflicts may arise between us and Great Britain , the horrors of war will never again be felt or known , as they often have been , on our northern frontier . The cultivated land in Canada , with the exception , perhaps , of that portion of the eastern division where it is held by a feudal tenure , is divided into small farms , which are , in almost all cases , owned by those who reside upon them . The condition of the great mass of the people is therefore very nearly the same as that of the citizens of the Free States of our Union . The richest there may not be so rich as the richest here ; and so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently stimulated by certainty of reward , and depressing poverty as well as overshadowing wealth is rare . The attention paid to the education of the whole people indicates , with the most certainty , the social condition of a community . It may be well to dwell on this topic , not only that our readers may know , what our neighbors are doing in this matter , but that they may be able to determine whether the system there adopted may not , in some of its details , be better than ours . And here it should be noted that , in treating of this subject , we shall speak only of Canada West ; although the same system , as we understand , has been adopted , but has as yet been less successful , in Canada East . More than forty years ago , probably at the suggestion of emigrants from the United States , then composing a considerable portion of the population , the legislature made an appropriation in aid of common schools ; and from that time to 1841 , annual parliamentary grants have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without system , and // with little advantage to the country . In 1841 , a provincial statute was enacted , granting money to each county , to be expended in the support of common schools , on the condition that the county should raise , for the same purpose , an equal amount by local taxation . Several laws altering and improv .. ing the details of this system were subsequently passed ; and in 1850 , all the provisions of former laws which experience had sanctioned , and others which it had shown to be necessary , were incorporated in one statute . Before the provisions of this act are stated , it should be premised that , by other laws , Upper Canada is divided into counties , townships , incorporated cities and villages ; each of which has a council , which manages its affairs ; and by an act of the provincial legislature , the sum of ? 25,000 , equal to $100,000 , is set apart as a school fund , to be applied annually to purposes of education . The school act empowers each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering to our school districts ; and also to establish a township model school . These sections are authorized to choose , at first , three trustees , to remain in office respectively one , two , and three years ; and every subsequent year to choose one , to take the place of the trustee retiring ; and also to decide in what manner they will procure the funds necessary to defray their school expenses ; whether by voluntary subscription , by rate-bills on parents sending children to the schools , or by rates on the property of all . The trustees are empowered to employ a teacher or teachers , male or female , or both , and give such compensation as they may think proper ; to appoint a collector ; to estimate the sum necessary to defray all expenses ; to issue their warrants to collect the amount ; and to exercise a general supervision over all the schools in the section . Analogous provisions , to accomplish the same purposes , are made with regard to incorporated cities and villages . The school fund before mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several townships , according to the population of each ; and by the local super* intendents among the several sections , according to the average attendance of the scholars ; and each section is required to raise a sum at least as large as that received from // the treasury . Should it fail to do so , the county council is required to assess and levy the whole sum , or the amount deficient , to be expended for the benefit of the section . The county council appoints a local superintendent of schools for the whole county , or for any one or more townships , not giving to any one superintendent the oversight of more than one hundred schools . He is entitled to at least four dollars , each year , for every school placed under his charge , and may be , and often is , allowed additional compensation . He is required to visit every school once a quarter ; to deliver a public lecture , in each school section , once a year ; and to report annually to the chief superin .. tendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to any portion of the school fund from which a satisfactory report was not received the preceding year . All the local superintendents and the trustees of all the grammar schools in the county are constituted a Board of Public Instruction for the county . To this board is ntrusted the duty of examining all persons who desire to be employed as teachers . Those whom they deem qualified they arrange in three classes , according to their qualifications , and state , in the certificate given , the class to which he who receives it belongs . No person is entitled to receive compensation as a teacher unless he has such a certificate ; and no section by a qualified teacher . Besides the local superintendents , who are required , all clergymen recognized by law , the members of the legislature , and all magistrates are authorized , to visit the schools within their parishes , towns , or counties , and they are desired to attend especially the quarterly examinations . The county and township councils are authorized to raise such sums as they may think proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them are prescribed . A council of public instruction and a chief superin-. tendent of schools , both appointed by the crown , are placed at the head of the whole system . To the council is intrusted the management of the provincial , normal , and model schools , for the establishment of which provisIon is made by law ; it recommends text-books , and books for the // school libraries ; prescribes regulations for the organization , government , and discipline of common schools , the examination and classification of teachers , and the establishment and care of libraries . To the chief superintendent are assigned other duties than have already been mentioned , similar to those usually performed by the same officer in the States . Such is a very brief sketch of the system of public elementary instruction in Upper Canada . It is now in active operation , and the intelligence and zeal with which it is administered justify the highest anticipations of its success and future usefulness . It is certainly encouraging to know that the number of schools in Upper Canada , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent , is 3,059 ; and that the number of pupils in these schools is 151,891 . Massachusetts , which , in 1849 , had about 150 ,  - -  000 more inhabitants than Upper Canada has now , had then 3,749 public schools , and they were attended by about 200,000 pupils . When it is considered that many of the townships in Canada have been settled but a few years , and that the inhal ? itants they contain are yet struggling with the difficulties around them , the comparison can not appear unfavorable to our younger neighbors . With what earnestness the inhabitants of Upper Canada have engaged in the cause of education is shown by the published account of the " Proceedings at the ceremony of laying the chief corner stone of the Normal and Model School and Education Offices , by the Earl of Elgin , Governor-General of Canada , " at Toronto , in July last . Most of the chief officers of the province manifested , by their presence , their hearty cooperation in the measure . From an eloquent address to the Governor-General , delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent , we learn that " This institution is designed to accommodate two hundred teachers-in.training , and six hundred pupils in the Model School ; a school intended not merely as a pattern , according to which common schools generally should he conducted , but a school in which the teachers.in-training will practise in teaching the subjects of the instructions and lectures giyen in the Normal School ; " and that the land set apart for the purposes of the institution " is an entire square consisting of nearly eight acres , 24* // two of which are to be devoted to a botanical garden , three to agricultural experiments , and the remainder to the buildings of the institution and to grounds for the gymnastic exercises of students and pupils . It is thus intended that the valuable course of lectures given in the Normal School , in vegetable physiology and agricultural chemistry , shall be practically illustrated on the adjoining grounds , in the culture of which the students will take a part during a portion of their hours of recreation . " And we learn farther ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made of fifteen thousand pounds , - " an enlightened liberality , on the part of our legislature , in advance of that of any other legislature on the American continent . " Near the close of his address , the chief superintendent remarks , " There are four circumstances which encourage the most sanguine anticipations in regard to our educational future : The first is , the avowed and entire absence of all party spirit in the school affairs of our country , from the provincial legislature down to the smallest municipality . The second is , the precedence which our legislature has taken of all others on the western side of the Atlantic , in providing for normal school instruction , and in aiding teachers to avail themselves of its advantages . The third is , that the people of Upper Canada have , during the last year , voluntarily taxed themselves , for the salaries of teachers , in a larger sum , in proportion to their numbers , and have kept open their schools , on an average , more months , than the neighboring citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that the essential requisites of suitable and excellent text-books bave been introduced into our schools , and adopted almost by general acclamation , and that the facilities of furnishing all our schools with the necessary books , maps , and apparatus will soon be in advance of those of any other country . " Surely , these are gratifying indications of the future intellectual and moral elevation of the Canadian people , and of their rapid progress in all the arts that bring wealth and refinement in their train . In view of all these circumstances , it is not surprising that speculation should be active in attempting to mark out the political future of Canada ; that the questions should , often arise , - Will she long remain connected with the British empire ? // Will she soon demand a place among the nations ? Will she seek to form a part of the American Union ? It is fortunate for her that the discipline that she has undergone for the last hundred years ; that the character and direction of her progress for the last fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , soil , and climate , - have all been or are , such as to give assurance that , whichever of these courses she may choose for herself , her progress will be rapid in the direction which recent impulses have given to an elevated rank among prosperous communities . We know of no motive which should induce her to remain connected with the British empire but the sentiment of loyalty , which is , doubtless , yet felt by many Canadians . We call it a sentiment rather than a duty ; for a colony situated as Canada is , - her early as well as her recent history being considered , has a right to consult her own interests , fulfilling only those special obligations , if any , which yet rest upon her . Does she still need the protection of Great Britain ? - does Great Britain need her aid ? are the benefits she receives from the present connection greater than she would probably receive from laws enacted by her own representatives , and administered by her own magistrates and rulers ? - are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they should be decided under the responsibilities , to herself and to others , which the highest of all laws impose on men , whether acting individually or as communities . And whether , having dissolved her connection with Great Britain , should she so decide , - but in no other way , we hope , than by mutual agreement , - she shall choose to govern herself in all things as an independent nation , or shall enter into the American Union , regulating her own domestic affairs , and sharing with others , her equals , the management only of her foreign relations , and such other affairs as equally concern her and her partners , - are also questions which she only has a right to decide ; and in regard to them , we shall not take the liberty to express , not even the trouble to form , an opinion .
