ART . 11. - NAPOLEON BONAPARTE AT ST . HELENA . The History of the Captivity of Napoleon at St. Helena , from the Letters and Journals of the late Sir Hudson Lowe ; and Official Documents never before made public . By WILLI*1 FORSYTH , M. A. , late fellow of Trinity College , Cambridge . Harper &amp; Brothers . 1855 . Napoleon at St. Helena : or interesting Anecdotes and remarkable Conversations of the Emperor during the five and a half years of his Captivity ; collected from the 2iifiemorials of Las Cases , O'Aleara , iuliontholon , Antommarchi , and others . By JOHN S. C. ABBOTT . Harper &amp; Brothers . 1855 . ArrEn Mr. Abbott had concluded in Harper 's Magazine , his long-drawn biographical series on Napoleon Bonaparte , and then repeated his work in two royal octavo volumes , pp. 611 , 666 , we hoped that having exhausted his theme , he had exhausted his strength , and that he would not be seen again on his hobby , spurring over the same track . It had , indeed , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in preparing for the press , the life of another eminent warrior , General Benedict Arnold ; containing some account of his religions experience at Philadelphia and West Point , with embellishments . We were fairly surprised , therefore , by the reappearance of the other old soldier under a new name . But the great Captain is again before us , challenging our attention in his worn regimentals , since we have given him on several occasions a hearty , though not a friendly salute . We halt before we advance to another review , for it appears to do but little good to inspect sharply a flashy book . It will be read and paid for , in spite of criticism . After the success of Headley 's Napoleon , and Abbott 's Napoleon , affording no small gains both to the authors and publishers , it seems as if a book of any sort " illustrated and appropriately bound , " would obtain a transient popularity . Such productions , literary men turn over carelessly and consign them to the pile of " light reading . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having power enough to expose these palpable blunders , these bald impositions in the name of history ; but the people have enjoyed a few hours of empty amusement and turn away to seek another . The author collects his profits and straightway repeats the entertainment , and as if // there could be no surfeit of adulation when Bonaparte is the subject , tells again his twice-told tale of the sufferings and death of the martyr of St. Helena  --  and the critic has for his pains the blessing which waits on good intentions and the satisfaction of wondering on what new image this literary Barnum will next display the thread-bare " gray great coat and cocked hat . " We write on , though it may be a thankless task , to expose the fallacy of such books as claim admiration for " Napoleon at St. Helena . " For if one aspect of his character is more repulsive than another , it is that which he presents in captivity . If any chapter in his whole history should check the infatuation of his admirers and the pretensions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes us that " the Great Pacificator , " or even " the Republican Emperor , " comes nearer to the Emperor Napoleon , than the " Imperial Sage " in dignified repose under mortal suffering . This attitude his unwearied biographer works upon with his usual zeal and more than usual neglect of facts , waxing warmer as the difficulties of the undertaking increase , and lavishly bestowing his praise where praise is most needed . Though the representation is a counterfeit it may be commended for its harmony with the character which is seen in Abbott 's triple memoirs . If this writer blunders in his statements , he never flags in purpose . Having carried his hero straight through his conspicuous career , without a crime or-what F ouch* considered worse-  --  a blunder , through an aggressive war of fifteen years to restore the peace of the world , through political revolutions of half of Europe by the bayonet to prove the fraternity of his troops , through the usurpation of supreme power to save the crown of France , some horrible wholesale massacres to protect his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of the Bourbons , and an attempt to poison himself on his own account , * * Napoleon is charged with the crime of having attempted to take his own life by poison , after his first abdication at Fontainbleau . Abbott would turn the affair into a fit of colic . His reasoning on the subject illustrates so well his usual method of avoiding difficulties that we can not refrain from repeating it . At midnight he ( Caulaincourt ) was hastily called to the bedside of the Emperor , who was taken suddenly and alarmingly ill . It will be remembered that just after the battle of Dresden , he was seized with a violent fit of colic . Fatigue , sleeplessness and woe , had , apparently , renewed . the attack . His physician , Ivan , simply administered a little hot tea . Gradually the cramps in the stomach became less violent , the limbs became more supple , and the dreadful paroxysm passed away . It has been asserted that Napoleon on this occasion , attempted to commit suicide . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , the remedy applied , simply a little hot tea , the rapid recovery , and his previous and subsequent conduct , have led all impartial men to discharge the dishonoring accusation as groundlcss . " In order to confound this // 217 our author conducts the narrative to a befitting conclusion . The last scenes of the Napoleonic tragedy are arranged with considerable tact . The hero suffers and expires as the tears of the spectators are called for , and the curtain is let down slowly before the corpse . If we are not moved to pity by the catastrophe as much as Mr. Abbott , it is because we have at hand a true account of this performance , in which we shall see , by and by , that Napoleon made his own thunder at St. Helena , shifte*1 the scenes for himself , blew the French horn , prompted and spurred the actors , arranged the drapery of his death-bed , and expired in a posture for the benefit of posterity . The compiler of his biography " from the memorials of Las Cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of these disclosures , because they do not subserve the main design of his work , which is to glorify the " Illustrious Exile . " Keeping this object in view , Mr. Abbott , in his preface , blandly remarks : " The author of these volumes performs , mainly , but the unambitious task of compilation . He desires to take the readertoSt . Helena* to introduce him to the humble apartment of the Emperor . He would give him a seat in the arm chair , by the quack historian , and destroy entirely the effect of his hot tea , we have only to take up Caulaincourt 's narrative at the point where Abbott drops it , to insert his prescription . " A short calm succeeded ; he ( Napoleon ) slept for half an hour . During that time Constant told me that whilst he was in bed , he heard a noise in the chamber of the Emperor . He ran to him in violent convulsions , his face turned toward the pillow to stifle his cries . He refused all the assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the Emperor saw him he said , Ivan , the dose was not strong enough . Then it was they acquired the sad certainty that he had taken poison . " All that Abbott has offered besides the prescription of hot tea to prove a case of colic against the testimony of his own witness , is a vague assertion of Antommarchi many years after . wards at St. Helena , in effect that if Napoleon had ever attempted to poison himself he would have informed his domestic physician of the circumstance . Over against the conceit of the Italian doctor we may set the dictation of his illustrious patient to Montholon respecting the affair . " Ivan , " says Napoleon , " assured me at Fontainbleau , that his poison would kill me were I only to inhale the fumes of it . Well , it failed in its effects . From th&amp;time of my retreat from Russia I had constantly carried around my neck in a little silken bag a portion of poisonous powder which Ivan had prepared for me when I was in fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * Why should I endure so much suffering , I reflected , and who knows that my death may not place the crown on the head of my son ? France was saved . - I hesitated no longer , but leaping from the bed , mixed the poison in a little water and drank it with a sort of feeling of pleasure . But time had taken away its strength ; fearful pains drew forth some groans ; they were heard and medical help nrrived . " " But the nature of his disease , " says Mr. Abbott , " the remedy applied , simply a little hot tea , the rapid recovery , and his previous and subsequent conduct , have led all impnrtial men to discharge the dishonoring accusation as groundless . " A. more unworthy attempt than this to impose upon the credulity of the reader can be found , if anywhere , only in the pages of the same writer . // side of the illustrious sufferer reclining upon the sofa , or lead him to accompany the Emperor in his walks among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Imperial Sage . " An " audience particuliere " like the one proposed might be pleasant , if the Emperor happened to be in one of his agreeable moods , which doubtless he would assume , when he understood that one of his visitors was an American author of some celebrity , who had published several accounts of his magnanimous behavior in exile , and was about to write another . A " remarkable conversation " something like the following , may be supposed to take place , while we are excluded from the Imperial presence , at the threshold of " the humble apartment , " for a breach of etiquette , as Sir George Cockburn was for a similar offense . Mr. Abbott , better acquainted with courtly forms , having had some experience at the Tuileries , enters , announced by the valet as Mr. Abbott , and so forth . Napoleon . The Americans are a great nation , with strong inclinations to liberty and equality , which are the elements of all stable governments , and which constituted the foundation of my throne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular power was preserved . Had the French people been as well prepared for civil freedom as the citizens of the Great Republic , I would have dispensed with the form altogether , and become a Washington to France . I did not usurp the crown ; " I picked it up lying in the mud , " and wore it with the consent of my army . The adoption of a new system of monarchy , with checks upon the old privileged classes , opened all the avenues of rank and power to merit alone , or what is the same thing , to such persons as I chose to distinguish . By restricting the influence of the press , controlling " the political franchise , the interests of individuals , the property of the municipalities , the progress of education , of science , of mind and sentiment , " I vested in myself , for the good of the people , the rights secured to them by the blood of the revolution . After all , popular liberty is a mere name . I said , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to grant liberty to their subjects , the more they must talk to them about it . I do not wish it more than they , you may be sure . I know well that now it requires a rod of iron to rule men , but it m*ust be *iilded , and we must make them believe when we strike them , that they direct the blow themselves . It is necessary always to talk of liberty , equality , justice , and never grant any liberty whatever . " After I had left Paris , in 1815 , I resolved to sail for America . I appointed the officers of the palace . Las Oases was to have been premier mini8tre du eon8eil . To besure // there were some British cruisers in the way , but with the Saale frigate and the Medusa , I could have blown them to atoms as easily as I could have routed the Allies at Waterloo , if Wellington had not held out longer than I expected , and refused to retreat after he was defeated . " In order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to the advice of my followers , and threw myself upon the magnanimity of the English nation , who have sent me to linger upon this h orrible rock . Had I landed in America I would have assumed at once , the supreme dictation of affairs as " Republican Emperor . " With an army of a hundred thousand men I would have conquered the British possessions on the north , the central portions of the continent , including the Mosquito Coast , the States of South America-annexed Cuba , Jamaica , and the Sandwich Islands-consolidated the whole into one grand military imperial model republic , having its center at Washington , and its extremities upon the poles . Such , sir , is the termination which suits my ideas . The people of America must appreciate my great actions , and admire the fortitude with which I endure my present sufferings , Monsieur Abbott . lLr . Abbott . It is painful to be obliged to inform your Majesty , that until a recent period of their history , my countrymen have not perfectly understood your character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older portion of our population-I refer to " those over sixty years " - have distrusted the pacific design of those memorable campaigns , which for twenty years dazzled the world with the coruscations of your military genius ; they have been slow to recognize in you the father of liberal ideas in France ; have accused your Majesty of some political crimes , such as the invasion of Spain , some " blemishes of despotic authority , such as the arrest and trial of the IDuc d'Enghien . " But a most remarkable change , an entire revolution of public sentiment , has , of late , transpired , achieved in some measure by my humble instrumentality , in the publication of your memoirs , a copy of which , illustrated and appropriately bound , I here present to your Majesty . You are now regarded as " supreme in intellectual greatness , and second only to one human being in moral excellence , our own Washington . " Should you , *3ire , ever escape from these " blackened rocks , " and land upon our shores , you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enveloped with shouts , " the long transporting cries of Vive 1'Ernpereur , resounding through our borders , would call to mind the most glorious days of the Empire . But I have sought this interview , more especially for the purpose of instituting an inquiry // relative to a subject upon which the minds of my countrymen are still somewhat sundered . I refer to your religious sentiments , revealed to my own satisfaction , both in your sublime utterances and in your public espousals to Christianity in the Concordat , as evincing a regard for religion , " not only as a police arrangement , but as a necessity of the human soul . " Napoleon . Bah ! Reli* , ' ion-Politique . I have uniformly declared " my belief in God and in the sublimity of the New Testament . " I said here to Las Cases , " Everything proclaims the existence of God , but all our religions are evidently the works of man . Why are there so many ? Why is the religion of Paris neither that of London nor Berlin ? Reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 religions ! the children of men . " On the throne of France , I said , " It is absolutely indispensable to have a religion for the people , and no less so , that it should be directed by the government . We must declare the Catholic the established religion , as being that of the majority of the people . They will say I am a Papist ; I am no such thing . I was a Mohamed an in Egypt ; I will be a Catholic here , for the good of my people . " True , I imprisoned the Pope in order to seize some of his secular dominion and secure some ecclesiastical privileges . " Policy justifies everything . " I was asked on board the Northumberland , what religion I professed . I said , " All : it is the best policy . " You shall write our memoirs , Monsieur Abbott ; you shall write our nwimoirs again ; you shall record our religious conversation ; you shall hand us down to posterity in our sacred costume . In consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last will and testament , one hundred thousand francs ; the same sum that I shall bequeath to Col. Marbot , whom I intend to engage to write in defense of the French armies , and to confound their calumniators and apostates . Mr. Abbott joyfully retires with numerous salutations . The art which Mr. Abbott has acquired , after long practice , of sketching Napoleon on one side , turning that round and round for a full view of the man , may have a double application , and be used to paint a different portrait . Let some one perform the " unambitious task " of drawing this peccable hero as he is not usually seen in print . Let him collect , not only from the memorials of his partisans , but from the accusations of his enemies , what friendship has conceded , truth asserted , or malice invented . Let him distort or expunge every relieving trait which might be borrowed from good impulses , glorious exploits or glowing utterances . With an eye on deformity , let him shroud the whole in the darkest colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him use nothing but blacking , and if he did not make a monster of selfishness , impurity and crime , start out from the canvas , he would pass for a bungler at his trade . There were some transactions at St. Helena , as well as remarkable conversations , implicating the character of the actors there , of . the chief actor in particular , which no truthful narrator in three histories of Napoleon 's captivity , could avoid disclosing . Some of these are inadvertently revealed in the memorials which have supplied our author 's volumes ; though we would not be made responsible for the accuracy of the first , more than that of the last , except so far as they are confirmed by other evidence . The chosen companions of Napoleon who have undertaken to hand him down to posterity in these memoirs , had every inducement to practice deception in order to extol the virtues of their chief . If their position was the best for knowing him well , it was the best , also , if they chose to abuse their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the treatment which he received at the hand of his oppressers , and of the fortitude with which he bore his martydom . " Interesting anecdotes , and remarkable conversations , " are , doubtless , fully repeated by O'iMieara and company , revised and corrected by the Emperor himself ; but many things said and done , which at the time involved the reputation of distinguished individuals , as well as questions of state policy and national faith , and which have not yet ceased to agitate the minds of men , have no place in the pages of these writers , and in all cases their testimony is to be received under the rule applicable to interested witnesses . It is not our purpose to discuss the credibility of those authors from whom the common imupression of Bonaparte at St. Helena is derived . We thought the question respecting the veracity of O'IMleara , the chief witness to the martydom , and principal defamer of Sir Hudson Lowe , had been settled thirty three years ago . The anatomizing process which this wholesale slanderer experienced at the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the power to assist a friend , or vilify a better man than himself . But in the progress of the new idea of Napoleonic history he has been revived in more than one edition of his principal work , " A Yoice from St. Helena . " This is the most dismal of all the voices that ever came from the island , and the most uncertain . The author became involved in a curious complication of difficulties , by undertaking , for a time , to serve two masters , as a spy , and afterwards becoming the sworn enemy of one of them . O'IVleara , before his rupture with Sir Hudson Lowe , wrote a series of confidential letters to a friend in England , in which he // ridicules the French exiles , repeats their conversations , represents them as making complaints for effect abroad , " with every aggravation that malignity and falsehood could suggest to evildisposed and cankered minds . " At this time he was under a solemu pledge to Bonaparte not to reveal the secrets of the household . After this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regulations , and for misconduct generally , he sought to avenge his disgrace by defaming the governor , and consumniated the act by the publication of his " Voice , " which flatly contradicted his private letters , that happen to be preserved . It is seldom that a malicious slanderer leaves behind him so broad a trail as O'iMleara has left . What credit ought to be given to his accusations , when he asserts that one duty imposed upon him by Gov . Lowe , was to take the life of his illustrious patient ? The journal of Las Cases is in the same strain as the " Voice , " more cautious , and less vindictive . As a memoir , it is to be regarded like other books prepared for publication under the eye of the Emperor by a servile French Count , who avowed that " Napoleon was his God . " The frequent contradictions of the author , the admission in unguarded passages of the bad behavior of the exiles , and their disposition to complain of every restriction as being an unnecessary abnse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection , ennui and melancholy were their most formidable enemies . Tue manuscript which , after Las Cases left the island , became his " journal , " happened to be inspected and copied by the governor , who has pointed ont many suppressed and contradictory passages , aud remarked , " Everything is sacrificed to the great object of presenting to posterity , in the person of General Bonaparte , a model of all excellence and virtue . Facts are altered , conversations only given by half , his own expressions repeated , the replies omitted ; such I have observed to be the case in conversations I have held with him when witnesses were present . " iMlontholon , through whose pages Napoleon designed more particularly , to descend to posterity , seems to have had a bad reputation even at Longwood . Having occasion to mention his name , O'Meara remarks , " He is better known here , ( in Bonaparte 's family , ) as the liar . " In another letter the surgeon says , " IMlontholon , if he were not a coward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two little defects , he is a perfect gentleman . " Napoleon said to the Count as he was going to James Town , " Now , Montholon , do not bring me back anymore lies as news . Bertrand is going to town to-morrow , and I shall know the truth . " Of Antommarchi , the Italian doctor , it is not necessary to say much . The value of his statements in dis // paragement of others may be inferred from a falsehood in his book , when he represents the British ministry as saying to him upon his return to England , " Why did not the Governor cause the body of Bonaparte to be thrown into lime ? we should have the sooner done with him . " General Gourgaud , one of the exiles , it is well known , denounced the whole Longwood company , and left them in disgust , affirming that they were treated better than they deserved , considering their behavior and groundless complaints . If we use the testimony of such writers , we shall do so only when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are corroborated by other witnesses . They have strengthened the impression made at the time of Napoleon 's captivity , by means of published complaints , protests , confidential letters , pamphlets , books , and the well arranged procession of one individual after another from St. Helena ; making awful disclosures . These false or exaggerated statements were exposed in Parliament in the defense of the ministry , by Earl Bathurst , Colonial Secretary . There was never a more satisfactory vindication of state measures than this explanation of grievances complained of in the paper signed by Count Montholon , which was made the basis of an inquiry by Lord Holland , the solitary defender of Bonaparte . It was shown that the great exile had every indulgence consistent with his safe custody ; that the governor of the island , instead of having cruelly exceeded his instructions , had fulfilled them , regardful of the comfort of his prisoners , and that all the complaints of Montholon were either " misrepresentations of facts , or direct and absolute falsehoods . " Notwithstanding the impression of this able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warden 's letters , by the Quarterly Review , the partisans of Napoleon contrived to confirm the belief that he was subjected to a course of treatment by which his life would be abridged , or , as he dictated himself , that " all was arranged to make this great man perish in the torments of an agony sufficiently long to have his death appear natural . " This opinion has become more popular through the " Memorials " published since the death of Napoleon , and innumerable compilations from those works . Many persons who have acknowledged the justice and the expediency of confining the disturber of the world 's repose , have been constrained to make concessions unfavorable to the conduct of the British Ministry , in the execution of this measure , and to that of their agent , Sir Hudson Lowe . They saw in history the ascendancy of the imperial despot 's power over Europe , and the extinction of the hope of republican France . They watched with melancholy satisfaction , the waning // of his baleful star . They saw it sink in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the horrors of the catastrophe , they thanked God for the victory which transported the worldconqueror beyond the confiuies of Europe , never to summon his terrible legions to another great feast of the sword . They could not , however , avoid the impression made by certain books , that some wrong was done to the prisoner at St. Helena , either in the mode , or by the instrument of his confinement . Our own uneasy feelings on this subject have been relieved by an examination of Mr. Forsyth 's volumes , " The history of the captivity of Napoleon at St. Helena , from the letters and journals of the late Sir Hudson Lowe ; and from official documents never before made public . " We refer to this work , disposed to complain that it has not been noticed more by American writers . But for the publisher 's commendation attached to some straggling paragraphs as the " opinions of the press , " and an article in the Southern Review , we might not have known that a true account of the captivity had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and robed in " cloth , " " gilt ; " it has an honest look on its front , referring our inquiries to such substantial matters as facts , dates , state documents , official correspondence , and confidential letters . As to the materials used in these volumes , we allow the author to speak through the account which Sir Hudson Lowe gave of the papers in his possession , when he contemplated a publication of his life . " There are perhaps few , if any , public administrations of any kind of which the records are so full and complete as those of my government at St. Helena . There is not only a detailed correspondence addressed to the proper department of his Majesty 's government , repeating the occurrences of almost every day during the five years that Napoleon Bonaparte remained under my custody , but the greater part of the conversations held with Bonaparte himself , or with his followers , were immediately noted down with an ability and exactness which reflects the highest credit on my military secretary , Major Gorrequer . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , but possessed a memory equally remarkable for its accuracy and tenacity . He was , therefore , eminently qualified to repeat the conversations at which he was himself present , and to detect any error into which a misapprehension of the meaning of foreigners , might lead other persons who repeated what passed at interviews with Bonaparte and his followers . These volumes fully explain the main incidents of the captivity , as connected with the administration of Sir hudson Lowe , while they relieve his character from the stain which has rested // too long upon it , through the slanders of his enemies and the faint praise of some of his friends . No man in a public and responsible situation has been more vilely abused than the governor of St. Helena . Mr. Forsyth , in allusion to this fact , ob-serves : " He has been made the scape-goat of all the sins which the English nation has been represented as guilty of , towards Napoleon . The historian has charged him with meanness , and the satirist has turned him into ridicule . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befitted the turnkey of a jail , rather than a British officer entrusted with a duty of unparalleled delicacy and importance . And even those who have duly estimated the difficulty of his task and suspected the veracity of his assailants , have not been able to divest themselves of the feeling , that he might have performed his duty in a more gracious manner . " The Southern Quarterly iReview , published at Charleston , S. C. , in a recent number relieves itself in this style : " The British government has been accused and found guilty of gratuitous harshness towards her illustrious prisoner . Her agent , the military governor of the island , has been universally regarded as a tyrannical jailor , who not only carried out in Pill detail the views of the administration which , with perfect knowledge of his character , selected him for a most unenviable position , but actually exceeded his instructions , and wantonly and maliciously tortured his prisoner through six long years of oppression and despondency . " A polite assembly in the city of New Haven were informed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority for our believing some things not recorded by other standard aw thors may pass for what it is worth ; that there were good reasons for supposing that Napoleon came to an untimely end through poison , administered at the instigation of Sir Hudson Lowe . Mr. Abbott and other recent authors have done their part to retail slanders respecting General Lowe , who is abused by the Bonaparte worshipers in pyoportion to the adoration which they pay to their divinity . The reputation of the governor has suffered , not only from the assaults of his sworn enemies , but from the lukewarm defense of his professed friends . Sir Walter Scott , whose genius , however , is not supreme in history , as in poetry and romance , under confession of having imperfect information on the subject , speaks of " irritating disputes " and " quarrels** between Sir Hudson and his prisoner , as if they were anything more than the disputes of a restive captive with the officer who has legal charge of his person , or such quarrels as may exist in any well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits of the establishment , or attempt to break the bars of their confinement . It is not surprising if all these misrepresentations put together , have fostered the impression somewhat savagely expressed by the Southern Review , so that the governor of St. Helena is regarded , in the worst sense , as having been the man for the time and the place , the pliant tool of the English oligarchy , selected for his fitness to do an odious job-not only to keep safe watch and ward over a dangerous State prisoner , like Napoleon , but to subdue his ferocity by blows and coarse fare  --  a sort of Van Amburgh or IDriesbach , one who tames and exhibits wild beasts in sport . We may find , however , in the sequel , that the original strength of " the animal " to harm his keeper is restored . The fable of *Esop is reversed ; the lion is seen standing over the man . The volumes before us turn our sympathy to the real martyr of St. Helena . If any one on that rock deserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost it , in an unenviable but honorable service , at a most important crisis of his country 's history . We blame him , since he had the most ample materials for the vindicatioi*i of his character , for allowing a stigma to rest so long upon his name , which forced him into seclusion , where he died , persecuted to the last by his enemies . Fortunately for his posthumous fame , the recent publication of his letters , journals and official correspondence , with corroborating documents furnished by the department of state , together with the testimony of the few living witnesses of the last scenes of Napo eon s life , and the concurrent , evidence of occasional visitors at the island , have achieved what a series of untoward events seemed for a time to preclude . We would not weary our readers with details which , in the Lowe manuscripts alone , Mr. Forsyth informs us , extend through thirty volumes ; but as an injured man asks , in his memorial to posterity , for the restoration of his good name , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up all the glory which belongs to heroic suffering , we aim to pass in review some of these transactions by which the claims of the governor and his captive may be respectively settled . We " perform mainly the unambitious task of compilation . " We lay no claim to original investigations of a subject which must lie in a few books . We take the principal facts contained in the official papers of Sir Hudson Lowe , in connection with some corroborating statements from " the Memorials . " Almost everything affecting the fate of Napoleon Bonaparte , within the sphere of man , or realm of nature , has undergone // most remarkable investigations and discoveries . St. Helena , before it became the place of his confinement , was considered one of the most salubrious islands on the face of the globe . Though gloomy and barren in appearance , travelers described it as having " vales and grassy slopes , " beautiful and rich in vegetation and variegated foliage . " Lying within the influence of the southeast trade wind , " its climate was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long life . In a report published at Paris , by order of Napoleon , in 1804 , St. Helena was called " a terrestrial paradise , where the air was pure and the sky serene , where health shone in every countenance , and diseases contracted in India were immediately cured . " After Napoleon landed upon the island , it underwent , in sympathy , perhaps , a most remarkable change of soil , scenery and climate , affording for its principal productions , " blackened rocks , " " damps , " " chills , " and " liver complaints . " There must have been some relief , however , from the " horrible climate , " if the following description by Las Cases of a moonlight walk with Napoleon is to be credited : - " The Emperor remarked , while walking in the garden , that after all , St. Helena , as a place of exile , was the best that could be . ' The evening was really most delightful . The shades of night were beginning to overspread the sky , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we had been accustomed to enjoy , in our summer evenings , in the neighborhood of our country residence in Europe . " Longwood House , ( the dilapidated stable of Mr. Abbott , ) the last residence of Napoleon at St. Helena , was not as splendid as the Tuileries , nor what the Emperor would have chosen had he been monarch of all he surveyed . There was upon the island , a better house occupied by the governor , which , for good reasons , was closed to his prisoner . The accommodations of Longwood , however , were considered ample for the lieutenant-governor , who , with his family , removed from the house that it might be prepared for the reception of the exile . Selected by Bonaparte for its seclusion from the observation of the people of James Town , containing bed-room , saloon , billiard-room , bath , eatingroom and a library of 2,500 volumes , ornamented with garden , shrubbery , grotto and fountain , it ought to have appeased fallen greatness until a new house could have been constructed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expressed to the British ministry the opinion , that Longwood House " was not such a residence as he desired a person to occnpy who had filled Bonaparte 's rank and station ; " and urged forward the completion of a more commodious building , which , however , // was not finished until near the close of Napoleon 's life , on account of obstacles which he created The annual allowance for the support of Bonaparte 's family was ? 12,000 , the same sum as the governor received for all the expenditures of Plantation House . The ministry , having in view reduction in the number of attendants at Longwood , proposed to reduce the expenses of the establishment to ? 8,000 . But the governor , in pursuance of his plan of torture , affirmed that General Bonaparte could not be suitably maintained for less than ? 12,000 . An intimation was given accordingly that " the sum was agreed to by his Majesty 's ministers . " Authority was given also for a greater expenditure , if it should be necessary . Before these modified instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting upon his own responsibility , increased the annual allowance to ? 12,000 , at the risk of being obliged to pay out of his own pocket the additional expenditure . Officially instructed , he afterwards intimated to Montholon , that if the expenses of the French exceeded ? 1,000 per month , the surplus must be furnished from their own funds , which it was known they could command on the largest scale , as Napoleon had offered to pay the whole cost of his establishment , if he might communicate with his friends abroad through sealed letters . Having due regard for the comfort of his prisoner , it was necessary that the governor should impose limits to the expenses of Longwood , since there was evidently " a good deal of leakage , " as Montholon said . If the French chose to have a large retinue , and insist upon luxuries of all kinds , when it cost 1,000 francs per month to support " Ia toilette de l'Empereur , " they could not complain if they were required to bear a portion of the expense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not slow to improve it . There was a sudden failure of supplies-wood and coals became scarce , the cows refused to give milk , the hens to lay eggs , the beef was " fly blown , " the " mutton indifferent , " the " wine sour , " the " ale not drinkable . " Soon there was heard a crashing of plate and the rattling of broken silver on its way to James Town to procure the necessaries of life for the starving inmates of Longwood . The sound of the p late was kept up at intervals to suit the progress of the game ; Napoleon expressing great delight at the success of the trick to confound the governor  --  the effect of this " forty-eight pound ball in the camp of the enemy. ** " Few facts connected with the captivity of Napoleon , " says Mr. Forsyth , " have excited more sympathy than the sale , by him , of his plate . And if any necessity for the sale really existed , it must have reflected indelible reproach // upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If we believe Count Las Cases , there can be no 4oubt about the matter ; for he tells ns that provisions were ordered to be purchased by the sale of the plate , ' and that , one morning , feeling hungry , he asked for a mouthful of bread , and was told that there was none for him . ' Thus , ' he says , we are denied both meat and drink . ' The whole affair was a maneuvre of Napoleon to create false sympathy for himself , and to draw public odium on Sir Hudson Lowe . " This is proved by extracts from those unpublished letters of O'Meara to which we have referred , in which he says , " You know they have taken out the eagles , and beaten up into a mass a portion of the plate , openly and avowedly , for the purpose of providing money , in order to cover expenses over and above the government allowance . The object they have in view in this is very evident , and does not require me to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private letter to his friend , Mr. Finlaison , O'iMieara says- " In this ( the selling of the plate ) he ( Bonaparte ) has also a wish to excite an odium against the governor , by saying that he has been obliged to sell his plate in order to provide against starvation , as he himself told me was his object . " Las Cases in assigning the cause for the selling of the plate to be the scarcity of provisions , contradicts himself ; for he declares , " there was always enough to eat , but not enough for a good table . " What the Count meant by a good table we shall presently see . Bonaparte at this time had vast funds at his disposal , both on the island and in Europe , if the statements of his followers , Las Cases and Gourgaud , are to be believed . Abbott states that " Napoleon took immense treasures with him to St. Helena in his pockets or under his shirt , where search was not made , on board the Bellerophon , some eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Diamonds would go as far as silver plate to procure the necessaries of life , but the metal would ring louder . From some estimates of the quantity of provisions furnished by the government for Longwood , it appears that the French had no reason to complain of short commons , the grievance assigned for the disposal of the silver ware . We hope to be excused , if , in touching the question of " the supplies , " we are obliged to descend to details respecting beef and wine . We have been interested , and our readers may be , in a particular examination of these " awful privations " of the exiles who have filled the world with their lamentations " O'er curtailed dislie8 and o'er stinted wines . " // memorable for the sale of the plate , we copy some items of the scale of allowance for Bonaparte 's table from October , 1816 , to June , 1817 : - " Daily-meat , 82 lbs. ; fowls , 6 in number ; bread , 66 lbs. ; butter , 5 lbs. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables , in value 20s . Per fortnight , ducks , turkeys , geese , loaf sugar , fine rice , hams , fish , fresh butter , " &amp;c . " Macaroni , vermicelli , dried haricots , liquers , foreign cheese of superior quality , Mocha coffee , have been supplied , which are not mentioned in the schedule . " It is to be observed that the greatest number of Bonaparte 's family during the time embraced in the scale was only nine , without including several children ; and for a portion of time , only six . A part of the servants employed in the house , and the surgeon and orderly officer in attendance , had separate rations . But if there was any want of food , there certainly was no lack of wine . From " the general statement of wines furnished for General Bonaparte 's *honsehold , from October 1 , 1816 , to June 30 , 1817 , " we copy the rate of supply for one quarter : SUPPLIED FROM THE GOVERNMENT STORES . Bottles . Claret 530 Yin de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,038 Teneriffe 552 Madeira i04 Constantia 92 3,724 The quantity of malt liquors supplied in three months was 504 bottles . The grand total of wines and malt liquors consumed in this thirsty household by principals and servants in nine months , for which period the scale is drawn , amounts to 11,518 bottles . These statements certain*ly show that there was no want of attention on the part of the governor and his assistants , to the comfort of the exiles , so far as their bill of fare was concerned . An extract from the confidential letters of O'Meara , showing the general style of living at Longwood , may explain in part the " awful privations , " and why even $60,000 per annum did not support this establishment . " You are , perhaps , not aware of the French mode of living and their cookery . They have in fact two dinners every day-one at eleven or twelve o'clock , at which joints , roast and boiled , with all their various hashes , ragouts , fricasses , &amp;c. , are served up with wine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only differs // from the first in being supplied with more dishes* Besides these two meals , they all have ( except Bonaparte , who only eats twice a day , certainly , very heartily ) something like an English breakfast in bed between eight and nine o'clock in the morning , and a luncheon with wine at four or five in the af ternoon . " In another letter O'Meara speaks of the French as " the greatest epicures and gluttons " he ever saw , " with the exception of one or two . " To Major Gorrequer he remarked , " They use 30 lbs . of beef in soup every day , which is boiled down to rags , and not fit for anything afterwards . " In view of this statement we are not surprised to hear the governor say , " If they choose to use their meat in that way , there was no telling what would be enough ; a couple of hams or 100 lbs . of meat would go little way in consomm*s . " It is not denied that through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions of a bad quality may have been sent occasionally to Longwood . It is certain , however , that Europe , St. Helena , and the Cape of Good Hope , were levied upon to supply Bonaparte 's table . To such an extent were these contributions exacted upon the island , as to lead to serious complaints against the government contractors . They were accused of a " sweeping monopoly , " and a petition was presented to the governor , asking that a sufficient quantity of milk for the use of the sick of the 53d regiment , might be furnished by the same farmers who had before supplied it , provided the surgeon of the regiment pay the same price as the contractor . Any inconvenience arising from spoiled provisions , or deficiency in any article of consumption , the governor promptly removed through his agents , and often provided from his own table , in addition to the expected supplies , many luxuries . As indications of Sir Hudson 's disposition towards Bonaparte , we notice scattered through Mr. Forsyth 's volumes such extracts as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Balcombe , the purveyor : " A complaint has been made through the orderly officer at Longwood , of the quality of the mutton sent there for the last two or three days . Will you be good enough to give the strictest injunction that it is sent up of the best quality . " By the *ame to Mr. Ibertson : " The governor has had his attention , very painfully , drawn of late to some complaints , of a serious nature , respecting supplies at Longwood . The first , respecting the failure of fresh butter . The failure of any article of daily supply is not for a single day to be withheld from his information . Fruit is another article which you are bound equally , to provide . The governor can admit of no plea for your not receiving a supply of oranges and such fruit as may // be in season , from the Cape of Good Hope , by every vessel that comes from it . " From a note from the governor to the orderly officer : " The bearer will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farquen , governor of the Isle of France , destined particularly for General Bonaparte . It is the whole of what I received , and is of a quality that can not be again readily procured . " Mr. Carr , the baker , was directed to obtain " the best flour . " When the beer was reported to be " not so drinkable , " the purveyor was directed to procure what was called " Hodson 's pale ale . " Montholon , on one occasion , returned thanks to the governor " for the jelly . " Mr. Henry , who resided many years at St. Helena , says , " When a pheasant , the greatest rarity of the season , appeared on the governor 's table , one was sure to be sent to Longwood . " These particulars are worth much in this connection . The instruction given to Mr. Carr , the baker , or the gift of a pheasant , more or less , or sweet oranges from the Cape , *r a cask of Hodson 's pale ale , could not affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor relieve the tedium of exile , but as expressions of Sir Hudson 's good will to his captives , they ought to have mitigated the ferocity of the imperial tyrant , who filled Europe with complainings of the " jailer who was killing him with pin wounds . " " The regulations , " another fruitful source of trouble at St. Helena , we notice in this place . If it was right to imprison the disturber of the world 's peace , it was right to keep him in safe custody. * For this purpose his written correspondence was confined to unsealed letters , which were to pass through the hands of the governor , a necessary measure , especially after it was known that this precaution did not prevent the inmates of Longwood from holding secret communications with all parts of the world . Through sealed letters and ciphers , in newspapers , correspondence was kept up with Bonaparte 's partisans in Europe . Pamphlets , money , and other articles , were transmitted to and from Longwood , without the knowledge of the governor or his assistants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no lack of agents for private communications ; that he had himself employed them ; that 10,000 pounds in Spanish dollars were received at the time of the disposal of the plate . These agents , he said , were persons on board the English ships which touched at the island , to whom the attendants of Bonaparte had free ac * We afflrm the necessity and justice of Bonaparte 's confinement . Our main inquiry , however , respecting his treatment and behavior at St Helena , does not involve this vexed question . // 283 cess at all times . It was the unguarded boast of Bertrand that the Emperor could command millions by giving a bit of paper . O'IMleara and some of the English officers were privy to concealed correspoudence . Las Cases was detected in sending from the island , by means of a servant who had eluded the sentries at midnight and entered his apartment , writings on silk in characters too small to be detected by the naked eye . That the restriction upon Napoleon 's correspondence was a hardship , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe , or writing to his banker and agent , was urged by way of complaint in Parliament by Lord Holland . To which Earl Bathurst replied , that " there was one preliminary to Bonaparte 's reception of letters from his friends , and that was , that his friends should write to him . " " He did not deny , " his lordship said , " that in a correspondence between friends the necessity of sending letters open was a severe restricti&amp;n , as it exposed , to the cold eye of an inspector , the warm effusions of the heart . But this did not apply to a correspondence with a banker . Who had ever heard of an affectionate draft upon a banking house , or an enthusiastic order for the sale of stock . Sir IEl7udson Lowe had exercised the trust reposed in him with the utmost delicacy , and when any letters were transmitted through his hands , had never permitted any individual , however confidential , to see them . " If the safe custody of Napoleon restrained his correspondence , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his free access to every part of it . Hence those obnoxious regulations , the confinement of his movements to a circuit of twelve miles , if unattended , with liberty to roam at pleasure in the company of a British officer ; and the requirement that the orderly officer should be assured either by observation or the testimony of some responsible person of Bonaparte 's actual presence at Longwood , every day . These rules of a " respectful captivity " were resisted by the French with a resolution which in a better cause would have been heroicnot in the expectation of effecting by their complaints any material change in these regulations , but with the pitiful purpose of foiling the governor and teazing his assistants . The daily duty of the orderly officer , for example , was well understood , but rather than be seen out of doors by any one in a British uniform , or give any assurance of his being at home , the illustrious exile confined himself for months together , to his own apartments . Through reports of servants and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupations in this seclusion-riding exercise on a sort of hobby constructed // of a balanced beam with a weight equivalent to that of Bonaparte 's person at one end , and a saddle at the other . This saddle the general mounts , and with his feet touching the ground , the conqueror of the world is seen moving up and down at pleasure ; for an interlude to this recreation , peeping with his imperial spy-glass through holes bored in the windows of the billiard room , to watch , without being seen , the movements of the officer without ; barricading his doors ; threatening to shoot any one who might venture into his presence ; compelling the poor " orderly " to stand at his post for ten hours at a time , or hang round the house exposed to the inclemency of the weather , the jibes of the French servants , and the insults of Montholon , who told him on one occasion that if he wished to see the Emperor he could " look through the key hole . " The officer , thwarted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferings , in his journal , in amusing , if not moving strains , of which the following entries are specimens : " Yesterday I was on my feet at least ten hours , walking about Longwood garden , but had no opportunity given me of seeing General Bonaparte . " " The weather is at present so bad that I fear my health will be greatly injured , if I am under the necessity of continuing this system , in order to procure a sight of General Bonaparte . " " Napoleon Bonaparte still keeps himself concealed . " " I believe that I saw General Bonaparte today in the act of stropping his razor in the dressing room . " " I have not seen the general to-day . But there is a person sitting now in his billiard room with a cocked hat on . I , however , can only see the hat moving about . If the French are accustomed to eat with their hats on , probably this was Napoleon Bonaparte at his dinner. ** With equal caprice , Napoleon fretted against " the limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that his circuit of twelve miles , for riding or walking unattended , would be enlarged . But wishing to have a grievance to complain ofcharges to make  --  and to win the honor of martyrdom , he confirmed his ill health by neglecting horse exercise for four years . And when , in order to his being excluded from free access to an inhabited ravine , a certain road was cut off from the original limits , " he complained bitterly of the loss he had sustained in not being allowed to ride unattended on a road which when open to him he had never used . " Notwithstanding the restrictions , the array of arms , and frowning batteries upon the island , and ships of war in the harbor , there were not wanting opportunities for Bonaparte 's // escape from St. Helena . Gourgaud reported that such a thing was not considered impossible at Longwood ; that the matter had been discussed there , but that the Emperor , rather than risk the attempt , preferred to wait for some change in the British ministry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plots in North America and in the Brazils , for the rescue of Napoleon , reached the English government . If some of these were fallacious , if the mysterious vessel seen hovering around the island , was either " the long , low , black schooner , " or " the Flying Dutchman , " there was reliable information enough to arouse the jealous watch of England over her implacable enemy , and to lead her to transmit fresh instructions to Sir Hudson Lowe , that he should neglect no precaution for the security of his prisoner . " A dash down a ravine and the strokes of a few oars might have set Napoleon free , if the most unremitting care had not been taken to prevent secret concert and intelligence with the external world . ' " And what , " said Lord Bathurst , " would Europe have thought if the escape from St. Helena had followed the escape from Elba , and Bonaparte had re-appeared in France , to light up the flames of civil war and involve the continent in a conflagration ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restrictions which was consistent with the largest liberty of a captive , and the security of his person . This was seen in the indulgence given to the orderly officer , who on account of the difficulties thrown in his way , did not fully execute his orders . Rather than enforce the severe measure , which the literal interpretation of his instructions required and the conduct of his prisoner justified , of intruding upon the privacy of Bonaparte , when he chose to hide himself , Sir Hudson remained for weeks together , without any certain information that the General was at Lougwood . This regard for the feelings of the exile , it seems , called forth some complaint from the British Government , as being an interference with what was considered an indispensable regulation . And it is a little remarkable that those acts of the " insular tyrant , " which the ministry , in their dispatches show any disposition to censure , were always on the side of humanity . In one instance he detained for several days a ship bound for England , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be transmitted to his government , that Bonaparte was upon the island . Without making words about the imperial title or the regulated intercourse of the islanders and strangers of distinction , with the inmates of Longwood , we pass to notice what may be // considered the explanation of this long story , the thread of the whole plot , the key to all the " mysteries of St. Helena " - the unprovoked personal abuse which Bonaparte bestowed upon Governor Lowe . There is , certainly , a point in human placability beyond which the reproaches and revilings even of a captive are not to be borne . If that point was ever reached and passed , it was done by the fallen tyrant who lost no opportunity to wound the pride of the man who allowed his prisoner every indulgence compatible with his duty in an honorable calling , and whose only defect seems to have been the want of a handsome countenance and of the manners of a French count . " We are astonished , " says Lamartine , " at the insults , the provocations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends outraged the governor at every turn . " Sir Hudson felt these stings , but there was no relief . He would not wound a prisoner even by a word . So he shunned a meeting which he thus describes- " Where the attack is all on one side , and the accuser thinks himself at liberty to use every weapon , that falls under his hand , fair or foul , and has a shield in his own adversity . " So keenly did the accuser use foul weapons as to prevent his having any intercourse with the governor , after five interviews during the early months of his captivity . For nearly five years Sir Hudson and his prisoner never met except once or twice by chance on the grounds of Longwood . The first interview was one of mere ceremony . After the second , Napoleon professed to have conceived such a dislike for his visitor , as to order the valet to throw a cup of coffee out of the widow , saying , " the governor 's looks have poisoned it . " The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion and the provoking composure with which his victim bore it . We may form some idea of the nature of this attack , from what the Emperor said about it afterwards . The confession is the more significant , being one of the few instances on record of his having ever acknowledged a fault . Las Cases says , " The Emperor reverted to the subject of the interview . I behaved very ill to him no doubt , said he , and nothing but my present situation could excuse it ; but I was out of humor , and could not help it . However , the governor proved himself very insensible to my severity . I would have liked , for his sake , to have seen him evince a little anger , or pull the door violently after him when he went away. ** But these reo'rets did not prevent the " imperial sage " from assailing Sir f'udson Lowe again , with a storm of bitter reproaches , for which the " phlegm " of the governor was the only provocation , He was called an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the work of an assassin , " " not knowing how to act towards men of honor , " destitute of all honor , the instrument of the blind hatred of Earl Bathurst , " a sentinel , " " nothing but the scribe of an etat major . " Napoleon said of this conversation afterwards , that he was " sorry he lost his temper so much , " that " the whole time he was on the throne of France , he was never in such a passion , or made use of such language to any one before . ' * " The Emperor admitted , " said Las Cases , " that he had during the conversation repeatedly and severely offended Sir Hudson Lowe . " He also did him the justice to acknowledge that Sir Hudson Lowe had never shown any want of respect . " The only failure , " said the Emperor , " on the part of the governor , which was trifling compared with the treatment which he received , was the abrupt manner in which he retired , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor said , this is the second time in my life that I have spoiled my affairs with the English ; their phlegm leads me on and I say more than I ought . " It was English phlegm , then , and not English abuse , which carried the " imperial sage " through such disgraceful scenes , for which even his followers are constrained to record his apology . Sir Hudson , unwilling to expose himself further to railing , which he could not even rebuke , discontinued his visits to Longwood , and for the remaining years of the captivity his prisoner had no reason to complain of any personal affront from his " jailer . " As it has been intimated , these interviews furnish the clew to the piece , the explanation of those " quarrels " and " angry disputes . " They should be borne in mind whenever the tragedy of St. Helena is passed before us , and there rises upon the stage the uneasy ghost of the hero shriekin g for the crown of martyrdom and canonization . It is here seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a war Bonaparte was going to wage against those who might interfere with his convenience , or possibly hurt his feelings , by restricting his rides , or by posting sentinels around his house after dark ; and what prospect there was for accommodation by offering terms . The object of these assaults maintained his dignity and temper with such firmness as to show that the " absence of all severity would be the real g:rievance . " Though these unfortunate interviews closed forever the avenues to friendly intercourse between the governor and his charge , the civilities and kind offices of the former were continued to the close of Napoleon 's life . They were seen in the attention bestowed upon the new house built for the French exiles , who were consulted with regard to every arrangement within , or // embellishment without , and indulged in their whims and even captions demands-in watchfulness not only over the lEmperor 's person but over his health , when he had impaired it by the rigor of self-imprisonment-in urging almost to importunity the acceptance of the service of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plantation Housein removing , when it could be done with safety , the barriers to free communication with every part of St. Helena , and the restraints of military supervision-in affording assistance and counsel during the last illness of Napoleon , and in paying the sad tribute of respect to his memory in the imposing funeral solemnities . After the mortal scene had closed we hear Sir Hudson say , when conversing on the character of the deceased , " He was England 's greatest enemy and mine too , but I forgive him everything . On the death of so great a man we should only feel deep concern and regret . " Is this the man who has been called " the inhuman turnkey of a jail , " " who wantonly and maliciously tortured his victim through six long years of oppression and despondency " - " whose name , " Abbott says , " is embalmed in eternal infamy " - of whom Napoleon recorded , " it is necessary to his enjoyment to torture me like the tiger who tears with his claws the prey whose agonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " insulting jailer " of Harper 's Magazine , the " insular tyrant " of the Southern Review , the " Sicilian hangman , " " constable , " " leader of brigands and chief of spies " mentioned by O'Meara and the French writers ? Some of these authors have repudiated , in their unimpassioned moments , their own calumnies . Montholon , who calls the governor on one page " a hyena , " on another sets down , " Sir Hudson was a man of great ability , an excellent man of business and of great probity , his principal vice was a want of confidence . " It belongs to a later generation of writers to be consistent slanderers , and to retail in the respectable name of history the grossest misrepresentations . Sir Hudson Lowe must have been more than human , considering his position-charged on one side by his government and in the name of humanity , with the safe keeping of the chief of slaughtermen , and met by him on the other at the head of a snarling crew of French counts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sensitive honor of a soldier-if he had never hesitated for a moment , in adopting a particular regulation , under general instructions , or had never enforced a restriction which , after balancing the probabilities of his prisoners ' escape , might have been dispensed with ; but to say that he erred in any important // matter , or that he purposely inflicted one unnecessary pain upon his unfortunate charge , is to affirm what , in view of the recent publication of his Memoirs , history will never sanction . On the other hand , he will rise in excellence of character above his hard-hearted , but more renowned oppressor : he will be recognized as a high-minded British officer , who having distinguished hnnself in the dreadful wars of the period in which he lived , was promoted , at a crisis in his country 's history , to a post of unparalleled delicacy and importance , the military guardianship of Napoleon ; and who having fulfilled his trust with firmness tempered with mercy , upon his retirement from office received the unqualified approval of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants of St. Helena , " for the consideration , justice , impartiality and moderation , which had distinguished his administration . " We allow Mr. Forsyth , speaking through one who knew Sir Hudson Lowe , to offer one last tribute of honor to his memory . " I witnessed his able conduct as governor of St. Helena ; I saw him when the malice of his enemies had gained the ascendant , and covered him with unmerited opprobrium ; I beheld him on his death-bed , and throughout these various phases in his career , I admired and respected his character , while I truly loved the man . " But what shall we say of his imperial oppressor , the illustrious exile ? We approach him now as he is seen in captivity , cast down from a throne , divested of the glory of war , abandoned by his followers , guarded by his enemies . Withdrawn from common observation , he is to prove his superiority to vulgar minds by the manner in which he meets his fate . We do not ask for his Memoirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations , nor for " remarkable conversations , " fitted to travel down the same long road to posteritynor for interesting anecdotes of the Emperor in costume , as he is seen in caricatures , standing on a rock in mid ocean , with folded arms , looking over the waste of waters into boundless futurity . We wish to know how he behaves under real suffering ; how he bears the iron hand of adversity . If his great strength fails here ; if he flinches now ; if he is gloomy , capricious , sullen , sly , fretful , revengeful ; if , worried by long confinement , he snatches through the bars of his prison an innocent victim to appease his wrath ; if he has no self-reliance , no peace of mind , no trust in God-he darkens the page of his history-he makes no atonement for his crimes . From the first moment of his captivity to the last , instead of submitting with dignity to his obvious destiny , he fought // against it , as he had fought the forces of Europe on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his person , whether it respected his correspondence , his company , or his personal moveinents , was regarded as an act of tyranny , inflicted with the deliberate purpose of prolonging the pains of his martyrdom . Any annoyance , though trivial and unpremeditated , was magnified into a grievance awful enough to excite the pity of mankind . Professing to think that the British ministry had determined to take his life in order to rid themselves of a political incumbrance and a costly pensioner , he charged the governor to his face with holding the deliberate purpose to kill him . Any proposed change in the existing regulations , he regarded as some new plot to annoy him , or to circumscribe his freedom . Even kind attentions , designed to mitigate his suffer ings , were presumed to be inspired by malice , and the offender was gruffly told " the Emperor will not receive favors from any one . " He employed his gigantic mind not only in dictating his Memoirs , but in petty devices to annoy the governor and his officials ; and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as over a great battle won . The difference insisted upon between the Emperor Napoleon ' and General Bonaparte , ' called forth bulletins sufficient to excite a new revolution in Europe . " One half the disgusts which I experience here , " we hear this great man say , " arise from this source . " And these disgusts were neither few nor small , for they were the pains of that mortal agony " made sufficiently long to cause his death to appear natural . " So stubbornly did Napoleon resist his fate , as to lose the advantage of all those ameliorating circumstances of his situation which a noble mind would have improved . Rather than submit to an open correspondence , he cut off all communication with Europe except in a clandestine manner . Because certain formalities were not observed in introducing visitors to Longwood , he shut his door against all comers . A district of twelve miles was open for his riding or walking , unattended . But rather than pass the guard at the lodgegates , or meet by chance in his path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precincts of Longwood . For months he never left his apartments , lest he should be seen by the officer whose business it was to be assured of Napoleon 's presence at Longwood every day . After the old house had become uncomfortable , though complaining of damps and chills , he refused to occupy the new house , because the ornamental iron railing around it reminded him of a cage . Under the course of treatment which Bonaparte prescribed for himself , it is not surprising if his health and temper grew rapidly worse . But he persisted // in refusing the proffered services of the best English physicians , while he complained of being " left to struggle with the attacks of disease , having had for two years , chronic hepatatis . " Antommarchi and the two priests sent from Europe by his friends , did not relieve Napoleon 's physical or mental disorders . The sight of Antommarchi became hateful to him . The medical attendant could not endure the reproaches of his patient , and he petitioned the governor to be sent to Europe , alledging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor . " Separated from a part of his followers , the fallen hero is doomed to see his remaining companions waiting to be released from obedience to a capricious master , whose favoritism had provoked among themselves , jealousy and mortal hatred . Las Cases had been sent from the island , for a flagrant violation of the restrictions which he had promised to obey . General Gourgaud had challenged Montholon to deadly combat , and sailed for Europe , in avowed disgust with the whole Longwood comp any . The traitor O'Meara , the first physician of Napoleon , had been sent away for numerous offenses . Madam Montholon had escaped the jealousy of her rival , Countess Bertrand , by a voyage to England . There remained of the original company of exiles only Montholon and the Bertrands . In the bosom of this miserable family of profane and infidel counts , with a medical attendant who was unfit for his calling , and a ghostly comforter who could neither read nor write , the last scenes of Napoleon 's life drew rapidly to a close . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of the malady , which betokened a fatal result , destroyed the exile 's hope of being able again to control the affairs of Europe . With the decay of this expectation , there came no relenting , no reparation , no submission to the decrees of heaven . That invincible will which in its pride had taken no account of impossibilities , defies the inflictions of Divine power and turns from its consolations . Weak and suffering , the conqueror of the world summons his remaining strength and resources , and expends them in fretting against the barriers of a hopeless bondage , or in provoking his military guardians . In the paroxysm of his disgusts with all mankind , he refuses the kind offices of his companions and drives them from his presence . As his mental and bodily anguish increases , he hides in the deepest gloom of his apartment , crouching in dark corners or burying himself in the folds of his bed , muttering curses on his enemies . He bequeaths " the horrors and opprobrium of his last moments to all the reigning monarchs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last will and testament , 10,000 francs to the wretch // who attempted to assassinate the Duke of Wellington . In the same instrument he endeavors to justify the crime by declaring that " Cantallon had as much right to murder that oligarchist as the latter had to send me to perish on the rock of St. Helena . " Is this the illustrious exile , the imperial sage , the magnanimous sufferer , Napoleon the great , " second only to one human being in moral grandeur ! " Is this the man who " opposed to his persecutions the most perfect serenity , " who claimed in his own name honors from posterity for his dignified submission to the ills of life , and in whose behalf we hear his obsequious follower exclaim , " the sight of a great man struggling with adversity is the sublimest of spectacles ! " We do not venture upon the dying scene . It has often received a touch of the sublime from abler pens than ours . The anatomy of the corpse demonstrated for the relief of the climate of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally , that Napoleon died of cancer of the stomach , an hereditary malady which had been fatal to his father . The attempt of Antommarchi , therefore , to establish a chronic disease in the liver of his illustrious patient , as proof of harsh treatment and bad air , proved a failure . The funeral ceremony befitted the occasion . The corpse of the great chieftain after reposing in state , was borne with all the honors of war , to the place of interment , a secluded spot under some willows , by a fountain . " The priest , Vignali , performed the last rite , and as the body was lowered into the earth , three volleys of musketry , and discharges of cannon over the grave , thundered the requiem of Napoleon . " Napoleon is dead . The long drawn labors of his American biographer , we hope , are ended . The island , the sepulcher , the willow trees , are crumbling memorials of the conqueror who has found at last a mausoleum on the banks of the Seine . Peace to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repose of his soul we are not permitted to pray .
