July , ART . VJ. - The Trees of America . By R. U. PIPER , M. D. Boston . 18*37 . Nos. 1 , 2 . THERE are some topics which claim periodical notice in the pages of an American quarterly . Not the least important of these is the subject of " American Forest-Trees . " In dealing with this subject , our IReview has already proved itself faithful , and within a quarter of a century has furnished at east four elaborate essays on this fertile theme . The time is fully accomplished for a return to it . Nine interstitial years have brought it to our perihelion , and the attraction to it is made stronger by the welcome intrusion of the new work which Dr. Piper announces . We are glad of the occasion to say a few words which ought , in due course , to be said at this time . The subject , indeed , does not lack discussion . Agricultural newspapers and reports , the circulars of nursery owners , and frequent articles in the daily journals , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few solid treatises that have been published have already become scarce . The translation of Michaux 's great work , indifferent and imperfect as it was , has quite disappeared . Brown e 's " Sylva Americana " has passed out of circulation ; and his larger work , on the " Trees of America , " which never reached , we believe , its second volume , is hardly known by name to learned librarians . Nuttall 's valuable supplement to Michaux , a most curious monument of persevering zeal and enterprise , is now exceedingly rare . Even the comparatively recent Report of Mr. Emerson on the " Trees and Shrubs of Massachusetts " is not to be had at the bookstores . The text-books of medical and scientific botany deal only incidentally with the subject . A new general work on the " Trees of America , " therefore , comes to us fresh , and as a sort of surprise . The plan of Dr. Piper 's publication , as stated in his prospectus , if less exact than that of previous works , is more comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entertaining , rather than scientific , - a book of engravings , with a running practical commentary . The text will be a frame for the pictures , and a pleasant filling up of the intervening // spaces , - partly description , partly suggestion , partly historical and critical observation ; not by any means , however , for this reason inferior in value to the pictures . Dr. Piper* s pictorial illustrations ( lifer from those of other writers of his class in being copies of individual trees , rather than of genera or species . He gives , not merely the likeness of an oak , but of the " Assabet Oak " and the " Charter Oak " ; not merely the likeness of an elm , but of the " Avery Elm " in Stratham , and the " Elm on Boston Common " ; likenesses not merely of such trees as grow in America , but of famous trees which actually exist in America , and may so be taken as types of their species . These are the several heads of a discourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike to the farmer , the landscape-gardener , and the gentleman owner , - to boards of health , railway corporations , and all friends of improvement . Of Dr. Piper 's qualifications for the bold and large task which he has undertaken , we can only say that he has the eye of an artist , the hand of a draughtsman , and the spirit of an enthusiast . His knowledge of trees and their habits is ample , his experience in their management has been equally long and successful , and his love for them amounts to a passion . The labor of preparing such a work is far too slow for his swift desire , yet he will do his task no faster than he can do it well . At the date of our writing , two numbers of the work have been issued , which , as specimen numbers , give a most favorable prophecy of what is to come . Each number contains four engravings and sixteen pages of letter-press , in quarto form , electrotyped on paper as thick as parchment , with wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress has been given to no American book . The nicer mechanical labor has been performed by the author , who can etch as skilfully as he sketches , and will intrust his more delicate work to no unpractised hand . The book is not sufficiently advanced to enable us to judge fairly of its literary merits . We can say with safety , nevertheless , that it will be always earnest , always clear , and never dry . The fault which we have most to fear is a redundancy of quotation , by which Dr. Piper 's modesty seeks needlessly to justify and fortify his own opin // ions . His own authority is competent , without such help . The work is to be published in quarterly parts , at a subscription price of two dollars a year . We are glad to learn that already a considerable number of subscribers have recorded their names ; and we are permitted to add that , by the liberality of a distinguished cultivator and gentleman , Mr. Frederic Tudor , the continuance of the enterprise is guaranteed . Itis a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who asks no profit for himself ; but we venture to bespeak for him the assistance of all whose tastes and whose means allow them to become subscribers . We commend especially to close inspection the admirable drawing of the " ash forest " in Maine , which makes the frontispiece to the second number , in which immense difficulties of detail and of light and shade are so beautifully mastered , and which , to our eyes , no photograph could surpass . We have seen other delineations of Dr. Piper , both in surgical anatomy and in natural scenery , which were remarkable , but nothing quite equal to this view . The drawing of the great Winchester Pine-tree is also wonderfully perfect . In the progress of the work , it is intended to include all those trees in this country which have , by their size , their age , their peculiarities , or their associations , any especial claim to notice . In most instances , the engravings will be from sketches taken directly from the tree by Dr. Piper . Occasionally , as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be copied from the work of another hand . The number of parts to which the work will extend , will depend on the health of the author . If his design is carried out , not less than twenty will appear . This Review , * we think , was one of the first to utter a warning against the wanton waste of our beautiful forests . Already , in a single generation , the good fruits of the reactionary movement are visible , and some of the cleared tracts are clothed anew with woods which the hand of man has planted . The desolation which threatened whole sections of our country has been partially arrested ; the Ohio farmer has restored what his father destroyed ; and in the new lands of the West there are estates which resemble the parks and // groves of England . In this Eastern region , where the waste was less notable , the decrease has , unfortunately , gone on more rapidly . To the consumption of timber in house-building and ship-building have been added the insatiable demands of railroads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for the forests an open sepulchre . Thirty years ago , the State of Maine was described as " a dense wilderness . " Now , it is possible to ride for miles in its interior without the protection of any grateful shade . The coast line of Massachusetts is not now marked , as the Pilgrims beheld it , by the sombre edging of uniform woods ; but the rim of the horizon is divided by numerous clefts and vistas , through which the voyager sees the setting sun . The hills around Salem are almost as bare as the hills around Jerusalem ; and there is more than one interval , blank as the Roman Campagna , where the names of the early settlers were once perpetuated in the forests which they owned . " Brown 's Woods " is most likely nothing but a pasture , diversified by a few straggling apple-trees ; and half a dozen oaks perpetuate the memory of " Clark 's Grove . " Thousands of acres of woodland have been burned over within the last dozen years , kindled by sparks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1830 on the banks of the Miami , is repeated in 1850 along the Merrimac . Accident and avarice are doing for the old lands of the East what the settler 's necessities seemed to compel in the new lands of the West . It is curious , too , to note the changes in taste and sentiment , as marked in the disappearance of various sorts of trees . Gone are those stately lines of Lombardy poplars which once stiffly fringed our roadways , or stood sentinels before our aristocratic mansions ; and the satirist of bachelors must seek some other type for his caustic comparison . Gone are those " Balms of Gilead " which softened the light by their polished leaves , and loaded the air with their spicy perfume , above many a New England farm-house . The gudewife no longer points to her " shoemake " ( as the sumach-tree was formerly called ) , with its crimson clusters , the pride of her trim front garden . The great sycamores have fallen before the economical wrath of a people who can not pardon such obsti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sentimental willows now weep mostly in ancient prints , where forlorn youths with pink faces bend above leaning gravestones : they are rejected from parks and door-yards . It is as difficult now to get in Boston a handful of locust-blossoms as a handful of orange-blossoms , and the flowers of the lilac are as rare in our cities as flowers of the pomegranate . Where in New England are the blushing peach-orchards which once encircled beds of peas and parsley ? Where are the wild vines , once trained to festoon the walls and to garland the oak ? The fashion has changed . New claimants have supplanted the former favorites ; and rustic Tityrus now , instead of practising his woodland lay under a spreading beech-tree , reads the last French novel under the shade of his veranda , and in the odor of an " ailanthus . " If anything could provoke a saint to wrath , it is the frequent destruction of fine trees on the most frivolous pretences . Here a majestic elm is sacrificed because the dripping from its boughs moistens cheap shingles on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There a barn is to be removed , and all the trees which stand in the line of its direct course must give way . A couple of rowdies , returning on a dark night from a winter revel , are upset against an oak which projects into the road a foot or two ; straightway the sapient selectmen of the town debate the case , and solemnly order that the tree which has stood there since the memory of man shall be brought low , rather than a dollar shall be spent to widen the road at that point . Here , again , unfortunately , a new street must be laid out in a straight line , to satisfy the precise genius of modern engineering ; and the great tree that stops the way must disappear , root and branch , rather than a hair's-breadth be changed in the beautiful lithograph of attractive house-lots . The first care of a lucky broker , who has bought at a bargain some fine old estate , is to thin out and trim the trees and shrubbery on the model of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coax into regular rows , or inspect with half-shut eye . We know more than one instance where a quarrel between neighbors has led to the destruction of noble trees , simply because one thought // that he might annoy the other by depriving him of his shade . And there are not a few occasions to admire that thrift which cuts doxvn an orchard because birds get all the cherries , or boys and Irishmen steal all the apples . Provocation of this sort , which constantly vexes one in a large country town , suggests the question , whether he who removes a public ornament and good , even from his own land , is not as much a subject for the law as he who creates a public nuisance . The destruction of half a dozen fine shadetrees may be as great an injury to a neighborhood as the erection of an oil-boiler or a fish-house . Yet the one has an impunity not alloxved to the other . Many statutes are passed with much less moral justification than a statute to prevent the arbitrary cutting down of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in the deeds a restraining clause , - an entail for the trees which border the road , if not for those which surround the house . The tastes of the city exchange ought not to have unchecked license in the groves of the suburbs . At any rate , a legislative " resolution " on this subject would be quite as timely and sensible as most of the resolutions which are passed by legislative bodies . But there is also reason for fault-finding in the style and taste which prevail in planting trees , as well as in the vandalism which destroys them . Almost every one who owns a house must garnish it with a larger or a smaller number of trees , and the paint is scarcely dry upon the clapboards before ominous earth-works in the garden prophesy of future shade . Bnt the chances are that all these cavities will be occupied by trees of a single kind , elm , maple , or possibly linden , or that the utmost variety will be of two species . Our amateur planters are as reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his liquors . Straight lines , too , are the ruling law of average landscape planting ; the passion for curves is exceptional ; the genuine Yankee wants the shortest passage from his door to the roadway , and tolerates no angles in his welladjusted boundary . In four gardens out of five the rows of trees are perfectly straight , and in the fifth the curves are such as Nature would never have made , and in which the trees will get no healthy growth . Comparatively few , we imagine , in // setting out trees , order their position with reference to winds , to mutual protection , or to harmony with surrounding objects . And the man who has txvice and thrice seen the elms which he placed unguarded along his northern fence wilt and die , will continue to insert others in their places , marvelling at his strange ill-luck , when he has taken such pains with them . There is something to be blamed , then , in the constructive method , as well as in the destructive method , of dealing with trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose works are made manifest along our city streets , and the bolder advocacy , year by year , of alloxving our pasture and ploughed land to return to its original forest state . But the tree reform is yet in its earlier stage , and is hindered by very numerous and obstinate prejudices . It is still hard to convince a farmer that he would do well to let his corn-field become a wood , or to bring the shade of an elm above his young orchards , or to surround his house with dampness and darkness in the form of a grove . To the force of many reasons for planting trees he is quite insensible . He does not , for instance , at all understand why trees should be planted for the sake of their associations , or how he can do as much for his children by rearing oaks on his land as by hoarding his money in the bank . He may melt a little at his daughter 's touching performance of Mr. Morris 's elegiac entreaty to the woodman ; but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose to plant , if he plants at all , for profit and not for posterity . Your Yankee would hand down his name in connection with some enterprise or invention , some patent plough or patent churn or patent apple-parer , not in connection with laurels and oaks , like Daphne and the Druids . Yet there are some who will appreciate even this sentimental reason for planting trees . Any father will recognize it as a beautiful and easy way of commemorating the birth of children in his household . The members of a college class , revisiting the place of their early instruction , will see in the tree which they left there on their parting-day a permanent memorial of their former union . Travel strengthens the force of this reason . When we discover how wide and high and sacred are the memories which // are kept on earth by means of these signs , - when we have visited the churchyard at Stoke , with its " rugged yew-trees , " where Gray lies buried , or the " Buruham beeches , " where he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Penshurst , which marks the birth-time of Philip Sidney , or that huge tree at Grafton , where , nearly four centuries ago , Edward Plantagenet first met the Lady Elizabeth Woodville ; when we have rested under " Milton 's mulberry " in Christ Church Garden , and remembered Warton under the " Avon willows " ; when we have walked in that square of the silent Certosa , where the spray of the fountain still moistens the great cypress which Michael Angelo planted , or have lingered by that blasted trunk beneath whose shelter , when its boughs were green , poor Tasso was wont to look down over the Eternal City , and to dream and sigh his life away , - when we have found everywhere the most famous sites and events , in the history of war and genius and religion , from the massacre at Clisson to the victory at Marathon , from the spot in Cambridge where Washington met the American army to the spot in Bristol where Augustine held conference with the English bishops , or that most ancient place of meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Abraham and the angels , scenes of faith and valor and romance , fixed and perpetuated by these lords of the forest ,  --  we come to understand better this sentimental reason , which some esteem so lightly . This sort of association , indeed , can not generally be planned and provided for . The best associations come by chance , and no man can say when he plants a tree that it is destined hereafter to be joined in memory with any great thing . Yet many a man in his old age feels a deeper attachment to the home where he has always dwelt , because it is overhung by the boughs of the tree which , as a sapling , he put there in his boyhood . The house has gone to decay , it may be , and he must build a better . But the trees make the place so dear , that he can not let it pass from his possession , and his children will keep it because their father 's trees are there . In these days of change and uneasiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important and effective . Old 16* // furniture , family portraits , even the buried bones of ancestors , may go with the children in their restless migrations ; but the venerable trees can not be carried off . To part with these often costs the hardest struggle , when , to repair his broken fortunes , one must sell his paternal acres and remove to a new home far away . All feel that it is a sort of sacrilege to destroy a tree which has been consecrated by any noble association . Every patriot felt the insult , when the British troops in Boston cut down and burned for fuel the " Liberty tree " ; and all Connecticut lamented as a public calamity the fall of the Charter Oak . The aesthetic reason for tree-planting is certainly more generally acknowledged than the sentimental reason . The most unsophisticated eye , and the most cultivated , alike recognize the beauty of this kind of ornament . A Western pioneer and an 1tabitu* of the Bois de Boulogne hold the same opinion in regard to the general grace of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer in Lancaster , Massachusetts , rejoices in the majestic elms which make the glory of his village , as much as that refined foreigner who could not resist their fascination , and who fixed his home , as he has found his grave , beneath their spreading branches . A Brookline schoolboy feels the grace of an avenue of lime-trees as truly as an artist who luxuriates in the magnificence of the " Mall " of Utrecht , or forgets the wife of Napoleon in the enchantment of the entrance to her chateau at Meudon . This sense of the beauty of trees is anterior to teaching , and resists quite vigorously the forces which would extirpate it . A Maine lumberman , no doubt , looks with more satisfaction upon his felled log than upon the trunk which he must spare ; the crash of its fall is more delightful than the rustling of its leaves in the upper air ; yet no man is a better demonstrator of beauty in the outline and the growth of trees than this same lumberman . John IRuskin could not discourse more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest about the tall pine , which whistles and whispers above his winter home . This sense of the beauty of trees is often , indeed , very crude , and modified by very fantastic notions . We know a man , for instance , Vho can see no beauty in a tree which // is not symmetrical , and who is accustomed to cut off from his trees any limb , however large , when an accident has destroyed the corresponding limb . In this way he has gradually trimmed a spreading horsechestnut , wounded by the missiles of boys , till it now resembles an Egyptian palm , only a long stem with a feathery tuft at the top . We know another man who abhors trees with pinnate leaves , and so rejects from his estate every hind of locust and evergreen . We have already alluded to that perverted fancy which sees in the ragged poplars only types of extreme ugliness . Not a few are amazed that any man of taste can admire the white birch , that mean straggler along the roadside . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be offended by any tree which leans out of its perpendicular . The Connecticut ped1cr was true to the characteristic neatness of his native State vhen he wondered , looking upon the live-oaks of Georgia , garnished with their long pendants of gray moss , " why the people did u't scrape their trees . " Parasites and fungous growths are often enough to destroy all the beauty of trees to the eye of a gardener ; a hornet 's or caterpillar 's nest changes grace to deformity ; and the elm-branches become " horrid " when they drop by invisible threads the disgusting canker-worms . On the other hand , to some eyes the beauty of trees is improved by artificial appendages . Some whitewash the trunks for the sake of ornament ; and the bill-sticker in a New England village finds the monarch of the public square completely noble , only when it bears upon every front the charming announcement of a sheriffs sale , a caucus , and a monster caravan . This consideration of ornament is , fortunately , closely joined to the broader consideration of profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here art and interest are nearly identical , and taste will prove , in the language of the shrewd Jew planter of Bethlehem , " remunerative . " It can be demonstrated that the best use for the larger part of the cleared land of New England would be to plant forests upon it . There is , except in the rich gardens close around the cities , no land so profitable , no land which pays so good an interest on its cost , as woodland . In some parts of Massachusetts a man who owns a // hundred acres of pasture is little better than a bankrupt , while he who owns a hundred acres of forest is independently rich . The first must pay taxes on what does not pay for its culture , while the second can cut off enough to meet the annual interest , yet have more at the end than at the beginning . We once heard an eccentric genius maintain that his wood-land , about fifty in all , though he had boucrht it and acres * , , paid for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in reality never cost him a cent ; " for , " said he , " I have cut off wood enough to pay not only the original outlay , but to meet all the worth of the money at compound interest , and to cover all charges , and now I have more wood than I found there at the beginning . " It was a rational logic enough . We are confident , that , at the present prices of timber and fuel , the profits of wood-land to our New England farmers are at least three times as great as the profits of the land which they cultivate with so much labor . The experiment of planting locusts on Long Island has proved that lands , before considered valueless , may become the most precious possession of their owners . Thousands of acres now lying waste might , with a very small outlay , be made to yield very great returns . The length of time that must pass before the profit of these artificial forests can be tested , undoubtedly deters many from planting them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the returns begin to come only after twenty or thirty years . But every man knows that whatever raises the value of his land is as sure profit as that Thich actually puts cash into his pocket . There seems to be less promise in an acre of young locusts than in an acre of thriving turnips ; but in twenty years the value of all the annual turnips will not begin to reach the value of the trees . The longer the planter is willing to wait , the greater will be his ratio of gain . The early age at which trees are felled precludes a fair test of the superior profit of this kind of planting over corn-planting . Patience is a cardinal virtue , when we are dealing with forests . There should be on every farm of reasonable size an annual planting , as well as annual cutting , of trees . Most farmers consider it a duty to spend a portion of the year in this latter // exercise , and if they do not begin quite so early as Hesiod advises , - Ti4u* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * XE* , 7TT0pOOLO TE X ? 7yEL T*os* i*i'p ' l*XoTo ! LEiv IIEbLV ? ) IIEVO* GpLa Epya , - at least with the first days of winter they shoulder their axes , and make the woods ring with their brisk strokes . The ambition of a good wood-chopper is equal to that of a good rifle-shooter , and he who can cut and pile his eight cords " between daylight and dark " has a fame like the marksman who can split his ball at a hundred yards . Without the stimulus of an Agricultural Society 's prize , it ought to be considered a point of honor to plant at least as many trees as are cut down , - to keep the number at least full . As your shrewd fisherman takes care to put a second net across the river before the first is drawn out , so that no fish shall escape , so your shrewd farmer , while he draws his piles from one side of his wood off to the brick-yard , ought to know that a new forest is growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he penetrates so far . We shall not undertake to say what kinds of wood will yield the speediest and the largest profit , whether the oak , the pine , the cedar , or the locust . Any of these will richly repay the labor and the cost required for their growing . According to the quality of the soil will be the fitness of the trce . The profit of tree-planting , however , can not be measured by direct pecuniary returns . It affects economy in many ways , aside from the mere growth of the wood . The willow , for instance , a tree of comparatively little commercial value , is of inestimable worth in preserving the land along the banks of streams from the encroachment of the current . Few persons , who have not watched the changes of the banks at the bends of rivers , can have an idea of the damage which is done yearly to our land from this single cause . The land-slides which seem so curious along the Nile , at Manfaloot and Osloot , may be observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A double row of osiers is almost a sure protection against this damage . Colonel Colt has planted , it is said , no less than fourteen acres of these trees along the banks // LAY , of the Connecticut , and has proved himself in that labor a benefactor alike to the farmers and the basket-makers . The willow in such a situation has a rapid growth , and iii a few years a tame and dull stream may be made romantic by the shade which these hedges throw . We know of one river , at least , in New England , which flows through a flat and uninterestin g country , yet preserves the fame of beauty , mainly from the foliage along its margin . Most of our annual crops impoverish the soil . After two or three years of harvest , the grain-field must be left fallow for a season , or be turned to other uses . But trees constantly improve the soil , giving to it more than they draw from it . And they improve not only the soil on which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not insist upon the annual deposit of decaying leaves or broken boughs , which rot upon the ground , and so infuse into it the elements of new life , but may rather dwell upon one or two of the incidental results which are less considered ,  --  the connection of trees with the proper distribution of snow , and their influence in preventing too rapid evaporation . These topics are of the highest importance . Snow is proverbially called the " poor man 's manure . " But to justify this proverb , it must be properly laid and distributed . The Tuscan conceit , " la neve , per otto di , * madre alla terra , da mdi in la * matrigna , " hardly fits the latitude of New England , and , to be a good mother here , the snow must lend more than a single week of nursing . Two things are necessary to make of the snow an effectual protection to the soil , - that it fall as evenly , and stay as long , as possible . Now both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be met in no other way . By breaking the force of the wind , they prevent not only the drifting of the snow , but its melting also , a fact not so generally remembered . We have seen this remarkably exemplified in the severe storms of the last two winters . Fields that were exposed to the vind were left nearly bare , all the snow being piled up on their farther side against the wall of the roadway in deep drifts , while fields only a few rods off , sheltered from the wind by a wood , were covered by a uniform depth of a foot or more . Yet // the deep drifts disappeared earlier than the level snow , though the latter was quite as much exposed to the sun . It is not necessary to go into the woods in winter to find the number of inches of snow which have fallen ; that can be ascertained as well by gauging the fields which these woods have sheltered . Nor is it necessary , in order to break the force of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even should be evergreens . Leafless trunks and branches will check the blast as surely as the dark , thick boughs of the pine . Two or three rows of trees , which hardly intercept light at all , will work marvels in intercepting wind . Any one may observe this in his garden , by noticing the effect which even a row of currantbushes has in keeping quiet the leaves on the ground under their lee . This consideration emphatically appeals to the surveyors of roads and the managers of railways . The immense sums which have been spent in the past winters for opening the avenues of travel might in great part have been saved , if these avenues had been furnished with the easy protection of a couple of rows of trees on either side . It is not in city streets that such a protection is most needed , but in those open and exposed highways which are most neglected . Our tree-planting societies ought not to limit their efforts to the decoration of brick pavements , or the furnishing of shade to traffickers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the village , which give growth to the village according to their convenience , as well as beauty according to their ornament . Trees are good and useful within a city ; but they are far more useful by the highways which lead to the city . Munich could spare its trees from the streets , content with galleries and churches , but could not spare those majestic ornaments which for miles relieve and glorify the monotonous landscape around it . On most of our old roads Time has reared , without help from societies or selectmen , a tolerable natural hedge . But that perverse utilitarian fancy which defines a good road as the shortest way from the mill to the market , is annihilating this beneficial work of nature by its sagacious " improvements . " To save ten rods of distance in a mile , the old , un // dulating road , meandering along from house to house , and charming away by its change of lights and vistas the weariness of travel , is converted into a turnpike , hot , dusty , and monotonous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this change has been severely punished by the round bills for snow-clearing which have recently swelled the taxes of so many of our towns , and the only thing which can make this " improvement " tolerable is a liberal appropriation for the shelter and protection of these straightened roads . No county ought to be allowed to change the course of its public highways without putting the line of the new way in as good a condition as that of the old . And when commissioners decree that the ancient landmarks shall be removed , and the paths of the Pilgrims shall be transposed , so as to radiate from the effulgent circuit of some smart provincial " city , " they ought to take thought of the expense and the discomfort , not to speak of the deformity , which their decree involves . One of the first evils which our tree societies are called to remedy is this road-straightening mania . We read constantly of new inventions and new experiments which seek to diminish the cost of railway working , - changes in valves , boilers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not aware that any railway in this country has given a first , or even a second , place in its counsels to the planting of trees along its sides as a matter of economy . When such a course has been suggested , it has been supposed that it was only decoration that was thought of . Decoration , though by no means a slight reason for planting trees along railways , is , nevertheless , the least of reasons , if we consider dividends as the foremost need of these useful works . We advise trees along these roads as a remedy , first , for snow-drifts , secondly , for rapid consumption of fuel , and thirdly , for absolute deficiency in fuel . Every locomotive engineer knows where he finds the worst snow-drifts , - where the road is most open and exposed ; and it is almost never in the woods . A draught of air , no doubt , is an aid to speed by making steam faster ; but where the hours of arrival and departure are regulated , no additional speed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind saves the fuel . Every engineer knows how much more // fuel it requires on the open plain than in the woods , to maintain on a windy day the same rate of speed . The most expensive railways in England are not those which run through wooded regions , but those which cross the unsheltered plains ; and the heavier grades of shady Derbyshire are more than balanced by the bleak winds on Brighton Downs , where despair , according to Johnson , reaches its climax , and a man can not even hang himself for want of a tree to hold the rope . No territory can be more exposed to the wind than Belgium and Holland . Yet the railways there , some will plead , are cheaply managed . The seeming objection is a proof of our position , since every one who has travelled in the Low Countries knows how all kinds of avenues , railways , roads , and canals , are adorned and protected . The whole region looks like a great nursery , and the most boisterous winds , sweeping over those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impalpable fragments . We are confident that , in this matter of the rapid consumption of fuel , the saving from protection against winds on our railways would amount at the end of the year to a considerable item . It may seem ludicrous to suggest that the few trees which can be grown along the line of a railway will perceptibly supply the deficiency of fuel . Yet a simple mathematical reckoning will show that the suggestion is not a jest , and tfiat the mere thinning out of the growth of twenty years , besides meeting the first cost of the trees , will afford not a small percentage of additional fuel ; making a provision , moreover , for accidents and emergencies . More than once during the last winter , locomotives were stopped all night in the snow , where a couple of trees within easy reach would have promptly extricated them . We hold it to be as good policy to have provision for an emergency of this kind , as to establish a special railway telegraph , the expense of which is far greater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Returning from this digression about railways , we have next to observe that trees perform their chief economical service by preventing too rapid evaporation . It is a common error , that the sun 's rays are the first source of evaporation ; and many persons ignorantly imagine that , because a locality // is sunny , it is sure to be dry . Now the wind has vastly more to do with drying and evaporation than the sun , as might be shown by an endless variety of facts and illustrations . In the formation of ice on ponds , for instance , as we learn from unquestionable authority , on a windy night , however cold , nothing is actually gained , since the ice wastes by evaporation from the surface as fast as it forms beneath . Every housewife knows that wet linen dries more rapidly when flying in the cold wind , than when hanging quietly in the warm sun . The driving blast which accompanies those sudden showers that vex and drench travellers in mountain regions , brings an almost instant remedy when the shower has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited quantity of moisture , and is speedily saturated . But air in motion is never satisfied , and is constantly abstracting moisture from the soil . It is not the character of the soil , but the constant and unobstructed motion of the air , which reduces open land to barrenness . Almost anywhere on the desert between Cairo and Gaza , the sterile waste might be turned to greenness simply by being enclosed . It is not wholly true that the palm-trees are in the oases , simply because the springs of water are there . The springs are there because the palm-trees are there beside them . Cut away the palm-trees , and the springs will soon become dry . It is matter of surprise to every one who journeys in Syria or Greece , that the sacred and classic streams should be of such mean dimensions , that Kishon , " that ancient river , " should be crossed at a leap , and Ilyssus be spanned by a yardstick . The cause is explained when one considers the hills of these lands , how void they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kidron be dry , when the groves have disappeared from the high places of Benjamin ? Abana and Pharphar still keep their bounteous flow , for there are forests to stay and hold the snows of Hermon and Libanus ; but Cephissus is a brook , since the heights of Phyle are naked . These ancientlands have lost their streams , because they have lost their groves and gardens . And the like cause will everywhere produce the like effect . In an open country , the absolute quantity of water which the rivers discharge is not only less than in a wooded country , but the // flow is incomparably more irregular and unequal . This week the stream may be a foaming torrent , forbidding all passage ; next week it will be only a sluggish pool , which scarcely wets your horse 's fetlocks . Since our Western lands have been cleared , the alternations in the " stage " of water in the rivers have been much more marked and violent . The fact has been vexatiously brought home to our practical men by the constant hinderance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , half a century ago , were valuable and steady , have now become nearly worthless . The dam which was conveniently put up to saw an adjoining forest into profitable plank , now that its excellent work is done , will drive the saw in the summer no longer . The good riparian mill-owners of one of the ponds in the vicinity of Boston remarked with amazement , some ten years ago , that the supply of water seemed to be failing them , and that the feeding stream had utterly dried up , - a thing never known by the oldest inhabitant . Within a few years the stream has regained its volume , and now flows full , even in the heats of summer . The secret of these changes was , that the water first disappeared on account of the cutting away of the forests about its source , a few miles distant , and returned when the young wood had grown there . Not a few of our larger factories have been compelled to introduce steam-power to supply a deficiency in the volume of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the word " inexhaustible " can now hardly be used of any waterprivilege in New England . We do not believe , though some high authorities maintain this view , that the cutting away of forests diminishes the quantity of rain or snow , but we only contend that it deprives the moisture of its beneficent effect upon the earth , by causing it to be too rapidly abstracted , and producing the pernicious alternations of freshet and drought , which are as fatal to the health of the soil as to the health of the men who oxvn the soil . The last sentence suggests to us a subject of great importance , which we shall not pretend to discuss , but only to open , namely , the sanitary influence of trees and forests . There is a prevalent notion , that too many trees around a house make // it unhealthy , that pestilence lurks where the forest is densest , and that it is hazardous to dwell in the neighborhood of a swamp . Facts , however , do not justify this prejudice . Medical statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . The wood-choppers of Maine are far more free from disease than the farmers of Illinois , and scarcely know , in all their exposure , what it is to be cramped by rheumatism or parched by fever . Dismal Swamp is as healthy as Sullivan 's Island , and the malaria which hangs along all the Southern seaboard finds no place in that dreadful thicket . Pestilence does not choose those sections of country or those quarters of cities which are greenest , but those which are most bare and open . Dampness is not the source of malaria , but decomposition caused by too rapid drying , whether of vegetable matter or of animal infusoria . Ditches and stagnant pools are , to be sure , not very desirable purifiers of the surrounding air , and generate more serious plagues than their legions of frogs . But a ditch which alternates from wet to dry , or a pool that is weekly emptied and replenished , as wind and shower follow each other , gives forth a much more deadly poison than any ground which is steadily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poison hangs and lingers , and gives itself to load the breeze to-morrow . In woods , on the contrary , while the decomposition of vegetable and animal matter goes on far more slowly , the poison which is evolved is taken up by the trees themselves , to which it is food and nourishment . Mr. Timothy Flint , in his account of the Mississippi Val-* icy , mentions the fact , that the wood-cutters on the banks of the streams where the trees had been cut away were constantly attacked by malarious fevers , while such diseases among workmen in the forest were comparatively rare , although the ground on which they worked was quite as moist . Every tree which they left to decay on the ground helped to create the poison , while every tree left standing helped to absorb it . Many cases might be cited where the cutting down of woods has had a most unfavorable effect upon the health of the surrounding region . The Roman Campagna is only a celebrated instance of what is a very common experi // ence . Every schoolboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of carL on , and supplying its defect and waste of oxygen ; though this teaching is usually coupled with the cautious proviso , that plants absorb oxygen by night and are therefore unhealthy companions of the chamber . But we have tested it abundantly in travelling , that , when one is properly protected from mosquitos , the night air is most pleasant in the immediate vicinity of woods , more easy to breathe and more softly soporific than even the salt atmosphere of the famed watering-places . A night 's sleep is quite as refreshing in the inn at Keswick as in the inn at Brighton , in a North Conway cottage as in a Newport hotel . There are several reasons why forests affect favorably the health of a locality or neighborhood . Two of these we have already mentioned , that they check the formation of poisonous miasma , and that they absorb it when it is formed , and so prevent its pernicious influence . But their effect upon climate is even more noticeable and unquestionable . They equalize the heat of the atmosphere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter years to be the bane of New England . There can be little doubt that the cutting away of such large tracts of forest in Canada and Maine has had a great share in causing the intense cold of our recent winters , if not in increasing the number of burning days in summer , and that the rapid changes which transpose at the caprice of the winds the place of the months and seasons are due largely to this cause . In a warm day , certainly , one feels the heat more in the woods than on the open prairie , when the wind is blowing . But a thermometer will give a lower temperature in the former than in the latter position . A fair way to test the difference is to sit for a while in a boat upon a pond surrounded by woods , and then to go into the woods . The sensation will instantly be one of refreshing coolness . In winter , on the contrary , the thermometer shows a much higher temperature in the woods than in the open field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is greater . Teamsters know this , and even on a still day in January feel a relief from the cold , the moment they reach the protecting woods . 17* // We are not able to give the results of any large observation of the comparative temperature in wooded and in open countries . Unfortunately , the foresters omit to provide themselves with the means of measnring heat , and are content with the sensation of comfort and the satisfaction of profit . Experiments enough have been made on a small scale to prove that , if the mean temperature is about the same in cleared land as in forest , the extremes in the latter are much less severe and the variations much less rapid . That the wood of living trees gives off heat directly in winter there can be no doubt , and there can be as little doubt that the atmospheric heat in summer is taken up by branches and foliage . Of course the influence of trees in deflecting and softening the rays of the sun has much to do with this equalizing process ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods should be more comfortable than the open field , is one which needs not be weakened by any refinements of science . Shade is a hygienic agent not less genuine than light ; and Nature approves that song of the comforts of behemoth , " chief of the ways of God , who lieth under the shady trees , in the covert of the reed , " as heartily as she sympathizes with the desperate prayer of Ajax . The effect of forests in establishing an electrical equilibrium , and in conducting the electric fluid or force , has also a bearing upon their sanitary value . Many persons object to the neighborhood of a grove , for fear of the lightning , and tall trees , when a charged cloud envelops them in its blackness , are terrible to those who else would love them . Yet we maintam that there is more real security in a house provided with a surrounding of these natural conductors , than in the best fitting of any patent metallic points . A grove of trees does on a grand scale what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However this may be , the electric condition of the atmosphere is more healthy , when there are these efficient means of adjusting it ; there is a freer play of the lungs , an easier movement in the limbs , and the air is less oppressive on a sultry day . These general views , however , will not apply to all kinds and varieties of trees . There are special influences which // modify the general verdict of salubrity . Some kinds of trees are certainly as pernicious in their exhalations as others in their substance and qualities . One may be poisoned by odors as surely as by touch and taste . Even the most delicious perfumes become nauseous and sickening when they overload the air , and the ammonia of the shambles is more tolerable often than the aroma of an orange-grove . After riding for an hour through the gardens around Damascus , and breathing that hyper-intoxicating compound of all that is delicious in the scent of leaf and blossom , it is an unspeakable relief to snuff in the bazaars of the city the fragrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persian " tumbac . " South American travellers tell of trees whose breath upon the air is deadly after nightfall , and a notion of this sort has banished from some of our city streets a tree which a few years ago was a favorite . The Indian superstition of a tree possessed by the Devil has its illustration in the antipathy of almost every community to some noxious plant or flower . The exhalations of trees are , however , much oftener salutary than noxious . There is real refreshment in the scent of the pine ; its rich resinous flavor gives to the lungs a stimulus as real as Dr. Hunter 's medicated vapors . What there is in the sunflower to purify the air , we believe that science has not yet explained . Yet this curious vhim of the negroes in the South concerning it is not to be treated with disdain . The ornament of the slave 's cabin door is his guardian of health , his good genius to forbid pestilence . An experiment recently tried by Lieutenant Maury seems to confirm this notion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very subject to fever and ague . Last year Lieutenant Maury planted a bed of sunflowers forty-five feet broad , at a distance of two hundred yards from the buildings ; and the result was , that , though in the neighborhood the fever was unusually prevalent , no one in the Observatory was attacked by it , - an exemption which had not been recorded before since the Observatory was built . Tllhis experiment does not , indeed , conclusively prove that the sunflower has an especial virtue . Perhaps any other plant of as rapid growth and a vegetation as luxuriant would have done the same good work // in devouring the malarious poisons given forth by the drying of the soil . Yet we may be sure , when the experiment is known , that the sunflower will be restored to favor , and through its prophylactic virtues perhaps regain its fame as the queen of the garden . We have not space to discuss the agency of trees in sweetening and purifying the springs of water which run where their roots penetrate . The miracle of Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course which will restore , not merely the flow to wells which have become dry , but the sweetness to wells which have become hard and brackish . A city supplied with trees and parks , however flat and low its site , will not need expensive aqueducts to furnish it with water . It will be a long time before level Savannah will find it necessary to copy the water-works of Boston , - that town of twice triple hills . We have more faith in the sanative effects of Nature 's decoctions beneath the surface , than in those healing beverages which rende : the name of " tea " so indefinite . Good water into which the virtue of plants hath passed is a more sovereign remedy for an inward bruise than any weak dilution of leaves and powders . We pass abruptly from this engaging topic , to say a few words about birds in connection with trees . Where the forests are , there will the birds be found , certainly in this land . Insects everywhere abound , and no desert is so waste and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But birds congregate where they find shelter , food , and an appropriate home . When " the fig-tree putteth forth her green figs , and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell , " then " the time of the singing of birds is come . " We need not insist upon the essential service which small birds render in destroying insects , and so in saving vegetation , or upon their agency in directly enriching the soil . All the harm that they may do in depredations upon fruit is more than balanced by their music and by the animation which they impart to scenery . He is a public benefactor who can entice birds to the habitations of man ; and it is good taste , if not good economy , that will plant fruit-trees for this purpose . Let the cherries go , if we can have the songs , and be rid of bugs into the bargain . // The actual damage which insects do to our orchards and grain-fields , even where birds are incessantly devouring them , is very considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow . What it would be without this mitigation , no reckoning can tell . As the shoal which comes back where a single herring has spawned , so is the devouring host of worms which a single winged moth will leave as its progeny . The birds which devour the worms are by no means so useful , as Dr. Piper shows , as those which devour insects on the wing . And it is therefore no objection to swallows that they daintily prefer butterflies to caterpillars , and are more given to the noble chase of a flying prey than to the wearisome delving of slow clodhoppers . We do not urge the practical con consideration of easy and handy shooting , which led once a lazy sporting friend of ours to choose the neighborhood of a wood for his summer residence , so that he might , like a Pacha of the Lebanon , fire from his chamber window without removing his pipe or doffing his slippers , - since we hold this whole passion for small-bird shooting in utter abomination , as the basest form which sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must minister , it is needful to provide for them shelter and a home , - a place to hide and a place to build . Farmers and lovers alike must have their forest aviary , to exterminate borers or to indite sonnets of harmonious numbers , to rid the air of its plague of flies or to pen the sweet invocation , Come , all ye feathery people of mid air Beneath the chamber where my lady lies , And , in yonr several mosies , whisper love ! " A question of much interest , which we trust Dr. Piper will treat fully in some of his future numbers , is of the fitness of mingling fruit and forest trees . There are horticulturists who hold that the close-communion doctrine is the only one to be applied to orchards ; that elms must be kept separate from plums as much as sinners from saints , and that an oak among apple-trees is as much an intruder as the serpent in Paradise . We are inclined to a different view , believing that the shade which large forest-trees give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to the healthy growth // of the fruit-bearing kinds . Some of the finest peach-trees we have ever known were nurtured beneath the shadow of a tall sycamore ; and in walking along the edge of woods , we have often stopped to admire the sturdy limbs and luscious crop of some ancient apple-tree . Grapes ripen readily in the thick shade . On the continent of Europe it is quite common to find the orchards belted with rows of forest-trees , set there to break the force of the winds . And it may be safely predicted , that he who has his orchard protected by this means will gather a third more fruit than he who leaves the slender trees exposed . At present , in most of our orchards , the crop consists very largely of windfalls , which become food for swine , but not for men . It may answer for one who can afford it to use his peaches for the creation of pork , but that luxurious diet will prove in the end , we think , rather expensive . Connected with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties of trees in forest planting . That picturesque effect is gained by this method there can be no doubt , as any one may see on the grounds of Mr. Tudor at Nahant . The more shades and shapes and contrasts it shows , the greater is the charm of a park , as well as of a garden . The inferior species of tree are dignified when set in the society of the monarchs of the grove , and draw honor from their privilege . The larch and the birch command more deference as courtiers of the majestic pine , than in any equal democracy of their own kind , however populous . The most ungainly trunk will have beauty in the forest , and he who will renew credit to those stunted cedars , which recall only by utter contrast the precious growth of ancient Lebanon , has but to plant them under the broad-leaved sycamore , or by the side of the symmetrical chestnut . Whether economy is well served by this mingling of many varieties , we are not so ready to say . Nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests have some prevailing species , which gives them their character . Oaks among the pines seem as alien as Greeks among the Jews , and a silver-leaved aspen , slcnder and tremulous , among the lithe and sinewy ash-trees , reminds us of a pale missionary preaching with fear and to // a tribe of dusky Indians . The prevalent idea of planters is , we imagine , that the most profitable forests are homogeneous ; that the growth is more rapid , and the influence upon the soil more wholesome . The French government , which has done more than any other in the culture of forests , rather favors this theory , and encourages the separation of kinds , where large returns are expected . In the Department of Landes it has chiefly replanted pines ; on the slopes of the Pyrenees the box is the favorite variety ; while in Brittany and Normandy the linden abounds . In Scotland the larch has been most extensively cultivated , and more than ten thousand acres with more than fourteen million of trees were planted in less than a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been copied in other parts of Europe , and one is often surprised to find in secluded places , like the region of the Tegernsee in Southern Bavaria , beautiful artificial forests of larches . In Greece , the prepossession seems to have been for plane-trees , and on the hills of Laconia a recent traveller , lvii . About , has remarked the wanton and wasteful destruction of these noble monuments of the Turkish dominion . The best method of planting , transplanting , pruning , thinning , and felling trees , is a subject which warns us back by its extent , and by the confusion of opinions which surrounds its discussion . We see no occasion to change the opinion expressed twenty-five years ago in this Review , that in most , if not in all cases , it is better to raise trees from the seed , - elm-trees and ash-trees no less than oak and hickory . We renew the protest , too , against the Procrustean truncation of saplings , which , to make the labor of removal a little easier , decorates for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We would repeal , also , that tradition of arboricultural common law , which enjoins an annual use of the knife , - so much wood to be exscinded every year , so many feet of trunk to be gained ; and particularly do we object to that " law of selection , " which destroys the vigor of the forest in decimating it . It is as bad for a forest to lose its great trees as for a nation to lose its great men , - the small trees and the small men alike assume meaner habits when they strive for the vacant places which the great have left . // For the successful culture of young trees , the first and almost the only necessity is that they be protected from the winds . The character of the soil is of less importance . The wind distorts and destroys them . They need most in the beginning that protection which they afterward effectually give . A close fence for a few years will secure the most tender fruit-trees on the very edge of an ocean cliff . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the roots be kept loose and porous , XThich a surface-covering of stones best accomplishes . Nine tenths of the trees which die after their transplanting , die because these essentials are neglected , not for any fault in the trees or in the soil . We should remark upon this point more at length , were we not advised that it will form a prominent topic in some future number of Dr. Piper 's work . All the topics which have been touched in this article will doubtless be fully discussed in the progress of the work we have noticed , and any novel opinions will be vouched for by abundant facts . One great fact is patent , and should of itself be enough to arouse the concern of all who are anxious about the future , that trees in this section of the country are disappearing far more rapidly than they are growing . The present annual demand for locomotive fuel alone in the United States is one hundred thousand acres , allowing ( which is a large allowance ) fifty cords to the acre ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one among many items . Along the line of our older railways there are scarcely any woods remaining . If the rate of disappearance goes on for the next half-century as it has for the last , the child is now living who will see the soil of New England everywhere as bare as the soil of Attica , and its noble rivers shrunken in summer , like Acheloiis and Cephissus , to shallow brooks . It is fashionable in many quarters to treat alarms of this kind as fantastic , and our tourists come back from a journey to Mount Katahdin or the Saguenay with the comforting conviction , that there is wood enough left in these Northern regions to supply the wants of America for a thousand years . We would rather trust to facts and figures than to these hopeful impressions . Cassandra here is a better guide than those who prophesy smooth things . The // increasing price of fuel is a premonition which we shall do well to heed . The probability of any important decrease in the consumption of wood no man can foresee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less wood will be used for railway purposes , and iron may to some extent be substituted for wood in the construction of ships and houses . But on this we can not build any calculation . The safer and more rational course is to meet the danger by the direct means of forest-planting . If half the money that is annually wasted in foolish speculations , or lost in the fluctuations of commerce , were turned to this work of renewing our forests , all the loss would be met by an equal gain . The pleadings of alarmists may seem extravagant , but in the end , we are confident , it will be proved that they were not too earnest or too early .
