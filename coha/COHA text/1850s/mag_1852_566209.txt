txt ART . VIII. - PROF . PARK 'S MEMOIR OF HOPKINS . The Works of SAMUEL IIOPKIN5 , D. D. , first Pastor of the church in Great Barrington , Mass. , afterwards Pastor of the First Congregational Church in Newport , R. I. , with a Memoir of his life and character . In three volumes . Boston : Doctrinal Tract and Book Society , 1852 . THE getting up of this edition of the works of Samuel Hopkins is highly creditable to the " Doctrinal Tract and Book Society , " and to its Secretary , Rev. Sewall Harding , the editor . We hope the success of this adventure may be such as to encourage and strengthen the Society for other similar undertakings . The memoir is by Prof. Park , of Andover , and is all that would be expected from the well known character of the author and his relations to the New England theology . It gathers up from every quarter all the facts relating to the personal history * It is certain that a similar name , " the Old Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Anglo-Saxon Nicor. in German Nix , was a water demon , or spirit monster of the waters . In the Netherlands Nikker is used in the sense of bad spirit , devil . See Grimm 's Deutsch . MythoL p. *75. // of the renowned father of Hopkinsianism , and combines them with admirable effect . And what increases the interest of the biography is , that the author appears to work not as an impartial historical critic , but rather as a disciple and admirer . An unaffected reverent kindness toward the subject pervades the composition , and gives a charm to every page . We thought we knew old Samuel Hopkins about as well as the readers of English literature know old Samuel Johnson . His autobiograply , edited by West , of Stock bridge , the " Reminiscences , " by the late Dr. Patten , of Newport , and the Memoir by Mr. Ferguson , of Attleborough , had done much towards making his personal history and character familiarly and extensively known ; and the tribute incidentally paid to his memory by the late Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be commended to the admiration even of those who have no sympathy with that theological system of which he was so eminent a champion . Prof. Park digests and incorporates into his work all these various materials . The result is , that the character of the stern old theologian stands out before the reader , wonderfully distinct and life-like . It is not merely as when an old portrait , smoky and faded , has been cleansed , retouched , varnished , and set in a new and appropriate fran ) e ; it is rather as when some gifted artist , after the careful study of several authentic like . nesses of some historic personage , from various painters , makes a new picture , alive with the expression of character , and impressive with the dignity and the gi  --  a ceful touches with which genius adorns the historic canvas . Without following closely Prof. Park 's arrangement and method in the use of his materials , we will attempt little more than to give our readers , in our own style , a rude etching from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  these were the founders , not of a sect or a heresy , but of a school in theology . Though the two younger sustained to the elder in some sort the relation of pupils , they were all born in the interval between 1703 and 1721 . They were all born in the then loyal , though uncorruptedly Puritan colony of Connecticut ,  --  Edwards at East Windsor , Bellamy at Cheshire , Hopkins at Waterbury . They were all educated at Yale College ; Edwards a graduate of 172* , Bellamy of 1735 , Hopkins of 1741 . They were all nurtured under the sternest influences of Puritan morality and religiGn ; : and they all felt , both in their religious experience and in the moulding of their theological propositions and reasonings , the influences of " the Great Awakening . " Of these three , Edwards , with the humility that marks the highest style of greatness , with his childlike simplicity and transparency of character , and with // that deep poetic vein of religious sensibility , which , had his logical tendency been less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master mind , without whose original and quickening force the New England theology , as distinguishable from the Scotch or the Dutch , might never have existed . Bellamy , with his commanding , popular eloquence , his lordly temper , and his inborn faculty of influence and authority , was the party chief and champion . Hopkins , with no gifts of oratory , with no capacity of leadership . or of any sort of worldly wisdom , with an intensely logical genius , quite incapable of any imaginative flights , and with a plodding and indefatigable industry , was the system builder ; and thus it has happened that the New England modification of Calvinism has been called by his name . it was in a quiet Puritan town , now grown almost into a crowded city , that Samuel Hopkins was born , on a Lord 's day , the 17th of September , 1721 . He was of a highly respectable family , and of the uncorrupted New England stock , his father , Timothy , being the great-grandson of John Hopkins , one of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Bay " to Connecticut river , in 1636 . An uncle of his , from whom his name ( Samuel ) seems to hav'e been derived , was minister of West Springfield , and was the father of another Samuel Hopkins , D. D. , of Hadley , five of whose daughters-nieces of Jonathan Edwards-were wives of as many eminent Hopkinsian divines . Another uncle of the father of Hopkinsianism , was the ancestor of Dr. Lemuel Hopkins of Hartford , physician , wit , and poet , and of the late Hon. Samuel Miles Hopkins of Albany . Few families in New England have been more definitely marked by a hereditary intellectual superiority , than that which traces its descent from John Hopkins , one of the founders of Hartford . The testimony which the subject of this notice gives in his autobiography , concerning the influences under which his childhood was nurtured , is worth remembering . " I have considered it as a great favor of God , that I was born and educated in a religious fan and among a people in a country town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prevalent , and the education of children and youth was generally practiced in such a degree that young people were generally orderly in their behavior , and abstained from those open vices which were then too common in seaport and populous places . I do not recollect that I ever heard a profane word from the children and youth with whom I was conversant , while I lived with ray parents , which was till I was in my fifteenth year . " It was thus , in the bosom of a strictly religious family , in a most retired , // rural New England parish , which had never yet been invaded by any corrupting influence from abroad , and where the traditions of Puritanism had never been modified-that the character of the man began to be formed . From the hour of ' his birth , he had been devoted by his father to the ministry of the Gospel , and it was intended that he should be educated at college for that service . But he , on his part , had no ambitious aspirings . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indications of talent , he spent his childhood on his father 's farm ; and in the prospect of being " brought up to college , " as the phrase was , he saw nothing to kindle his hopes or to waken his ambition . On the contrary , such was the contented simplicity and affectionateness of his nature , that the thought of those years of absence from his parents which his education at college would imply , was , as he says , " intolerable to his childish mind . " But in the winter of his fifteenth year , he began to love retirement ; he " spent considerable time in reading , especially reading the Bible ; and began to feel more inclination to learning and less to working on a farm . " His father , observing the new development of character , placed him under the tuition of a neighboring pastor ; for such was in those days the ordinary mode of putting young men through the preparatory studies of a liberal education . After somewhat less than two years of study , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Southbury , a man of some distinction in his day , he became a college freshman at New Haven . Such was the early training of our theologian-strictly , almost exclusively religious . Almost from his infancy the attempt to learn and remember the doctrines of theology , in the Calvinistic type , was the chief exercise of his mind in the way of learning . The Westminster Catechism had already superseded all similar formularies in New England ; and it was doubtless from the New England Primer , ( which was then , as the name imports , " the child 's first book , " ) that he took his first lessons in the science of theology . At college , in those primitive days , a little more than a hundred years ago , pupils and teachers had little to do with the studies which are now the staple of a liberal education . Four days in every week , the freshmen were exclusively employed on Latin , Greek , and Hebrew ; those languages being studied not as Latin and Greek are now studied , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for the sake of becoming acquainted with the languages themselves and getting access to the treasures of knowledge embalmed in them . The study of Hebrew , however , must have been very limited . Proficiency // in Greek hardly extended beyond the New Testament . The use of Latin was carried to an extent of which the little now spoken at commencements and on some like occasions of aca* demic pomp , is only a forgotten landmark . Latin was regarded as the true vernacular of colleges ; it was therefore the language of the recitation room and of formal communication between the teachers and their pupils ; and it was even enjoined on the students , by law , as the language of their intercourse with each other in their rooms . The sturdy Protestantism of New England forbade the use of the Pope 's language in the chapel ; otherwise Latin would have been heard in morning and evening worship , for the suggestion that Latin was an " unknown tongue " could not be entertained within the academic walls . The result of all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the entire college course , was somewhat less than is now required for admission to the Freshmen class , a great deal of barbarous Latin that might have frightened the ghost not of Cicero only , but of Priscian , was glibly spoken ; and a good scholar , after his graduation , might perhaps have been able to maintain a few minutes ' conversation with a learned foreigner in that learned tongue . Through the second year , the first four days of every week were in like manner devoted to logic . " Burgersdicius , Ramus , Crackenthorp , and Keckerman " - names redolent of learning , but now gone into oblivion- " were the great lights , " and under their illumination the students were trained by the tutors into familiarity with the complicated arts and puzzling mysteries of syllogistic disputation . The third year was occupied to the same extent with physics-not physical science , as we of this nineteenth century understand the name , but the physical science which the schoolmen got out of Aristotle , and which scorned the induction of facts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth year , being in their turn the subject of study and recitation for the first four days of every week . Five times a week , each undergraduate , after his introduction to logical studies , was required to bear a part in a syllogistic dispute . At the beginning of every recitation through the whole course , a portion of the Hebrew Scriptures was read by the class into Greek , and a portion of the New Testament from Latin into Greek , except in the Freshmen class , where the New Testament was read into the Greek from the English . In all the classes , Friday of every week was devoted to ethics , rhetoric , and the Compend of theology by Wollebius , of which a copy may now be found here and there in some ancient library . Saturday morning , Ames ' " Marrow of Theology , " in // Latin , was recited ; and Saturday evening , the Westminster catechism , also in Latin . Every Lord 's day morning , Ames ' Cases of Conscience was the text-book of an exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergraduate had his monthly declamation to perform ; every one took his turn at repeating sermons in the hall or chapel ; and all were " constantly examined " - on the sermons of the day , as we supposeat sabbath evening prayer . Such was the course of study through which Hopkins was conducted in the four years of his college life . It is easy to see that with much of that sort of discipline which tends to the development of intellectual strength and acuteness , there was in it very little of truly liberal culture , very little to waken and refine the sense of beauty , very little to bring the student into intercourse with nature or to train him into habits of observation , and very little to give him breadth of views or to waken within him generous sympathies . Yet , on the other hand , for all but those of stubbornly profane and irreligious temper , there must needs be in such a course of study , with its ethics , its Wollebius , its Amesius , its " What is the chief end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so often been answered at home in English , its Sunday-morning drill in cases of conscience , its Sunday-evening examinations and repetitions of sermons , and its daily use of the sacred Scripture as a textbook-much to direct the mind 's habitual attention toward the grandeur of duty and the reality of things unseen . To a serious and ingenuous youth , whose domestic affections and sympathies , as well as his conscience , were wholly on the right side , how much must there have been in such studies and exercises , that would tend to waken more and more that consciousness to which revelation appeals , and which is given in the developed constitution of the soul as the basis of religious sensibility and experience . But something very different from all academic discipline , was necessary to prepare the future theologian for the work to which he was destined-something that should move his calm and somewhat sluggish nature to its lowest depths . When he had been about two years in college , he made a profession of religion at home , and connected himself with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was thus in a fair way to pass through life , a self-satisfied and rigid formalist ; for the New England religion of that day , with all its nakedness in respect to liturgical show , with all its simplicity of ecclesiastical structure , and with all its high-toned Calvinistic doctrine , had its formalism , as cold and stony as that of Oxford , von . x. 58 // Aug . Prof. Park 's Memoir of Hopkins . and far more meager . But just then was the epoch of a wide religious movement , the results of which are still in progress . The " Great Awakening " in New England takes its date from 1735 , when the preaching of Edwards , at Northampton , began to be attended with extraordinary effects which attracted attention and excited a glow of Christian sympathy on both sides the Atlantic . In October , 1740 , Whitefield , then performing his first circuit in the northern colonies , came to New Haven . Great multitudes from town and country flocked to hear himsome from a distance of twenty miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , and the orator with the unrivaled power and pathos of his utterance , but the doctrines which he announced and the views of Christian duty and experience which he exhibited , became the subject of general conversation and discussion . Hopkins heard him in public and in private , " highly approved of him , " " was so me*vhat impressed by what he said , " and " justified him " against the censures of those who were disposed to condemn him . The new attention to religion in New Haven and elsewhere , outlasted the visit of the transient evangelist . Through the autumn and winter , the indications of increased interest in questions of religious faith and duty were multiplied . Early in the spring of 1741 , Gilbert Tennent , having spent the winter in the eastern l ) art of New England , came to New Haven on his way to New Jersey . A great excitement attended his preaching . In a week of labor at New Haven , he preached seventeen sermons , two or three of which were in the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months religious inquiries and convictions had been working in the minds of thousands who had listened to the graceful and *vinning oratory of the impassioned Englishman ; and now the ruder Irish eloquence of the " plain and rousing preacher " from ' New Jersey , produced effects which the conservative orthodoxy of our day , if they should reappear under the sermons of some modern itinerant , would hardly hesitate to denounce as scandalous . Hopkins says , " thousands , 1 believe , were awakened , and many cried out with distress and horror of mind . " Many who had maintained a reputable Christian profession , became convinced that they had never known anything of the power of religion . Among these was Hopkins , who had been carried along in the general movement to this point , without mistrusting seriously the soundness of his own religious experience . But David Brainerd , who was then a sophomore , came one day into his room and found him alone . Hopkins suspected that Brainerd , who had distinguished himself by his zeal , had come to search him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been of the right sort ; and he " resolved to keep him in the dark , and , if possible , prevent his getting any knowledge " on that point . In the progress of the conversation , Brainerd said , " that he believed it impossible fora person to be converted , and to be a real Chi'istian , without feeling his heart , at sometimes at least , sensibly and greatly affected with the character of Christ and strongly going out after him . " Such a statement , in such terms , from one presumed to know all about the matter , might have thrown a truly penitent and believing child of God into inextricable perplexity ; for surely , if we read the Bible aright , and if we understand aright the philosophy of human emotions , it is possible for one who has learned to say in lowliness and self-renunciation , " God be merciful to me a sinner , " and who really trusts insChrist for pardon and redemption-we say it is possible for such an one not to know that at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the character of Christ or strongly going out after him . " Wisely enough , the preacher may sometimes endeavor to excite not only affection toward the Redeemer , but a vivid consciousness of that affection ; wisely enough the language of devotion may sometimes be the iml ) assioned expression of kindling sensibility ; but it is neither scriptural nor wise to teach that such a consciousness is in any way a test of Christian character . The test of discipleship or of conversion , in the New Testament , is of another sort : - " If any man have not the spirit of Christ , he is none of his . " " He that hath my commandments and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me . " In this instance , however , there was no harm done . Hopkins says respecting the statement which Brainerd had made to him , " I verily believed it to be true , and at the same time was conscious that I had never experienced anything of this kind , and that I was a stranger to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never known at all the power of religion , became in his mind , from that time , a fixed and painful con viction . He had now come to a new stage in the formation of his character . Compelled to renounce the hopes which he had cherished in his formalism , he began to feel something of " the powers of the world to come . " T here was a lesson for him to learn , in order to his being fitted for his destined work , but which he could not learn otherwise than by sounding his " dim and perilous way " among the paradoxes of evangelical truth translated into evangelical experience . He says , KI felt myself a guilty , justly condemned creature , and my hope of relief by obtaining conversion failed more and more , and my condition // appeared darker from day to day , and all help failed , and I felt myself to be nothing but ignorance , guilt , and stupidity . I now lost all desire to conceal my case from those whom I considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . " This depressed and darkened state of mind continued for weeks , and even for many months . He steadfastly excluded hope from his mind . He had gathered from the enthusiasm of the time a confused and exaggerated notion of what Christian experience must be ; and till he could realize that notion , he could not but regard himself as an unconverted and unforgiven sinner . And yet there were experiences of his in that period of depression , which , had he not been so misguided by his preconceived notions of the nature of conversion , might have been evidence to him , as the natural exhibition of his religious character was evidence to others , that the Spirit of grace was working effectually within him . In one particular instance , though he took little notice of it at the time , and indeed had quite forgotten it , not recognizing the grace of God in it , till similar experiences at a later period had recalled it to his memory-his views and feelings were so distinct that he has put them upon record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I was in my closet one evening , while I was meditating and in my devotions , a new and wonderful scene opened to my view . I had a sense of the being and presence of God as I never had before ; it being more of a reality , and more affecting and glorious than I had ever before perceived . And the character of Jesus Christ , the Mediator , came into view , and appeared such a reality , and so glorious , and the way of salvation by him so wise , important , and desirable , that I was astonished at myself that I had never seen these things before , which were so plain , pleasing , and wonderful . I longed to have all see and know these things as they now appeared to me . I was greatly affected in view of my own depravity , the sinfulness , guilt , and odiousness of my character ; and tears flowed in great plenty . After some time I left my closet , and went into the adjoining room , no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all intent on these subjects , and took up Watts 's version of the Psalms , and opened it at the fifty-first Psalm , and read the first , second , and third parts in long metre , with strong affections , and made it all my own language , and thought it was the language of my heart to God I dwelt upon it with pleasure , and wept much . And when I had laid the book aside , my mind continued fixed on the subject , and in the exercise of devotion , confession , adoration , and petition , in which I seemed to pour out my heart to God with great freedom . " p. 17 . The question whether the psychological phenomena above described , were , as the author supposed them to be , the exercises of his conversion-in other words , whether , up to that moment , he had been , as he then and long afterwards supposed himself to be , in an absolutely Christless state , as much without faith and without God as he was without hope-is a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Waving that question , there is no reason to doubt that , in the mental phenomena // above described , we see , as clearly marked as the nature of human language will admit , the development of an elevated Christian consciousness  --  a humble and believing soul carried up by the Holy Spirit into the sphere of those intuitions and emotions which are peculiar to " the new man , " and which in one degree or another are common to all truly Christian minds . We see here an illustration of what the Scripture means when it says , that the things of the Spirit " are spiritually discerned . " And we may say that the religious experience into which that element enters , differs not in degree only , but in essence , from a religion of mere volitions , in which the will is operated upon by motives addressed to the constitutional desire of happiness . The reader who remembers Watts 's version of the fifty-first Psalm , can hardly fail to observe in those workings of religious emotion , in which the mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to God , and which found utterance in the words of that version , the distinct presence of a truly and simply evangelical element , which , long afterwards , when cast into the alembic of metaphysical analysis , and submitted to the relentless processes of speculative logic , became one of the most exaggerated and obnoxious features of his theological system . The peculiar penitential sentiment of the Psalm referred to , is common in some degree to all minds that have felt the power of the Gospel by coming to the spiritual discernment of its realities . How aptly does Watts express that sentiment in his version " Lord , should thy judgment grow severe , I am condemned , but thou art clear . Should sudden vengeance seize my breath , I must pronounce thee just in death ; And if my soul were sent to hell , Thy righteous law approves it welL " * * * * " My soul lies humbled in the dust , And owns thy dreadful sentence just . " Out of the glow of devout emotion with which the youth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , repeated to himself those lines , so expressive of humiliation and contrition , came , in process of time , after much ratiocination on " God 's last end in creation , " and on " love to being in general , " the hard and repulsive dogma that a willingness to be wicked and wretched for the glory of God , is an essential element of all true religious experience . When Tennent was in New Haven , Hopkins was one of his most devoted admirers . He even formed a purpose of going // to live with him after leaving college . But just before the commencement when he was to graduate , " Mr. Edwards , of Northampton , came to New Haven and preached . " The sermon was published a few months afterwards . It is found in his collected works , ( Vol. iii , Dwight 's edition , ) and is entitled , " The distinguishing marks of a work of the Spirit of God . " Hopkins had read such of Edwards 's writings as had then been published , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing that one sermon , though he had no opportunity of a personal introduction to the preacher , he gave up his former resolution of following after fennent and determined to go to Northampton , where he might be under the influence and instruction of Edwards . We can hardly avoid asking the curious question , how far the relative positions of Princeton theology and New England divinity would have been modified , if Hopkins had gone to New Jersey , according to his original intention , instead of going to Northampton ; if he had been a " new side " Presbyterian minister , instead of being a " new light " Congregational pastor ? After taking his degree , in September , 1741 , he lived a sort of recluse life at his father 's house for three months , dejected and gloomy . He was reading , meditating , praying , fasting , habitually regarding himself as one in whom there had never been one movement of true religious affection . Yet he was not wholly inactive , but was doing good as he had opportunity , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had not yet subsided there . In December , having provided himself with a horse and other equipments for so great an undertaking , he set out for Northampton , " with a view to live with Mr. Edwards , " to whom he was entirely a stranger . There , in the bosom of that saintly household , he gradually emerged from his long-continued depression , and began to walk in the consciousness of reconciliation to God through Christ . No original description of the personal character of Edwards , of his family , and of his parochial and domestic life , can be compared , for fulness and distinctness , with the artless delineation drawn by the reverent hand of Hopkins in his Life of Edwards . and in his autobiography . It must have been chiefly by the calm and judicious advice of Edwards , as we judge , that he obtained relief from his religious discouragements . Mrs. Edwards appears to have interested herself in behalf of the diffident and depressed young man who had taken shelter under her roof , but whatever benefit he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of holiness which shone in the daily manifestations of her extraordinary charac // ter , there is little room to doubt that her religious rapturesthose ecstatic frames of devotion for which she was so famous in that day , and by which she is still remernbered-would be more likely to exaggerate than to relieve the depression of a mind like his , heavy , unimaginative , and prone to discouragement . It is suggestive to observe the prodigious contrast between the method of preparation for the ministry a hundred years ago , and that which is now deemed essential . Hopkins graduated in September , 1741 , just as he was completing his twentieth year . In December he went to Northampton to sit at the feet of Edwards . During that winter he could have had but little instruction in any department of theological study ; for his teacher , who was to him in the place of the whole staff of Professors in a theological seminary , was much of the time away from home , doing the work of an evangelist . " In the latter end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of obtaining from the associated pastors of the neighborhood the letter of approbation by which candidates for the ministry , after examination , were introduced to the churches as l ) reachers of the Gospel . On the 29th of April , 1742 , he received what he calls " a permit to go forth and preach . " His classmate , Buell , afterwards the renowned pastor of East Hampton , on Long Island , and the predecessor of Dr. Lyman Beecher at that place , " commenced a zealous preacher " six months before him , and only one month after they had commenced B. A. at college . The explanation is , that the college course of studies in those days was itself no mean preparation for the ministry . If we remember what that course of studies was , wiih the New Testament for a class-book , and its four years of daily exercises in the original laaguages of the Bible , with its Logic , and its drill in the use of the syllogism , with its " Wollebii Compendium , its " Arnesii Medulla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with its repetitions and rehearsals of sermons in the college ha II , it becomes evident that in those days , if young men began to preach earlier than they now do , they did not begin without a pretty thorough and exact preparation in the science of theology . The college was then little else than what the theological seminary now is ; and in the simplicity of that age the study of the Greek Testament , and of the doctrines and duties of the Christian religion , was deemed essential to the education of a Christian gentleman , whatever the employments and offices to which he might afterwards be called . The superiority of our modern system does not consist so much as is sometimes supposed , in the fact that the theological // 400 Prof. Park 's Memoir of Hopkins . education has been invented , and added to the liberal education by way of preparation for the ministry , but rather in the fact that the whole system of what we now call a liberal education has been invented and introduced into the colleges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor and dominion , has become exclusively a professional study , and has been compelled to build colleges of its own . The few months which a candidate for the ministry ordinarily spent in the family of a pastor , before beginning to preach , were by no means regarded as answering the purpose which is now answered by a three years ' residence in a theological seminary ; but there was , in that method of coming into contact with a pastor 's official duties and professional life , an advantage for which our present system , with all its compensations , has no substitute . After preaching a few times in his native place , and in the neighboring towns , Hopkins returned to Northampton , where he spent the ensuing summer , preaching occasionally in Edwards ' pulpit and elsewhere , and thus pursuing his studies preparatory to the sacred office . From first to last he spent a little more than eight months in the family of the Northampton pastor , with whom he then formed a lasting intimacy . In the autumn , having returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Bellamy , the young pastor there , had gone as far as Philadelphia , on one of those itinerating expeditions in which , like Pomeroy of Hebron , and Wheelock of Lebanon , he made himself celebrated . It was in such methods , by rendering aid to neighboring pastors , and by supplying now and then a vacant pulpit , that a candidate for the ministry was to be gradually introduced to the churches . We need not follow the candidate to all the places in which he found temporary employment . He was not , and he seems to have been fully aware that he was not likely to become , a popular preacher . It was to other uses that his nature was adapted ; and education had done little in this respect to counteract the bent of his nature . Devout and intelligent hearers , well versed in the theological disputes of the time , lovers alike of spiritual truth and of powerful argument in its behalf , were edified , and often delighted under his ministrations ; but it was not for him to command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waken and subdue a drowsy audience . From the beginning of his work , those who had disliked the doctrines and proceedings of the Great Awakening , seem to have had a special dislike for his preaching . When Hopkins was a young man looking for a settlement , the far West was in the county of Berkshire . Stockbridge was // an Indian missionary station , to which Edwards banished himself a few years afterwards , when dismissed from Northampton . In 1740 , what is now the beautiful town of Great Barrington was first incorporated by the General Court of Massachusetts as the " Second Parish in Sheffield , " though for a long time afterwards the place was known by its aboriginal name of Housatonick . To that place Hopkins consented to go , after deciining applications which had been made to him from other places , in respect to which he seemed to have distrusted his ability to give general and permanent satisfaction . Though there were thirty families of inhabitants , some of whom Lid lived there in the wilderness thirteen years , there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a settled minister . It would have been difficult to find in New England a less pleasant or hopeful field of labor for a minister of just those gifts and intellectual habits by which Hopkins was now unchangeably characterized . But that was the place to which his humble and selldenying spirit conducted him . He went to Housatonick in June , 1743 . In August he was seized with the fever and ague , which was then as much a matter of course in Berkshire as it is along any of oum* Western rivers now . His powerful frame was shaken day after day in the returning grasp of the disease , and from one month to another he felt , in his loneliness , away from all friends and from all intellectual and spiritual sympathy , its deeply depressing influence . On the 30th of September , he wrote in his diary , " My fits continue yet . The people here have given me a call to settle among them , and have voted to give me sixty pounds lawful money for settlement and thirty-five pounds salary the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till it arises to forty-five pounds . The Committee was with me this night , and I objected against the settlement as not enough to build a house and barn . " On the 26th of November , when he had been shaken by more than thirty-two ague fits , he gave his answer to the people , and consented to stay among them in the work of the ministry , with no Home Missionary Society to help him , and with no other means of support than the pittance they had offered him , $200 at the outset , and an annual salary of $11 ( j to be increased at the rate of $3* annually till it should reach the maximum of $150. * He must have had a low standard of con-i * We have in this place an opportunity which was not granted to the Princeton Reviewers in their protracted controversy with our author .

Prof. Park compares the settlement and salary offered to Hopkins with the salaries of other ministers in those von . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a church was gathered in Ilousatonick , consisting of five brethren beside himself , and he was ordained to the pastoral office . David Brainerd , who was then laboring among the Indians at Kaunaumeek , a place " in the woods between Stockbridge and Albany , " was present at those solemnities , as was Sergeant , the missionary at Stockbridge . Hopkins began his ministry on missionary ground , and with as truly a missionary spirit as that which glowed in the bosom of Brainerd. it is no part of our design to describe the particulars of Hopkins 's parochial ministry at Great Barrington . Yet there are certain traits and touches too characteristic of the man to be entirely omitted . We might naturally presume that a preacher of his scholastic tendencies  --  a predestined doctor in the schools of theologyplaced in the charge of a rude pioneer congregation , would err by making his sermons too elaborate ; that his speculative tastes would control the selection of his subjects , the preparation of his discourses for the pulpit ; and that his people would be fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sermon by an eminent living Professor , " not with the sincere milk of the word , but with the hard , dry , mouldy cheese of metaphysics . " But his diary gives some striking evidences that such was not the fact . From the time of his going to Housatonick , he seems to have been conscientiously determined that his people should have sermons , homilies which they could understand and feel , and not disquisitions . One of his earliest sermons there was preached times , and particularly with the settlement and salary given to his kinsman , townsman , bosom friend , and classmate , Jonathan Judd , who was ordained at Southampton the same year . Judd had for a settlement two hundred acres of land , one hundred pounds , old tenor , and one hundred and twenty-five pounds , old tenor , to be expended in work on his house , with a " salary of one hundred and thirty pounds . old tenor , for the first three years , and five pounds a year to be added till it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were added , at another meeting the pledge to give him his fuel , and an indefinite promise of " more according to our ability . " Undoubtedly Southampton was then , as it is still , if we mistake uot , much the better " living , " if we may borrow a word from the Church of England dialect . But the difference was not so great as Prof. Park supposes it to have been , when he adds that " the salary and perquisites of Mr. Judd were about four times greater than those of his cousin . " Our author overlooks the obscure but serious difference between old tenor and lawful money . In 1742 the difference between those two currencies was such in Massachusetts , as declared by a legislative act , that a given sum in the latter must be multiplied by four in order to get at its equivalent in the former . See Felt 's Massachusetts Currency , p. 113 . Hopkins 's settlement , by that rule of reduction , was equal to ? 240 , old tenor , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of ten years ? 180 . The difference between the two " livings " lay chiefly in the two hundred acres of Hampshire County land , on which the Southampton minister might support a family as well as any other farmer . // in the hearing of ' the excellent John Sergeant , of Stockbridge ; and he says , " I perceive that Mr. Sergeant was not well pleased with it . . . he evidently disliked my preaching without notes . It may be that I am in the wrong in thus doing , but 1 do not see it yet . 0 that God would lead me . " Five days afterwards , he says , " I have now preached five Sabbaths altogether without notes , and believe it is the best way for me . " In Oct. 1744 , he says of his preaching , on a week-day occasion , " Had no free. * dom at all . Used my notes pretty much . I something suspect I had better fling them quite by . " Sunday , June 16 , 17457 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearers . " Preached to-day . Wrote almost all that I preached , and read all that I wrote . I propose to preach a system or body of div*nztg ; to lay open and explain the fundamental doctrines of the Gospel in their order , and have begun to-day . " In his autobiography , he says , " I have not been confined to my notes in preaching , except for a short time , when I first began , and h*ive not generally written my sermons in full length ,  --  but only the heads of them , and some short hints to suggest ideas which were to be mentioned under the general heads . " There can be no reason to doubt that he was right in those conscientious endeavors-forcing himself to speak to his people instead of permitting himself to read from a manuscript . The difficulty in his case was , that the native bent of his mind , not having been modified by early education , was too strong to be overcome . He must needs " preach a system or body of divinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took his pen in hand for such a purpose as that of making the outlines and digesting the details of a system or body of divinity , he must needs consult the universal fitness of things , the symmetry of the science , the difficulties and needs of speculative minds , rather than the intellectual habits and the spiritual condition of the few families , some English and some Dutch , scattered along the base of Monument Mountain , who were maintaining their post on the frontier of civilization , subduing the stubborn soil , hunting the wild beasts of ' the mountain , and keeping guard against their savage neighbors . It was to be feared that such hearers as Joachim Van Yalkenburgh and his vrow , if he had one , would not be much instructed or awakened by a discourse which had been framed and digested with reference to its place in a scientific system of divinity . Nor was it strange , all things considered , that their d3minie when he began to preach such discourses , " wrote almost all that he preached , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimen of what Hopkins could do in the way of // adapting himself to the special character of a congregation , Prof. Park has copied a sermon preached to the Stockbridge Indians through an interpreter , on " the next Sabbath after Mr. Edwards left them to take the residency of Nassau Hall , January 21 , 1758 . " It is a perfectly simple exposition of the parable of the sower , with probably not a sentence which could not be instantaneously rendered by the interpreter into his vernacular Muhhekaneew , or which was not wholly within the intellectual reach of the tawny audience . Few ministers of the Gospel in any situation have less to encourage them than Hopkins had in his ministry at Great Barrington . When he accepted the invitation to that parochial charge , it was with no brilliant hopes . At the close of the day of fasting kept among the people , according to an ancient custom , preparatory to the ordination , he says , " I feel very much discouraged about venturing into the work of the ministry . They are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified for such a work . " A few days afterwards , while beating about to find who there were that could be used as materials in forming the Church on the ordination day , he encountered one who expressed some disapprobation of his preaching ; and he enters the fact in his journal with the remark , " I have wondered that they said nothing against my preaching before , bui I believe the more is to come . The way looks very dark before me . I am , it is most probable , going to run myself into innumerable difficulties by settling among this people .. . most of them opposers to Divine grace and the power of godliness . " On the Saturday preceding his ordination he writes , " I have fasted in secret to-day . " His Saturday was always with him a day of rest and devotion preparatory to his sabbath labor . " Have had some unusual assistance and enlargement . My courage is increased about settling here in the work of the ministry , being willing to go where God calls me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness . " A few months afterwards , Aug. 1744 , we find him beginning to move against the tippling-shop , and encountering opposition accordingly . In April , 1745 , we find him saying , " Have been very much discouraged , and things look very dark to me ever since I came from Northampton last . I have inward difficulties and outward troubles which are too great for me , so that I go mourning all the day . I often fear that I have no call among this people , and this day am almost determined to leave them ; yea , to leave off preaching . " Sometimes he makes a Lord 's day entry in his journal after this fashion : " Had some liberty in speaking in the forenoon , but was enabled to speak with more warmth , // vigor , and closeness this afternoon . " At last we begin to get some gleams of encouragement . May 8 , 1753 , he mentions that the sister of a young woman , on her death-bed , to whom he was making a pastoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " appealing tenderly concerned about herself . " She " desired me to pray for her , which I endeavored to do when I got into my closet at home . " He adds , in the simplicity of his delight , " &amp; what a sweet duty is intercession ... , every fervent intercessor has his reward paid down , and his prayer immediately returns into his own bosom . " The next day he makes this record : " This day H. D. died . She was a desirable youth , and hopefully converted a few weeks before she was taken sick ; and God was pleased to make me a mean of awakening her , which I esteem a greater favor than if he had given me the whole world . This is the first that I have evidence of the conversion of since I have been in the place ; and surely it is well worth while to preach seven ten ? years , ( which is the time I have been here , ) to be any ways instrumental of the conversion of one soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of labor , without the encouragement of any spiritual success ? In addition to these discouragements , or rather intermingled with them all , as the fatal cause of ill success , was the fact , that almost the entire period of his ministry in that perilous spot upon the Indian frontier , was occupied with the alarms and struggles of those French and Indian wars which were terminated by the treaty of 1763 . Yet it was not to be supposed that he was wholly excluded from the cheering and invigorating influence of intercourse with congenial minds , or from other means of improvement . Nor was he without the wholesome discipline of domestic duties , and of the joys and sorrows that are connected with the domestic relations . After two disappointments of affection and of plighted faith , he was married in his twenty-seventh year . Sons and daughters were born to him ; and his fiouse , regulated in the strictest methods of the ancient Puritan disipline , shared in the blessings of the covenant . In consequence of the death of both his parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , * while he was yet a young man , he was invested with new responsibilities as the executor of his father 's will , and as the natural guardian of his younger brothers and sisters . Three young brothers were taken to his home , as members of his household and were fitted for college under his personal tuition. # * One of them died while a student at Yale . Another , Daniel , was graduated in 1*58 , and twenty years afterwards having in the mean time distinguished himself by his patriotic zeal and activity in civil life , he was ordained pastor of the Third // At the beginning of his ministry , as we have seen , the missionaries Sergeant and Brainerd were his neighbors , with whom he took counsel and had kindly fellowship . Year by year he traveled on horseback down that exquisitely picturesque valley of the Housatonick , to the annual festival of his alma mater at New haven , and among the white wigs that gave dignity to the commencement procession , as it moved across the green , his was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pomp at Boston . After the removal of Edwards to Stockbridge* in 1751 , he had in respect to society and opportunities of study and discussion , all that his heart could wish . Hopkins and Edwards were frequently at each other 's houses-only an hour 's ride apart ; they were each other 's company in journeys . We find them together as guests at Bellamy 's house in Bethlem , a long day 's journey distant . His diary contain such passages as these : " This day being attended as a public fast , Mr. Bellamy preached for me all day . I believe there is not a better preacher in America , on all accounts : "  --  and then the next day " rode with Mr. Bellamy to Stock bridge :  --  and again , " Feb. 12 , 1755 , Mr. Bellamy came to my house last Tuesday , with whom I went to Stockbridge , and staid there two nights and one day , to hear Mr. Edwards read a treatise upon the Last End of God in the Creation of the World . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , " that in regard to their professional literature , Hopkins , Bellamy , and Edwards had all things common . " Books , pamphlets , theological manuscripts , were constantly passing and re-passing from one to another for perusal ; and each of the three was in the habit of submitting to the others all his own speculations and conclusions in the great science of Christian truth . When Edwards , after having resided seven years at Stockbridge , was invited to preside over the college at Princeton , Hopkins was a member of the council which advised his dismission ; and it was understood that his opinion determined the result . That was surely a disinterested opinion , which was to separate him from the most valued and revered of his friends . Edwards was at Princeton only long enough to receive the title which has ever since been annexed to his name . His untimely death , in less than three months after the date of his dismission Church in Salem , where he continued faithful , honored , and beloved , till his death in 1814 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same year with Daniel , and established himself in the profession of law at Great Barrington . He was eminent in the early history of Berkshire , and died in the military service of his country at White Plains , N. Y. , two days before the memorable battle at that place . The present distinguished President of Williams College , and Professor Albert Hopkins of the same institution are his grandsons . // from Stockbridge ; ' had a depressing effect upon the friend , who in so self-denying a spirit had advised his removal . The time came when Hopkins himself must be removed from his parish . Great Barrington was no longer what it was when he was ordained there as the pastor of a church consisting of five other male members . The settlement of pioneers in the wilderness , had grown into the beauty of a New England town . Having been selected as the shire town for the new county of Berkshire , it had become the residence of some men distinguished in civil affairs . He had acquired a homestead of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had brought under thorough cultivation , and on which , if he had been willing to employ himself in secular affairs , he might have lived to the end of his days in comfort . But when he had completed a quarter of a century in the pastoral office , a council called at his repeated request , advised his dismission from his charge . There had been from the beginning , opposition to his principles of church communion , and to the uncompromising Calvinism of his sermons , particularly on God 's sovereignty and his universal predetermination of events . The poli* ical agitations which grew more intense from year to year , as the epoch of the revolution was approaching , mingled themselves with the ecclesiastical affairs of Great Barrington . The pastor was a zealous whig ; and repeatedly the tories triumphed ' in town-meeting . And besides all this , the town had not outlived the period in which barbarism is the first danger ; the vices and immoralities incident to a frontier settlement , had never been suppressed , and so far as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was an obnoxious person . Under that church-andstate arrangement by which the pastor of the church was dependent on the votes of the town-meeting for his salary , his situation became at last too painful even for his meekness to endure . Yet his ministry had not been entirely unsuccessful , as lie in his humility and despondency sometimes represented it . He had received to comniunion in the church , one hundred and sixteen member* , forty-five by letter from other churches , seventy-one on their profession of faith . The evidence of his usefulness was painfully increased by his removal . The enemy came in like a flood . For eighteen years there was no pastor ; and barbarism was triumphant . At the close of the revolutionary war , an attempt was made to have a settled minister ; but after three years the experiment was given up , and sixteen more years of moral desolation followed . Twenty-five years after his dismission , Hopkins visited the scene of his former ministry ; but there was not even a place for public worship . The old meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used even for a single service : its windows were broken , its doors were fallen , and the sheep that were pastured on the common , had long made it their fold at night and their refuge from storms . Meanwhile the people were expending , upon their wretched and barbarous amusements , far more than would have supported the schoolhouse and the sanctuary , the instruction of their children and the ministration of the Gospel . Let those who discourage themselves with the belief that all motion is retrograde , go and see what Great Barrington now is . Dismissed from the pastoral office , under such discouragements , in the forty-eighth year of his age , he was little inclined to make himself a candidate . But he had already acquired a celebrity , as a theologian indeed , rather than as a preacher , which caused him to be inquired for . The very title of his first published work , * had the matter of it been ever so judicious , was well fitted to create strong prejudice against the system which it was intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin by an eternal and absolute decree , seems to imply that there is some reason in the Divine counsel for the existence of sin , distinct from the fact that a free agent must needs be capable of sinning ; and thus Calvinism has always been liable to the ad captandum objection , that it makes God the author of sin . But to defend this doctrine by the argument , " Sin , through Divine interposition , an advantage to the universe , " must needs irritate , instead of subduing , the prejudice which the doctrine itself awakens . The next of his works , in the order of time , " An Inquiry concerning the Promises of the Gospel , " was controversial in its nature ; and while its lucid and powerful logic had caused it to be extensively read , its conclusions were exceedingly repulsive to all but the most thorough and unflinching Calvinists . It had called forth a sharp reply , not from an Arminian of the school of Dr. John Taylor , but from a warm-hearted , though inconsequent Calvinist , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mills of Ripton , so often mentioned in the earlie* part of David l3rainerd 's journal . The celebrity then of Hopkins as the author of these two works-in which is the germ , at least , of all that is distinctive in Hopkinsianism-was such that , * " Sin , through Divine Interposition , an Advantage to the Universe , and yet this is no excuse for sin or encouragement to it ; Illustrated and Proved : And God 's Wisdom and Holiness in the Permission of Sin ,  --  and that his will herein is the same with his revealed will , shown and confirmed : in three sermons , from Horn . iii , * 6 , 7 , 8. " // wherever he might be thought of as a candidate , there was sure to be a formidable party against him . Such was the case in Newport , R. I. , where , after having been heard five sabbaths , he received from the First Congregational Church a call to the pastoral office . A strong opposition was raised against him in the congregation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the call . He continued to preach there several months , and then the congregation determined by a vote of thirty-six to thirty-three , that they did not desire him for their pastor . He submitted meekly to the disappointment , and only asked leave to preach to them one more sabbath , which was readily granted . He took that opportunity to preach , in the afternoon , a simple farewell sermon , and to communicate a formal answer , in the negative , to the call which the church had given him seven months before . This he did with no appearance of irritation or of a desire for the renewal of the call , yet doubtless not without sensibility ; for he had no other thought than to return immediately to his home , and thenceforth to " live a private life on his farm . " But there was something in that sermon , and in the delivery of it , which affected the congregation as no other sermon of his had done before . The result was a sudden and almost complete revolution of opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from both church and congregation . There is no portion of Dr. Park 's Memoir more exquisite than where he describes the novelty of the position in which Hopkins found himself on his removal from the rustic loneliness of Great Barrington , to the wealthy , commercial , fashionable , and ( for that age ) strangely diversified society of Newport , then the second city of New England . Ezra Stiles , afterwards President of Yale College , was the pastor of the Second Congregational Church ; and all his sympathies were in opposition to the peculiarities of what was already stigmatized as the " New Divinity . " Yet he received the unwelcome comer with a Christian courtesy which was reciprocated by the less urbane , but not more guileless Hopkins . It illustrates the estimation in which the New Divinity was held , and the impression which had been produced by Hopkins 's " Inquiry concerning the Promises , " to be informed that Stiles 's church , when invited to attend in council at the installation , unanimously instructed its delegates to examine the candidate respecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he held that it was a sin for the unregenerate to use the means of grace , " and , if he held that principle , then to have no part in his installation . The question was satisfactorily answered-greatly to the surprise , no doubt , of // many who had never read the Inquiry ,  --  and the installation took place without a protest , Stiles himself preaching at the invitation of the candidate . And what a sermon ! Not even the memorable Election Sermon by the same author , can be compared with it . The preacher was just in the flush of his Hebrew , the result of his daily walks on the parade with Jewish rabbies ; he was crammed with readings in the fathers , the result of his free access to the Redwood Library ; his imagination was evidently excited by the greatness of the occasion , and the necessity of impressing with a wholesome awe the champion of New Divinity ; and the sermon was a perfect chaos of the three learned languages , andof citations from all sorts of authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabbinical , with English enough to stick the parts together . Yet , notwithstanding this majestic salutatory , the Old Divinity pastor of one church and the New Divinity pastor of the other , the learned scholar and the metaphysical divine , the one with his stiff courtliness and the other with his stiff rusticity , lived together as peacefully as the lion and the lamb shall live together in the millennium . With all the points of difference between them , there were points of sympathy and mutual attraction . Both were ardent patriots , and were hated accordingly by the enemies of their country . They were equally hearty in their attachment to the Congregational Church order . They were equally ready for every work of Christian philanthropy . And what was more than all the rest , they both held with a firm faith the essential things of the Gospel ; and both admired and adored " the mystery of Godliness , God manifest in the flesh . " Hopkins was installed at Newport , in 1770 . Six years afterwards the town was occupied by the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worship save the Episcopal , was desecrated and dismantled ; the town was half destroyed and generally plundered , and the patriot inhabitants were driven from the island . After three years ' absence , Hopkins returned to resume his work amid the ashes and ruins of former prosperity . The remainder of his protracted life was spent in uncomplaining poverty , the pastor of an impoverished and discouraged congregation . It was in this poverty that most of his works  --  and especially the two solid volumes of his System-were elaborated . But we are not now reviewing his works , and must abstain from the discussion of his opinions as a theologian and of his qualities as a writer . Newport , after the revolution , owed the temporary revival of its commercial importance to the African slave trade , in which it had aforetime been largely interested . Nothing in the // 1852 . Prof. Park 's Memoir of Hopkins . history of Samuel Hopkins is more honorable to him , than his early , fearless , uncompromising and indefatigable testimony against the slave trade and against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the study of his works on this subject , to those pastors and doctors , who , within the last three years , in their zeal for compromise and political expediency , have shown themselves recreant to the cause of liberty . That honest old man , with all his metaphysics , had a " throb under the left breast ; " and , with all his logic , it was impossible for him to deduce from the Scriptures , or from his own theory of the nature of virtue , any apology for so atrocious a thing as the system of slavery . Without the gift of eloquence , without any advantage of station or office , without wealth , without personal influence , save in a restricted range , he made himself felt , and was willing to be hated , as a defender of the needy and the captive . His influence in this respect has acted upon thousands of minds who were never conscious that the influence which moved them came from so obscure a source . Guided by no impracticable or Jacobinical theory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he demanded , as with an inspired earnestness , justice for the wronged and liberty for all . There was nothing fanatical in his opposition to slaverynothing extravagant or reckless-nothing of the peculiar features of immediate abolitionism . His sympathy with the poor black men who had been torn from their native land , and whom he saw bought and sold , was not a blinding passion , but an expansive and elevating principle . It moved him , when the modern missionary enterprises had not yet been thought of , to attempt a mission to the heathen of Africa . It moved him to plan a noble and Christian scheme of African colonization . When his hopes and dreams shall have been realized-when civilized colonies of freedmen shall have redeemed the African coast from barbarism-when the Gospel shall have penetrated all the mysterious interior of that pagan continent-when slavery shall have ceased to dishonor and to blight the fairest land beneath the sun-his humble name may not be named on earth in connection with those great results , but his record will be on high . On the 16th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , was struck with a paralysis , from which he never wholly recovered ; yet he persevered in preaching till the age of eightytwo . And it is a beautiful close to his history as a pastor , that after all the discouragements that had attended his ministry , he did not depart till he had seen a time of religious awakening and prosperity among his people . " The friend of Edwards , Buell , and Brainerd , he had preached his first sermon in a re // vival of religion : it was meet that he should preach his last in a like scene . " The sun " shone out again at its setting , and smiled upon the patient man who had waited so long for its beams. ** It illustrates his character to know that when the time of his departure was at hand , he wrote a catalogue of all the names in his little congregation , and day after day , in his study , he made that catalogue his rosary , offering prayer for his people , distinctly , one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became his successor , and who was afterwards well known as the pastor of the church in Wethersfield-came to be his assistant in the labor to which his old and paralytic frame was no longer equal . Immediately the prayers which the aged pastor was whispering alone in the ear of God , began to be answered . It was in the progress of that awakening that he preached his last sermon . " Now have done , I can preach no more , " were his words , as he was helped out of his carriage when returning for the last time from the worshiping assembly . A little more than two months afterward , on the 20th December , 1803 , the honored patriarch , in the sixty-second year of his ministry , and in the eighty-third year of his age , was released from his infirmities and sufferings , and slept in Jesus .
