txt ART . VIIL-THE RELATION OF MINISTERS TO THEIR PEOPLE . The Sunny Side ; or the Country Minister 's Wife . pp. 142. l8mo . Philadelphia : American Sunday School Union . Eleventh Edition . THE value of a book is not measured by its size , nor is its title-page always a true index of its contents or character . We have accordingly placed at the head of this article the title of a small book , recently published by the American Sunday-School Union , for the purpose of commending the work itself to a class of readers who are in danger of losing the pleasure of its perusal , and for the sake also of saying some things which , it seems to us , need to be said . The book itself , though entitled The Country Minister 's Wife , ' is really a picture or history of the experiences of a country clergyman and his family , and a picture true to the life . Not that the experience of any one family will answer , perhaps , to all the incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread of the story are strung the real experiences of many a minister of the gospel , and of his household ; and these // are what give the book its charm ; these are what make it true and real in the best sense , and these are what enable it to find an answering chord in the heart of the reader and make the eye moisten over many of its unpretending pages . We confess to have had the fountains of emotion stirred within us by its perusal as they seldom are stirred . We felt , while reading it , that we were looking in upon the experiences of persons actually alive like ourselves , and not upon those of the mere creatures of fancy . Mr. Edwards , we are sure , is living , or was , not long since , somewhere in New England , though not known by the name given him in the volume before us . His wife , too ,  --  we have not the least doubt that the author of Sunny-Side could tell us to what post-office we could direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam 's postal arrangements could have any approximation to infallibility predicated of them . Deacon Jones , also , if he does not live in the same parish with Mr. Edwards , we will venture to say , lives in the next one to it . And then there is Miss Cribby . What country parish would be a country parish without a Miss Cribby ? These are the more prominent persons of the story , and every reader must feel that he is perusing the history of real persons , only under the thin disguise of assumed names . We are introduced to Mr. Edwards , a young clergyman , as he rides over in the flush of youthful anticipation to the parish where , on the next day , he is to be ordained as a minister of the gospel . Then we follow him through his marriage , and all the changes , duties , and perplexities of ministerial life . He is weighed down with the accumulations of debt incident to an inadequate salary and an increasing family . He is chilled by lack of the warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is pressed at length to the necessity of resigning his charge and betaking himself to some other occupation , for the purpose of supporting his family . His resignation , however , wakens the slumbering affections and energies of his people , and they rally and make promises just sufficient to prevent his carrying his purpose of leaving them into execution . He remains ; toils on , now in hope and now in fear , sustained by a firm trust in God and a true spirit of self-denial , until , finally , the clouds begin to break away , and the blessings of God come down upon him through the children whom he has nurtured with so much care and patient suffering . The end is bright like the beginning , though separated from it by a long night of darkness and conflict . The sunny side of the pastor 's life is turned towards us at its close , and that life goes out in comfort and peace . // In too much comfort and peace , many are disposed to say .  --  the complaint is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reference to this little volume , that the sky becomes too clear ; that the starved and suffering pastor and his family are overprosperous in the end . This is true , in some sense . And , if the picture here drawn is to be taken as a representation of the ordinary experience of ministerial life , we should say it is faulty at just this point ; we should say that it too entirely takes off the edge of suffering , by giving it a more than counterbalancing sequel of joy and outward posperity , by giving it a result or consequent which seldom follows it . To this we propose to direct our general remarks hereafter . But certainly it is within the province of a writer to draw an individual picture , with all the brilliant effect here given by the strong , sharp contrast of light and shade . It is within the possibility of things , too , that such a picture should be drawn from real life . And if the Sunday-School Union or some benevolent person would give a copy of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great good would be done , and mainly because of the bold and even startling contrast between the different portions of the life here portrayed . It would sustain and encourage perplexed and burdened pastors in their struggles , by the thought that there have been those who have come out successfully from such trials as theirs ; that others have gone before them , who , after having borne the heat and burden of the toilsome day , have been allowed the comforts of a blessed repose at evening . It would hold up before them with a new and more vivid reality , the truth , that God is with his ministers and can feed them even as Elijah of old was fed . It would make their burdens lighter , or , rather , easier to be borne . It would quicken their faith and nerve their patience , and enable them to live a truer and better christian life . We are persuaded , also , that , if there were a more fervent , all-consecrating piety in the ministry , the sunny side of life would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man within us magnifies troubles and causes us to wound ourselves , by unnecessary and ineffectual chafing against those troubles that are great and real . We are not about to complain of the piety of the ministry , certainly not in comparison with the piety of the church at large . But Elias was a man of like passions with other men . Ministers are human , and , like all of the race of Adam , they are open to the exhortation " let us go on unto perfection . " And we do believe that many of their troubles are occasi.oned or aggravated by the lack of a completely right state of heart , by the lack , at times and measurably , of that // spirit that was in Christ Jesus . We do believe , that , if those whose office it is to preach the gospel had more constantly and manifestly a single eye to the glory of God , and a heart more entirely consecrated to him , they would find a thousand alleviations of trouble , and a thousand gifts of plenty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more holiness , both for their own comfort and usefulness ; and the church and the world want more holiness in the ministry , to say nothing of what they want in themselves . Having thus indicated our opinion that the volume before us is calculated to encourage ministers themselves , we are bound also to say that for general usefulness it would have been better , if it had been written with a stricter regard to general truth . We mean by this , that if the author had given us a history or picture of ministerial life , not as it may he found in a single particular case , however interesting and worthy of being chronicled that may be , but as it is seen exemplified in the frequent experience of the village pastor ; if she ( for the authorship of the book is no longer a secret , ) had shown us the more general and common experience of clerical life instead of the particular and uncommon , a more serviceable work would have been accomplished . The graphic delineations of our author 's pen would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ministerial life , which need to be held before the public in a strong light . Perhaps , indeed , the present volume is but an experiment of the author , intended to be a test to herself of her ability to cope with the subject in its wider and more general bearings . If so , the success of the experiment can not but encourage her to go forward . The public have their eye upon her as one able to interest and instruct them , and they will not easily suffer her pen to be idle . We should learn with pleasure that she had undertaken a more complete exhibition of the subject of the volume now before us . Meanwhile , we shall , as we said at the outset , make her book the occasion of advancing some thoughts of our own upon the general subject , confining ourselves , however , to some of its darker features . The bulk of the volume now in hand is occupied with the picture of the struggles of a country clergyman and his family against the ills- of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We wish to say that this part of the picture which the book presents is one of general character , that it portrays scenes which are very common . It is our wish , so far as possible through our pages , to call attention to this , and to urge some considerations pertinent to the occasion . // We say , then , that there are thousands like Mr. Edwards , thousands of ministers of the gospel , whose lives , if brought to the sight of the public by some faithful pen , would present the same interesting and touching picture presented in the volume before us , though lacking the bright coloring of its happy close . We are wont to associate hardship and suffering with the life of a missionary , and our sympathies are called out in no measured degree in behalf of those who go forth to distant lands as preachers of the gospel . And the mass of people seem to think that the minister of Christ , who goes out to China or Ceylon , is a very different being from what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pastor of some village church . We are much more regardful of his wants and trials , ready by common consent to do almost anything to promote his comforts . We assemble once a month for the special purpose of supplicating God in his behalf . Mothers tear themselves away from their household engagements , and meet from week to week or month to month , to provide with needle and nimble fingers articles of apparel , or , by exchange of money , books and other things which may promote at the same time the usefulness and comfort of those who have gone forth in simple obedience to their Saviour 's command , to preach his gospel in the wilds of the west or the heathenish abodes of the east . Now while we do not object to this in the least , or think that there is any superfluous expenditure of sympathy and good will in this direction , we wish to say most distinctly and unhesitatingly that there is call for an equal sympathy in behalf of those nearer home . We believe that no tale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more calculated , to touch the deepest sympathies of a generous and feeling heart , than would be the narrative were it to be written , of a multitude of christian ministers who are living and dying in the service of their Master among the hills and valleys of the longest settled and most cultivated regions of our own country . Nay , we believe there is many a parish , even in New England , and in its best portions too , where the people assemble at the beginning of each month to hear with tearful sympathy from their pastor an account of the trials and successes of the missionaries on the Home or Foreign field , without ever asking themselves whether his field is not as full of toil and trial as theirs ; and where , as the good mothers in Israel assemble in their sewing circle and invite their minister and his wife to be present ,  --  if she is not even expected to be manager of the whole thing  --  and see what they are doing for God 's dear ministers in other lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastor and his family do not need such services as // much as those afar off . And we believe there are many , many such p*frishes where there is an amount of discouraging , disheartening influences that is seldom found in connection with what is called missionary life . People seem to be ignorant of the fact that the ministry of the gospel is essentially a missionary work , and in this respect is independent of locality and undetermined by lines of latitude and longitude . So they have divided the company of those whose employment is preaching the gospel , into two grand classes , and a man is set down as belonging to the one or the other , not by reason of his essential occupation or his faithfulness and success as a teacher of righteousness , but according as he exercises his vocation in one place or another . If a man is manifestly sent of God to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ to a company of human beings in Cincinnati , or a large and intelligent congregation in Massachusetts , he is only a minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a missionary . The fact that one speaks in the name of Christ in one place rather than in another gives him a different rank altogether in the general esteem of the christian public . In the one case he is invested with a greater sanctity than in the other ; he is supposed to be a person of higher toned piety , more self-denial and greater devotedness to God . He is supposed to need the prayers and sympathies of his fellow christians also in the one case more than he does in the other . And he has them . If a man is learned in all the wisdom of the schools , and armed in a complete panoply for the conflict with error , a panoply not alone of a well disciplined and erudite mind , but also of a heart filled with the graces of the Spirit , and goes into some populous city , where vice and error have put on their utmost strength of allurement , and have taken to themselves the aids of false philosophy and a corrupt social spirit , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in a moral Thermopyke , and holds at bay the subtlest and most persistent foes of God and man ; or , if from the pulpit and the press alike he makes vigorous onset upon the legions of evil and routs them at all points he is only doing his proper work , men think-just as the merchant by his side may be doing his , or the mechanic his-he is simply a minister of the gospel . But if , with little culture of any sort perhaps , and no more and no better piety than he , another goes out to talk to the Kaffirs or the South Sea Islanders about God and eternity , he is a missionary , a higher order of workman in the Lord 's vinyard . He is , prospectively at least , a martyr for Christ , and a martyr 's glory is assigned him in advance . The prayers and sympathies of Christians all over the land are at once drawn out in his behalf . // The Relation of Ministers to their People . May , If a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to the weather or the unfavorable effects of a new climate , or of some threatened danger from barbarous men , why there is no end to the feeling at once excited in behalf of those thus exposed . It makes a vast difference , in these respects , where a man is , a greater difference by far than what he is . Let us not be considered as depreciating or slighting at all the missionary work as it is commonly understood . By no means . We do not believe there is one jot too much of feeling and prayer and sympathy given to those who have gone abroad as preachers of the gospel , although men of the world will spend their lives at the poles or the tropics , and brave all hazards of climate and character in the pursuit of wealth , and neither ask or receive the sympathies of any . But we have spoken as we have , for the sake of correcting , if possible , what we deem an error . We would not have our churches lessen at all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth to the ends of the earth in obedience to the mandate , " Go ye into all the world .. and preach the gospel to every creature . " But we would say , in the language of our Saviour , " These ought ye to have done but not to leave the other undone . " We would have them understand that the preacher of the gospel , so far as he does preach the gospel out of a good and pious heart , is a missionary , one sent of God , whether he is sent to New York or to New Guinea , to the hills of Asia Minor or to the hills of New England . We would have them understand that the work of a faithful country pastor here at home is as important , every whit as important , as the work of him who preaches Christ on the other side of the globe . We would have them understand that the work of reclaiming and converting the erring and sinful of our own language and blood , is as important and as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hottentots . We would have them feel that there are heathen at our own door , as far from God and the hope of salvation by Christ as any to be found in Hindostan or Caifrana . And we would have them give their sympathies to the ministers of salvation , not by weight or measure , and not with the distinctions of place , but according to the demands of each and every case . We would have them not withhold their regard and their tender feeling for any whom they now cherish , but bestow their attention and regard upon others also . We wish by these remarks to bespeak the sympathy and regard of our churches for a class of persons , whose claims have been neglected very much hitherto , but whose claims are second to those of none besides . We mean the pastors of churches here // at home . And , more particularly , we mean the pastors of churches in our humbler villages and less populous places . There is no class of men , perhaps , whose life is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry . There is no class of men , we are firmly convinced , who do as much work with so little earthly recompense as they . There are none who are compelled to struggle with so many difficulties and discouragements and perplexities and anxieties , with so little sympathy that might occasionally let up the crushing weight . We talk of the self-denial and loss of comforts incident to the life of a missionary to the distant heathen ; but there is many a pastor in the parishes of New England , who , if he could have foreseen at the outset the difficulties and trials he was to encounter , and it had been given him to choose a held of labor on the score of ease and comfort , would have chosen to cast his lot with any of the tribes that know not God , sooner than undertake the work and the trials which he has found incident to the life of a parish minister at home . But they have undertaken , we are told , a work of self-denial , and look for their recompense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So they do . And this is all that keeps them from sinking . It is to the praise of the riches of divine grace , and love too , that men can find so much of comfort and happiness amid outward circumstances so untoward . But this excuses not their fellow men and fellow christians for leaving them to depend upon God thus . He will undoubtedly reward them , in this world or another , a hundred fold for all their toils and self-denials in his service . But this is no reason why his people should not lighten their burdens by their sympathies and care . This is no reason why they should not exercise an appropriate fellow feeling in their behalf . Let us say , then , as a first point demanding attention , that the ministry are very inadequately paid in a pecuniary point of view . We mean this as a general statement , admitting of course of the appropriate qualifications in individual instances . But the statement needs fewer qualifications than many suppose . We say the ministry are very inadequately paid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent for work rendered , as we do in regard to the ordinary employments and services of men , the word is quite out of place . No preacher of the gospel can receive a pecuniary equivalent for what he renders . Goodness is not to be measured by the standard of the exchange . Its value is above rubies . In this view , the dullest drone that ever worked six days in the week on the farm or the cobbler 's bench , and mouthed drowsy exhortations or read other men 's // sermons from the pulpit on the sabbath , was never adequately paid . The most meagre discharge of the functions of the pastoral office is worth more to the pecuniary thrift and prosperity of any place , to say nothing of its other beneficial influences , than it ever costs in money . But the true idea of a salary or pecuniary stipend in the case is this ; that , if a man gives up his time and ability for the spiritual benefit of his brethren and the community , of which he and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will see that he and his family are provided for in respect to earthly wants . Nothing short of this is reasonable . Any upright , just-feeling man would be ashamed of himself , if he were to propose or offer anything short of this . There is an implied contract on the part of each one , who has a voice in inviting another to take the spiritual oversight of a particular congregation , to do his proportion to provide for the temporal wants of the one so invited , if the invitation is accepted . How can it be otherwise ? On what other terms can men , in this age and in this part of the world , be supposed to wish for the services of a stated religious teacher ? In the very fact of inviting him to the post of a pastor and minister , they indicate their expectation that he will undertake a work which will occupy his time and faculties to the almost total exclusion of every other work , certainly to the exclusion of any that could be of any considerable account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out and in before them with such frequency , and to be so accomplished in the knowledge of the word of God and its adaptation to the character and needs of men , and so skillful in applying it , that he must be absorbed in this one business . It must engage his time and employ all his energies . From what source , then , but from those to whom he ministers and for whose benefit all his labors are undertaken , is he to look for those comforts and necessities of physical , intellectual and social life , for the attainment of which all except himself are at liberty to toil with unrestricted energy ? We say , then , that there is an implied contract , and the most obligatory of all contracts , a contract to which a written bond and visible seal could give no additional validity or binding force , between a minister of the gospel and those to whom he ministers , that so long as he is their spiritual instructor and makes it his absorbing business to take the spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will provide for his temporal wants . This implied contract , moreover , is usually , if not always , recognized and made an express contract , by a written declaration . The invitation to become the pastor of any particular church is usually accom // panied by the distinct offer of a certain sum of money as salary , as the means of providing for temporal wants . The sum specified , however , is properly nominal , and is to be considered as the exponent of an understood and acknowledged obligation on the part of a people to provide a temporal support for their pastor . We say it is to be regarded as a nominal sum , and not a definite and conclusive return or reward for services rendered . It is true that many parishes regard the payment of the nominal salary as a conclusive bar to all further claims upon them , and consider the contract between a minister and the congregation whom he serves , to be like that between the owner of a farm and the one whom he engages to dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a house and the carpenter and mason by whom it has been built ; so much for so rhuch , so much money for so much work . But this is a departure from the true idea of the matter , a wrong construction of the contract , which we are endeavoring now to bring into the court of appeals for a new ruling . The legal relations of every ecclesiastical society make it necessary , indeed , that the connection between a minister and those in whose behalf he labors should be based upon a civil contract , which can be taken cognizance of and enforced by the ordinary legal tribunals . But there is a contract deeper and more binding than this , a contract not in the letter but in the spirit , and that contract has not its tern 's in any specific number of dollars and cents . It is like the matrimonial contract , which is deeper and more binding than the mere civil engagements between the parties . There is such a deeper , closer contract between the pastor and his flock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to them , and foregoes the opportunity of acquiring pecuniary competency or wealth . They , on the other hand , and by the very fact of inviting him to sustain the ministerial relation in respect to them , pledge themselves in the most distinct and binding manner , to see that he does not lack those things which are needful for his temporal comfort . It would be difficult , indeed , if not impossible , to specify in precise terms what he shall have , for his wants and necessities can not be foreseen . But the nominal sum set down in the civil contract.is certainly not to be considered the exact measure of them . It may not half measure them ; and if so , its payment does not absolve a people from further payment . The Common Law may not enforce the demand of anything more . But there is a higher Law which does , and that law is not satisfied until the one party to the contract have put the other beyond the need of asking " what shall we eat , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we be clothed . " Nay , more than this is demanded . The minister of the gospel is not only to be provided with a house in which to live sheltered from the storms , with a table at which he may find that which will replenish the material waste which is all the while resulting from the organic laws of physical life , and with the clothing which decency requires ; he has a right to be comfortable . lie has a right to all that is involved in or required for , a state which we designate as one of comfort . Until he has this , the contract on the part of those for whom he labors is not fulfilled . Just what this is , as we have already said , can not be stated in advance and specifically . The determination of it depends upon the character and circumstances of the minister himself , and its supply must be left to the sense of justice and the christian feeling of those whom he serves . What is comfort for one man is not for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be rightly settled , though it is but too true and too often true that its settlement is attempted by such a law . For example , there will be , through a large section of country , the same nominal salary promised to the minister of the gospel , and then this nominal sum will be regarded as all that there is any obligation to pay . So it will be found that the man of simplest inbred habits of life , and of fewest desires of taste and scholarship , receives the same means of livelihood with the one brought up in different habits and having far different and larger wants . The man who has but himself to provide for receives the same pecuniary supply as the one who emulates the martyred Rogers in the extent of his family . Now we say that this state of things ought not to exist . But it does exist to a very great extent , and it is on this account that we have been induced to enter upon the present strain of remark . We complain of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ministry and the people whom they serve in the gospel . Ministers of the gospel are borne down and literally starved to the last point of endurance , or they are driven from the ministry or into a state of insolvency , which , if it does not involve fraud on their own part , does on that of their people . And this is frequently the case . The general fact is , that ministers of the gospel are suffering in this respect . They who can be considered comfortable are the exceptions . If the census were to be takeA , if the inquiry were to be made into the temporal condition of the clergy of New England-aside from the larger towns and citiesit would be found that a large majority are actually suffering for want of those things which they ought to have at the hands of // those for whom they spare no toil by night or by day . And it is time for this matter to receive a proper attention . Consequences , far greater and more important than the mere suffering of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a position in respect to other christians , they sustain such a relation to the church at large , and , through the church , to the whole body of their fellow-men , that whatever cripples their energies cripples materially the power of the gospel . The church , therefore , for its own sake , for the sake of its own edification and spiritual growth , and for the sake of the wide world which it is set to watch and to save , can not afford to have its ministers crippled in their efficiency . And how much they are crippled by the inadequate provision made for their temporal wants , few besides themselves probably know , few stop to consider . In most cases , we venture to say , this one thing hangs like a leaden weight upon all their energies . Their piety enables them to lighten its pressure somewhat . But it is expecting too much to expect that it will take off the pressure altogether . After all relief that we can reasonably look for from this source , enough will remain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouragement , and perplex it with an anxiety that it ought not to be disturbed with . Let the minister 's stipend be so small and be paid so unfrequently , that , instead of being able to keep something always by him or safely deposited to meet coming wants , his indebtedness is always in advance of his means of payment , and the stipulated compensation is no sooner paid him than he finds bills and accounts ready to swallow it all , and more too , and one can see if he will that such a state of things will not be very favorable either to a minister 's comfort or efficiency , or to the spiritual welfare of his people . As he sits down to compose a sermon for the coming sabbath , almost before he is aware of it , the sense of this and that want will make itself felt , and will take in hand the direction of his thoughts . He will revolve the means of supplying the rising wants , and as the means seem of doubtful efficacy , he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he perhaps knows not how to meet ; and then trouble is upon him , and its tangling meshes are all around him ; and thus he sits and ponders and suffers till he is called to dinner by his patient , toiling wife , or goes to bed weary , the pen unsoiled with ink and no preparation made for the intended and expected discourse . Such is the history of many a day in the minister 's study . Such is the natural fruit of a neglect on the part of a people to fulfil their implied contract with their pastor , of the failure to provide for his temporal wants . And where the effect of such // failure is not thus to rob them of entire days of a pastor 's services in the study and exposition of the word of God , with which they expect him to feed them , it must enter as an element into all his days and affect more or iess the whole course of his life . It must show itself in all his sermons , though , from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed by the people . But no man can study , no man can write , with such worldly cares and anxieties hanai can when free from them . * ug about him , as he In addition , also , to the mere sense of want and perplexity which the minister so situated must have , there is the feeling of injustice , which of itself is enough to take the nerve out of any man 's resolution . The minister thus troubled feels that he is unjustly troubled , and that too , by the injustice of those for whom he is still expected to labor . He is conscious , he can not but be conscious , that he is doing a work for which he receives nothing like an adequate recompense from them . He feels that his services , so far as pay is concerned in the ordinary acceptation of the word , are well nigh a gratuity . He knows , too , that if he were to exercise the privilege of those around him , and engage in any pursuit to which his powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most abundant gain , he could probably soon put himself in a condition of ease and comfort . He sees the lawyer , the merchant , the manufacturer , the farmer , the school-teacher , all of whom demand his services and his undivided services , all , amassing wealth and living in a state of comfort of which he is deprived , and of which he is. deprived by their neglect . He feels not only neglected , but injured also . And it is more than can be expected of imperfectly sanctified man that he will or can , under such circumstances , labor for his flock with the good will and whole-hearted devotion , which he would manifest in a different state of things . Let any one , by an effort of mind , endea**or to put himself into the position so often occupied by the minister of the gospel , and he will see without difficulty what must be the effect . In addition to the results already mentioned , the inadequate provision made for the wants of the ministry tends to beget also a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man uncomfortable to himself and to all about him . The man thus situated is often obliged to deal with things of a temporal character on the narrowest scale and by the smallest measure . He is constantly at work in the endeavor to live on homeopathic allowances , on bran bread and weak dilutions of tea and coffee . The natural tendency of such things is , unless the man has a mind and heart of such strength as to resist and overpower // all adverse influences , to beget a narrow and dry habit of thought and feeling . It takes the life and spring out of him , and his discourses , instead of being animated with a generous and glowing spirit from which the hearers take fire , are only so many dried preparations of an anatomical mijseum . The consequences , therefore , of the too common condition of the ministry in regard to provisions of a temporal nature are every way evil and disastrous . While their condition is one of wrong to them , it is also one in which they are more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whose benefit they professedly labor . In urging , therefore , the duty of rectifying the evil to which we have adverted , we are calling upon the church not only to do an act of justice to its ministers , but likewise to do what its own welfare imperatively demands . The church is suffering beyond measure on account of this narrow and neglectful policy . It is even losing pecuniarily untold sums for want of a truly wise and economical outlay , in its provisions for the temporal support of its ministers . We are not advocating any such style of pecuniary recompense , if we may use the word in this connection , as would enable the ministry to compete with others in the acquisition of earthly wealth , or the enjoyment of luxuries . We are willing , nay , desirous , that they should be kept under such restraints in this respect that they shall be under no temptation to relax their devotedness of mind , or to become less spiritual in their life and feelings than they now are . But we do claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do claim that they shall not be pinched with want of the ordinary necessaries of life . We claim for them the ability to purchase all needful books that will aid in their studies , or enliven and invigorate their minds . We claim too , that they shall be able to make their houses something more than mere shelters from the inclemencies of the weather-that they shall be able to adorn them with unexpensive articles of taste-that they shall be able to enrich their walls with an occasional picture of a different order from the certificates of membership in the Tract and Bible Societies , which now , in their black-painted frames , are so often the only ornament of the parlor walls . We claim thus much for the mihister of religion , as the award of common sense and common justice , as well as the demand of a true and enlightened economy . At this point too , we wish to advert to what specially deserves consideration . It is the fact , that while the character of the ministerial work has undergone a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change as necessarily in* // creases the pecuniary expenses of the clergy , they actually receive smaller salaries than formerly . Fifty years ago , all that was requisite to render a man eligible to the pastoral office , in any of our most flourishing and intelligent villages , was credible evidence of piety , and a six months course of study , if it could be called by that name , with some settled pastor , whose whole library was comprised , perhaps , in the Bible , the New Testament in Greek , and some now antiquated body of divinity , the greatest virtue of which was that it had a current reputation for orthodoxy . Such was the necessary equipment of a minister of the gospel . By a happy correspondence , also , between the expectations of his people and his own qualifications and abilities , he was regarded as fully discharging the duties of his office by reading two dry sermons on the sabbath , attending perhaps a drier prayer-meeting during the week , and visiting the sick and well as occasion might seem to demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by any means , all of a minister 's time . It seems to have been thought that he would probably need one or two days of the week to prepare his sermons , except when he made use of old ones , but as for the rest , if he was only where he could be found in case of necessity , as when a funeral or marriage was to take place , and would look in upon the district schools occasionally , why , he could occupy himself for a considerable part of the week , like his parishioners , in the care of a farm , or in any other employment he might choose . Accordingly , when one was invited to take the pastoral charge of a parish , a pecuniary stipend was not only voted him , and a sum really greater in value than is now received on the average by our country pastors , but a parsonage and glebe , or farm , was also provided . The result was , not unfrequently , that the minister gained a livelihood like his neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater part of it at interest every year , became pecuniarily the most independent man in town , and at death , if he lived , as those farmerministers frequently did , to a ripe old age , left a goodly amount of property to his children . This was the natural result , for with a farm at his disposal , and liberty to labor on it from four to six days in the week , be had little occasion to make inroads upon his pecuniary salary . There were few books to be bought , and there was little desire for those that might be had . Newspapers and magazines , now so much necessaries of life , were then almost unknown . Plenty of bodily exercise with the hoe , the scythe and the axe preserved the health , or , if it failed for a time , the lack of railroads and steamboats was an effectual check upon the expenditure of much money in the attempt to re // cruit it . Travel , if undertaken , was done with the parson 's own horse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , or tavern charges by night . He was always well provided for in the house of some deacon or brother minister , and his horse fed liberally on their hay and oats . But now things are different . How different we need not stop to describe . The people , led by the ministers themselves , that is , by those who have been students of the word of God and not farmers , have come to demand and look for a different style of pastoral duty . They have come to demand , that a man who undertakes the charge of spiritual things among them shall be totus in illis , wholly given to this one business . They expect him to be thoroughly furnished for his work , and to be so accomplished in sacred learning and the abstruse points of metaphysical theology , that he can answer questions put to him on his examination for ordination , which are many of them altogether beyond the depth of the veteran questioners who ask them . He must be equipped at the outset with a library , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher of the last century . He must be furnished with abundant exegetical helps from the great German thesaurus , and be well read in biblical literature of every sort . Costly quarterlies must keep him advertised of the latest results of universal scholarship , and he must look for the news of every ocean steamer with the same interest that the merchant and the politician do . He is expected to be acquainted with the whole circle of the sciences , and to be thoroughly posted up in regard to almost every species of knowledge . He must be familiar with Mantell and Hugh Miller , with Liebig and Faraday , with Agassiz and Owen . The equipment thus required of the candidate for the gospel ministry at this day , and the labor and pecuniary expenditure incident to the preservation of a respectable and useful position in that ministry , are almost incredible in amount as compared with what was needful fifty or a hundred years ago . The preliminary attainments and the subsequent study which were then considered ample , are now altogether inadequate . The newspaper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has made all more or less conversant with the merits of religious questions . The works of Baxter , Bunyan , Howe , and Edwards , are also no longer strangers in the dwelling even of the farmer and the mechanic of humblest circumstances , while the commentaries of Barnes and Bush , widely diffused among the people , have advanced them to the positions in respect to biblical // learning , that was occupied only by the clergy in the last century . The preacher of the gospel , therefore , can no longer combine the functions of the ministry and of the husbandman . The people will not tolerate it . The increased demands of the mm*sterial work itself , will not tolerate it . But while this is so , and while the minister is thus cut off from making any provision for his temporal wants by labors aside from his profession , the people , for whom he toils and who are expecting three fold the work from him which was expected fifty years ago of those in the like position , have made no corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have taken away the resources of the farm or the private school , the stipulated pecuniary payment of the pastor , though nominally somewhat enlarged perhaps , is left in reality at the point where it was under the old order of things . The result is , that the ministry are to a great extent in a state of real and great oppression . They are reduced to the extremity of a constant endeavor to solve the problem , on how small an allowance human life can be sustained . They are really living , many of them , in a state of perpetual starvation . We speak plainly , for we have *ken up this subject , not for the sake of filling space in our pages , but for the purpose of calling attention to what we deem a great wrong and a great abuse . And we say , therefore , deliberately , that it is true of a large number of those engaged in the work of the christian ministry , and that too in the best portions of our land , that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the physiologist knows that the process of starvation may go on for years as well as for days . There is many a christian minister in whom this process is going on . The result is seen , in the fact , that so many die in comparatively early life . It is seen also , in the fact , that so many are driven into other pursuits , and abroad into other lands , for the purpose of escaping a premature grave . It is seen likewise in the fact , that dismissions from the pastoral charge are so frequent throughout the country , dismissions the chief and most pressing cause of which is not always given , because of a pastor 's reluctance to expose the faults of those whom he loves . A man is starved in body and in mind till it is found that he does not grow and keep pace with the busy , progressive world around him , and then he receives a gentle admonition , ( and sometimes not so very gentle either ) that his usefulness is at an end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so many words , that a proper regard for the spiritual welfare of the parish should cause him to ask for a dismission . This is the polite and christian // way of getting rid of a minister , whom the people have made a sacrifice to their own miserliness or neglect ! Starvation , first ; ejectrnent , next ! It is like a man wearing the life out of a generous-spirited horse , while he keeps him on rye straw , and then , when nature is giving out , trading him off slyly at the best advantage . It is common to hear people talk about dull preachers , much more common than it was formerly . The cause is two fold . The mass of men now growing up have been fed on the stimulating food of our newspapers , the rehearsals of " Moving accidents by flood and field , " accounts of murder , riot and all that is exciting . The whole movement of the age is rapid and spirited . The jog-trot farmhorse and turnpike are exchanged for the locomotive and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What , therefore , was quite acceptable to the fathers is dull to the children . But there is another cause to be assigned in accounting for the prevalence of the complaint alluded to . The people have treated the ministry in just the way to make them dull . They have compelled them to expend the forces of thought on the question of temporal support for themselves and families , and so have prevented them from giving that attention to things spiritual and eternal , which would have brought them before their people with a constantly growing interest and usefulness . They ask them not only to make bricks , but to make them without straw . They not only oblige them to be absorbed in the study of ways and means for a livelihood , but they debar them from the stimulating and nurturing effects of a good library , from which they might bring to their flock , week by week , the fruits of diligent toil , reaped from a hundred fields . Thus , they dull the ministry by system , and then complain that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is time that a change were wrought in regard to this matter . No man ought to be expected to preach the gospel as it is expected it will be preached in these days , and yet have only that pecuniary provision mad@for him which is made in most of our parishes , He can not do it . He must either starve himself or starve his people , if he undertakes the charge of a parish under such circumstances . And so , as we see , ministers are everywhere compelled to break up their connection with their people after a few years , and go into some other employment , or to another parish where they can get their debts , or a part of them , paid off as a condition of settlement . In this way , the wealthier and more liberal churches are // constantly assuming and discharging the obligations which other churches have neglected to meet ; and , on the other hand , those churches which compel their ministers to flee from starvation , as the Irish are driven from their green island over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministered to by the mere apprentices in the ministry . They take a young man fresh from his preparatory studies , and for a year or two he is able to live on the means afforded him . But just as his rawness is worn off , and he is ready to take a strong position and hold it , just as he has cut loose from the ipse dixits of human teachers , and is ready to bring forth as the result of his own christian experience and severe , independent study of the divine word , treasures of wisdom for the benefit of his people , he finds himself so hampered by lack of means to provide for bodily and mental wants , that he becomes like a tree , in which the vital force is struggling to accomplish its appropriate effects and swelling the bark to bursting almost , but whose growth and power of assimilation are impeded by extraneous influences , and so stands and must stand , while those impediments exist , making no increment from year to year . Just so it often is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone to a certain point , root-bound , so to speak . He could grow by nature to a given size , but now the cares of an increasing family , and the pecuniary inability to provide for the temporal wants of a household , and to procure those helps to his own mental growth which he hungers and thirsts for , bring him to a stand-still , or into the condition of a mere struggle between life and death . We have reason to believe that this is the position of a large number of our clergy , particularly in our lesser towns and villages . Therefore , we speak as we now do . It is a shame to the churches that such a state of things should exist , and , therefore , we call upon them to remedy it . It is a wrong to the faithful , self-denying ministers of Christ , and , therefore , we call upon the churches to rectify it . It is a wrong to the churches themselves , to the cause of their Redeemer and to the eternal welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the churches to suffer its existence no longer . But the plea will be made by many of these churches , that they are unable to pay a larger salary than they do . We do not believe this plea to be well-founded . We do not believe there is a church , in the older portions of our country to say the least , which is not able to support its minister in ample comfort . The inability is the inability of disposition . It springs out of a defective style of piety . Professedly christian men look upon the engagement between a church and its pastor // as being like that between a farmer and his hired man , or the merchant and his clerk , in which the aim is to get the required work at the lowest possible cost , regardless whether the one performing it can so afford it or not . The lowest tolerable salary is named , and if that is paid duly , or unduly even , the church considers its contract fulfilled and itself absorbed from all other demands . If more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " that is , in such a way that it shall seem a gratuity , a matter of overflowing generosity , and not by any means a right or a precedent for another year .. Then , too , if the more appreciative and large hearted piety of the fathers has provided a fund as a held to the proper support of the ministry , the children are very apt to make it their study , on how small a sum beyond the avails of the fund , they can compel their minister to live . We have known the exact avails of a fund , and that a small one too , to be voted as the salary of a minister , the people refusing to tax their own pockets to the amount of a dollar . Such is the trafficking , sixpenny-pedler character , to which the contract between the preacher of the gospel and his parishioners is often reduced . It is absolutely disgraceful , and it is high time for a change to be wrought in the matter . The interests of all concerned demand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sensibly , yet the people feel it as really and as disastrously . Nay , they feel it more disastrously , for while their neglect may pinch him with bodily want and mental stagnation , it must , for that very reason , leave their souls barren , and the spiritual interests of the entire parish must suffer ; how much , the revelations of the future state alone will determine . We have left ourselves no room to speak as we should like to speak , of other topics which have a bearing upon the general subject before us . We must , however , go so far as to say that the ministry , particularly in our lesser parishes , are not only suffering unwarrantably through lack of proper pecuniary supplies , but also for want of a proper sympathy on the part of those for whom they labor . And the suffering thus occasioned , though different in kind , is often no less severe and burdensome . The christian minister knows that in all his labors , whether in the pulpit or elsewhere among his flock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the silent hours by the study lamp , he is laboring not for himself so much as for others , that he is endeavoring to be a helper of the joy and faith of those around him . He feels thath is business is theirs as truly as it is his . And yet how little apparent sense of this is there , on the part of those to whom he ministers . How seldom is there a manifest knitting of hearts together as in one common work . how seldom // do the people have a consciousness that he and they are engaged in a common business . How seldom is there that close and intimate fellowship between minister and people , which makes them alive to all his wants and all his labors , which telegraphs to them by hidden nerves of watchfulness and interest every varying phase of his ministry and makes them forward to see and to remove every impediment to his success . How often is it the case rather , that he is looked upon as one hired to do an unpleasant but necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duly paid ; they are absolved from all further concern . They have hired a pastor , as the farmer hires the son of Erin to ditch his land . The minister is expected to bring his implements and dig moral ditches , through which the cold and stagnant waters of sin may be drained off . Let him do his work and take the stipulated pay , always provided , that if he does not do the work in the manner expected , he is liable to be dismissed at any time . But as for his employers manifesting any sympathy with him , or indicating that they are interested in his welfare , and disposed to lighten the burden of his toils , he is not to look for that . They will come occasionally , that is , once a week , on the sabbath , and see how well he gets along with his spiritual ditching . Perhaps they will praise him as a clever workman . That involves no expense but words . But for the rest , they will go to their farms and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gospel to plod his way as best he can . He must not expect them to take time from their worldly employments and unite with him in visiting their brethren , or the poor and needy , or the erring and sinful . He is hired to do that , and the payment of the stipulated salary is considered a discharge on their part from all such labors . He must not expect them to inquire whether his temporal wants are sufficiently provided for , or whether he is able to purchase the needful helps to the study of the scriptures . They have hired him to make bricks . It is no concern of theirs whether he has straw or not . Some very devout spinster will be on the watch to detect the faintest approximation to brilliancy in the ribbon of his wife 's bonnet , and if she should set her newly baked bread in the window to be cooled before being eaten , some neighboring housekeeper in Israel will report it through the parish as a great marvel . But as to entering with warmhearted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the christian pastor and his family , few of our parishes think of it . For lack of such sympathy , many a minister of the gospel carries a heavy heart , and preaches heavy sermons . // The people at large ought to know this , and to act accordingly . They ought to consider that the thousand little manifestations of interest and sympathy , which it is in their power to make , are worth as much to the minister of the gospel , and are as necessary , in one view , as any provision of money . When the members of our churches have reached a more intelligent estimate of . the character of the work given in charge to the ministry than they now have , and when they have reached a higher standard of christian living , they will necessarily see and feel their relations to the public ministers of religion as they do not now . There is yet too much of the Romish idea among us that the priest , so called , is to take charge of our religion for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is to be paid the stipulated tythes . We have not yet reached the practical realization of the gospel view , that all believers are equally priests , and all equally bound , in their sphere and according to their ability , to preach the gospel and to be ministers of grace to the sinful . When we come to that , it will be seen and felt that when one of the brotherhood relinquishes , by invitation of his brethren , the ordinary employments of the world , and the sources*of earthly acquisition , in order that he may give himself wholly to the work of helping their faith , and showing them how to act more effectively for good upon the sinful around them , he is entitled to the amplest pecuniary support , and to the constant sympathy and cooperation of those who belong to the christian society . While , therefore , we would call the attention of our churches to the present unhappy state of things , and urge it upon them to remedy the evil , both on account of its inherent injustice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and incalculable evil to the church at large , and to the world , we would say also to the ministry themselves , that the remedy is , to a considerable extent , in their own hands . If any churches persist in regarding the engagement between minister and people as a mere civil contract , so much work for so much pay , then let them remember that there must be always two parties at least to a contract , and that the one has the same right to fix its terms as the other . If the one party have the right to say how much they will give for a certain service , the other has an equal right to say , whether or not he can afford to render the service upon the terms proposed . And a candidate for the pastoral office ought not to feel any delicacy in determining for himself , upon what pecuniary terms he will undertake the charge of a parish . If the parish put the engagement upon the money footing-as is so often done  --  the indelicacy is theirs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generosity enough to say , " come and serve us in the gospel and we will work with you and see that all your real wants and comforts are provided for , " there is no good reason why his own generosity should make him a sacrifice to their narrow and unsanctified spirit . Yet many are sacrificed in just this way . Under the plea of poverty , parishes will induce men of generous , self-denying spirit , to undertake the spiritual oversight of them with the promise of a salary which , on the face of it , is inadequate to sustain a family in comfort ; and yet , iii the pursuit of mere worldly pleasure , they will often expend more , in money , and time taken from labor , in one single day , than they are willing to give for the preaching of the gospel throughout an entire year . Now we doubt the propriety and even the right of Christ 's ministers to sanction such a state of things , by what seems an unwillingness to put their office on a footing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , it is the right of the ministry also to have a voice in the matter . And by exercising this right , they will do something to place their office ultimately upon a better and worthier footing . A minister 's highest usefulness is greatly dependent , after all , upon the supply of his temporal wants . In insisting , therefore , that their supply shall be adequate , and putting this beyond all contingency , he is really consulting the glory of God , and the interests of the kingdom of Christ , his master . If , then , the professed disciples of Christ composing the visible church are so indifferent to their own spiritual welfare , and to the cause of their Redeemer , as to suffer his public ambassadors to be pinched and hampered and starved , let those ambassadors at least say , that , so far as they are concerned , for the honor of Christ , it shall not be so .                    @
