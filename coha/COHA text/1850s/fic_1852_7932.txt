Whitman , Sarah Helen , 1803-1878 : To a Withered Rose . from To a Withered Rose ( 1852 ) Pale flower  --  pale , fragile , faded flower ; What tender recollections swell , What thoughts of deep and thrilling power Are kindled by thy mystic spell ! A charm is in thy faint perfume , To call up visions of the past , Which , through my mind 's o'ershadowing gloom , " Rush , like the rare stars , dim and fast . " And loveliest shines that evening hour , More dear by time and sorrow made , When thou wert culled ( love 's token flower ! ) And on my throbbing bosom laid . On eve 's pale brow one star burned bright , Like heavenward hope , whose soothing beam , Is veiled from pleasure 's dazzled sight , To shine on sorrow 's diadem . Bright as the tears thy beauty wept , The dew-drops on thy petals lay , Till evening 's silver winds had swept Thy cheek , and kissed them all away .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
