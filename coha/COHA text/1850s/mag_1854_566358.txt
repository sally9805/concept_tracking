txt THE recent publications on the " Sunny Side , " and the " Shady Side , " of the ministry , have presented us with a new and peculiar species of literature . The novelty of this kind of literature consists not in any peculiarity of style , or of the general design , but rather in the introduction of a new theme into the list of subjects , which have been treated in works of imagination . The characteristic of this literature is , that it essays to portray the Christian Ministry with the colorings of imagination , and to combine into one life-like story , the various incidents and elements of experience which shall render the portrait a fair and veritable representation of life , as it is , in the ministry . The judgment of the reading and religious portion of the community has uttered the just decision , that the attempt has been executed with able and skillful hands , and with hearts that cherished a proper and ample appreciation of the work of the Gospel ministry . The artistic execution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , characterized by excellence of a high order . The spirit that pervades their pages is lovely and refreshing . Perhaps few writers could be found , whether male or female , who could have been expected to accomplish the design of these works with greater success than our gifted authoresses have attained . First , in the order of time , we were presented with " The Sunny Side , " which appeared in 1851 . This little volume is * beautiful delineation of a very worthy country pastor , // meeting the ordinary trials of the ministerial office , and sometimes suffering depression of spirits , but always encouraged and aided by the ready expedients and sacrifices of his loving and ever-hopeful wife . Her courage never failed . With a salary of five hundred dollars , and precarious " donation visits , " they found themselves often solely straitened for the means of a comfortable living . But by the expert economy and contrivancy of Mrs. Edwards , they were enabled to struggle through the clouded passages of life , and to give their children a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations , and all but one at the head of Christian families ,  --  that one remained out of the safe enclosure of the everlastino ' covenant , not long after the decease of his sainted mother . *Phe setting sun of t*at pastor and his wife was gorgeous , but on the whole it was a darkened life , with but few outward joys , save those where her own bright spirit gave the light . Next , from the same pen , arrested since by death , appeared a graphic description of the life of a city astor , under the quaint title of " A Peep at Number Five . ' * Mr. Holbrook passes from the theological seminary immediately to the pastoral charge of a large city church ;  --  a young man , of sincere piety , of respectable talents , but without experience or knowledge of the world , sensitive and somewhat ambitious . In his exhausting efforts to acquit himself worthily in the duties of his official position , and , at the same time , eke out an insufficient stipend , he encounters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate and too easily desponding spirit . The cheerfulness of a discreet and loving wife is his solace . At length they are established in the affections of their people , and placed in a condition of outward comfort . It is an interesting story , but one which does not present the ministerial sphere as a very attractive field of labor . After the interval of a few months , a third work appeared , under the sombre title of " The Shady Side , " tracing , with a gifted pen , the simple annals of Parsonage life . The design of the book is thus stated by the author : " It proposes to give a graphic view of life , as it passes from year to year in the country parsonages of our own New England . " The author professes to have avoided extremes , and to have presented a shading of the landscape not darker than the average aspect would justify . The characters and incidents are not dream-like , but drawn from real life , and attest the fidelity with which the design was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personages . We follow them with a cordial sympathy through their strongly-marked experience in these // geographical localities . The incidents of ministerial experience , with which the narrative abounds , though often striking , seem altogether probable and quite common . We can readily credit the remark of a minister 's wife , who is said to have commenced reading the book with the purpose of marking , by turning down the corner of a leaf , each page which her own memory could have supplied , but was induced to stop marking , before she had half finished it , because she said " there were so many corners turned down it spoiled the looks of the book . " There is a charm upon every page that shows the hand of genius , and that serves to fix the attention and touch the heart . Scenes like the death of " Carrie Wood , " or the lingering over the darling 's grave in the churchyard of Melville , few can read without emotion . All is veiled in the best style of description , gilded and illumined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ministry in the author 's own mind , and often expressed in the volume before us . Yet the picture is dark , gloomy , and repelling . The grouping together of so many evils and sorrows , in one pastor 's life , presents , as a whole , a combination which rarely exists . And the termination of that life is an accumulation of trials that requires an effort of imagination to give it a reality to the mind . The author has certainly depicted a large amount of human infirmity and perverseness , in pastoral and parish history , without displaying anything of bitterness or self-righteous asperity . The design of the book is benevolent , and worthy to be considered as amply counterbalancing some defects and blemishes which we may discover in its structure or its tendency . The experiences of missionary life remained to be told , and this phase of the ministry has recently been exhibited in a little work of 180 pages , entitled , " The Prairie Missionary , " and written by the wife of a home missionary , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the form of a journal . It purports to be a true history , and its sketches bear the appearance of actual occurrences , and not of fancy-colored fiction . Like its predecessors , this book , by its graceful , simple style , commands the attention of the reader , while the privations and trials to which the missionary family were subjected , through poverty and sickness , and the want of due consideration and sympathy on the part of their people , make a deep impression on the reader 's heart . This portrait of ministerial toils and tAals is very distinctly marked by the peculiarities *f Western society , in its frontier localities and earliest stages . It exhibits throngliout a heavenly sweetness and meekness of spirit , amidst its sad experiences of injustice and neglect , which can hardly fail to make one 's heart better , in the perusal . // The publication of the volumes has occasioned an animated discussion in the religious journals . We have had " Letters from the Old Parsonage , " depicting , in vivid colors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent times , as seen through the medium of a personal experience , not the most happy in the pastoral office ; and " Letters from the New Parsonage , " detailing trials , indeed , not a few , but animated with a buoyant hope and fervid piety . Varying experiences and observations of clergymen and laymen have been spread out to the public eye . The subject has occupied quite as much of the public attention , yerhaps , as it deserves ; the facts are before the people . Itis to be hoped that some important good will be accomplished by what has been written on this subject , and which seems to us to be justly described , as a whole , by the title of this article " Shady Side Literature . " Our object , in what we have further to say on this subject , is not to sit as critics in judgment upon the literary taste and art displayed in the volumes which we have noticed . The universally warm reception with which they have been received ) attests their truthfulness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among our most distinguished authors . We ad. mire the tone of feeling which pervades the works . We take a lively interest in the events and characters , sketched in life-like proportions , and veiled by an artful licence of description . We appreciate the design that appears to have had a leading influence in prompting the publication of these interesting volumes . We pass from this glance at the character of the works before us , and proceed to offer some remarks on their tendency and probable effects . That there are errors and evils , in a measure latent and unobserved by the masses of the religious community-errors and evils , under the operation of which many pastors have been subjected to severe trials and injustice , and to serious embarrassment in their sacred work ; and which demanded an earnest effort to expose and correct them , is a truth which admits of no reasonable doubt . They needed to have public attention drawn to them , and fastened upon them . Many of them are of too delicate and personal a nature to be handled profitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulpit . They required to be presented in more engaging and striking forms of address , before they would arrest the attention , or make an effectual impression upon the minds of multitudes , who are // apt to imagine that a minister has , of course , a very easy life . There would seem to be no other method , so promising of good results , as that of dramatic description , presenting living pictures of ministerial experience among their people . Hence , there is reason to believe that the works before us will , in some important particulars , be productive of good effects . In the first place , we may notice a tendency in these volumes , so far as they are perused by the people , to improve their intercourse with their pastor , and to render them more considerate and careful of his feelings . The feelings of a pastor are often tried by a deportment or remarks of some of his people , which proceed from inconsideration , and which have a good heart hidden beneath them . Now , the graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude dictation , of selfish exaction , drawn out here and there in these narratives , will naturally furnish hints and start new thoughts in many minds , which will profit by them . The minister of the Gospel is , more than most men , the subject of remark ; his perforinances are often treated as mere matter of criticism , and his character is scrutinized as a fit theme for the exercise of an unbridled tongue . It would be unreasonable to expect that any mere hints or graphic descriptions of its iniquities are to impose any effectual restraint upon the " unruly member ; " but we may rejoice in any agency , which tends to promote a thoughtful appreciation of the circumstances and work of the minister of Christ , and to call forth towards him those expressions of confidence and kindness which he needs more than other men , and which cost but little sacrifice to those who have the thoughtfulness to make them . It is certain that many kind and good people may obtain from these volumes a rich variety of useful hints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastor . If they give heed to them , they will be reasonable in their demands upon his strength and sparing of his time . It is said that Cotton Mather used to have the words placed in large letters on his study door , Be Short , to remind visitors not to intrude upon his sacred labors . We may indulge the hope that the recent " Shady Side " literature will also have an influence to promote the permanency of the pastoral relation . This desirable result naturally follows the truthful disclosure of the causes and consequences of frequent changes of pastor . The fact is beyond a question , and it has been much deplored by the best portion of the churches , that dismissions of pastors are more frequent now than they were fifty years ago . The average length of pastorates has diminished about one-thin in Massachusetts ; and the ratio is // not less , probably , among the Congregational churches in other parts of New England . Where pastors fifty years ago continued eighteen years , they now continue , in the same place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in many cases not more than from three to six years . The consequences of this frequent dissolution of the pastoral relation are evil , to parishes as well as to pastors . A good minister can hardly be dismissed , by the action of his people , without debate and strife-their harmony and peace are broken up  --  the piety of the church is marredthe respect of the people for the ministry is diminished ,  --  and the tone of morals is deteriorated . We have only to look at the usual consequences of the dismissal of pastors to see , at a glance , the deplorable effects . It would be unjnst to charge the blame , in all cases , upon the people . Whatever may be the causes of this great practical evil , it is a symptom of better things , when the evil is exposed and subjected to scrutiny , and when public attention is effectually drawn to the religious aspect of communities , where the pastoral relation has often been dissolved . There is need that the people should be instructed , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pastoral union . It is to be expected that cases will occur where sufficient reasons exist for dissolving it . But the experience of churches and of pastors goes to enforce the recommendation that there should be an honest purpose , on the part of both , to make the union permanent , and an expectation that it will be for life . There should be no intention on the part of either to take any measures for trifling reasons to sunder the tie ; and no provision in the contract between the pastor and the people , that it *na.y be dissolved by either party , giving " three ' * or " six months notice " of their wish to have it dissolved , as if they were more anxious to make a dismission easy than to render the union permanent . The beneficial influence of these popular volumes , and the consequent discussions , is to be sought chiefly in their bearing on the subject of ministerial support . They portray the heavy expenses and the ever-recurring , incidental outlays of a minister 's family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a convincing power , by giving them their proper place and proportions in the course of the narrative . The story fixes the impressions of the ft*cts , and shows the reader where the salary of the young minister has gone before the year is closed , and what economy and contrivances the minister 's wife is compelled to practice , in order to avoid falling hopelessly in debt . Many people , accustomed to live on the income of a farm or a trade , without keeping accurate accounts of their expenses , and without many outgoes for books , periodicals , traveling , or // company , seem to be very slow to understand how a yearly stipend of four , six , or eight hundred dollars , in the country , as the place may be , should be insufficient to afford a comfortable support to their minister 's family . It may be hoped that such persons will come to entertain better views on this subject by reading these publications , and will be more cheerful in furnishing their pastor a liberal support . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people have been turning their attention to this subject , and that the salaries of many ministers have already been increased . This movement is in the right direction . The necessity for such a movement has been waxing imperious for years past . It must be admitted that the salary of ministers now is nominally greater than it was formerly , when , in addition to the yearly stipend of so many pounds sterling , the minister was furnished with a house and a lot of land , or the means to buy one , as a settlement . But the fact which needs to be considered is , that the increase of ministers ' salaries has not kept pace with the increase in the expenses of living , as marked by the wages of labor in other occupations . We hazard nothing in saying that any one , who will make a candid comparison of the salaries of ministers with the pecuniary rewards of other employments at the present day , will acknowledge that ministers , considering the cost of their preparatory education , and their necessary current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men . Here is an evil and an injustice which demands a remedy , or else a retribution to the churches will not linger . Here is a dark side of the ministry , we must admit , which has not yet been shaded.too deeply . It is well for the churches , as well as for the pastors , that the picture has been drawn , and that different portraits , taken from different localities , have been made to this phase of ministerial experience before the public eye . We have no personal complaints to offer in this matter ,  --  no personal experience of injustice in this respect to engender a sourness of spirit . Some parishes have always rendered cheerfully a liberal support to their ministers . Others have done all that they were able to do , and have manifested a warm heart in sympathy with their pastors . But the fact can not be concealed , that most ministers , with families of children , in country towns , are obliged to practice the most ri*id economy to make their salaries meet their expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They suffer , and their people suffer with them , thong* not in the same way . For , if a minister is pinched with poverty , unable to go abroad , and to mingle with his brethren ,  --  if he can not subscribe for a few periodicals , and can not replenish his // library occasionally by adding to it a few new books , his people suffer in consequence of his indigence . There is little excuse , in most cases , for the scanty support of ministers in the older portions of the country . We behold around us unparalleled prosperity ,  --  increase of business and wealth , stimulating the masses , and engaging the energies of men in the way of moneymaking , as never before ,  --  ability for display and indulgence . Worldly callhigs hold out extraordinary inducements . It would seem reasonable that ministers of the Gospel , at such a time , should receive a more adequate support . The laborer is worthy of his hire : " Even so hath the Lord ordained that they who preach the Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as a happy circumstance that the Western Missionary should have a place in this group of pictures . If that simple story has the effect to awaken a more lively sympathy with our Home Missionaries , and lead us to contribute more cheerfully to the treasury from which they are sustained in their peculiar toils and privations , it will have done no small amount of good . There is a tendency of the " Shady Side " literature in another direction , which may well create apprehension ,  --  and that is a tendency to deter young men from devoting themselves to the 6*hristian ministry . Truthful and important as these narratives may be , they are an inadequate representation of the work of the ministry . In expressing this opinion , let us not do injustice to the writers , whose excellent spirit and laudable design are spread over their pages , like the pure light of Heaven upon the landscape , in which its objects are revealed to the eye . They evidently cherish in their own minds just views of the ministry . They are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature and rewards of the sacred office . But they aimed at a particular and limited ob , ject , not , to give a complete view of the ministry . They depict one side of the subject in bold relief , while the other side is of such a nature as to baffle all attempt to represent it in the light and shade of ordinary story . They speak , as the times demand , in the ears of the religious community , to portray errors , and correct evils in the churches , in order to bring about better days in the ministry . Mrs. Vernon , in her dying moments , is represented as saying to her son , " The churches will awake to the value of their religious privileges , and make their pastors more comfortable . " Allison , in turn , opens his heart to his dying mother , and in full view of the shady side , which he had seen already , declares to her that " it is his great ambition to be a good minister of the Gospel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As revealing the same specific purpose of preparing her journal , " The Prairie Missionary , " after describing a touching scene where a little group of six Home Missionary laborers chanced to be brought together , has this record : " I said to myself , do the ' churches know at what price their work is done ? Do those Christians , who sit surrounded by luxury , and out of their abundance give a trifle to send the Gospel to these new settlements , ever dream what sacrifices of health , and strength , aud comfort , those whom they send hither are compelled to make ? If each of these hearts could be laid open , what records of needless and unwritten suffering would be read ? Then came the question , Does Christ call upon some of his children to bear all this , while the great company of professing Christians never know sino'le sacrifice for the sake of the Gospel ? " Now the bt a o , Jec here disclosed is important and worthy of a deliberate effort for its accomplishment. lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poverty , calumny , and ill-treatment of ministers . The story must be told , in order to disclose the truth , and correct the prevailing errors and delinquencies of the churches . The story has been told , and the discussion , which has grown out of it , has turned principally on the peculiar traits attending the calling of ministers , and especially their want of an adequate support , cooperation and sympathy , as a common thing , from the churches . While we would do justice in our estiniate of the noble object and beneficial tendencies of this literature , we ought not ' to be insensible to the danger , which appears from other quarters . It is difficult to treat the subject of the ministry in comparison with other calhings , and the comparison can not safely be pursued very far . John Newton has the remark , which is as full of truth as it is of force , that " the Christian ministry is the worst of all trades , but the best of all professions . " It is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should afford a comfortable living for the minister and his family , the necessities of his library , and of his journeyings being fairly provided for in the estimate . But when it is brought into comparison with other employments with respect to wages and emoluments , the ministry is set at woful disadvantage , and suffers from its false position a serious injury . This iiijury may be unintentionally inflicted . One writer , who speaks as a veteran in the ministry , has said , that " the pecuniary condition of the ministry alone is enough to give us empty seminary walls , and lower to below the medium quality of mind , those who at last consent to preach . " This remark // AS*A ady Side " Literature . 63 may be taken as the representative of the tone and bearing of a class of remarks , with which we too often meet . It gives to the ministry the appearance of being only a trade , whose claims upon the choice of young men may be all summed up and cherished in calculations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be viewed chiefly under this aspect , we might well apprehend that the sacred office would soon be nearly deserted . Some generons spirits , nurtnred in the bosom of selfdenying piety , like Allison Vernon , might still aspire to be good ministers of the Gospel . But many other equally noble minds might be expected to decide , with his cousin Edward , when , on leaving the house of his uncle Vernon , he wrote to his parents thus : - " I do not want to go to College . I know you have hoped I should follow uncle Edward 's steps , but I never shall be good enough to be a minister . And if I were , I ca2not be a minister . I am forever set against it . I have seen too much how they are treated . Dear nude and aunt have done a great deal of good , and they seem to take things-at least auntie does-very cheerfully ; but it is too bad . I could n't stand it . " Here was a conclusion veiled in simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which generous youth might adopt without any fault of reasoning or feeling ; if we are to take this view of the ministry as in simple competition with worldly pursuits and on a level with them . But this is to view it in its most disadvantageous position . It is clear from the history of the church , as it is also from the word of God , that it was never the purpose of God that the incumbents of the sacred office should hold an enviable worldly position , or that they should wax great in wealth and power . In the ancient economy , it appears that God assigned to the tribe of Levi no possessions in the land of promise , but ordained that they should live of the altar at which they served . And the New Testament plainly teaches us that the ministers of Christ have the same right to live of the Gospel which they preach , and may have property , but are not to reckon a lucrative income and secular advantages among the proper privileges of their office . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were it possible to induce the churches to do justice to all their ministers and raise them up from depression , so that there should be none found to complain of stinted salaries , of pinching poverty and want of sympathy , it would probably be very disastrous to the ministry . It would be like making churchmembership , as in former times among m*s , the way to political // office . It would induce mercenary and unworthy characters to enter the holy office and fill its ranks with worldly and unsauctifled men . Distant be the day , when the ministry shall hold ont wordly inducements , in comparison with other trades , to draw young men into it . We would not have ministers feel dependent , as if they lived on the alms and free-will offerings of the people . Their salary is their due . It is , no doubt , too often viewed in the light of a charity . It should be paid as a just obligation as much as a debt to the lawyer , the physician , or the mechanic . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied and comprehensive relations , it presents to the Christian heart , attractions , which are peculiar and superior to those of any other calling . It has relations to God as well as to man . It has substantial and precious elements of happiness , which can not be fairly represented in dramatic descriptions . It is impossible to dramatize them , and set them forth , with all the spiritual interlocutors , so as to have those higher elements make their due impression , side by side with the earthly portraitures of mere human actors . We must not , therefore , set it down as the fault of the writers of these narratives , if their volumes give an inadequate representation of the vocation of the ministry , and have room for a false impression of the sacred office to rest on The author of " The Sha y maiT young and sensitive minds . d Side , ' aware of this difficulty , which is , to some extent , important , in the mode of exhibiting the subject by means of a story , in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in Olney wear too sombre an aspect to admit of many requests of the pastor and his wife , at the prospect of removal ; to which she subjoins this beautiful reply ,  --  " Ah ! then we haVe failed to supply to you what has been present to our own experienced eye sight ,  - -  a diamond vein , running through the whole flinty quarry ,  --  a fring* of golden light bordering every leaden cloud ; gleams of sunshine in the tangled wilderness ; fresh water from the rock in desert sands ; way-side greenness and bloom , all along the dusty thoroughfare ; - and , more than all , vital heat sn used throughout the scene , reflecting a warm glow even where it can not permeate , giving a rich coloring to the rugged , deeply shaded landscape . ' The failure , here supposed , is what we must regard as a necessity inevitably incident to the undertaking to portray , in story , life in the ministry . In order to see it as it is , the " eye sight " must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With its purest joys a stranger does not intermeddle ; they can not be set forth in dialogue , nor painted in story , any more . than the higher elements of the Christian ' 8 // spiritual life . Were the scenes of affliction and sorrow , through which the majority of Christians pass , to be depicted in detail ; were an average experience of trials to be exhibited in a story , and portrayed with a graphic description of trials , wants , sufferings , disappointments , and abuse , it would be a deeply shaded picture . There would be danger that the dismal portrait would have the effect on some to render religion repulsive . This mischief would be sure to follow , if the trials were made to appear as the proper effect of religion , and peculiar to the Christian . Bunyan has depicted in allegory , the Christian life , in a way that has made religion appear attractive . The license of allegory allowed him to dramatize the whole range of Christian 's experience , and introduce celestial messengers and helpers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A story could not do this ; it may convey in abstract statements , all the truths respecting the spiritual experience of the Christian , which are conveyed in the Pilgrim 's Progress . But the abstract statements are unequal in vividness and power , to the narrative of the series of simple facts , which make up a shady side of the Christian 's life . It is difficult for us to conceive , how the purpose to portray , in a written narrative , the shady aspect of the Christian 's lot , in the world , in comparison with other men , could be safely executed . Christian biography has a different purpose to accomplish . It does not shrink from recording the sufferings of martyrs , or any of the varied trials of God 's people . But its legitimate object is to show how the higher resources of religion are adequate to afford support and comfort in the most distressing outward condition . It continues to be true , that " We must through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom ' of Heaven . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians , are not very many . The same remark may be app lied to ministers of the Gospel . Few , comparatively , of their hardships and difficulties are peculiar to them , and chargeable to their office . Other callings have their own peculiar trials . Be a merchant , and you will have trouble . Be a lawyer , and yon will have trouble . Be a physician , and you will have hardships and trials which ministers know little about . Whether you are a physician , a lawyer , a merchant , or a mechanic , if you have mistaken your calling , you will have a double share of difficulty . We are led to anticipate in the nunistry , more than time common lot of trials . We remember the words of Christ to his disciples ,  --  " Ye shall have tribulation . " And , if the trials of such men as Flavel and John Howe , of Baxter and Bunyan , were written out , it would be a sad tale . But it would be far from conveying their deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ministry of reconciliation . They rejoiced in tribulation , and felt that while their path was rough , a hand divine led them onward , and refreshed them abundantly with sweet fruits and flowers by the way side . As you read Baxter 's " Reformed Pastor , " you hold communion with one who mounted above the darkest trials , and could say , " None of these things move me . " His estimate of the ministry as a work for the glory of God , and for the good of souls , is evinced by his language to ministers . " Consider the interest which all the faithful servants of Christ have in their Master 's regards . You are related to Christ as well as to his flock , and he is related to you . Be true to him , and never doubt of his being true to you . Do you feed his flock ? He will sooner feed you , as he did Elijah , than forsake you . . In the midst of enemies he will give you a tongue and wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to his plough , he will wither the hand that is stretched out against you . his faithful , ministers have always had large experience of his care . He who knows that he serves a God , who will never suffer any man to be a loser by him , needs not fear what hazards he runs in his cause ; and he who knows that he is seeking a prize , which , if obtained , will infinitely exceed his cost , may boldly engage his whole estate upon it , and sell all he has to purchase so rich a pearl . " This is the light in which the work of the ministry ought still to be viewed . The narratives and discussions to which we have called attention , have accomplished good ; but they may , in another way , do harm . They may correct some errors , and raise some salaries , and lead to a better appreciation of the toils and trials of the ministry ; but , it would not be strange if some parents should turn from the touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the sons whom they have consecrated to Christ , should bg induced to recall the offering , with the feeling , that they can not desire them to be ministers of the Gospel , in view of such hardships . Nor should we think it unnatural , if many young people should recoil from encountering the trials of the ministry , as they find them portrayed in such striking and forbidding aspects ; and should feel their hearts chilled towards the sacred office , and " forever set against it . " They may have piet*y-piety in the bud ; but they are unable to see how they could bear what they are led to expect , but might never experience , in the ministry . They forget that whatever may be their calling , it is very probable that they will have burdens to bear and labors to perform at times , which , if they could now foresee them , they would think it impossible to // endure . Their piety , if real , is weak , and their spirits are not disciplined and prepared to view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , from station to station , in the warfare , and who find the work delightful and desirable beyond any other . They will dismiss the idea of entering the ministry , and choose pursuits which promise independence , worldly consideration , and affluence . We deprecate this effect . It is a just cause of concern , that few candidates are offering themselves for the ministry-hardly enough to supply the vacancies occasioned by death and loss of health of ministers , while the world is demanding a great increase . Various causes conspire to produce this result . There has been a dearth of revivals in the churches to bring the young into the church . The popular current of the world runs in the direction of making money , and the young are swayed by the common impulse . The church is too easy to yield to this current , and to forget the great principle of stewardship which ought to regulate them in training their children and using their property . The work of the ministry is not the avenue to affluence-it is to be hoped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the solicitations of wealth and worldly honor , to look to other inviting employments , when they ought to feel the motives of the Cross , and choose for themselves , or seek for their sons , the work of the ministry . And now , in review of the whole subject , we would say to young men of piety , if you desire to be happy and useful , go into the ministry . We have the authority of the apostle Paul for this recommendation of the work of the ministry . " If a man desire the office of a bishop , he desireth a good work . " It is pr&amp;minently a good work . It is such as justifies an earnest and irrepressible desire to preach the Gospel , in one who possesses the proper qualifications . It is such in its nature , objects , and influences upon the community , as to be entitled to very high esteem , as a good work . The minister of Christ is a teacher of divine truth . This is his high function . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation . And though he may esteem hi*m8elf less than the least of all saints , yet he ought to magnify his office . He is a preacher ,  --  not a priest , in the Jewish sense or the IRomish sense , to offer sacrifices and grant absolution to the people . He has no power , by virtue of his office , to lord it over God 's heritage ; but he has the promise of an unfailing assistance , while the publishes the word of God . His commanding object is to instruct and save men . There are subordinate objects , which are sought by the ministry , and which are the // inseparabie attendants of its success  --  the growth of Christians in knowledge and holiness ,  --  the promotion of sound morality , and of social and civil order ,  --  and the suppression of violence , injustice , intemperance , and lust . The people of Gluey gradually vain light and thought , as well as more of heart , and Mrs. Edwards , in her last hours , expresses the conviction that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by the influence of the preached Gospel , on the minds of men , that their passions are restrained , and those moral principles are established which are the source of everything lovely and of good report . But the great object of the ambassador of Christ is to persuade sinners to become reconciled to God . It is , through divine truth , to convert and save them . To effect this change in men is his aim . For this he preaches the Gospel ; for this lie counsels the inquiring ; for this he visits the chambers of the sick ; for this he watches for souls as one that must give account . If he is successful in bringing this blessedness upon one of his hearers , how great is the usefulness of his office . In its rewards , the ministry is a good work . It is true , as we have before remarked , that the peculiar station of ministers of the Gospel deprives them of many worldly enjoyments , and naturally subjects them to a life of selfdenial . They have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affluence , or that independence , which attends many other employments . Nor is it desirable that they should have them . But the ministers of Christ have a reward of their labors which is better than rich salaries and worldly honors . They receive no inconsiderable reward as they go along , before their labors and lives are ended . There is such a thing ' as " the peace of God , which passeth all understandino ' " - ii ving smile , they know what this i his appro peace is . They enjoy the noble and divine happiness which is felt when one has " comforted a tempted soul , or brought back a wanderer to the Saviour 's fold . " They e*joyth e pleasure which there is in separating themselves from the world , and intermeddling with all wisdom . This privilege of the sacred office is justly represented in the following passage from Baxter 's Reformed Pastor : " But especially consider what an excellent privilege is it to live in studying and preaching Christ !  --  to be continually searching into his mysteries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contemplating the blessed nature , works , and ways of God ! Others are glad of the leisure of the Lord 's day , and now and then an hour besides when they can lay hold of it ; but we may keep a continual Sabbath . We may almost do nothing else but study and talk of God and glory ; engage in // acts of prayer and praise , and drink in sacred and saving truths . Our employment is all sublime and spiritual . Whether we are alone or in company , our business is for another world . 0 ! that our hearts were more disposed for this work ! what a blessed , joyful life should we then live ! how sweet would the study be to us ! how pleasant the pulpit ! and what delight would our conferences yield . What excellent helps do our libraries afford , where we have such a variety of wise , silent companions , whenever we please ! Surely all these , and more such privileges , attending the ministry , bespeak our unwearied diligence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library have not been diminished since Baxter 's day , unless it be in consequence of the draughts made upon ministers by the benevolent enterprises of our times . These enterprises are not a damage to the ministry . They impose additional labors , and allow less time for study and reading . But they are the occasion of increasing our knowledge . Periodicals , as well as books of a useful character , are multiplied , which a pastor must read more or less , in ( Yrder that he may live in the present , and not in a bygone age , and be informed of the events and changes which are taking place . lie has no time to waste . But it is a privilege to be called , by the nature of his work , to " give attendance to reading , to exhortation , to doctrine , " and to employ time and attention in gathering from journals and 1i*ook8 information , which he may constantly give out to his people . And in this light we look upon ministers of the Gospel as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most others ; because they are men of culture and of piety , engaged in a great and blessed employment , and connected with the people around them by the most endearing ties . " But the reward of faithful ministers is known but partially in this world . Happy , indeed , are those days in which they see their ministry successful in the conversion of those of whom they have travailed in birth till Christ was formed in them . These spiritual children are their reward while they live ; they will be their reward when they meet them in heaven ; they will be their " joy and crown of rejoicing , " from the day of Christ 's coming , onward forever . It was this prospect which supported and animated the apostle Paul , under all his labors and trials , in the vineyard of Christ . Souls saved from death are the hire of the ministers of Christ . Those immortal fruits of his labors follow him to heaven , and surround him in glory . The brightness of his crown will prove that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , and that who // ever desires this work , desires the best work that ever employed the mind , or heart , or tongue of man . The world needs an increasing supply of ministers of the Gospel , and this should be felt by parents in the training of their children , and by young men in making their choice of a profession . The ministerial office needs no foreign aid to recommend it . iVlioney can not procure such ministers as we want , if we had " all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them " to offer . If promising young men are turning their attention unduly to other callings , some may ask , What is to become of the ministry ' ? Who will desire the sacred bifice ? The answer is , Those who desire a good work for the sake of a good work ,  --  those who make God their end , and desire the honor of Christ , the welfare of the church , and the salvation of souls , will undertake the ministry . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as religion lives ,  --  as long as the church stands . Secular advantages it may not have to draw men into it . Men who are led by the desire of emolument , ease , or honor , to preach the Gospel , are the worst spirit*ial guides . The work of the ministry will always recommend itself to pious and faithful men , who will esteem it a privilege to plead the cause of Christ and promote the salvation of sinners . They will desire it . They will say , " Necessity is laid upon me ; yea , woe is me , if I preach not the Gospel . " To the young minister , there may be in reserve a fair allotment of outward comforts . Let them be received with thankfulness , as gifts which his kind Father has placed in his path . But they should not be his great inducements to draw him onward in his work . The secular benefits of study , learning , culture , refined society , should be held quite subordinate in anticipating the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children after the pattern of the Gospel , and to fit them for the ministry , should , we think , train them to covet for themselves hard service in the cause of their Redeemer , rather than an easy life and earthly distinction . Let them be ' taught to regard the outward circumstances of life , important as they may be in ti*emselves , as lying far in the back ground in comparison with the reward and honors which the Lord , the righteous Judge , will give to them that make full proof of their ministry and turn many to righteousness . We want , in the rising children of the church , something of that spirit which was found in Dr. Morison before he went to China , when he wrote , " If I knew what spot in the world is more dark and desolate than any other , I desire to go and preach // Christ to that people . " The service of Christ is a warfare . It is a service to be desired . Its rewards are sure to every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus Christ . "
