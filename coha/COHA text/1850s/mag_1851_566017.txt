The manner in which the subject is discussed , is not , however , the same in all of them , nor do they lead the reader to precisely the same conclusions . The Report first in order , reviews at some length , the history of the colleges of this country , investigates the measure of success with which they have accomplished the objects for which they exist , and their relation to the wants and demands of the community at the present time . The conclusion at which it arrives is , that these institutions require important modifications , in order to realize the highest use fulness , and to meet all the demands which may justly be made upon them . It recommends to the Corporation of Brown University the particular too ( lifications which should be adopted in that institution . These changes have since been made , and the institution , in its altered form , has commenced its first academical year , under " the star of its new destiny . " the project or advertisement of the Cleveland University informs the public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened upon the same l ) rinciples as are set forth in " the Report " just noticed . It tells us that at the head of each department of knowledge " an able Professor will be placed , whose duty it shall be , to peifect the students , &amp;c . " In the next sentence it adds , that " in all these courses , popular leettires are to be delivered , of which not only the students , but multitudes of the community may profitably avail themselves . " " The object of this system of instruction will not be to carry the students through // a multitude of studies , without his thoroughly mastering any one of them , but to perfect him in those he does study . " It pmposes to dispense with the necessity of erecting buildings for the residence of students , " in accordance vith the plan of all the German , and many other of the most celebrated European Uni* versities . " In connection with the above , it informs the public , that the laud , to buy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after reserving a sufficient quantity for the uses of the University , and " for manual labor purposes , " " the remainder may be sold in city lots so as to realize a sum as high as from $120.000 to $150 , OuO , for the endowment of Professorships . " The discourse of Pres. Woolsey WcS delivered the 14th of August last , one hundred and fifty years since the founding of Yale College , to an audience of nearly a housand of her living graduates . It is principally historical , giving a rapid review of the history of the College , and is accompanied with a valuabb appendix . The author , after reviewing the course of one of the oldest colleges in the country , thus sums up the results of this retrospect : " And xviii not this historical sketch he admitted to have shox n great chan e and progress in our College affairs ? Of proofs of change indeed the whole history of the College has been full . Whether we compare the usages of the olden time with those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the means by which improvement can he effected , or the standard of scholarship , or the number of officers employed in educating , or the numbers educated , everywhere we see change marked and sweeping ; so that lie , who should join together in his mind the first period of the College at Saybrook , or even its first are at New Haven , with the actual state at this day , without knowing the transitions , might reasonably doubt its identity . The*e changes , moreover , must be regarded as progress , not as a backward course . For not only have they been introduced in order to come nearer to the best standard of education ; but they have justified themselves by the confidence of discerning persons , and by increased numbers and efficiency . " " It is sometimes said by persons who look with a jealous eye on colleges , particularly on their social and political infiuepces , that they are immovable institutions , conservative of knowledge elsewhere useless and forgotten , op .. posed to new scicnce , to the practically useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have laid before you , fellow *raduates , suffices , if any thing were needed , to show how unjust and one-sided are these allegations . True it is that colleges are not apt to think that Of old things all are over old , Of good things none are good enough , ' nor to overturn instead of repairing . A confession of past failure and ill-success , such as that implied in revolutionary measures of destruction and renovation , is not apt to be made by them , or to express their convictions . But then the changes , great as they may seem if measured by the contrasts of centuries , are no violent nor sudden ones : they are such changes as time with his gentle irresistibleness works in whatever is not made but grows ; in states arid churches , and all things which live not by infusion and propping up but by inward energy . If the past may be our rule ofjudging we shall have such changes still . They will come , as they have come , through enlightened men // Feb* Reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their walls . But far be from us those changes which instead of ingrooving themselves in forms becoming obsolete ' tear and snap in twain ; those which break up the flow of College history ; which sever the connection with past science and with the world of the past ; which render the venerable forms of grey antiquity less venerable ' to the scholar ; which make a gap in the long procession of science upon which a , es have looked as spectators , and inspire the student with the conceit that he is not at all a transmitter and a torchbearer , but rather one of a new ' race the creators and sole possessors of knowledge. - pp. 72-74 . The discourse of Pres. Chapin , compared with that of Pres. Woolsey , is interesting from the striking contrast of the cir* cumstances under which it was delivered . The first and youthful President of one of the youngest colleges at the West , modestl'y* yet ably defends the old system , from the recent objections whi h have been urged against it , and clearly exposes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education are in many respects , like theories of medicine . The newest is likely to attract attention , and to find abundance of imitators . As theories of medicine are tested by time so are theories of education . The result of their actual working , when fairly tried , is the most satisfying and decisive test of the claims of both . This is a cogent reason for leaving the question between the new arid the old , without discussion , to the decision of experiment , and the arbitrament of time . There is a reason more cogent , however , which compels us to discuss the claims of both , when discussion will be of any use , and to anticipate by satisfactory reasoning , so far as we can , what will be the result in fact . False theories in medicine are very costly to human life . The experiment of fact is only determined by the sacrifice of multitudes of living men . Unsound theories of education are equally costly to the noblest part of man . They result in the imperfect or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter into no defense of the old system . We are content to leave it to the decision which time has passed upon it , and to the confidence which the experience of past generations naturally awakens in the minds of the generation now living . Nor do we wish to attack the new system . We respect the reputed author of this " Report " as well as the gentlemen who have with him subscribed to it their names . So far as the weight of their experience , or the authority of their opinions is concerned , we are content to leave these to their natural influence . So far , however , as this is an argument , designed to establish certain conclusions , and founded upon alleged facts and reasonings , so far is it open to strictures and questionings , and these strictures are invited by the somewhat confident and positive manner in which the argument is conducted . * " Let the change which comes be free To ingroove itself with that which flies . " - Tennysofl. // The conclusion which the report aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued in Brown University , has failed to attract a sufficient number of students to support the college , and has also failed to give the education which is justly required by the present state of the community . If the argument were directed to this conclusion only , we should feel that the affair is entirely private , and that with it neither we nor our readers have any particular concern . But in order to establish this conclusion , it was deemed necessary to prove that the colleges in New England generally , are in the same condition , and labor under similar defects . The argument is directed to this general conclusion and has this general bearing . The question which we propose to discuss is this , do the facts and reasonings that are adduced actually justify this conclusion ? The arguments are arranged somewhat informally , under the following heads . " The system of University Education in Great Britain . The progress and present state of University Education in this country . The present condition of this University . The measures which the committee recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The subject of collegiate degrees . " Upon the first point it is said , that the founders of the New England colleges , being graduates of the English universities , took these institutions , or rather a single college in a university , for their model . After a very general , but so far as it goes a correct account of one of these colleges , it is added . " We however varied in many respects from the original idea , and it must be admitted that our changes were generally for the worse . " And what are these changes " for the worse ? " " We required residence in a college edifice , and thus assumed the whole superintendence of students ; but our buildings were constructed with no reference to this object . Our officers were at first like theirs , a president arid tutors , but the president did not live in college , nor , when professors were subsequently appointed , was provision made for their residence . " After stating also that we gave our colleges the power of conferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Report proceeds : " The result of our departures from the original idea has been in every respect unfortunate . In the first place , we assume the responsibility of a superintendence which we have rendered ourselves incapable of fulfilling ; and we have lost the humanizing effect produced by the daily association of students with older and well bred gentlemen , so obvious in an English college ; and , in the second place , we have expended almost all the funds appropriated to education in the construction of unsightly buildings , we had almost said barracks , for which , perhaps , the highest merit that can be claimed is , that they are not positively and universally a nuisance . " - Report , p. 10 . The only changes " for the worse " that are here specified , are two ; the fact that the students , though required to live in a pub // lic building , do not reside in a quadrangle , of which the outer windows are grated , and that the president and professors do not reside with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masters of the English colleges , when married , do not reside in the building in such a way as to give to the undergraduates the " humanizing effect " of intercourse with their families that professors were hardly known in the New England colleges till one hundred and sixty years after Harvard college was founded , about the time of their alleged decay ; and that the tutors have , in all cases , resided with the students , occupying chambers in the public buildings , and in most cases , eating with them at the commons table . In respect to the first , that of erecting buildings which do not secure any superintendence over the students , we can only say that these buildings do not indeed secure the superintendence of a prison , but we deny , altogether , that the fact that they were not built in the form of a quadrangle , and furnished with grated windows , renders thetn titterly unfit as an aid to the reasonable supervision which may be and is exercised , when students reside together . That these buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the change " was " for the worse . " " That the highest merit that can be claimed is , that they are not positively and universally a nuisance " we deny , affirming that they save the parents enormous bills for rent , which would be a " nuisance " indeed , if these buildings did not exist ,  --  that they afford a means of supervision which is most important ,  - -  that they tend to create a common feeling , an esprit du corps which , rightly directed , is most desirable , and that were it not for the 1 ) arsimony of the public , the rooms in these buildings would be almost universally preferred by students themselves . We would ask also , whether it is true , that in consequence of this alleged defect of superintendence , the manners and morals of our students are inferior to those of the students of Oxford or Canibridge , of equal age , and similar domestic training . The points of residence in a public building , ' and in contact with the instructors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sweeping statement , that our changes have been " for the worse . " As to the course of study , it is not contended that this was changed for the worse , indeed , it is affirmed that " we adopted the unchangeable period of four years , and confined the course of education almost exclusively to Greek , Latin , and Mathematics ; adding , perhaps , a little more theology and natural philosophy . " * * * " The studies pursued were Latin , Greek , Mathematics , Natural Philosophy , and Locke on the Understanding , while some attention was generally given to Theology and the Hebrew language . " We ask here how much Greek was studied in these colleges before the Revolution , and even down to 1800 ? How much Natural Philosophy before 1740 , one hundred years // after Harvard college was founded ? How long was Harvard college founded before " Locke on the Understanding " was written ? Was not logic , both in theory arid practice , one of the principal studies in these colleges down to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to be hypercritical , but it strike us as somewhat singular , that the course of study , if unchanged , should be introduced at all under the bead of changes whether for the better or for the worse , and that it should be so broadly intimated that this course of study in 1640 or in 1700 even , consisted only of Latin , Greek , Mathematics , Natural Philosophy , and " Locke on the Understanding , " and that this was copied from the English universities . The author of this report evidently had his mind fixed on two leading ideas , first , that the colleges were in a given condition just before the American Revolution , and secondly , that these colleges were modelled , course of sttidy and all , after the English universities , arid did not advert to the fact that from 1640 to 1775 , the world had made great advances , that Natural Philosophy had been called into being , " Locke on the Understanding " had started the long succession of imitators and opposers , and that these changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study in the American colleges , than upon that of the English universities . It seems also in place here to ask , if these changes in respect to buildings , were " for the worse , " which we by no means admit , were no changes made for the better ? Was not that a great change for the better , with which the New England colleges first started into being , and accord ing to which , the students were subjected to daily examination or recitation by their public tutors , a practice which has not been fully established to this hour in the English and Scotch universities ? And is it not true that this feature was adopted from the English schools , as Eton and Westminster ? We have puzzled ourselves somewhat to answer the question why these remarks on the system of university education in Great Britain were introduced at all , and what bearing they have upon the argument . At one time we thought that we had discovered the answer to this inquiry , in the passing remark which was designed to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whom the Report was written , that " the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were , as it is well known , established mainly , if not exclusively , for the benefit of the clergy . They were ecclesiastical and monastic institutions . The course of study which they prescribed was designed for the education of priests , " &amp;c . This opinion was strengthened by the remark in the same strain , th t the colleges in New England gave great attention to theology and Hebrew , " inasmuch as a large // portion of the students were designed for the ministry . " We reasoned thus , the argument which it is designed to found on the relation of our colleges to the universities must be , that as both these classes of institutions were constructed for the special training of the clergy , they are of course unfitted for the wants of the community at large . But when we were told on the very next page that these colleges , founded on the model of monastic institutions , when in their highest perfection and glory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen , and diplomatists , in the intellectual struggle that preceded the Revolution , shrunk not from doing hattie with the ablest men of the mother country , and won for themselves , in the contest , the splendid eulogy of Lord Chatham , the noblest of them all ; the same men who , when the Revolution was accomplished , framed for us , their successors , the Constitution of the United States , perhaps the most important document that the eighteenth century produced , " we verily thought , that if these monastic and clerical seminaries could train men for services of such various and splendid renown , they might , as schools of training even now , with the four years ' course of Latin , Greek , &amp;c. , be the best for general education that can well be devised . But this conclusion would spoil the argument , and would leave unexplained the reference to the universities of Great Britain . We pass from this , however , to the second topic or head of argument ; " The progress and present state of university edtication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they kept to the model of the English universities , with all their " changes for the worse , " we are told , " were eminently successful . " The reasons alleged for this success are , that " the course of study was limited , and time was allowed for deliberate investigation of each science . The mind of the students was suffered to invigorate itself by reflection and reading , and hence , with far less perfect means than we now possess , it seems to have attained a more manly development . " The cour*e of study was indeed limited . The Latin authors regularly recited in Yale College before 1800 , were Virgil , Horace , Cicero 's Select Orations , and Cicero de Oratore , little more than is now required for admission to the institution ; the only Greek regularly recited was the Testament , not so much as is now required to enter . A small class , studied for the Berkeley scholarship , additional Greek and Latin . The mathematics were taught from inferior compends . What were the sciences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not appear , unless logic were such an one , which the present generation has been taught to ignore , and therefore to despise . More time was indeed allowed to the student , than at present , to use or abuse . Some of this was used by the industrious , to " invigorate themselves by reflection , " but it will hardly // be argued from this fact , that we ought to give the students greater leisure , in order to return to the golden age of academical perfection . The truth is , these statements will be regarded by the graduates of those days with perfect wonder . If it is indeed true , as it may be , that their minds attained to a more manly development than those of more recent times , it will not be ascribed by a single individual of them , to the fewness of the studies which they pursued , nor to the greater time which they gave to them , but to the greater earnestness of the life which they lived , and the greater simplicity of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherein consisted actual success in life . The severity of manners which then prevailed , the respect which was paid to age and station , and which put back the period of entrance upon independent manhood till nearly the age of forty , made all the previous experience of life a kind of subjection and pupilage . The actual influence of men of wisdom and age in reproving temerity , in detecting sophistry , and in smiting down arrogance ,  --  as well as the absence of the means of passing off superficial for real knowledge , that are now furnished in reviews , popular lectures , and quack systems of education-all these influences combined , prolonged the period of education long after the days of graduation , and made the essays of years at the bar , in the pulpit , and in the senate house , to be a continued education , leading to a manly development indeed . We are glad to see the principle recognized for once in this report , though it would seem almost inadvertently , that the true end of education is the manly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a given amount of knowledge , which may be requisite for the art or science by which a man earns his bread . We are pleased also to notice the concession , that a system of training which is said to have been designed for the education of professional men and of the clergy particularly , produced men adequate to any exigency , and to the most novel and trying circumstances to which men are ever called . But the argument proceeds . " With the present ceuttiry a new era dawned upon the world . " The resources of a great country were to be developed by the mind of the people aroused to new energy . rp0 develop these resources , science was needed to direct labor , and for the science required , the people looked to the colleges . But this science was not to be found in the system of instruction already prevailing in the colleges . Virgil , and Horace , and Homer , and Dernosthenes , could not train men to survey laud , to construct roads , to build and navigate ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' This , we are told , C ' was an important crisis in the history of collegiate education tn this country . To remain in its present condition was impossible . Every one conceded that a knowledge of those sciences on which // success depends in the various departments of active life , must be communicated to students in our higher seminaries of learning . " If by the higher seminaries of learning , be intended the colleges already existing , very few have conceded that these colleges could or ought to attempt to give the knowledge of these sciences , to such an extent , as is here implied . Very few have thought that the colleges ought to be so modified as to profess to give such knowledge . Bnt the colleges , we are told , found themselves in a dilemma , in conseqnence of these demands . They ought to have said , we can not do this work in four years . We will , therefore , either extend the time of study , or will make it optional with the student to select the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorongh instruction , as far as he goes . But they did neither of these things , but crowded all these new sciences into the space of time already fully occupied , " by curtailing every other that may have been previously tatight , thus increasing the number , and teaching every one less perfectly . " " The time of study was not extended , but science after science was added to the course , as fast as the pressure from without seemed to require it . " This is the representation . We do not deny that there is a semblance of truth in it , just enough to enable us to idenufy the caricature . If it is true , that the colleges have introduced more studies than they could thoroughly teach , it has been by admitting in part the very false assumption that pervades this report from beginning to end , that the college is bound to qualify a man fully to discharge the duties of any profession , which he may choose to follow ; that it is a school of special , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show that it is true to but a very limited extent . The fact is not even adverted to in the report , that during the interval described , the preparatory studies have been more than doubled in amount , so that some of the students who now enter college know more of Greek , and nearly as much of Latin as the best scholars who graduated fifty years ago , and that as fast as time has been lost by crowding in the sciences at one end of the course , time has been gained , by crowding out studies at the other . Nor is this all . It is the testimony of all who are competent to judge , that in one college at least , and we speak of one because we can speak with confidence , nearly all the studies which are now pursued , are prosecuted with greater thoroughness , enthusiasm , and success , than at any previous period , that during the last twenty years there have been striking advances in these respects , arid that the examinations for entrance and during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are encountered with a thorough preparation which were never before eqtialled . We speak here only in comparison with what has been , not at all in respect to what is desirable , or may be attained . // The consequences of this new order of things , are then depicted . First , it is argued that it is quite impossible " that the work that is marked out in the course of studies in any of our colleges can be performed in four years . " In support of this it is alleged that " the course of study in the English universities " " is extremely limited , " and yet those who are candidates for honors are obliged to study industriously , and frequently in tensely " ' while we impose " three or four times the amount of labor " upon our students . The course of reading for a degree in an English university is indeed limited , so limited that to impose ten times the amount upon one of our students , would not be excessive , but the amount of study requisite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arena , is far greater than that which is exacted from our students . The two amounts are very different ; to substitute the one for the other , and to leave the impression that we impose three or four times the greater , * is an inadvertence , which , if it were intentional , would be a sophism of the grossest character . But this method of study is affirmed to be unfortunate on the mind of the student . " The student never carrying forward his knowledge to its results , but being ever fagging at elements , loses all enthusiasm in the pursuit of science . He studies not from the love of study , but to accomplish a task . He learns to cram for a recitation , or for an examination ; and when the last is over , his work is done , and he is willing to forget all that he has sttidied . It gave him no pleasure , it has yielded him no fruit , and he gladly dismisses it all from his thoughts forever . " Is this representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe , the complaint with the students through the greater portion of the college course , is , not that they have too many sttidies , but that they are perpetually drilled in the same round of Latin , Greek , and Mathematics . We do not deny that the actual operation of the college system on the mind of many students accords with the descriptions It is not , however , the fault of the system , but it results from the imperfection of youth . It wot1ld not be cured by a change in the system , or by the introduction of one that is new . It must be outgrown by the enIt may be said , that the examination for honors is confined to but few books , while our colie*es require a great number . We rcply , a philologist may spend years upon years in mastering a single book , and the mathematician may do the same , in applying to new prohlems the principles of algebra and of fluxions . The question is , do we impose more studies than can be thoroughly learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted in the most positive manner . To these positions and confident assertions , we oppose the undeniable fact , that in the German gymnasia , from which the German students graduate at ahout 19 or 20 years of age , a greater number of studies is pursued than in the . *merican colleges . The objection will not be made , we presume , that these studies are not thoroughly taught . // larged experience and the wiser head of the mature man . The students of our colleges are youth . They have the chafing impatience under present duty , and the eager enthusiasm to grapple with future and unknown tasks , which are incident to youth . They vote all present rules , and languages , and sciences , and examinations , and instructors , an offence and a scandal , and glory in that blessed future , when they shall roam in the floxvery fields of knowledge , and every task shall be a pleasure , and every science shall he learned as easily as a song . The temper of youth is the same , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gerniany , the college of France , or the colleges of America , except perhaps in the university that is at Providence and the one that is to be at Cleveland . By-and-by they outgrow this view of tasks , and examinations , and instructors . When they enter the university of Germany , or the professional school of America , and the powers matured by painful drilling , begin to rejoice in the exercise of the strength which they have acquired , and the student begins to feel that his livelihood and success have to do with the knowledge he gains , then study seems to be a different matter . Then do we hear not so often , complaints of the system under which they were trained , as regrets that they did not fag harder at the elements , and did not master more thoroughly their text-hooks , and drudge more faithfully for the recitation of that , which , if its acquisitions had not remained , would have left something far better , the capacity to use the intellect with ease , and vigor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this training . All of our colleges teach Greek and Latin , but where are our classical scholars ? All teach mathematics , but where are our mathematicians ? ' It would be sufficient to answer on the principles of supply and demand ' which are assumed in this report , that the demand for scholars in this country is very limited , and we ought not to expect a very ample supply . The fact is , that there are scholars in this country , both classical and mathematical . If it be said in the spirit of the quotation from Mr. Ticknor , that our colleges have not made them such , we answer that these colleges have never professed to complete stich a training . Their course of study and the time at which they take the student , both render it impossible . The American college occupies the ground midway between the gymnasium and the university on the continent . It is gross injustice to complain that it does not do the whole work of the latter . Besides there is another and more serious difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early youth , that makes the scholar in the sense in which the appellation is used by Mr. Ticknor . The college can not do the work of the nursery and the preparatory school . If it occupies the ground of the two last years of the gymnasium , or the collegiate // schools of England , and the work of the earlier years has not been thoroughly done , the deficiency can not be supplied . Sir Robert Peel composed Latin verses with fluency at the age of thirteen . Boys are trained in Germany to compose Latin well at an earlier age . The few accomplished classical scholars that have been trained in this country , have been from their boyhood , drilled in Latin and Greek . These young men have graduated at our colleges , but they did not find that the instruction there received was not scholarlike , but are forward to confess the benefit of the discipline which they encountered . But they were forced to perfect their training abroad . ' What if they were ? We can not but regret that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the colleges do not do all which may reasonably be expected of them ; least of all , does it prove , that it would help the matter or tend to create scholars , if the colleges should assume the functions of academy , gymnasium , and university , united . But the colleges have not supplied the demand for civil engineers , which has been very great . ' So also the demand has been great for military engineers , for educated machinists , and naval constructors . Does that prove that the colleges as such , ought to train all sorts of engineers , machinists and ship builders ? It would be in point to show that the mathematics , so far as they are pursued in them are not thoroughly taught , and still more in point to prove that the special attainments in the practical sciences which are made at West Point , are not purchased at a great expense to the general culture of the student . Another point , on which great stress is laid in the conduct of this argument , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deserted by the community have resorted to the expedient of cheapening their tuition by raising permanent funds , in order to increase the number of students ; that notwithstanding these efforts , the number of students has been diminishing in proportion to the population ' ; and that this proves , they do not furnish the education which the community requires . It is very positively asserted more than once , that these colleges till very recently have been self-supporting institutions . This statement is very extraordinary , and it can not have been written , with a vivid recollection of the minute and frequent proofs of the contrary which are furnished in the history of Harvard and of Yale . All the public buildings of these colleges have been erected by means of private and public benefactions . Permanent endowments for the support of the officers have been provided in part , from the earliest time . Yale College receiv edan annual appropriation of a hundred pounds from the state , for more than fifty years . The salaries of some officers have been paid from the state treasuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly been given , either to pay off the debts of these colleges , or to provide for particular necessities or to go into a general fund . The effect of all these donations and we may add their avowed object was to cheapen tuition for the public good , that more persons might be enabled to receive a liberal education . It is true , that the method of realizing this object by raising funds to be specially appropriated to the use of the indigent and meritorious , was a thought of more recent times , but the effect of these funds , is so far from cheapening tuition in general , that it rather sustains the ordinary price to those who can afford to pay it . But we are told that these funds were raised , because the means of the colleges were diminishing . The means of colleges are always diminishing , i. e. , its capital stock being derived from the benefactions of the public , must be now and then replenished , as new buildings , new books and new apparatus are required , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that this expedient was devised because the number of stndentswas falling off , and the treasuries of the colleges were becoming empty , seems to us to be idle affirmation . This class of funds were primarily the fruit of religious zeal . They were first raised to defray the expenses of students for the ministry . Afterwards they were enlarged to meet the *vants of all those that are meritorious and indigent , that the public good might be promoted thereby . But the authors of this report would have us believe , that it was because inducements to enter the learned professions were becoming far less , and those to enter the active professions far greater . Nay they would persuade the public , that it was to reduce the price of tuition , in order to draw students to a particular college , when there were not students enough for all , that these funds were primarily contributed . We can not think that facts will warrant a single one of these representations , and we are at loss to understand , how they should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the report proceeds . The colleges finding their customers leaving the shops , might have provided themselves with wares to attract a large numOer , or they might have altered the system of education to suit the demands of the community , but this they did not choose to do , but rather forced the community by appeals to their generosity , to pay the expense of the commodity which they did not need . ' Whatever competition or feeling of rivalry may have existed among the colleges of New England we believe to be owing to the fact that more of these colleges were founded than were really required . Local attachments , religious or denominational preferences , have occasioned this multiplication of their number , with its disastrous and depressing influences upon the cause of sound learning . These local and // religious preferences united to a strong desire to do the public a service are sufficient to account altogether for the readiness with which these funds were raised , without the fancy of a supposed alarm , at the diminution of the number of those who desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilemma , two courses were again open before the colleges . rPl*e first was to adapt the article produced , to the wants of the community . Inasmuch as a less number desired to enter the learned professions , and those who were entering them , did not , in many cases , prefer this mode of preparation , the sources from which students were supplied to the colleges seemed to be drying up . But here were large and intelligent classes of citizens who needed education , though not such education as the colleges afforded . These institutions might then have been at once modified , and their advantages ext*ended , not to one class , merely , but to every class which needed a scientific and liberal education . In this manner , they might probably have been enabled to support themselves . the other course was to appeal to the charity of the public , and thus provide funds by which the present system might be sustained . The second course was adopted . " But was not the first course also attempted ? No one who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years since in two or three of the leading colleges of New England , will hesitate for an answer . But what was actually done , and with the actual result , has been so well described by Pres. Wayland himself in a previous work that we can not do better than to quote his own language . " It has been said that the course of study in our colleges was formed in a remote age , and that it is adapted only to a state of society very different from our own . Specially has it been urged that the study of the classics is at best but useless , that it has no relation to our present duties and every day engagements , and that the time devoted to it had much better be employed upon the study of the Modern Languages . Besides , it has been said that our collegiate course should extend its benefits to merchants , manufacturers , and * We can not refrain in passing , from remarking upon the following statements . " It is a remarkable fact , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tW teolleges are the only corporations intrusted with funds , either by public or private liberality , which are not required to make an annual exhibit of their property and the mode in which it is appropriated . The receipts and disbursements , even of a mite society , are always made public , but of the colleges in New England , there is but one , i. e. , Harvard , which publishes its Treasurer 's annual report . " The authors of the report were not aware that the Treasurer 's report of the funds in Yale College is required to be made public every year to the Legislature of Connecticut , who can print it or not as they choose and that it is also printed for the use of the Corporation and can be had by applying to the Treasurer . This mistake may be trivial but it seems to us that the most scrupulous accuracy is desirable in collecting data for inferences as important as those of this document , and especially in using them to the real if not the intended disparagement of institutions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens . These persons desire the honors of a degree as much as others . They do not however wish to waste their time in the study of the classics , and therefore the studies required of the candidate for a degree should be accommodated so as to meet their reasonable wishes . It was predicted that as soon as this change should be made , our colleges would be crowded with those who were anxious to avail themselves of these advantages and to obtain the honor of a degree . " In obedience with these suggestions a change was made some years since in the studies of some of our colleges . Both a classical and scientific course were established , the first requiring the study of the Learned and the other substituting in their room the Modern languages . Teachers were engaged , classes were divided , each student had his option , and all who wished were invited to become candidates for a degree upon these modified conditions . But what was the result ? No one came to accept of what was thus freely offered . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from mere inanition . " Very much the same course has been pursued in regard to the higher mathematics . The same objections were made to this branch of a liberal education , and it has been proposed to substitute in their place the study of history or of natural science . To a considerable degree this experiment has been combined with the other , and with very much the same result . The colleges so far as I know , which have obeyed the suggestions of the public , have failed to find themselves sustained by the public . The means which it was supposed would increase the number of students in fact diminished it , and thus things gradually after every variety of trial have generally tended to their original constitution . So much easier is it to discover faults than to amend them ; to point out evils than to remove them . And thus have we been taught that the public does not always know what it wants , and that it is not always wise to take it at its word . " - Thoughts on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayland. 1842. pp. 12 , 13 . To the justice of these last remarks we fully subscribe , and it xviii require more argument than is afforded or suggested in this report , to prove that the material and fatal dofects that marred these efforts of the colleges to please the community was that this " popular and practical course , " as it was called , was extended through four years and was rewarded with the usual academical degree . But to return to the argument : after stating the dilemma in which the colleges found themselves , and the mistaken course which was adopted to escape froni it , the question is then asked what success attended these efforts , in the three following particulars . " Has the present mode of supporting the existing collegiate system , increased the number of educated men in New England ? Has the standard of professional ability been raised within the last thirty years ? Have our efforts in this direction increased the number of the ministers of the Gospel ? " In respect to the first question , we remark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of educated men has increased , but whether the quality of the education received has been improved , and this though answered in part under the second of the questions proposed , is not wholly determined by a correct answer even to this last . Many of our educated men do not now enter the professions . Of those who do not enter the professions , a considerable portion are our very best trained scholars . // But in order to answer the first question , whether the number of our educated men has increased , the report gives us the statistics of the number of students in the Nexv England colleges , at intervals of four years each , from 1830 to 1850 . During this period our population has greatly increased , a general interest in education has increased also , and large endowments have been bestowed upon the colleges , and xve ought to expect that the number of our students should bear at least as great proportion to the number of inhabitants , in 1850 as in 1830 . But in point of fact we find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , while in 1849 there was only one in 14,080 . ' On this calculation we have only to remark that those persons who judge of such matters by figures alone , might perhaps reflect , that other causes come into consideration , which greatly affect the number of students in our colleges at a given period , as the given commercial prosperity of the community , a great degree of which has a tendency to withdraw students , a less degree to increase them , and a still less degree to diminish them again . During this interval also , a large foreign population has come into New England , each thousand of whom if they can do nothing else for the argument of the report , or the cause of education , can at least figure in its columns of statistics , and thus argue strenuously against the college system . During the same time , the relative proportion of students who come from out of New England to its colleges may have been increased or it may have been diminished . The prosperity of the Baptist college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result at Brown University and at Newton . Or if the question is to be decided by statistics , the commonest maxims applied to inductions of this sort , should at least be observed . One of these is that a longer interval of tune than twenty years should be selected . Another is that notice should be taken of the fact , whether or not , during the period tak&amp;n there was a steady tendency in the direction of the final result . Neither of these rules has been observed in this case . The interval of time is not long enough to be made the basis of any inference of this kind . Nothing is more easily proved , than that for the last century and a half , the number of students in the colleges of New England , has borne no steady proportion to the number of inhabitants . At one time the colleges have been full for several years in succession . At another the classes are smaller . Let an advocate , who wished to establish any conclusion whatever in regard to the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last century , take periods of twenty years , of each of which the beginning should show a few larger classes and the termination several classes that are smaller , or the // reverse , and he might make figures prove whatever he should choose . rJlhe second of these rules has been violated very grossly . From 1830 to 1844 , three-fourths of the time , there was a steady increase , from an aggregate of 1560 students to one of 2063 , an increase of nearly thirty-three per cent. , which was more rapid than that of the population , while it is only from the accidental diminution in the remaining five years that these sweeping conclusions have been induced , which are set forth as the failure of a plan to resuscitate the colleges , which plan itself is nothing but a figment of the inquirer 's brain . We pass to the second question , concerning the consequences of this unfortunate condition of colleges and of collegiate education . " Has the standard of professional ability been raised within the last thirty years ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then an assertion that is wholly irrelevant if it were true , al ) d winds up with a conclusion in which nothing is concluded . The random guess is expressed as follows . " It is however , we think , a very general opinion that the average of professional talent is declining . " The assertion , which if true , has no bearing on the argument , is that the " productive professions " attract young men away from the learned professions , and enable them to rise to the highest stations in society , which " would indicate that the professions certainly had not advanced as rapidly as society around , so that relatively they had retrograded . " Whether the professions have relatively retrograded in the public estimation is one question , " whether the standard of professional ability has been raised is quite another . " The conclusion in which nothing is concluded is this . " But without pressing the argument further , it will probably be conceded , and this is sufficient for our purpose , that no noticeable effect upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts which we have made to reduce the price of tuition in our colleges . " We believe that the standard of professional ability has on the whole been raised within the last twenty years . The period is too short , to authorize us to expect a very noticeable improvement , but we believe in some of the professions it is distinctly visible . It is true the circumstances of society have been such , that quackery and charlatanism have been successful , and sometimes conspicuously so , particularly in the medical and the clerical professions , but we are not aware that the reduced price of tuition in the colleges , or the influences which have emanated from the colleges have had anything to do with this result . Rather do we believe , that it is because the colleges and the training imparted at the colleges have had so little influence in guiding and correcting the popular judgment and taste , that this charlatanism has been so successful . // The last question is , " have our efforts in this direction increased the number of the ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics upon this point . It is found that there were nearly as many theological students in the seminaries of New England from 1830-34 as from 1845-49 , and it is concluded that the tendency of this system of giving away an education is not to increase the number of clergymen . We trust the clerical signers of this report will not think that we claim any originality for the suggestion , that it has been thought by very respectable authorities , that certain influences , usually denominated moral and religious , have somewhat to do with determining the choice of the clerical profession , and with the increase of the numbers in that profession . The writer recollects the fact that in a college class consisting of eighty-one members , at the beginning of the senior year , not more than five had any thought of studying for the ministry , xvhereas three years after their graduation , it was known that more than thirty had commenced theological studies . We yield all deference to the calculations of political economists , and we believe that the principle of " supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which it may properly be applied . But we do not believe that , given much or little money , the result will be more or fewer clergymen , any more than we believe in the rule , that given the old or the reformed colleges , the consequences will be seen in the diminution or the increase of the same class . In view of the alleged failure in these three particulars , under the alleged-which in our view is entirely a fictitious-cause , that the funds were contributed , in order that tuition might be reduced and students might be increased , the report thus expresses the conclusion which it thinks justified by these premises . " We are , therefore , forced to adopt the other supposition , that our colleges are not filled because we do not furnish the education desired by the people . We have constructed them upon the idea , that they are to be schools of preparation for the professions . Our customers , therefore , come from the smallest class of society ; and the importance of the education which we furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this class . We have produced an article for which the demand is diminishing . We sell it at less than cost , and the deficiency is made up by charity . We give it away , and still the demand diminishes . Is it not time to inquire whether we can not furnish an article for which the demand will be , at least , somewhat more remunerative ? - Report , p. 34 . In farther support of this view , a long extract is given from the report of the commissioners appointed in 1830 by the Crown , to examine the universities of Scotland . This report expresses decidedly and pointedly an unfavorable opinion of the influence of the bursaries in those universities . The commissioners say that these bursaries are too numerous , and bear so great a // proportion to the number of the really indigent , that they attract students to the university who have no fitness for the professions , by the simple hope of maintenance , and that the effect of so large a number of inferior scholars is to lower the standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may he true . When the funds in our colleges are large enough literally to pension and maintain students , as do the Scotch bursaries , and more numerous than there are worthy applicants , the extract will he appropriate . We *onld suggest that it be reserved for such an occasion . We come now to the third head of inquiry , the consideration of the manner in which Brown University has been affected by the changes which have been taking place in collegiate education in New England . We shall offer no extended remarks or criticism upon this part of the argument . If the Corporation of Brown University think that the college is suffering greatly from a diminution of students or for a want of funds , and think moreover that the only way to obtain more students and to earn more money , is to change the system it is no concern of ours . If they think , in mercantile phrase , that in order to do a larger business it is xvise to do another kind of business , we shall not interfere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New England , they will devote their buildings , and funds , &amp;c. , to an education that is not strictly collegiate , they must do as they think best . They may become an academy , a real school , a gymnasium and university , all in one , or they may add a department for instruction in any art or trade whatsoever , for this is a free country . It is only when to justify themselves , they attack and depreciate the whole collegiate system , and respectfully yet really hold up all the colleges to popular prejudice and contempt , that we shall hold them accountable to show the reasons why , and shall take the liberty to criticise the reasons which they offer . There is one point in this argiliment , however , which we can not comprehend . It is said that it would require an additional fund of $50,000 to enable the college to go on successfully and pay its expenses well . It is proposed to raise $125,000 to enable it to do a remunerative business , and become a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old plan , it would pay its annual dues , only it would do it on the basis of $50,000 as capital . We can not see how the addition of $75,000 more to this capital is fitted to render it self-supporting , unless this is to be converted into scrip , to be repaid with interest after the new or self-supporting system shall have beet-i in operation long enough to earn surplus profits . That however is not suggested . The scrip would constitute indeed a new kind of fancy stocks . // The next head of argument is " the measures which the committee recommend for the purpose of enlarging the usefulness of the institution . " These measures are briefly as follows : The fixed term of four years , or any other term , is to be abandoned , and every student is allowed to pursue as many or as few courses of study as he he may choose , subject to certain limitations . Every course of study , when once begun , is to be continued without interruption till it is completed . No student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustain his examination , in all the studies required for the degree , but no student shall be under any obligation to proceed to a degree . The advantages which it is expected will result from these alterations are the following : It will add to the number of students , because , 1 . * course of instruction will , it is hoped , present a better preparation for the learned professions than that pursued at present . This class of pupils will not be diminished . 2 . Those who wish to pursue a more generous course of professional education , can remain at college five or six years . 3 . Many , who wish to enter the professions , are unwilling or unable to spend four years at college . This class would form an important addition to our numbers , and we should thus , in some degree , improve the education of a large portion of all the professions . 4 . Most of the studies pursued in college , if well taught , would be attractive to young men preparing for any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected in these courses of study from those devoted to agriculture , chemistry , or science applied to the arts . These expected consequences are all presented , it will be seen , in the form of reasons why the number of students will be increased under the new arrangement . This fact , of itself disindines us to discuss the merits of the new system . But , inasmuch as the old system is distinctly and positively depreciated in the comparison , we hope it will not be deemed out of place to offer our own views upon the one as compared with the other . We object to the new system , because it throws away the advantages which are peculiar to the college system and to a collegiate education . What is a college ? A college , as its name imports , is a collection of students , who , from beginning to end , pursue together an appointed course of study . What are the peculiar advantages which result from an education at college ? These do not result from the fact , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of science in which he might perfect himself or that in one or all he makes ureater attainments than he might under other circumstances . Under a private tutor , he might attain to very great eminence in every one of these studies , with the aid of his particular inspection and // constant drilling , he might , in the same time , become a more finished scholar in every branch of study . Nay , at an academy , or a high school he might go over the same ground , and apparently with greater thoroughness than many students do at college . Or , he might , in a large city , attach himself to different classes in different branches of study and selecting the best professor in each branch might derive very considerable advantages from the stimulus furnished by his associates . In this way his progress might be very rapid , and his attainments very great . But he will still lack the peculiar advantages of being educated in a community of youth , who start from the same point , are carried over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college system receives its inmates for the period of life when the habits , intellectual and moral , are formed . They are received when passing out of boyhood , they are discharged just as they begin to be men . They are not too old to receive new impressions with freshness , to enter upon new enterprises with excited ardor , and to submit themselves to unpleasant tasks with a dogged energy , and they are not so young as to forget the impressions which they receive , and to outgrow the habits which they acquire . During this most important and hopeful period of life , they are met by the same corps of instructors , each in his turn ,  --  a corps numerous enough in a well-manned college , to prevent them from being formed after any one-sided and imperfect model , and to secure every desirable form of intellectual culture and excitement . Under the same course of study , from day to day , and from year to year , they watch the development of each other 's minds , with observation sharpened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take note of any striking improvement , and with feelings wakeful enough to be most deeply excited and instructed by all these various impressions . They meet each other , after each day , in chapel , at the place of recitation , on the play-ground , at one another 's lodgings , and in variOus voluntary societies , for the noble strifes of excited intellects Never afterwards in life , are they brought in so close and so long continued a contact with so many minds , under circumstances of so great interest . There is but one period of life xv hen such excitement and such impressions are possible . Hence has it been in this country most extensively true that the discipline of college life is always remembered , that a xvasted college life is always deplored , that college acquaintanceships are never forgotten , and that the college who does her duty to her sons , is regarded as the alma mater of their noblest life . The course of study is , we believe on the whole , xvisely selected , and best adapted to train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , and of acting as they think . These are in the highest and most rational use of the word , practical // men , and the studies which train them , are practical studies . We know that in this report it is often asserted and more frequently implied , that our colleges were originally designed and are exclusively fitted to prepare men for the professions , which design it is more than once very confidently intimated , they do not realize so well as other institutions-so that if we are to believe this report , they are not very good , even for this object , and by consequence are very well fitted for no purpose whatever . The supposition in our view is wrong , that they were designed or are exclusively fitted for this object . They are fitted to train men for all the duties and offices of life , not in the special art or profession which is to occupy the chief attention of the life , but in that general enlture which an education in a profession presupposes , and which a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truly practical man . For these reasons the course is not special in any department . It does not consist exclusively of Latin and Greek , for its aim is not primarily to train philologists , but to give to the mind familiarity with language , and thought as expressed by language , and in the way which long experience has proved to be the best practical training for this peculiar and most important instrument and accomplishment. lience though the ancient languages may be disused and partially forgotten , their effects remain . It is not confined to the mathematics , for an exclusive education in the mathemnatics is a onesided and narrow education , while in their place the mathematics give a singular strength and discrimination to the mind , and above all , teach the habit of severe and consecutive application . Nor does it consist principally of the physical sciences . These sciences , grand and glorious as they ate , can not be understood as sciences by any mind that has not learned to reflect , and to apply itself severely to other subjects . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may in a sense be mastered , they are not comprehended as sciences , their grandest laws are reduced to facts for the memory , but are never principles for the reason . So far as they consist of facts , they can be learned from private study , by one who has a tact for them , and if the mind has been already trained , far better in the study or the laboratory , than when passively imbibed from the lips of a lecturer . To these are added logic and rhetoric , and the laws of the mind , and the principles of morals and politics , as furnishing the rules of thought and expression , with their application to sciences with which every thinking man is conversant , and on which every educated man must practically have principles , and know how to express and apply them . These studies are imposed upon all the students , in tasks which are to be completed at stated intervals , and to the acquisition and recitation of which , the entire energies of the college community // are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those educated at college , have reflected on the peculiar advantages which result from a system of tasks enforced by the strong and severe pressure of college machinery . The mind is awakened to an energy of which it had not dreamed . It learns to concentrate its powers upon a given duty , and to accomplish that duty in a given time . Obstacles that would seem mountains under a voluntary system , are as mcAe-hills under a system that is enforced . Indolent and listless habits are shamed or driven ought of sight . Self-indulgent excuses vanish before the stern necessity of duty , as she holds up the certain penalty of loss of reputation , or open mortification . Such a course may be censured by indulgent fathers and fond mothers , aa cruel and stern , but it imparts a manly vigor , a sturdy self-reliance , and a ready self-command , which can not be secured by any voluntary system . Whether a man is to be qualified for the business of a profession , or what is called the business of life , he leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the stock and strength will never be too abundant . The system proposed in this report , fails to secure these advantages , and so far as it fails to secure them it is open to the most serious objections , and labors under fatal defects . It does not educate its pupils in a community in that peculiar and important sense which we have described . Its classes do indeed form communities , but these are liable to be changed and broken , while , if certain of their members do go on for a course of years in the pursuit of a single study or of more , it is not with that peculiar interest in each other which characterizes a college community . Into these classes new and incongruous elements are liable to be introduced at any time , with evil consequences . The students in the regular course , who give their attention to the various subjects which make up a liberal culture , are vexed and chagrined by the dazzling exhibition , which a few stars in philology make , ( if indeed under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blest with a classical scholar , ) who give their sole attention to the classics . Or , on the other hand , while the regular students in rhetoric are pursuing that study with the advantages which they may be supposed to enjoy from the superior training of years in the other classes of so distinguished a university , they are forced to receive as competitors , a band of new recruits , fresh from the plough , who have satisfactorily passed their examination in " Green 's English Grammar . " The students in logic or intellectual philosophy , encounter a youth fresh from the head of a country school , who has figured as the champion of a village debating society , but who is guiltless of other culture and knowledge . // The plan is liable to the very serious defects which must attend every system of optional studies . An elective system of studies might be a great desideratum , if the election could be wisely made , or if it could be entrusted to the hands of those competent to choose in view of the capacities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide according to this system , the courses which the student is to follow ? The parent . And what are his means of deciding in regard to the advantages of Latin or Greek , of which he is ignorant entirely , in respect to the favorable influences of which on the training of any one , he will be very skeptical , especially if he has read this report to the Corporation of Brown University . But suppose he decides wrong , and the boy finds it out , as he will be very likely to do , when the Greek becomes hard , and the mathematics tedious . He must go on , says the new system , but how loncr ? Surely the Faculty will not be so cruel if the pupil proposes to stay five or six years , pursuing various courses of study , to drag such a reluctant youth through Xenophon and Greek composition and Thucydides and Sophocles and Aesehylus , with the analysis of Greek verse , with the expectation that " he shall gain such habits of close grammatical analysis , and acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as shall enable him to pursue the Greek language with pleasure and profit when he shall have left the walls of college . " * The principle of elective studies once recognized-especially in the hands of those who hold the views of the objects of education which are avowed in this report , will lead to change and inconstancy , which will cheat many a boy of the very discipline which he needs all the more because he does not like it , and the want of which will make him an intellectual bankrupt through life . The fact is , that a course of study must be imposed , by those who are competent to make the option and upon those who are not competent to decide for themselves . Otherwise but few will choose aright . After a course of imposed study has been finished , and the student has learned to know himself , and also to know that disagreeable study may be for his greatest advantage , he may be trusted to select either a course strictly professional or special courses in the physical or moral sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much to hope from young men or from many of their parents , that they will decide for themselves on precisely the studies which are best fit * An examination of the catalogue of Brown University , for the first term of the first year , under the new system , furnishes the best comment on the above . Of the undergraduate students , of four years standing , there is not a single scholar in Latin or Greek . Of those of three years standing , forty-two or rather thirty-five in all there are thirteen scholars in Latin , and not a solitary pupil in Greek . // ted for general culture , and pursue them just as long as will but secure this end , and that then they will fall into those departments , to which they need to give special attention . This leads us to remark , that all the real advantages which this system proposes to attain , may be secured in a far better way , We* admit that there are not a few in the community , who xvish to pursue a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied chemistry and in engineering , &amp;c. , who can not , or who will not , pursue a collegiate course . It is important that provision should be made for such students , and this can be done more successfully in connection with colleges already existing than elsewhere . these are the centres of science already established . They present libraries , apparatus , professors , and all the numerous appliances which may be found at a well provided college . It is proper and desirable that as an appendage to its regular course of study , philosophical schools of this sort should be opened , to which admission may be had , by all who desire to study , with no special requirements for admission except those necessary to enable them to pursue their studies with advantage . Students of this class can readily obtain access to the lectures and libraries of the college proper . They can even receive special instruction in classes by themselves , from the professors of each department . All this . is reasonable , and it meets effectually every demand that is felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being at Cambridge , another at New Haven . Both these were already in successful operation before this report was written . The signers of this report had probably heard of the Lawrence Scientific School , possibly also of the Philosophical Department at Yale College and yet not the slightest allusion is made to either , whereas both were designed to meet the want which the report describes as so pressing and so entirely unprovided for . At Yale College another object was contemplated , viz. , to induce graduates , to pursue special studies in philology , history and natural and intellectual science . We are ' happy to state , that this part of the project has been in some degree successful , though the number of students who have been desirous to avail themselves of special instruction , has not been so great as to show that the zeal of young men to study the classics , &amp;c. , to a very great extent , is sufficiently aroused to warrant the hope that large institutions like the philosophical departments of German universities , can be opened with success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet come , and the colleges that for the sake of the name and appearance of such institutions , shall admit all students with all degrees of preparation from Green 's English Grammar upward , to swell the numbers of those who attend upon the prelections of the professors , may possibly end in degrading the college into an academy . // If then every advantage which is contemplated in this report can be received in connection with the college system , and the abandonment of this system must be attended with very serious evils , we can see no reason why the plan proposed should be adopted . It may be objected indeed that the colleges which have provided this supplementary course do not propose to make scholars so accomplished and perfect , as is promised in the new course at Brown University . Perhaps these colleges think it better to perform than to promise . The last subject in the report is that of collegiate degrees . The report argues that the system of B. A. &amp;c. , has no common significance throughout the literary world . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of study - which is different in each university-that in the Scottish universities they are given after residence and attendance upon lectures , but with little or no examination . In this country , " it may be taken for granted that unless a young man be remarkably dull or incorrigibly negligent , if he enters college and pursues the prescribed course , he will be admitted to the degree of A. B. " " Did the sign accurately correspond to the thing signified , it would be a well earned , and therefore a proper distinction . But it is universally affirmed that this is not the case . It is said , that out of the number of our graduates in this comitry , many can not translate their diploma ; others are ignorant of the elementary principles of mechanics , nay , that many of them can not write the English language correctly . " From all this it is argued , " if academical degrees actually signify nothinr " that it is right to give the degrees of B. A. , not only to those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for an amount of knowledge equivalent to the Latin and Greek , which are omitted ; and it is proposed to admit no one who does not pass a bonafide examination . We remark upon this course of argument , that though the amount of knowledge which is possessed by the poorest of those who receive a degree is small enough , yet it is hardly so small as is here represented . it differs however in different colleges . We have heard that there are colleges in the country , that receive students at all stages of the course with a very slight examination , colleges in which elementary studies are pursued in the Junior class , and which gather into their classes an agglomeration of all sorts of material which they turn out upon the world as I3accalanrei . Graduates from such colleges might make any representations of their own knowledge and of that of their associates and with truth . We know of a college in which the examination for admission is somewhat trying , and from which many every year are rejected , and in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 136 Reforms in Collegiate Education . to graduate . It is easy to promise to make examinations thorough , and to give no testimonials except upon actual attainments , after a severe trial . Every college faculty promises this . Every board of legal , medical , and theological examiners promises this , when they are not tied to forms , and are not tempted to be satisfied with a simple residence , and yet in point of fact examinations are too often superficial . The Faculty of Brown University are honorable men , but we do riot like to have them promise too stoutly , that all their future graduates shall know all and as well as a graduate ought . " Let not him that girdeth on his harness , boast himself as he that putteth it off . " We shall not argue the questions of propriety and right which are naturally suggested by the proposition to alter the terms , or the studies according to which the usual collegiate degrees are given . We choose rather to present the views of one of the soundest scholars as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored New England . In the year 1829 , the Faculty of the University of Vermont , of whom Dr. James Marsh was the President , submitted to the public " an exposition of the system of instruction and discipline pursued in the University of Vermont . " The system was in some of its features like that proposed in the report before us . It provides that students should be admitted to any classes of the college , for any length of time as they should choose . On the subject of degrees however it expresses the following views . " Were our estimate of the value of ancient learning less than it is , and did we believe that a fair substitute for it in a liberal education could be found , our opinion of the propriety of insisting on an acquaintance with it as a prerequisite for a degree would not be altered . It is unnecessary to inquire into the origin of academic degrees or what they originally signified . That they have a pretty determinate meaning now , is well known . Saying nottiing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every scholar knows to be different from those in our country , it . is bere presumed universally , that the person who receives the degree of Bachelor or Master of Arts has pursued to a considerable extent , a course of study comprising important portions in the principal parts of the general circle of arts and sciences . Among these the study of the ancient languages has been considered as occupying a very important place . This being understood wherever the degree is known , with what propriety can a widely different meaning be given to it , except by common consent among those institutions ( or at least a majority of them ) who have the right of conferring this degree ? If one college may without any violation of the implied rights of the republic of letters , at its individual pleasure , lay aside a knowledge of Greek and Latin as re ( luisite for a degree , surely another might with equal propriety cease to require a knowledge of the pure mathematics beyond the elements of common arithmetic-another dispense with every thing belonging to the science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call an equivalent of something else . " * * " The whole bearing of the procedure in question , if countenanced , will be we think , to render a degree of no value because it will be a sign of nothing specific . What its possessor has been studying , or what he might know // must be left to conjecture or ascertained by examination . Must not the result of the whole be an unfavorable opinion abroad of the standard of scholarship in our colleges , and an actual lowering of it at home , the injurious effects of which on colleges and the community must be great indeed . If the colleges agree to throw aside all degress , very well . In that case every man proceeding from a college must he examined by those who would be informed of his scholarship . If degrees are to be iven as sureties of scholarship of a determinate kind , it is all-important that they mean alike . " * " We think these are important considerations , having a much wider scope than an increase of students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and th ' t they can not have been weighed as they should be , by those who have been engaged in such innovations . " - System of Instruction in* I e University of Vermont , pp. 8 , 9 . Thus far have we followed the argument in this report somewhat minutely for ourselves , and perhaps tediously for our readers . Its conclusions may be true , but we do not think they are proved by this argument . We might stop here , and leave the discussion . A few thoughts , however , suggest themselves in respect to the principles and the spirit of this report , which we can not forbear to express . We think it unfortunate , if not unfair , that no distinct recognition is made of the principal causes of the defects of our colleges . We are as sensitively alive to these defects , and as desirous to correct them , as the authors of this report can be . We do not desire to conceal or deny them . But is it not true , that the colleges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of the community ? Why is it that the colleges do not give a more complete and finished education ? Is it not because the great majority of students enter , with inadequate preparation ? Arid to what is this owing , if not to an eager arid excessive haste , to push through college into professional or active life ? Let the colleges do their utmost to raise the standard , let the united efforts of the rapidly increasing class of thorough teachers be strongly and steadily directed against this h'ste , and they both contend against an adverse and powerful current . Let the colleges seek to detain their choicest graduates within the circle of " quiet and cloistered studies " to mature and ripen the fruits which have been hastily gathered , and how few can they detain even for a year-how few of those who have wealth , youth , a literary and scientific taste all united . And why is this except that they are carried forward by the same pressure , to a profession , to a position in life , or to miscellaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical uses of each day 's acquisitions must be made apparent , or they are made with reluctance ; the instructions must be rhetorical , or they are counted dull ; and the student instead of cultivating his own garden , with patient trust in the wisdom of those who have gone before him , too often imitates the child who ever and anon pulls up his plants to see if they are likely to take root and grow . For all this // there is a cause , an adequate and a most efficient cause . That cause is in the mistaken judgment of the community . We are a young country . Mature and symmetrical scholarship , scientific precision and logical acumen , are not our most pressing wants . We have no learned class of gentlemen and scholars strong enough in their social position to give law on such a subject , or shedding about them so conspicuously the grace and lustre of a finished culture as to invite multitudes to the source from which they in golden urns drew light . The government , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high attainments at the university with valuable appointmens and a permanent livelihood . All these influences in the form of " demand " for scholarship do not exist . Why should a larger " supply " l ) e expected and why should the colleges be called to account so severely , for the imperfect success they attain in the ungrateful task of supplying the community with what they do not " wish " but sadly " want ? ** Why did not the authors of this report expend a little of their surplus dexterity in argument , and a small portion of the ingenuity , of which so much has been required for their purpose , in the simple and straight-forward duty of telling a plain story to the community concerning the injury which their mistaken views inflict on the colleges , and through them , upon the country ? Take one of the principal points of argument , the evil which is claimed to have resulted from the attempt to study so many of the practical sciences . This report might , in commenting on this point , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be taught in our colleges , and how ill-advised was the pressure which was obeyed , perhaps by giving too great a portion of time to mere facts , and experiments , and illustrations . But , instead of doing this , its whole bearing and effect are to justify and increase this unwarrantable feeling on the part of the community . It impels and excites the expectation that the graduates of colleges should become adepts in the sciences and their application to the arts , before they leave the walls of college , and it justifies the demand that the colleges should make them so . How much more wise , and just , and true , would it have been to tell them that the business of the college is to train men in the ability to learn these sciences , and then if they are to be specially prosecuted , the work is easily and quickly done . We desire to say one good thing of this report , however . We thank its author for calling attention to the fact , that the number of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their share of time is disproportionate and excessive . We think it is // true . The reniedy we propose , is not that any of them should cease to be taught , but that they should be taught in a manner more severe and scientific . We wonid have the laws and principles of physics , in all their branches , set forth with great thoroughness , from manuals as brief and condensed as possible , with a sufficient number of oral lectures to give the whole life , and point , and interest ; but those facts and applications which may just as well be read as heard , we would leave to the student to collect for himself . Principles , definitions , and laws , are the glory aud beauty of the wonderful sciences of nature , and the more severely the student is tasked to study nature in the light of her laws , the more truly will he master these sciences , even if his preseut store of facts be few- . He should never be allowed to feel , by any of the exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension , or be released from the stern necessity of close application . We are surprised also at the tone of the allusions to the professional classes , and the views expressed of the education which is best fitted to qualify meu for the professions . Especially are we surprised , in view of the fact that this argument is addressed by so many professional men , to those who do not belong t othe professions . It is never in good taste for men of one class to make insinuations to the disadvantage of their own associates , and it strikes us that this offense is especially aggravated when the class addressed are so unfortunate as to have enough of illfounded prejudices already . We are surprised in this view at the assertion , so often repeated , that the colleges were primarily disposed to train men for the professions , and that so wide an opening is left for the inference , that of course they can be suited to train men for no other pursuit whatever . We contend , and there is nothing in this report which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why a college education is suited for professional men , is because it is necessary that one be well trained as a man before he is trained for his profession : The general discipline , which is a pre-requisite to a special apprenticeship to the law , or medicine , or theology , is not so important , because the studies which it exacts have a close relation to what are called the learned professions , as because it tasks the mind by efforts that are best adapted to give it acuteness and energy , and because , also , it elevates it by those liberal studies which give refinement and grace . This is the best education for every man , who has time and money to bestow upon a culture so desirable , before he studies his profession , whether his profession is to be that of a merchant , a mechanic , a scholar , or a gentleman . We can not divine what the report intends by lending its sanction to the opinion which it represents as very prevalent , that the colleges do not furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it intends that inasmuch as this opinion is held it is well to profit by its existence , even thou gli it be a mistaken and prejudiced opinion , we could easily understand the use of such an argument for such a purpose . To suppose , however , that the gentlememi whose names are given to the public , intended to employ the arts of third-rate politicians , especially in appeals to one of the basest of prejudices , those of the uneducated or the half-educated against the liberally educated , is a supposition that we can not admit , even though we are at a loss to account for a remark so reckless and unproved . We do not believe this opinion to be well grounded , by whomsoever it may be held , nor do we believe it is held by any person who is capable of forming an opinion on such a subject . We do not believe that there is a professional man in the country who was not educated at college , who does not deeply regret that he was deprived of this advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts , all their lives long , to supply the defects which they are conscious are oxving to this deprivation . Nay , more , we believe it to be the candid opinion of the most intelligent merchants and manufacturers , that other things being equal , the man who has been well trained at college , if he will submit to the additional training which is required for any practical department of life , will outstrip the rival , who has not enjoyed such advantages , in quickness , self-reliance , and success . We say other things being equal , for that many students , educated at college , are awkward and unsuccessful in practical life , is true , and it is also true , that without such an education they might have been still more unfortunate . We may also be allowed to express our surprise , that such a style of remarks , or rather insinuations , are indulged , in respect to the study of the classics , we quote a single example : " If by placing Latin and Greek upon their own merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the education of civilized and Christianized man , then let them ' give place to something better . They have , by right , no pre&amp;ninence over other studies , and it is absurd to claim it for them . " To a certain class of minds this remark would be very acceptable , we do not doubt , but they are not the class of minds to whose prejudices we should be overproud to minister . We had supposed that it was a question settled long ago , for such men as the signers of this report , that the principal advantages derived from the Latin and Greek classics , are not the actual knowledge that is gathered from Latin and Greek books , nor the ready suggestion of etymologies , nor the facility at apt quotations . To such minds , we had supposed that the disuse of reading Latin and Greek by too many of the graduates of our colleges , though in itself greatly to be regretted , was not the most decisive of arguments . But it seems we are mista // ken . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention is made of that subtle discipline of the intellect , which is necessarily involved in the acquisition of any language , and most of all , in the study of languages , so clear , and philosophical , and well articulated as are the Latin and Greek . To our minds , this advantage is sufficiently obvious and imprrtant to deserve to be ranked among the practical results of classical study . The English universities are spoken of in a manner not at all agreeable to our feelings or our sense of justice . The English universities have faults enough to serve as themes for sober argument , and for grave objections . We are at a loss to understand the taste which directed the selection of the passage of coarse carricature , which is selected from the Edinburgh Review , " to relieve the tedium of a dry discussion , as well as to illustrate the tendency of a system of education , raised by great endowments above the control of enlightened public opinion . " The humor is not of the highest order , but we can easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a class of people whose opinions are not the most " enlightened " in respect to all " endowed " universities . All institutions have their Mortimer Plantagenets and their Theophilus Mudges . We should not be greatly astonished , if some of the masters of arts who shall have mastered the six years ' course of Latin and Greek curn annewis , at Brown University , and even have taken lessons in theoretical and practical " didactics , " should be quite unable to govern a country school . Nay , it would not be a prodigy , an absolute lusus nature , if a " Bachelor in Philosophy , " who had studied nothing but the sciences in their practical applications to the arts , when put to building a bridge , or draining a swamp , should prove himself utterly incapable of applying any science to any art whatsoever . We have said that the English universities have their faults , and are open to well-grounded complaints . rJ7he discussion of some of their faults , in a candid and correct spirit , would have been altogether in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare , if not to argue , their many and incontestable excellencies . It would seem that a scholar , with a scholar 's sympathies , and a scholar 's generosity , wotild delight to acknowledge the many obligations under which the whole English stock are laid to these seats of accomplished culture , these fountains from which so much that is noble in the character of the English gentleman , has been derived . To rely upon the testimony of a single partisan article , in the Edinburgh Review , as a principal witness against the English universities , is sufficiently naif  --  to introduce such a specimen of humor , is , to say the least , not in the best taste . It seems to us also , that a very false view of the object of education underlies the whole of this report , and is continually assumed // to give force and point to every one of its arguments . We have rarely seen a more obvious and j ) ersistent misuse of the word practical , as applied to the subject of education , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explicitly asserted , in distinction from the opposite view , we should not be so offended . Its power to do injury results preeminently from the fact that it is not defended but assumed , that it is not clearly put in contact with the nobler and more correct signification of the word , but quietly used in its place . The correct statement of the question would , of itself decide it . T he attempt to defend the narrow view of these gentlemen would lead them to abandon their own cause . A practical education , in the sense generally assumed in the report , is that which has an immediate and direct relation to practice . if a man is to be an engineer , he ought to study the science of engineering , and because he is to practice the art . Forasmuch as the mathematics must be studied , in order to learn the science of engineering , the study of the mathematics is for him a practical study , because it is an indirect btit necessary means to his end . For the same reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional man , because he now arid then has occasion to read musty Latin and Greek ; but it is of no practical use to any one else who does not read Latin and Greek authors , and of no use to even the professional man who disuses the reading of these languages . There is another and better use of the term . That education is truly practical , which trains a man to intellectual power of thought and experience , and which gives a man facility in applying this power to new acquisitions and new applications of old and new knowledge . Whatever conduces in the highest measure to this end , is a necessary portion of a practical education , whether it is remembered or forgotten , whether it is directly used in the actual service of life , or whether it is used only as the power and skill are used to which it has formed the man . Never was there a man who insisted more sternly than Arnold , that education should be practical ; never a man who measured all its value by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the boys in his sixth form had ventured such an interpretation of the word as is here employed , we should have feared lest his cane would have been suddenly called into requisition . Or if one of his former pupils had written word to him from Oxford that he could not pursue the study of Aristotle because it was not practical , he would have mourned over him as a perverse and degenerate son . The reforms proposed in this report , have been hailed by many well-meaning men , as promising to introduce a higher style of scholarship into our country . Soon after its publication , the public were assailed with echoes of its doctrines , and certain of our // educated men seemed to be excited by the discoveries that the college system of fixed classes , and long lists of studies , could not be expected to teach anything thoroughly . Now we shall have scholars , was a very general cry , for have we not introduced the true German system of lectures , attended by those students only who feel an interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scholar selects only a few subjects , and gives to them his sole and undivided attention ,  --  the system under which the professor is dependent for his living on his fees ? It was forgotten that the German student enters the voluntary system of the university at nearly the age , and more nearly at the standing , of the graduates of our colleges . Previous to this , he must have gone through a course of more studies than do our college students , a course which is enforced upon all by rigorous discipline and concluded by a severe examination . It was forgotten , too , that the great majority of the students in the German universities are students in the three professional departments of law , medicine , and theology , while those in the fourth or i ) hi losophical school , are principally those who are qualifying themselves for some part of instruction , as professors , teachers , or authors . The reception of this report , and the ready acquiescence in its doctrines among some intelligent men , is another indication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the wrong end , of laboring at the superstructure before we secure the foundation . Our scholars hear of the prodigies of German erudition , and are smitten with an ardent and worthy desire not to be outdone , and so instead of asking how they begin in Germany , they only inquire how they finish ; instead of imitating them in the school and the college , they copy after the university , and vote the school and the college to be antiquated and imperfect , quite inadequate to satisfy the aspirations and to meet the wants of the new style of American scholarship . Nay , they admit into this new establishment , one express object of which is to elevate the attainments , arid to give room for the large desires , and noble ambition which are now enkindled-they admit into it a herd of pupils of every grade of attainment , to attend upon the instructions of a lecturer who proposes to carry them to the extremest limits of human science . It would not be a new thing under the sun , if , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be found worthy to be entitled , " A project to render education superficial , under the name of making it more thorough . " P. S. Since the preceding pages were sent to the printer , we have received a copy of Prof. Tappan 's Essay on University Education. * We are sorry not to have had it before us at an earlier * University Education . By Henry P. Tappan , ft D. New York : George P. Putnam , 1851 , ISmo , pp. 120. // date . Mr. Tappan takes a scholarly and correct view of the object of education , and expresses an opinion of the new project presented in this report similar to our own , though perhaps it is more cautiously uttered . We are snrprised , however , that he receives upon trust , and without scrutiny , so many of the statements of the report in respect to the education given in the colleges , and in respect to their claims to the continued confidence of the public . We can hardly be expected to criticise the views of Prof. Tappan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of New York . We give our best wishes to the success of an undertaking so desirable , and would speed the efforts of all , who think the chances of success will warrant the contribution of funds to the enterprise . Our own opinion is , that such institutions like a language can not be made , but must grow .
