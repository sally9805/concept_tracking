From them we get with the direct and reflected rays which make the darkness of the hour more apparent We place 01 ) 00 record the doings of the Emperors of Russia and Austria at Vienna ; and of the lbrmer and the King of Prussia at Berlin , for history and philanthropy 's sake . The Czar , we are told , has succeeded io reconciling the royal representations of Austria and Prussia , who kept up quite a farce of cross purposes during the years 1848-9-50 , to mislead the people and their chiefs . They never had any real intention of quarreling , but were striving to briug hack their subjects to allegiance , by feignin , , hostilities so as to appeal to and betray the pat itisrn of the people . The following description of the Imperial review at Vienna is from a late letter of Thurlow Weed to the Albany Peru ozg Journal : " MOainAv , MAYlO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great military pageants of the earth . We have looked open two live Emperors - NicHoLAs I. of Russia , and Josspn It . of Austria-at the head of an army with banners . It was understood that tbe review was fixed for ten o'clock . Knowing that the Russian Thuperor was prompt in his movements , we drove out to the Glacis Josephstadt ' at that hour . The troops were afield and in line , ' am:d at ten minutes past ten the Emperors , with a magnificently dressed staff of Aids , Arch-Dukes , Princes , Marshals , Generals , &amp;c. , dashed , with their high-blooded sud proOd steeds , upon the ground . A bright sun gave the fullest effect to all this gorgeoo. and glittering paraphernalia of war . The Emperors were dressed in the uniform of the Polish Lancers , their Aids in crimson and gold , the others of the staff in the unifornas of their respective corps . " Phere were upwards of thirty thousand troops in the field , of which twenty thousand were infantry and rifle , and ten thousand cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lancers , and streaming from each lance was a black and yellow flag . " The Emperor of Russia , with one aid-de-camp , a few yards in adiance of the Emperor of Austria and stafl rode in flout of the line , or rather of the three lines , stopping at the head of each battalion , and addressing a few words to the officers . This occupied nearly an hour . 311e then , with his staff , which consisted of more than three hucidred splendidly mounted officers , took a position in front of the centre of the line , which immediately passed him in review . The different corps , whether by battalion , re , iment , or hri*ade formed in sections of three files , fifty feet deep , giving one hundred and fifty feet to earls section or company . There was a marching distance of about six rods between each section . The band of each division , as they reached the Emperor , moved out to the left , and , playing until their corps had passed , was succeeded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After this there was a review of a regiment of lancers , whose horses were put to the top of their speed . The effect was thrilling . And this closed the day . The Emperors returned to the palace , and the troops to their quarters . There were a large number of Court ladies in Court carriages upon the field . Among these was the mother of the Emperor of Austria , a wesoan whose influence is supposed to be as potent with the son as it was with lila uncle , the ex-Emperor , who lives very quietly at Prague . " Ab ! what a canvass is the map of Europe ! Thu survivors of 1848-50 , may well exclaim now that their heroes and martyrs are stript almost wholly away , and to themselves nothing remains . But God in the language of Heber : their fashion ; and the closing of the revolutionary era upon the Vienna and Verona platforms ; that Metternich , Nesselrode and Wellington , still survived far beyond the natural term of life to inspire " Beneath our feet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie the countless dead , Above us , is the heaven . " One can feel even in the United States , at a distance of thousands of miles from the spot , the sombre reality of a spectacle which was gorgeous even to an American eye . The surface glittered witla splendor . But the array was one of execotoiners only , and even the woman who appears in the picture , here as bloody a part in the slaughters of Vienna . Pesth , Prague , and Arad , as the men who attended her to the review . There never will be a worse fame recorded hereafter in the annals of woman , tlsan that of the Arch-duchess Soplila , who stood firm to despotism when even old Metternich trembled more from fear than age , at the massacres of Vienn ; and who infused the spirit of an " angel fallen " into the imperial generals , Radetzky , Haynau , asad Windishyratch , from first to last .

It is the army which has became in our day all over Europe , the only institution whereby mankind are to be systematically and by wholesale kept under the yoke of iron . That instrument of govcrmnent has established the status of 1852 , on the precedent now so famous of the Arch-duke Charles letter to his brotiser at St. Petershnrgh. announcing that order reigned in Warsaw . " The army is everywhere and everything , and in the midst of its ranks . and on the foreground of the picture , we have the well known and execrated forms of the Emperors and Princes , who have so lately surpassed the outrages of Nero , Caligula , and Commodus upim the masses , whom they regard as rubbish to till the ground in peace , and fatten it in war . Here is the account of the Berlin review , the week following that of Vienna : " The Emperor of Russia arrived in Berlin ems the 18th nIt. , he was not expected till the afternoon of the 19th , after the great review , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linden that night . But at seven o'clock on the evening of the 18th , it was officially intimated to the inhabitants of the quarter that they would do well to anticipate the demonstration by twenty-four-hours , as the Eniperor intended to pass the night at the Russian embassy . In all haste , therefore , the illumination was got up ; but the short notice given was injurious to the spectacle . It was rather imperfect , whole stages , amid in some places whole houses , presenting gaps of darkness . The hotels and a few of the first-rate shops were the only points that could be called brilliant . The splendid state appartments mu the hotel of the Russian embassy wet e lighted up as for a grand soiree , though they were for several hours quite empty . A comasiderable crowd gathered in front of the hotel , and contemplated the brilliant chandeliers , crimson draperies , and plat* glass of the saloons at their leisure , in hopes of catching a glimpse of the Kaiser . No one knew precisely when he would arrive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , began to drop off by ten , had thinned very much at eleven , and was in rapid diminution at half past , when his imperial majesty actually drove up , and disappeared into the imiterior . The Emperor had come by a special train from Potadaum . The grand review , which derived most of its interest from the presence of the Emperor and Empress of Russia , took place on the mormifog of the 555 // the mutual confidence and the requisite firmness for the task ; that the veil of 19th , on the Tempeihofer Feld , a vast place behind the Kreuzberg . The number of the troops on the ground was nearly 25,000 ; hot five times the number might be maumuvred on the plain with ease . The Emperor of Rossia and the King of Prussia , attended by the princely and duc 'd guet who have come to Berlin to assist at the spectacle arrived at a quarter to eleven . The cavalcade wa- ma " niheent ; the imperial and royal staff and the suite* numbered 500 horsemen-an irregular mass , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line ot fiont . They were received by royal salute* from the batteries , a roll from the drums , and the strain of the Russian hymn from the regimental baud The fir I ai rival of their msjesties was by far the grande t moment of the spectacle . The Em ress of Russia and the Queen of Prussia , with their suites , followed . Their majesties were in a carriage and eight . As soon as the Emperor had ridden down the lines and returned to the centre , the troops began to file past in companies and squadrons , then in column  --  the cavalry the second time at full trot . The Emperor placed himself at the bead of his cuirassier regiment , and led it past the King of Prussia , as if on duty for the day . The tri ) ops were in motion for two hours and a half . and this part of the spectacle was rather monotonous ; to sime of the men it was very exhausting , the light sand giving way at every s p under foot ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have done credit to July . The troops began to leave the ground at half past one o'clock . The next two days were devoted to itrand military maneuvres of cavalry . The Enaperor ha* delighted the officers of the army by addressing them on his arrival at Potsdam , as his brave comrades , ' and assurine them that his whole heart was with them during a critical period . ' The address was somewhat broken , and did not appear to have been meditated . The officers on the announcement of the Emperor 's arrival , waited on him , and he descended froni the balcony of the palace to the staircase to meet them . 5 rejoice , ' said the Emperor , to he among you once more . You know me , and you know I have always been your true comrade . My whole heart was with you at a eritie , il period . ' ( Here the Emperor pressed the hand of Colonel Count Von Blumenthal , commander of the first regiment of the guard . ) You have maintained your renown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . I come to you , an old friend to his old acquaintance . We will always remain friends , and stand firmly by one another as comrades should . Will von do that ? ' There was a general shout of We will , your majesty . ' On which , the Emperor replied , So it shall he , then ; friends and comrades let us remain . ' " On the 2tst nit. , occurred the grand review in the Tempeihuffeld- and on the 22d , a - uperb banquet was given at the royal palace , whereat four hundred Emper. or Kings , Princes , Counts , and other magnates , sat down . Duriig the dinner , the King himself called on the eats to fill their glasses to thebrim , ( Isis zum reads ) , and gave the following toast : - " In my own name , and that of my srmny , and in the name of all true Prussian hearts , I give the he , ilth of his Imperial Majesty of Russia . God preserve him to that portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritance , and to this age , to which he is indispensable . ' " The Emperor replied , Diesm cans re voire Mejesme , ' adding immediately af erwards in German : - I drink to the welfare of the King of Prussia and his admirable army . " The toast was drunk with the utmost enthusiasm and the hail re-echoed with oft repeated Hochs . ' " " I drink to the welfare of the King of Prussia and his admirable army . " Well done ! for you , but we hope that when you have thus " high uplifted " your system ; when you have laid your pedestal of battering cannon on the necks oh the people , and upon that pedestal elevated a monster musket with gleaming bayonet piercing the very clouds ; heaven 's lightening may cleave the monument from top to base , and destroy its founders braver . The Crisis in Europe . these congresses had not been torn , but the day was not distant 4en they would be revealed to mortal sight . Almost in the moment of the prediction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the truth , in all its repulsiveness , is before us , so fully that we have scarcely anything to supply by speculation . In the London Times of the 24th ultimo , the Paris correspondent appears with an elaborate expose of the dQings in conclave a few days before , at Vienna and Berlin . We present the letter to our readerg , almost without abridgement . On such a subject alone do we regard the writer as authority , or the channel of his communication worthy of any confidence . The subject itself is of such magnitude to every statesman and citizen of the United States , that we will depart from our practice and insert the most material paragraphs of the Times ' correspondent , verbatim . Nothing can be more interesting , to Americans , than this letter , which has already been mere extensively republished and read in the United States than in all the rest of the civilized world " The visit of the Emperor of Russia to Vienna is still a topic of great interest in pialitical circles in Paris ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Emperor , perhaps , owed such an act of courtesy to the King of Prussia , who , in 1851 , proceeded from Berlin to Warsaw to meet his brother-lu-law , whom he had not seen since March , 1848 ; but no such obligation existed with reference to the Emperor of Austria . In order to explain the fact , it is alleged that the Emperor Nicholas , eager to reconcile , fraiikly , and without any arriere pensde , Prussia and Austria , desired to inspire the Court of Vienna with unbounded confidence iii his zeal and impartiality , and to remove beforehand any misgivings that his sojourn at Bem-lin might give rise to . Havimig manifested his intention of visiting Berlin , he feared that his acts or his words might be regarded with suspicion at Vienna ; or that army counsels he might give to the young Emperor might be traced to Berlin influence . This was the cause of his visiting Vienima first ; it was the Emperor Fi-uncis Joseph he wished to see first in his capital , and with him he first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his general policy . Such a mode of proceeding is considered in Paris as skillful and prudent . " It is believed at Vienna , that the Emperor of Austria will rejoin the Czar at Berlin ; but if such be the case , it will not be until after the reconciliation of the two sovereigns of Austria and Prussia . " Confidential amid interesting communications very recently received hero from Vienna , again insist upon the fact that the policy of the Emperor Nicholas is based on an intimate and // absolute alliance between the three cabinets . That alliance he will at any cost , reform and cement , and will try to impart to it the political and religious character the Emperor Alexander , his brother , gave to a similar alliance in 1815 . It is known that Prince Metternich and M. de Nesselrode took a considerable part in the events of that period now , the former h s returned to Vienna , where he is a useful witness of the Imperial Conferences , and the latter has accompanied the Emperor in his journey . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he arrived on the 8th , and left the 12th ; it was Sunday that was devoted to business ; on Monday the two emperors reviewed the troops , and the public remarked the abandon and the very friendly demeanor of the soverelens to each other . " The greatest curiosity ismanifested , both at Vienna and in the salons of Paris , as to the reason why the Czar pursues , with a sort of impassioned perseverance , the idea of so close an alliance between the three powers . It is known that the Emperor desires , and sincerely desires , to maintain peace , and that he will use all his efforts to that end ; but he is at the same time convinced that the most absolute respect for the treaties of 1814 and 1815 is the first and indispensable condition . it is not denied by him that those treaties have already been infringed in some of their provisions-and particularly by the consequences of the French revolution of 1830 ; but independently of the fact that these infractions were not of very great importance , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those treaties ; that they did not call into question the results that those treaties had produced in Europe ; and it is firmly believed by the Czar that if Europe had not accepted the events of 1830 , it would not have had to deplore those of 1848 . " It was thought for a moment that the revolution of 1848 would have called all into question again , either with reference to France or Germany . It appeared all but certain that everything was about to be changed by that general overthrow ; that some States would be destroyed altogether , others re-modelled ; that ancient dynasties would disappear ; that new ones would be founded ; and that , in a word , the revolution would establish itself after many disasters , and on heaps of ruins . It is felt there is no longer cause or motive for such fears . Germany is very nearly re-established on its ancient basis . The treaties of 1814 and 1815 are in full vigor , as on the very first day ; and when a perfect friendly understanding shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide them are settled-Europe of 1852 will exactly resemble Eur ( ipe of 1815 , with this difference-that its attitude with respect to the government of France will not be that of a victorious enemy , nor to France that of a protecting ally . " Of the many revolutions that burst forth in 1848 , and which menaced the treaties , there are now no traces except in France ; where the actual governwent is its issue . It is true that the revolutionary establishment in this country has undergone several transformations for the last four years ; no one denies that it has lost most of its dangerous character , in a revolutionary sense ; but the revolutionary principle subsists . After 1848 Europe did not break ( 1ff its friendly relations with France . It has recognized the governments de facto which have been successively established . Europe will probably recognize any other , but only with the same title , without their admitting right or principle , or , in fact , doing anything that would be opposed to the spirit of the treaties of 1,814 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the basis of the Vienna treaty of 121 articles , so suddenly adopted by all the great powers , 10th June , 1815 , in the fright occasioned by Napoleon 's return from Elba , is reaffirmed . That basis is legitimacy ; in other words , the despots assume that there is no political power on earth except by suifrance of the Holy Alliance , but the divine right , as opposed to the sovereignty of the people . That proposition is several times distinctly promulgated in the abstract of the correspondence , and is the pith of the whole of it . As we have said , the old theory of fisurpation is to be reestablished in the world without the slightest mitigation . Their scheme can not be too often considered by Americans , for sooner or later it will force itself upon their attention . We have said that it consisted of three parts , which we recapitulate . First . All human rights whatever belongs to the kings by ordinance of God . The people have no rights at all ; and their liberties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sovereign . Second , that the kings are bound by their duty to heaven to unite for the defence of the royal prerogative against all infractions whatever by the people , peaceable or forcible , and should support each othe.r in all cases of popular pressure or rebellion by force of arms . Third , that the kings must retract all such priviliges as the right of representation acquired by the people of France in 1789 , and at other periods in Germany and Italy ; all freedom of writing , speaking , or of conscience , so as to make the mass the slaves and tools of absolute power . " To that complexion must we come at last Hci*-etic . " Let us next take up what is said with regard to France , the perpetual terror of all tyrants . She was the old offender whose rebellious and heroic spirit was dreaded by the Vienna squad of 1815 , // more than all the world besides . She is the same now she was then ; and inspires the same " fear of change to monarchs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manacles of 1815 were forged ; and it is for the same inglorious purpose that those of 1852 are preparing . Fear of her is manifested in every line of the correspondence of which we quote the abstract three-fourths of it relates to her altogether She is , indeed , a case of unmanageable difficulty . We find that much as the despots hate Bonaparte , they hate republicanism far worse than him ; and they accept the complete infraction of their system as applicable to France , because to attempt to impose a Bourbon on the people , would be to give republicanism new force . On the other hand , Bonaparte will make any terms with them because he more distrusts the people than the emperors . He wants to become what his uncle boasted he was , the Rodolphus llapsburg of another dynasty , by espousing some sprig of royalty . But he is destined to realize the dream as little as the old Napoleon . And with all his obstinacy he will accept the terms dictated by his superiors , as he did from the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18th May , 1849 , to Edgar Ney , in favor of liberal institutions at Rome , was succeeded by dumb acquiescence in the papal despotism . So any result against the following settlement of his pretensions to a throne and dynasty in France , xviii be attended with swift obedience . The French people are indifferent between Bourbon and Bonaparte , and await but the propitious hour to march singlehanded , if necessary , against the coalition of despots . Whatever the conduct of America in the approaching conflict , that is a strife all of us will live to see , and over its consummation we apprehend no republican will have any cause to lament . " French affairs occupied the attention of the Emperors in a most serious manner , at Vienna , during the visit of the Czar , and these affairs fermed the beginning , the middle , and the end of every &amp;nversation. - It was particularly with reference to France , that , on every occasion , the respect to treaties was insisted on , and the necessity of a strict alliance between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from neing exhausted ; on the contrary , it is still continued , and is sustained every day in the diplomatic or confidential notes that pass between the respective ministers . It is in these notes , the substance of which is known only to a very small number of political persons , that the intentions of the Emperor of Russia are recorded , and which he would desire to see accepted by the Court of Vienna - now that the death of Prince Schwarzenberg has removed the principal impediment , and the cause of resistance , and which he has already persuaded the Cabinet of Berlin to adopt . " If I may judge from the confidential communications , it would appear tojle considered that the French governsnertt will soon reach the lost limit of the concessions reconcileable with the fundamental principles of the treaties . Those notes first fix that limit ; and then examine what conduct ought to be observed if it be passed . They go still further . They determine and define the obligations to which the French government is expected to consent-even though it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be demanded of it in the interest of general peace , or under the pretext of that interest . The correspondence in question contains considerations with reference to fact and right , of which I am enabled to present you with a summary " Considering matters at the point to which they have now reached in France , it is admitted that Prince Louis Napoleon Bonaparte is invested with supreme power , and has been so since the 10th December , 1848 , by the fact of his election , and still more since the 20th December , 1851 and it is in that fact that a certain infraction of the letter of the treaties is perceived-i , of the treaty of the 11th April , 1814 , in virtue of which the Emperor Napoleon renounced for himself , his successors , and descendants , as for each member of his family , all rights of sovereignty and domination , as well over the French empire and the kingdom of Italy as over any other country ; 2d , of the treaty of the 20th November , 1815 , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Russia pledged themselves to maintain , in full vigor , the perpetual exciasion of the members of the Bonaparte family Sum supreme power in France . If that infraction was tolerated in 1848 , ( such is the argument of the cabinets , ) the reason is that the powers were occupied w , th their own affairs ; that the treaties were called into question itt Germany itself ; that Europe was then in a situation full of peril and uncertainty , into which the Presidency of Prince Louis Napoleon glided almost without being noticed . ThePresidency of 1848 , in feet , covered , and as it were protected , that of 1851 , and there existed no good reason for the powers to be more scrupulous or more exacting in 1851 than in 1848 . Besides , each was , after all , but a government de facto of a provisional nature , not even for life , and which has not the pretension to be any thing else than temporary , and the existence of which may be considered in the interest of peace , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree affect principles . " But , if the actual President of the republic became Emperor -- if he became so by means of universal suffrage-  --  the question is put hu*v ought the new government to be considered , and how it ought to consider itself ? If such a change were merely nominal ; if things remained fundamen // tally as they are ; if the chief of the republic , instead of bearing the title of President , bore that of Emperor-if , in fact , a mere change of decoration only took place-from mere personal satisfaction , or amour propre-perhaps the Empereur a vie would be considered by the powers , and tiested in the saute manner as the President , and there would be no change in diplomatic relations . There would , in fact , be so slight a difference between the Emperor and President , that the powers would judge that the maintenatsce of peace was , after all , worth the sacrifice of recognition . The powers would , however , act in quite a different manner if Prince Louis Napoleon should , when Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as such to transmit the imperial dignity and power to his heirs or successors-if , in a word , he claimed to continue or found a new dynasty-for by doiag so he would substitute right for fact-he would transform his government de facto into a government de jure  --  and this is ( as the notes specify ) precisely what Europe will not permit -- what it will not accept . In the diplomatic correspondence I allude to , the particular question just touched on is discussed at considerable length , and in wltat may be termed a doctrinal manner . It is attempted to be shown that a de facto government can not become a dejure one , merely in consequence of the good pleasure or by the will of the chief of that government . It is also shown that such could not be done by Cromwell in England , nor by the Emperor Napoleon in France , who , when they tried to do so , committed an act of usurpation , and that the President would be in the same position , whenever he presented himself to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Europe will never admit that that sovereignty can proceed otherwise than from the right of birth , or of succession , or is transrnissible but in virtue of a similar right . The chance of revolutions , they allege , and the capricious nature of universal suffrage , may raise an individual to supreme authority , and the powers might have availed themselves of the treaties of 1814 and 1815 against that fact . They have not done so . Let then , the holder of such temporary power exercise what he has been invested with , but without infringing on any of the fundamental princispies of the European constitution . " The notes then proceed to examine the probable intention of the President with reference to Prince Schwarzeuberg 's circular of the 20th January ; the addresses delivered by the President on more than one solemn occasion the declarations which have from time appeared in certain setni-official journals , attd those of certain known agents of the Fretich government , in all which an inteistion is discovered of assuming the imperial crown . It is further inferred that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutions ; that he may hesitate or postpone the execution of that design , because he anticipates the resistance of the powers , but that sooner or later he will end by becoming Emperor ; that this being the case , he will not be satisfied with a merely elective title -- that he will desire to be an hereditary Emperor , and that he will demand to be recogtiized in that quality -- that is to say , as the continuator or the founder of a new dynasty , and that is pre cisely , as is declared , what can not and shall not be . It is declared that , so far as Europe is concerned , there already exists a French dynasty and that so long as a Bourbon is found , whenever a French crown is spoken of , it is to him it appertains ; any one else assuming it would be a usurper ; that such usurpation , lasting as long as the life of a person , may be to a certain extent admitted as a fact to which the powers submit ; but to deduce from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Europe , after having recognized and admitted the material fact of the existence of a republic in France and of a supreme elective power d vie , should consent to recognize in favor of such power and hereditary right of any kind whatsoever , Europe would overthrow the fundamental maxims of its own public law ; and it is further contended that the sovereigns who should lend themselves to such a violation of those maxims , would indict on their own dynasties a mortal blow . " The diplomatic notes maintain on this first point the same conclusions of the cabinets of Berlin and Sr. Petersburg they have already done in their respective notes of the month of February last . The conclusions are to this effect - If Prince Louis Napoleon was proclaimed Emperor , and if such change in the French government was the result of a vote expressed by universal suffrage , the courts of Europe would observe a line of coisduct , where such election was personal and oniy for life , different from that with respect to a prete*dcd hereditary right , and transmissible by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussia and Russia would perhaps consent to asatmilate the situation of the executive in France to that of the former kin 0s of Poland , who owed their power also to election -- who received no rights from their ancestors , and transmitted none to their descetidants ; and even such recognition would be given under certain conditions . There is no doubt that the powers by doing so would depart from that provision of the treaties which inerdicts the Bonaparte family from the exercise of supreme power in France or elsewhere ; but , on the other hand , while doing so , they change nothing in what exists at present , and the principle of right would not be affected ; it is not impossible that , in the interest of the peace of Europe , they wn , uld maintain with the President , become Emperor for life , the same diplomatic relations they now hold with him as President of the French republic . The powers would not go beyond that ; and if there arose a question of hereditary Emperor , of an empire transmissible , or ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would certainly refuse to recognize the new government ; they would protest a4ainst the assumption of a right ; and such protest they would make not only in their own interest , hut for the sake of France herself . Finally , they would declare that the pretension of establishing hereditary power in the person of Prince Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was contrary to the fundamental principles of public law , to the tuterest and dignity of sovereign houses , and to the letter and spirit of the treaties which are in vigor at this day in Europe . " The notes next enter on the question as to whether , in the event of an elective or life Emper i559 // or , it would not be necessary to make the recognition of the powers depend on certain conditions , and even to demand certain pledges . The conclusions from the various arguments employed is decidedly in the affirmative , and it is attempted to define the conditions that ought to he imposed on the new Emperor , and to which he should hind himself . The first of these conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The imperial government of France will he expected to keep within the territorial limits which those treaties have laid down , and to seek no occasion of aggrandizement --   --  to give a real ratification to those treaties --   --  to declare that it renounces all and every pretension to continue , or to found , an irnpenal dynasty --   --  and to regard itself only as a de facto government , and never otherwise . As a matter of course , explanations would he expected and required on the question of peace and war , as well as the strongest guarantees for the maintenance of peace . The notes add that it never was intended by the three powers to interfere in the government of France that France ought to know what best suits her ; but that explanations will be asked as to the nature of the political doctrines of the government , and on what seems to the cabinets to be a species of propagandism ; as also on the encouragement which , they allege , is given to the Italian and Polish refugees . " Such is a rapid summary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have very recently passed between the cabinets of Russia and Aestria , and also of the conversations between the two Etnperors and their respective Ministers , and which , no doubt , will be repeated at Berlin , so soon as the complete reconciliation between the sovereigns of Prussia and Austria be effected . " The cause of reform in Europe has become a republican struggle against the doctrine of monarchy or aristocracy in any possible guise . It is true that the leaders of Germany and Hungary took up arms for charters and for the vindication of chartered rights , and did not at first propose to cast off their allegiance . In Hungary , where there was the greatest resistance to despotism , there was not any time , when it was formally decided by the provisional government to strike for absolute independence and republicanism . But everything was taking that direction at the date of the catastrophe ; and such was the inevitable current of events that nothing could have prevented success in the field being followed by free institutions . If Kossuth himself had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he would not , he would have been swept away by the stream . It was thus that our history teaches , by example , the lesson of experience . The North American Colonies for several years insisted that they were contending for chartered rights . They argued and remonstrated against their violation , and when these were of no avail , they drew their swords , and appealed from the forum to force . And when war came , and blood was shed in battle , there was no longer any question of chartered rights ; there were thenceforth two nations in presence , with arms in their hands . The Colonies asserted their sovereignty , and repudiated altogether not only their allegiance , but the hereditary principle on which it rested . The American revolutionists , by inevitable law of circum stances , became republicans . They conquered a republic ; if they had been conquered , the democratic idea would not have perished for a long period . It would have been re-asserted at every renewal of the contest with the British crown . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , and Germany , which submitted without much resistance . Therefore , they are republicans in whose favor these sentiments are expressed , and we are republicans who are expected to respond . In such a contest there would be no doubt of the right of citizens of the United States to volunteer on the side of liberty . It is a right acknowledged alike by the general principles of justice , which are fundamental to any national code , and also by the neutrality acts , and by our constitution . Any citizen may expatriate himself at pleasure , and take the chances of a foreign war , on the same terms with the party whose cause he has espoused . It is a right recognized among us ; and repeatedly exercised by other nations , especially by Switzerland which has allowed her soldiers to serve every country in Europe . Our right as individuals to pay sums of money over to the Hungarian , or Italian , or German loan is clear . The object of these loans is to actively propagate republicanism in Europe by agents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so prepare the public mind that there will be a popular revolution , and the final overthrow of the system of monarchy . All Americans , wherever their purses and inclinations take them , are , or should be republican propagandists . They give ' precept and example in favor // of self government , and our public example is the great lever of democracy which is pushed under every throne , and will soon overturn them . Besides , monarchs expend their breath and money in trying to perpetuate the old imposition of their divine right , and the preposterous idea of their utility to the people . We but answer them bluntly by giving money to those whom they have too long deceived , to the end that the deception may cease very soon and for good . As citizens we have repeatedly done the same thing before . We gave private contributions to Greece , to Ireland , to Texas  --  and their cause , whether it terminated successfully or disastrously , was the sacred cause of liberty and man . We are called on with a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge of the gospel of Christ ; and the pulpit claims the right to act against infidelity at home and abroad , by the same instrumentality of agents and money , on the general warrant of ethics , and the express authority of the Scriptures . It is not the hungry nor the naked who are half so worthy of aid from the philanthropist as the victims of a despot . No temporal interest compares in value to the treasure of social and political rights ; it is only second to the store which man is admonished to lay up in Heaven . The legal and moral right of private citizens of the United States to embark their lives and fortunes in continental wars is too clear for further argument , and duty and interest follow in its train . We shall , therefore , leave the discussion of individual responsibility here , to grasp the larger theme of our national rights , duty , and interest , at the present juncture of European affairs . The relations of citizen and individual are inseparable in the enquiry ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invasion of strangers and republics , threatened by a iRussian alliance against human freedom , and national independence , is a step far beyond our former policy . It includes the question of private agency , and goes much farther-is in truth , the most important and comprehensive of all kindred subjects in a national aspect . The predicate of the doctrine of intervention with the States of Europe , is the history of that continent for the last three years , and the imminent danger of republicanism both as a fact and as a principle from a premeditated and successful attack , by Russia and her allies , upon the rights of the people of central and southern Europe ; the destruction of Bremen and llamburgh , and the further menaces against Switzerland confirm it , and we can better understand thIs foundation , by recalling the epoch of 1776 , in this country . Intervention by foreigners on the side of the people against the monarch saved us from destruction* as intervention by foreigners against the  |p2o|ple  and for the monarchs , threatens to destroy the last vestiges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of navigation and of the world , the quality of ships and of sailors ; the distance to us from Europe was then five times as great as it is now from us to Europe ; and , indeed , the French intervention was a chivalric crusade , far more remote than would be the intervention of this country hereafter to save India from England , or China from Russia , in that world which lies beyond the Pacific and the other side of the globe . A glance at ourselves and France eighty years ago , will aid us to find the line of action for our government in reference to Europe . The case was not half as urgent , nor half so clear . We will give that picture the benefit of comparison with the one under consideration ; we will bring together 1776 and 1851 , and we will drive any man , who doubts , to the sophistry of the fable where Esop amuses himself with the lawyers , and has left them dangling to this day on the horns of what should be known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suffered from England the grievances set forth in the Declaration of Independence . The list had commenced in the middle of the Seventeenth Century , by the enactment of the Navigation Law of 1651 , levelled against American commerce ; the list ended with what was the unpardonable aggression of the paper and tea tax , both of them insignificant . After all , we felt nothing , from the oppression of the mother country , which was vital and ruinous . But for ten years before our Declaration of Independence , the great minds // of the age , in this hemisphere , were ardently debating the science of government . They descended to the foundation of personal and political rights ; they questioned the past and speculated on the future . They evolved for themselves and posterity at last the great theory of free institutions , now eclipsing other systems , and soon to be the agent of universal republicanism . The revolution commenced on an abstract question between the rights of the people and the powers of the government . War began by the refusal to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the beverage overboard in Boston harbor . The resistance of the tax on principle , had much more to do with the appeal to arms , than the casual violence of the tea party . The act of parliament was vehemently denounced as an usurpation upon the colonies , because they had no representative there , and so were to be taxed without their express or implied consent . They had always taxed themselves by their legislative acts ; and thus they had paid for the support of the British officers who ruled in the colonies . They proclaimed the integrity of that right as fundamental to justice and freedom* as the incontestable doctrine of human liberty . Argument , and remonstrance , and patience exhausted , the Colonies appealed to the sword . The conflict was waged about as long as the vital discussion had lasted . For seven years the world beheld a handful of patriots facing The power of the British empire , and fighting its foreign and savage allies almost without success or hope . Scattered , feeble , beset on land and sea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisted the shock of the first campaign themselves , but they had no chance cf ultimate deliverance except from strangers . They appealed to France . France was a monarchy , the ancient enemy , the gi*gantic rival , as she is soon again to be after a thousand years , the conqueror of England . It was a question even then of adverse principles , and of no important interest in any respect to the French king or French people . In fact all governments had an interest to suppress a rebellion , but by the same token all subjects had a higher interest to give it aid and comfort . And it was in this order that the cause progressed in France - first that gallant and renowned race heard and answered the appeal of the colonies . Foremost of the first caine Lafayette , a name that overshadows all the monarchs of his country , and who had the power afterwards to push over or at pleasure rescue the throne . He launched into the desperate strife of the colonies for national existence ; he volunteered to fight out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he , risked life , fortune , and honor . The path offered nothing but sacrifice ; there was no scope for any of the great passions of warriors or leaders ; but there was a cause which stood above even ambition . France from all ranks furnished volunteers ; so did Germany , Ireland , and Poland , and their soldiers and officers took and honored the posts of danger . Steuben , Pulaski , Dc Kalb , Kosciusko , Montgomery , and Lafayette caine to fall into the ranks , and either die in battle or vanquish the invader . They did some of them die , sword in hand ; and some lived through the dreadful , barefooted , starving campaigns from 1777 to 1781 , saw the foe beaten to the ground , and the rampant lion of the llritish standard bite the dust . They displayed all the great qualities of warfare . They retreated as well as they fought ; they saved their lives from idle exposure , and offered them freely to secure the needed victory . The glorious day of Yorktown is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them it was a surrender made to the united armies of the United States and France* to Lafayette and Rochainbean , Lincoln and Washington . May their kindred flags be always associated in the battles of revolution and their different , but not discordant voices shout the common triumph over the last tyrant . It is their glorious mission to conquer , . not simply the low and hireling agencies of despotism in the field , but to extinguish for ever , in the minds of men , the detested error of every form of the hereditary principle . France has not poured out her thousands of lives on sea and land for us in vain , nor wasted upon perfidy or ingratitude her hundred millions of treasure . We love to linger over these closing scenes of the revolution . To do so here is both argumentative and agreeable ; it assists the judgment and softens , while it elevates , the heart . // We can never render too much justice to France and the French people for the assistance they gave to our side in the revolutionary war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real friend of the colonies , and that his subjects were indifferent to our struggle . With the natural perverseness of men who have been obliged , but not having the magnanimity to freely acknowledge the obligation , there have been statesmen who give this false direction to public opinion , because it enabled them to attribute weat France did for us to the jealousy of one king against another ; but the statement and the explanation are both alike incorrect . The correspondence between the premier of Louis XVI . and the British minister at Paris shows that the French court were not at all anxious to give offence to the King of England , and that it was at last compelled to take the popular side by the outside pressure . The leaders of the masses in France had caught the inspiration of liberty from the writings of their philosophers in the reign of Louis XV. , as well as that of the actual king ; they had communicated that spirit to the people , and it was with the people that the popularity of Franklin and America and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were filled with hope and expectation for the result of the struggle , and they announced loudly their partiality , and tendered their assistance . The courtiers and the court were not the first nor the ardent friends of the colonies , these were formed among the right-minded and stout-hearted working classes . It would also be a great error to suppose that we could have achieved the conquest of the British army and the expulsion of the British rule , without the aid of France . It was not only opportune , but indispensable ; nothing else could have averted the catastrophe , whose cold shadow , like that of any coming funereal event , was falling on the scene . Washington was in the most despondent mood . A war of nearly six years had been protracted by his great military , and greater moral resources , but it was becoming almost desperate . He wrote to Congress to say that he had never been pushed to such extremities and that unless some great event occurred in his favor , he must abandon the cause as hopeless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the desk that God would stop the unholy war which was waging between mother and daughter . Any history of the period will give the frightful picture of the struggle . As Washington most truly said , unless some " great event " had happened , it must have been abandoned . There was no possibility of facing the victorious and confident enemy with a starving and demoralized army , which even the virtue of the Father of his Country could not keep together . That " great event " did happen ; and it happened in the very nick of time . The French navy and army came over , and General Rochambeau landed 10th July , 1780 , at Newport , Rhode Island . We have somewhere seen a sketch of the landing , by an eye-witness , which made an indelible impression on our memory . He states that Rochambeau and his staff landed without any ceremony , and walked immediately up the silent street to the hotel . That the people were sitting in their houses , wringing their hands , and giving vent to feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed ; the country people , for several weeks , had refused to bring anything to market because there was no money to pay for it . Washington , with a few thousand troops , was retreating before three times his force , and , in short , the peopl* had determined to surrender at discretion . In a few moments it was known everywhere that the French had landed , and the chief inhabitants of Newport went to the General to hear what he meant to do . He said at once , that the King of France had sent over his ships , and several thousand soldiers , with all the arms and munitions of war , to take part against the British army , and to fight for Amencan independence . That he had abundance of money to buy provisions , and that he would pay for whatever he wanted in gold and silver , without delay . He immediately opened communication with General Washington , placing his army at his orders , and proclaimed that he would leave nothing undone to merit the confidence of the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed the extravagant joy of the citizens of Newport at this " great event , " which had // been anticipated , it is true , for some time , but which , when it happened , came so opportunely as to save the cause of independence at its last gasp . The bells were set to ringing , bonfires were kindled , and the country people came pouring into town with all kinds of produce , which were bought and paid for in cash by the French commissariat , to the great satisfaction of all parties . And it was especially observed that the new allies preserved perfect order , and that not the smallest article of property was appropriated ; not even the twigs of the fruit trees were disturbed . The troops did not leave their encampment for several days , during which time there was perfect cordiality between them and the inhabitants . As we have before stated , these French reinforcements soon after joined Washington , and fought under his command to the end of the war . At the assault at Yorktown the next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the British outside of the main fortifications . The command was given to two French officers . Lafayette led the Americans , and Viomenel his own countrymen , and there was the noblest rivalry between the soldiers and officers of the two nations . The scene of the surrender has been painted by the national order , and now hangs in the capitol . History and poetry have emulated the canvass in ennobling the event . It can never cease to thrill the breast of any American , till corruption has made freedom distasteful , nor be appealed to in vain by the oppressed of other countries till our own liberties are on th' eve of taking their departure . The immediate and remote consequences of a failure of the colonial struggle would have been dreadful beyond description . The King of England was merciless and silly . The resistance had driven him to desperation ; and when we add the venom of his private character to the royal horror of treason , there is no limit to the probable extent of his vindictive rage . The people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been refused in any shape , and affairs would have been administered here to-day as they are in Ireland , India and the Jonian Islands , where despotism is as remorseless as it is in Siberia . Killing and expelling would have become common , and the great luminaries of freedom , whose effulgence now guides the world , and who are known and heralded as Washington , Jefferson , Madison , Franklin , Adams , Hamilton and the rest , would have been hanged to gratify malignant deputies of the crown . Some struttling viceroy , covered with ribbons , stars and garters , perhaps Sir Henry Bulwer himself , would be attempting to govern us by his will and pleasure as tyrannically as Lord Clarendon starved the Irish , as Sir Henry Ward shot and bastinadoed the lonians , and as Sir James Brooke killed with his own cowardly hand the Indians at Saranac . Our great example would have been no example at all ; and instead of being of ourselves " a power on earth , " with paramount and increasing to frighten away other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present , however , these grand contrasts at further length : Americans at once see from what a depth to what a height they were raised seventy odd years since by the herculean arm of France . It is not our habit to dwell enough upon this great debt , for we have bcen pressing too rapidly forward to live at all in the past . That volume will , nevertheless , be soon the text-book of statesmen , for we are drifting to a crisis for which it furnishes the main instruction . We commend it again to the student and the statesmen , taking it for granted that they will agree at least , that what was done for us by others , was well done . We want our great men to go further , and to lead their countrymen to coMsider and decide that in some tangible shape , they are bound to render to Europeans some aid and comfort , as well as to others quite as much in their time of need . No place in the discussion could be more appropriate than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be irresistible . We say , then . that it follows from the history of French intervention in our revolution , that whenever the same occasion arises , we are bound to act a similar part according to all the circumstances . What is the tacit // understanding of men and nations who have received benefits from either friends or strangers ? Is it that the matter is to be forgotten , or what is the same thing , never to be acknowledged ? And if remembered and responded to , in what manner shall it be done ? The answer seems to us to be easy . There is an implied promise on our parts in every such case , whenever we find ourselves in like position , to go and do likewise . Towards France , by accepting her help , we bound ourselves to give back to her whatever we received , whenever we were in condition to do so . The moral obligation of a promise , express or implied , is that it shall be discharged in the sense in which the promiser knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have incurred that moral obligation , for it was on the implied promise that France came forward . To test this , we have but to ask ourselves whether one of us would render any friend private assistance if we knew he would refuse is under the same circumstances to us or 4o others ? Clearly not . And to come to the very case before us . France would never have moved one step to our assistance if the American Congress had said , " you may aid us , but we will never aid you nor anybody else in the same situation , no matter what may be their extremity , or what our own ability . " Indeed , it need not have gone so far , to have deterred the French-if they had suspected that such an idea lurked in the American heart , they would have recoiled from contact with it as from the touch of an adder . There is no doubt that we were understood by the mere acceptance of assistance , to promise to do what we could for the same great cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise thereafter . Republicans and freemen are surely capable of all the magnanimity of royalists and aristocrats ; but there is no royalist or aristocrat so faithless to his own order , so pusillanimous towards his benefactor , that under the same circumstances he would disown his obligations , and hesitate to move to the rescue at any crisis , like the present , which threatened the overthrow of all royalists and aristocrats by leaders and armies of the people in both hemispheres . If we should , therefore , find , or we shall find , that the movement of the people of the old world since 1848 , now suspended , but soon to be recommenced , is for the vindication of the eternal right of self-government , and that there is need of our assistance on the popular side , we may as well prepare for a corresponding manifestation of public sentiment , especially when-as we have seen-our principles are at stake , and as we shall see , our interests far and near , loudly demand attention . What , then , is the condition of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States are rec1uired to determine the line of public as well as private action ? We do not purpose to detail all the facts which must control our decision . They are recent , and more fully in the possession of Americans , than the minutini of our own revolution . The same motive inspired the masses of 1848 and 1776 it was the desire to be freemen . They made all the sacrifices the object required at Paris , Vienna , Berlin , IRonen , Pesth , Prague , Venice and Naples . Thousands exposed their lives , and thousands fell beneath the sword ; but the people , by dint of heroism , conquered almost everywhere . Their monarchs saluted them as victors , and promised , if trusted , to restrain the royal prerogative within constitutional limits . And a number of these instruments were granted-one at Berlin , another at Vienna , and another at Naples ; others by several of the lesser Germanic princes . France and Italy held conventions of delegates of the people , and gave themselves the constitutions of Democratic Republics . St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of universal suffrage penetrated as for as Moldavia and Wallachia , where Russian protectorates were forced back by the spirit of the people . All these royal concessions were a juggle , intended to deceive till danger was over , and then to be retracted and torn to pieces . They were the offspring of terror and treachery , begotten in the palaces of Kings , by traitors to their duty , and falsifiers of their honor , perjurers , whose oaths could not bind , but only tempted . When , therefore , the masses went back to work , and labor resumed its pursuits , the royal brood // concocted and executed a simultaneous reaction , which only deserves the name of treason ; and will justify the destruction of the criminals in the most summary form . The case of Europe is , then , many fold stronger than ours ; for there , liberty conquered tyranny , and afterwards hearkened to its entreatics for mercy ; and armistice and amnesty being given to Kings , the generous people were by them atrociously betrayed . While our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us win the day ; our claim on France was nothing , because we had never done anything for her , and she was a monarchy , and it was not strengthened by the material circumstances of succcss over the King , and the betrayal of the faith pledged to a victorious people when he was prostrate . These circumstances do exist in the present appeal made by Europe to the United States ; and give to that appeal an emphasis not to be resisted . It is a far higher and stronger abstract case of oppression and deceit than has evcr been presented to the arbitramcnt of mankind . Sooner or later , and , we trust , speedily , this appeal must be entertained by the whole people of the United States , North and South , East and West . It is more than the question which Mr. Webster stated in the debate on the Greek IRevolution in 1824 , which , he said , was between absolute and constitutional governments between restrictions on rulers and the divine right to rule , without any restriction whatever ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained by the people , tyrants shall be permitted to destroy them ? It is more even than that question , which only touches the welfare of third parties ; for we shall ascertain by a cursory examination of our condition , that we are ourselves most deeply involved in our internal and external interests . Before we proceed to that consideration , we will speak of the peculiar character and position of our people . We shall be enabled to show , if more proof be wanting , that even if we are the descendants of the original settlers of the continent , and if the inhabitants of the United States were now all from that stock , lineally succeeding by ordinary natural increase to a common ancestry , it would be our interest and duty to accept and decide upon the greatest question ever put to the consideration of public opinion in this country . What we shall finally do with the question , will be subsequently debated ; but were the Union surrounded by a Chinese wall , or Americans , like Chinamen , without the slightest admixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction in the premises . We are not , however , by any means such a nation . Anybody can become an American by emigration from any land but Africa . if he desire it . The process of settlement and naturalization , together with the freedom of our institutions , and the fertility of our soil , have invited the denizens of the world , wherever assembled , or dispersed , to come among us and become fellow-citizens . And from every degree of latitude and of longitude , and from every isle and continent , under the whole heaven , the flood of emigration has poured in upon the United States . For twenty years the streams of people have become enormous , and multiplied , and they seek this land of promise as eagerly as the rivulet the rivers , the rivers the ocean ; and we have now within our territories , not a homogeneous , but a most heterogeneous people . There has been nothing like it in appearance since the encampments of the Roman enipire , or the tents of the crusaders . Here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites , suddenly assembled together , and more by emigration than procreation , vast multitudes of whom are still bound by ties of blood and association which can not be broken . They are every day not only assailed in their rights of property remaining behind , but wounded most deeply in their tenderest feelings of consanguinity . They are living here with us , but their hearts are in their old homes , with their household gods , and ten thousand objects of interest and affection . American citizens , to the number of millions , occupy this peculiar relation to the masses of Europe , and it is to them as well as to the natives of the country , that the right of jurisdiction over the European question in part belongs . And from such a collection of human beings so associated , and so allied , American public opinion will inevitably proceed ; // and what public opinion here seriously decides , will soon have all the force legislation could give it . Public opinion governs us within the limits of the constitution , which , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon makes rulers and enactments conform to its bidding . It becomes us , therefore , who deal with the present crisis in affairs , to consider the very peculiar composition of tribunal of which every citizen , native or naturalized , is but an integer . Feeling will inevitably be thrown into the scales of justice as soon as the march of continental revolution begins . Let us not overlook that feature of our country , and its character . It is , indeed , the vital element of this discussion , and the commanding fact which governs it with our people . Mere politicians must perceive the importance of mastering some active system of foreign policy in self-defence . For such is the condition of parties in the United States , that it is most important to both Whigs and Democrats to control the large vote which is cast in all the Northern and Eastern States , by emigrants and their descendants . That vote is decisive now of the Presidency ; and instead of going on diminishing , is certain to increase largely and rapidly . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more stringent , and they will never be touched . These votes will soon be controlled to a great extent by the leader who avows the doctrine of intervention in the next European convulsion . This is so clear as to recluire only the statement without any argument . The German and Irishman . and their descendants , will support a President and a foreign policy almost to a man ; and at the very next election , standing on the vanta*e ground of this question . Both parties may as well take heed of the complication which the presence of that political strength belonging to naturalized citizens introduces into American politics . It can not be silenced ; it must be regarded . The foreigners who have settled here have highly intelligent men in whom they repose their confidence , and they are ambitious and sagacious , and will act according to convictions of duty and interest . If much lower intelligences-the free blacks-were in the same position , they would act likewise under similar circumstances . Had free negroes a vote in the choice of Federal officers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had they the same common cause , they would soon be consulted and coveted by statesmen , and influence , in like manner , our foreign policy with respect to the condition of Africa . This line of argument is not very attractive to us , and yet we can not leave it abruptly . That it has been left out of view by writers and orators on intervention proves nothing ; for it often happens that the point of a matter is the only thing not overlooked . This wide-spread confederation of thirty-one sovereignties , peopled by all the scattered races which are said to have descended from Eve and Adam ; and extending day by day the list of its own members , and filling up continually with population every fresh acquisition of territory , is , in truth the newest as well as the most sublime spectacle of any age . It is not a nation in reality , because it is only a federation of States , and also because it is a congress of representatives from all other nations . No tribunal that has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be imagined , approaches that of the mingled and various inhabitants , recent and ancient , who , whether subjects and aliens before their settlement here or not , have become citizens of the great republic , and by nicans of the double right of universal suffrage and universal elegibility to office , control the public course of action with reference to all possible questions under the constitution . The territorial extent of such a tribunal at the end of twenty years , can not be anticipated ; the census ought fo give us fifty millions of people full of the demo'cratic spirit . What was the famous international court of the Areopagus compared to the United States what will be the proposed international congress of the Peace society , even under its most perfect instauration as the supreme court of nations ? Literally nothing . And when we reflect that in fifty years we shall , in. all human probability , have a population of as many more millions , the hand of destiny will fix its index finger in but one direction  --  the direction of universal re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golgotha of the humble , and a palace for princes only , will become fit for the residence of man in a superior condition of intelligence and virtue . The men of to-day in the United States may preach and practice as they please ; but the men of to-morrow and the future will not allow the wholesale imprisonment , nor slaughter of the people of any country by tyrants ; and we can not too soon shape our foreign policy accordingly . We propose , next month , to enter upon the consideration of our immediate interest in the question of intervention , and to prove to the most unwilling heart of every section of the Union , North , South , East and West , that in some or all the forms we will describe , the interference of the United States with the politics of Europe is a matter of principle and policy ; and only a question of time . We can afford to quit the subject here with the following historical citations . If we consider the examples of the master states of antiquity , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminent in politics as in science , war and the arts . We do not propose them for imitation , but for our own instruction only , till we issue another number . The iRomans conquered the world as much by their wisdom as their strength ; and no nation of ancient times possessed so complete a system of external policy . It would not be adapted to this age , nor suited to our condition ; but it is instructive to consider it . Whenever they conquered a province they planted their colonies , they protected the lesser neighboring nations without increasing their strength ; they humbled the overgrown power of others , and never permitted any foreigner , whom they had any reason to fear , to obtain the smallest influence . In Greece they supported the Achaians and Eolians without adding anything to their strength . They weakened Philip in Macedonia , and drove Antiochus out of Syria : the former they made an ally , after he was reduced in power , and the latter they could not trust , and therefore expelled him from his dominions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the IRomans did what ought to be done by every wise prince , whose duty it is not only to provide a rqmedy for present evils , but at the same time to anticipate such as are likely to happen ; by pre-secing them at a distance , they are easily remedied ; but if we wait till they have surrounded us , the time is past , and the malady is become incurable . * * * The Romans , therefore , when aware of evils that might happen , immediately prepared to avert them , and never suffered them to grow worse , merely to evade a war , well knowing that the war was not to be escaped by such means , and that in deferring it they always gave a great advantage to the enemy . Upon which account , they rather chose to make war both against Philip and Antiochus in Greece , than suffer those princes to invade Italy . They might then unquestionably have avoided the war in both cases ; but they judged better , and they did not think fit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , viz : to wait the advantage of time . They made use only of their prudence and their courage ; knowing that time drives everything before it , and may bring good as well as evil , and evil as well as good . " Chap . III of The Prince . Such was the Roman foreign policy , which the leading statesman of a later age quoted and recommended in his political manual . The foreign policy of the Greeks was also quite as distinguished for its grasp and its wisdom . The celebrated Demosthenes has left us also lessons of diplomacy which some cotemporary or future statesman of the United States will be compelled to consider , and probably to adopt , and enforce upon his countrymen , as did the great Athenian orator . One good effect of the present agitation of the world will be to compel the candidates for office to rub up their classics , and depart from the beaten track of their masters and teachers , to pursue the path of history and of philosophy by the lights which stream down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The islands of Cos , Chios , and Rhodes , were colonies of Athens ; but they revolted in the 105 Olympiad . They were assisted by Mansolus , who enabled them to conquer the great Athenian expedition , but at the same time took care to subor // dinate them to himself . His wife , Artemesia , asked for Persian assistance to retain her dominion , after his death , and placed a garrison of those foreign troops in the citadel of Rhodes . The Rhodians , although ancient rebels and colonies , preferred their old laws and masters , and consequently sent to Athens for material aid . Demosthenes appealed to the Athenians in their behalf , to overlook their former conduct and grant the request , upon reasons marked with as much wisdom as eloquence . T*e following is an extract which illustrates our line of ar-gument : " Consider this also , Oh ! men of Athens , that you have waged many wars both against democracies and oligarchies ; but the causes of these wars against each , perhaps none of you understands . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on account of some mutual complaints which ceuld not be publicly disposed of , or some portion of territory , or line of boundary , or honor , or ascendancy . But against oligarchies for none of these-for the principle of your government , for freedom ; insomuch that I have no hesitation in saying I consider it better for you that all the dominions in Greece should be at war with you , than that the oligarchics should be your friends . For with a people in the possession of liberty , I consider that you have no difficulty in making peac ' * whenever it suits you ; but with oligarchics I do not think even friends secure . For it is not possible that the few should be well disposed to the many , or those that thirst for dominion towards mea who have resolved to live in the enjoyment of equal rights . I am astonished that none of you think , when the Chians , and the Mityleneans , and now the Rhodians are under oligarchies , all mankind , I had almost said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain degree of danger to your oAn constitution also ; nor consider this , that if oligarchies are established everywhere they will not allow your republic to stand ; for they know well that none else can bring back the state of things to freedom , and they will wish to destroy those from whom they expect mischief to befal them ; all other aggressors you ought to consider enemies on account of the particular grievance , but I advise you to hold those who destroy free governments , and change them into oligarchies , as the common enemies of all who love liberty . Moreover , it is but just , oh , men of Athens ! that you who are free , should appear to entertain the same sentiments respecting an unfortunate people who have lost their freedom , which you could expect others to entertain respecting you , if , ( which Heaven avert ) any such calamity should ever befal you .
