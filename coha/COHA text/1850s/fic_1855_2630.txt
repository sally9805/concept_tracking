CHAPTER I. Illustration " Do come here , mother , " said Eddie , carefully tip-toeing from the window , and beckoning with his hand . " Here is something I want to show you . Come carefully , or I am afraid you will frighten it . " Mrs. Dudley laid aside her book , and stepped cautiously forward , Eddie leading the way back to the window . " What is it ? " she inquired . " It is a bird with straw in its mouth , and I do believe it is going to build a nest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , looking from the window . Presently a robin alighted on the walnut tree , directly before them , with a bunch of dry grass in its mouth . It rested a few seconds , and then flew in among the branches of a honeysuckle which twined around the pillars , and crept over the top of the porch . A fine , warm place it was for a nest , sheltered from the north winds , and from the driving rains , and from the hot rays of the noon-day sun . Eddie and his mother watched the bird for some time . It would bring straws , and arrange them in its nest , as only a bird can ; and then it would away again , and come back , perhaps , with its bill covered and filled with mud , which it used for mortar in fastening the materials in their places . Then it would get in the nest , and , moving its feet and wings , would make it just the right shape to hold the pretty eggs she would lay in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and feed so carefully . The robin was industrious , and worked hard to get the house finished in season . I think she must have been very tired when night came , and she flew away to her perch to rest till morning . I do not see how she could balance herself so nicely on one foot , as she slept with her head turned back , and half-hidden beneath her wing . Eddie often watched the robin during the day . He was careful not to frighten it . " I wonder how the robin could find so nice a place . I should not have thought it would have known about it , "  - -  he said to his mother , as he saw the bird fly in , almost out of sight , among the clustering branches . Mrs. Dudley told Eddie God taught the birds where to build their nests , and that he took care of them , and provided food for them . Is it not wonderful that God , who has built the world in which we live , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend to the wants of the robins and sparrows , and other birds which he has made ? We should forget them , if we had much of importance to attend to , or we should be weary of providing for their wants ; but our heavenly Father never forgets , and never grows weary . He hears the ravens when they cry , and not even a sparrow falls to the ground without his knowledge . " Are ye not much better than they ? " our Saviour said to his disciples , when endeavouring to teach them to trust in the love and parental care of God , and not to be anxious in regard to their temporal welfare . If God so cares for the birds , whose lives are short , and who have no souls to live in another world , will he not much more care for those who are made in his image , and for whom the Saviour died ? No good thing will he withhold from those who walk uprightly , who try to obey his commandments , and look to Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , when you see the birds , you will remember God 's love to them and to you . I have given you all I know of the history of one day of the robin 's life , but Eddie will observe it while it lives in its house in the honeysuckle , and will tell me all he sees of its domestic arrangements . I hope to tell you with what kind of a carpet it covers the floor , and what it hangs on the walls , and how it brings up its little children , if it should be so happy as to have any to gladden its quiet home , and cheer it with their chattering tongues . I am sure it will have pretty flowers and green leaves for pictures to look at , painted by One whose skill no artist can rival ; and it will need no Cologne for perfume for the breath of the honeysuckle is more delicious than any odour which the art of man could prepare . CHAPTER II . GOING TO HOUSEKEEPING . I promised to tell you more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with great attention , and has kept me well informed in regard to it . I have stepped out upon the porch with him , and , kneeling down , and looking over the side , I have had a peep myself at this wonderfully contrived home of the robins . It is partly supported by a cornice , which runs around the porch , and gives it a firmer foundation than the small branches of the honeysuckle could do . But I must not forget to tell you about the finishing of the nest . The second day , the robin was at work before six o'clock in the morning ; so you see birds are early risers , and like to have their work done in good season . They know how pleasant it is to see the rosy dawn , and welcome it with their sweetest strains of music . I wonder how many of my little friends see the sun rise , these bright mornings ! If they would awake with the birds , they must , as wisely as the birds , go to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world in darkness . If they sit up late , they will lose the morning songs , which fill the woods with sounds of gladness , and which resound from every tree and shrub about the houses of those who love these pleasant visitors , and refuse to allow them to be frightened from their premises . The robin rose early , as I have told you , and resumed her labours for a short time . Through the day she came occasionally to see how the house was drying , but did not seem to be at all busy . She had accomplished so much by her previous industry , that there was no necessity for much exertion , and she felt quite at liberty to enjoy herself , taking short excursions in the country , and returning sometimes alone , and sometimes in company with her mate . He , once in a while , visited the nest ; but was so well satisfied with the domestic arrangements of his wife , and had so much confidence in her ability and skill , that he manifested no disposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them , and cheered and encouraged her by singing her one of his sweetest songs , telling her how dearly he loved her , how highly he esteemed her , and how truly happy he was that he had so pleasant and agreeable , and at the same time so housewifely , a companion . She appeared quite as well pleased to be appreciated as any wife or housekeeper of my acquaintance , and it made her labour a labour of love . We all like to be appreciated . I see the robin is a plain , common-sense bird in her notions , and wants nothing for mere display . Every thing which could add to the real comfort of her family she has provided , and has no desire for any thing further . Many house-keepers might learn a valuable lesson from her prudent , comfortable arrangements . When the dwelling was completed , and suitably dry for occupancy , the robin deposited there four bluish-green eggs . I assure you they are beautiful , and are great treasures to her . In about twelve days from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she became very domestic , never leaving home but for a few minutes at a time . Her four eggs now occupy all her attention and her great business seems to be to keep them warm with the heat of her own body . She does not complain of being confined at home , but is entirely satisfied to attend to the duties which devolve upon her . She is not uneasy that she can not sing like her husband , or , like him , attend to the interests of Robindom ; but quietly and discreetly she labours in her appropriate sphere , and feels no wish to leave it for a less secluded and less happy life . Her heart is satisfied with the happiness of her home , and she feels no uneasiness -- no ungratified longings for something to occupy her , aside from the duties she so cheerfully performs . Madam Robin was entirely satisfied with the success of her labours , and she had reason to be . No bird could have done better . This consciousness of having done well did not make her proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels who is conscious that an allotted task has been faithfully performed ; and the praise of her husband was no injury to her , as she was not silly enough to think of herself more highly than she ought to think . As the house was for a summer residence , she selected fine straw-matting , instead of woollen carpets for it . She put it down with great care , perfectly smooth and even . The wall was covered with the same cool material , delicately woven . Was n't it nice ? CHAPTER III . PLEASANT NEIGHBOURS . The location selected by our friend , the robin , seems to be highly appreciated by many of the feathered race . Although the robin was the first settler , others have already decided that it affords great advantages in the way of shelter from the fierce winds , from the burning rays of a summer sun , and from the too-curious eyes of hawks and other birds of prey . An abundance of fresh , soft water can be obtained not far from Honeysuckleville , and this is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men or birds . Fruit also abounds . There will be bright red currants for the little folks ; strawberries , too , more than they can eat , and raspberries in any quantity they may wish . I must not forget the cherries , of which birds are so fond , and which they can have at any time when they are ripe , for merely the trouble of picking . It is not surprising , with all these advantages in its favour , that Honeysuckleville should find more than one family happy to settle within its borders . For some time , two song-sparrows have made it frequent visits ; and have finally decided , after a careful survey , that no more desirable spot can be found for a summer residence . They have accordingly commenced building , not more than two feet from the mansion of the robins . Their house is much smaller -- a cottage -- but quite large enough for them . It nestles so lovingly in the shadow of the vines , that I am sure domestic comfort must be found there . Discord and contention could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be pleasant neighbours . They are exceedingly fond of vocal music , and their clear melodious voices fill the new settlement with harmony . In that terrible snow-storm which occurred in the middle of April , I often saw a sparrow alight on a bough of a tree near the house , and send up to heaven such a strain of full , gushing melody , as melted my heart with pity and admiration . It reminded me of a child of God in the midst of trials and afflictions , yet rejoicing in faith , and trusting continually in the care of a Father in heaven . Was the cold little sparrow singing itself away , as it was once believed the swan sung its own death-song ? Or may the new neighbour of the robin be the very one whose voice rang out so clear and loud , above the howlings of the storm ? I trust no rude blast nor chilling frost will mar the pleasure of our feathered friends , but that they may prosper in their plans , and never forget seeking a home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Dudley 's cottage . The song sparrow is not the only neighbour of the robin . A pair of cat-birds have a nest in a lilac near the honeysuckle , and one of them sings hour after hour on the walnut-tree opposite to the window and often comes near enough to the house to look through the open casement . These birds have lived for several summers in that same lilac , and annually make all the repairs necessary to render their dwelling habitable . They have raised several broods of birdlings , much to their own enjoyment , and of Mrs. Dudley 's bird-loving family . CHAPTER IV . HOME DUTIES AND HOME PLEASURES . Our robin has been a keeper-at-home ever since those four bluish-green eggs demanded her attention . She has occasionally left , for a few minutes at a time , to procure food and drink , or to take a little exercise ; but she has never forgotten her quiet abode , and the duties which there require her almost constant presence . She loves the green fields , the leafy trees , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mate over the fresh grass and the clean gravel-walks ; but better than all she loves those pretty eggs , which lie so cozily in the bottom of her straw-built nest . Before she commenced house-keeping , she was very fond of travelling , and many a mile has she wandered , over hill and valley , in company with her friends . She assisted at concerts , and was universally admired ; but she had the good sense to give up these enjoyments without a murmur , when higher claims called for her undivided care . Whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well ; and the robin will doubtless be repaid for the unwearied patience with which she performs her unostentatious duties . Some people are inclined to think domestic labour dishonourable , and the cares of house-keeping a burden ; but our feathered friend is wiser than they . She does with her might what she finds to do , and she does it heartily . Every act of duty , faithfully and cheerfully performed , is acceptable to God ; and his children do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupations in such a way as he can approve . If all house-keepers felt that , in attending to the different departments of their work as they should be attended to , they were honouring Him who has made this care necessary for the comfort of families , it would be a blessing to themselves , and to who all who dwell under the same roof with them . We can not consider any thing which we do to please our heavenly Father of small importance , and no favour can be degrading which he requires of us . We may all learn a lesson from the robin who lives in the honeysuckles , and we shall see how she was rewarded for her devotion to the employment which Providence assigned her . The wisest of men , in describing the character of an excellent woman , says : " The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her . " " She will do him good , and not evil , all the days of her life . " Our feathered friend 's husband is absent much of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his well-ordered home ; but he always thinks of it with pleasure , and hastens to it whenever he can find time to do so . Sometimes he only stops a moment , but it is a precious moment to them both , for their hearts and interests are one . They are cheered , in their separation , by the pleasant memories of these brief interviews , and by bright anticipations of future enjoyment . I have observed , Mr. Robin thinks it of importance to look nice at home , as well as when he is abroad . I have seen him alight on the walnut-tree , and carefully arrange his toilet , before going into the presence of his wife . She must feel complimented by this delicate attention , indicating so high a regard for her , and such anxiety to preserve her esteem . I should not wonder if she was a little proud of her handsome husband . However this may be , I am sure it is her greatest happiness to deserve his respect and love , and honourably to perform all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madam Robin was sitting one day in her vine-shaded home , looking out through the slender branches of the honeysuckle , which were gently swayed by a refreshing breeze , when she heard a slight tap . She listened eagerly . Another tap -- presently another . How her heart fluttered ! It proceeded from one of those highly-prized eggs , and she knew it was the timid knock of a birdling , who was in that little chamber , and was waiting to have the door opened . Of how small consequence all her self-denial and her seclusion from general society seemed , when that thrilling tap sounded on her ear ! She continued to listen , and within those four tiny chambers she heard the same rapping repeated ; and more than that , the sweet word , Mother , might seem faintly to greet her ear . How she longed for her mate to return , that he might enjoy , with her , this new happiness ! When husband and wife love each other , as they should , all pleasure must be shared , or it will still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming ; and when he alighted on the honeysuckle , she looked so full of grateful joy , that he knew that something more than usual must have occurred . He affectionately kissed her bill , and then , in a low tremulous voice , she told him the glad news . He was quite as much pleased as she , although he did not appear so excited . Had employment in the open air given a firmness to his nerves , which her sedentary occupations had not done for her ? Yet beneath that calm exterior , his sparkling eye plainly revealed the full tide of emotion within . It was pleasant music to their ears to hear those four new voices in their secluded home ; and though they knew it would increase their labour to provide food for those gaping mouths , what cared they for their own comfort , if they could nurture their precious charge , and rear them to be an honour and a blessing ? When the doors of their chambers were quite open , out came the baby-birds , with a few downy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Eddie , with one breath ; and , " How big their mouths are ! " with the next . To be sure , they do look very small , and their mouths are very large for such diminutive bodies , and they open them so wide that it almost seems as if one of them could jump down another 's throat . The robin now often comes home , and brings food to his family . It is gratifying to see how attentive he is to his dear children and their mother ; and I hope I may be able , some day , to tell you that they repay his attachment , by growing up fine , obedient birds . It will not be long before their education will be commenced , and I will tell you whether they are taught at home , or are sent away to school , and what progress they make in acquiring their accomplishments . CHAPTER V. HOME LIFE AND HOME EDUCATION . The birdlings still live in the honeysuckles . " How they do grow ! " Eddie exclaims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think they could ever have lived in those little eggs . " They are now almost half as large as the old birds . They are well covered with feathers , and their mottled breasts are very pretty . " They do n't have to dress as we do , " said Eddie . " Their clothes grow . " And he thinks it would be a great convenience if his clothes grew too , for then they would always be large enough for him , and his mother would not have so much sewing to do . Sometimes these little birds lie in the bottom of the nest , quietly sleeping , while their father and mother are both away , getting them food . At other times they feel wide awake . Then they stretch their wings , stand upon their feet , and peep over the side of the nest . From the parlour-window , the children can look up directly at their secluded home , and can see them amusing themselves and practising their lessons . The honeysuckle grows almost as fast as the birds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps off all the rain . The old birds are mindful of their children , but do not consider it necessary to be with them all the time . So other parents endeavour to implant good principles in the hearts of their children , and then leave them to their self-control ; ever keeping a watchful eye on the influences which surround them , and using their proper authority , when it becomes necessary , to restrain from evil , and guide in the way of virtue . The child that has never learned to depend upon himself , or to control his own passions , and to do right because it is right , will hardly be able to sustain himself when the presence of his parents is withdrawn . The robins know very well that children grow weary of long lectures ; so they give them here a little and there a little instruction , as occasion demands . They are decided in their family government , but not severe . Their children are taught to obey promptly and cheerfully , but they have no slavish fear of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for , at all suitable times , they have freely permitted their little ones to laugh and frolic to their hearts ' content . They willingly listen to all the plans of the birdlings , and lend an attentive ear to the story of their joys and their sorrows . Their sympathy is never withheld ; their griefs are never considered as of no consequence because they are brief and soon forgotten . The parent birds do not leave their young alone but a little while at a time . They often fly home to see them , and sometimes perch on the walnut-tree , and talk with them . Their musical chirpings are pleasant to hear . We do n't understand the bird-language ; but we judge , by the soft tones , that it is something kind and agreeable they are saying . Perhaps they are talking about their plans for the future , when they all know how to use their wings , and can fly about together . Very often , during the day , the robins bring worms to fill the gaping mouths . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have grown plump and large , for they eat and sleep as much as they please . We expect soon to see them flying about from tree to tree , and hopping along the ground . We hope that great cat , which steps about so softly , will never find them . She is welcome to all the rats and mice she can put her paws on , but we never like to see her climb a tree , for we fear she will destroy some of our cheerful friends , who build near the house in full confidence that they shall not be disturbed . The young robins are not lonely in their rural home . The plainly-dressed sparrows and the brilliant yellow-birds look in upon them , and , now and then , their cousin , the oriole , comes , clad in the richest golden plumage , and sings them a song . If he had dipped his feathers in the gorgeous sunset he could not be more beautiful . The delicate little humming-birds sip nectar from the deep horns of the honeysuckle ; and the red-winged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashing scarlet epaulette , occasionally comes from his home in the meadow , to make them a call . He does not like Honeysuckleville quite as well as his dwelling in the grass , just above the water . If he was not so confirmed in his habits , I think he would be strongly tempted to become a neighbour of the robins . A few weeks ago , when his favourite resort was five or six feet under water , he and his friends seemed to be in great uncertainty what course to pursue . They had several mass meetings on the quince-bushes , in full sight of Honeysuckleville , and a great many speeches were made . It sounded to me like incessant chattering , and as if all were talking at the same time . I could not understand a word they said , and I can not tell you the result of their deliberations . Whatever it may have been , when the water subsided , they returned to their old haunts by the river-side . These I have mentioned are not the only visitors whose society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , and greet them with their merry voices . The wren often favours them with one of his sweetest melodies , and the blue-bird flies around the corner to sing a song on the walnut-tree . He has a curious little nest of his own , hidden away under the eaves . The cat-birds , of course , are always near , as they live in the lilacs . The oriole has suspended his nest , like a basket , from a limb of the great pear-tree ; and when the robins know how to fly , they can return some of his visits . The old robins , now and then , play peep with the young birds . They fly almost up to the nest , and poise themselves for an instant on the wing , just long enough to say , " Bo-peep ! " and then away ! almost before they can be seen . Pretty soon they return again , generally bringing some nice morsel with them . They often first alight on a small branch of the vine , below the nest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birdlings keep up with their mother ! They like to talk as well as Eddie Dudley and some other children , whom I have heard pleasantly called little chatter-boxes . Children have much to learn , and must ask many questions . The world is new and strange to them , and is a constant source of surprise and wonder . I do not suppose people ever learn faster than before they are six years old , or ever learn more in the same length of time . They are constantly observing , and in this way the stock of their ideas is continually increasing . I once heard a gentleman say he did not like to go through the world with his head in a bag . He wished to see what was taking place around him , and it was this seeing , and thinking upon what he saw , that , among other things , made him a distinguished man . The young birds are now seeing and thinking , as well as birds can . Their time for action has not come . Like dear children in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life ; and , if they honour and obey their parents , as far as birds are expected to do , and as all children should , I doubt not they will faithfully perform the duties which will hereafter devolve upon them . From observations I have made , I conclude the robins neither send their children to school nor employ a governess for them . They have so made their arrangements that either one or the other has time to attend to their education . Sometimes the father , and at other times the mother , assumes the labour of teaching , and their dearly-loved pupils are quite as attentive to their instructions as any children I have ever seen . CHAPTER VI . GOING ABROAD . It was on a bright , warm , breezy morning in early June , that our friends at Honeysuckleville decided that the home education of their children had been attended with such success as to encourage the hope that they would " come out " creditably to themselves , and their parents . Arrangements were accordingly made , and I assure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the occasion . It was proposed to spend some weeks in travelling , that the young people might enjoy themselves , and acquire much useful information , which could be obtained no other way . The weather was delightful . A few light , fleecy clouds were floating in the blue sky , continually changing from one form of beauty to another . The sun shone forth in his splendour , cheering the tender grass and the up-springing seeds , and drawing them nearer and nearer to his bosom . They stretched toward him their feeble blades and diminutive leaves , as if they would gladly be clasped in his arms ; but their growing roots were striking deeper and deeper into mother earth , and binding them closer and closer to her . The gentle , cooling zephyrs were playing among the leaves , and winning sweet music from the tiny voices , which responded in glee to their salutations . Often they lifted the soft hair from the brows of the children , and frolicked amid their curls , and fanned their sun-burnt cheeks . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a finer day to start upon a journey . As birds do not need a change of dress , there was no trunk to pack , and no travelling-bag to be laden with comforts . All the preparation necessary was the usual attention to the toilet , and the instruction and advice which the exigency required . The hearts of the young adventurers fluttered with excitement . There was a mingling of curiosity to visit the great world of which they had heard such glowing descriptions , and of fears to trust themselves to the power of their wings to bear them from their pleasant , happy home , and keep them out of harm 's way . They had seen Pussy , as she walked about in her white and black robe , and though she seemed so gentle , they had been warned against her as one of their most deadly enemies . They knew she was often prowling about , with stealthy tread , to prey upon the unwary . They feared that , instead of flying to the walnut-tree , as was the plan , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them and destroy them , notwithstanding the screams and agonizing entreaties of their parents . Puss is a full believer in the doctrine that " might makes right ; " and she is as unmoved by the cries and appeals of her victims as if they had no hearts to suffer , and were made merely for her own use . Many words of encouragement were addressed to them by their parents . They told them how they themselves had suffered from similar fears ; how difficult it was for them to trust implicitly in the wisdom of their own father and mother ; and how they stood , tremulous and fearful , on the top of the nest , wishing they had sufficient resolution to obey , and yet fearing to venture ; but how easy and pleasant they found it to spread their wings in the air , and be borne up by it , when they fully determined to make the attempt . Our little birdlings still hesitated , just as I have seen children hesitate and quiver with terror when for the first time they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their father tells them the truth , for he has never deceived them . He has bound a life-preserver beneath their arms , and has promised to remain near , to catch them , if they begin to sink ; yet they are afraid , and draw back . They lack faith . When at last they timidly push from the shore , and find themselves buoyed up on the water , their delight is almost unbounded , and they are as unwilling to leave as they were reluctant to enter it . The old robins stood on one of the branches of the walnut-tree , and endeavoured to persuade their timid brood to come to them . They were not stern and severe , for they had not forgotten their own youth , and they sympathized deeply with these children ; but the father found he must be decided , so he told them , ( as it seemed , ) authoritatively , that they must hesitate no longer . He would count one -- two -- three ; and when he said three , they must spread their wings and do as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they determined to obey , whatever effort it might cost . " One -- two -- three , " counted the robin , in his full , musical tones . The birdlings fluttered their wings , and strained every nerve to alight by the side of their parents . With what joy they felt their feet clinging round the branch ! How elated they were with their success ! They chirped continually , and merry and brisk was the conversation . " What is this ? " one asked , and " What is that ? " said another , till it seemed as if the old birds would be weary of their questions ; but they never lost their patience ; they thought the little folks remarkably intelligent . When they were rested , away flew the birds to the elm , and called to their young . Grown courageous by success , they quickly followed , and , through the whole day , they were flying about from tree to tree , enjoying themselves highly . At sunset , I saw them on the locust-tree , near the cottage , inhaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering , perhaps , what occasioned all that glorious beauty , as the sun escaped from their view . Presently they flew to a great cherry-tree , and , from the chirping and calling , we concluded they spent the night in its shelter . How strange it must have been to them , this first night of their perching ! The sky was clear , the stars twinkled , and the half-moon shed her silvery light on the earth , and gleamed through the cherry-leaves , as it had done through the honeysuckles ; but it was not home , that cherry-tree , and they sighed as they thought of their birthplace . They sat close to their mother 's side , and felt that , after all , where she was , was the best place for them . They curled up one foot into the soft down , and turned back their heads till their bills were beneath their wings . The lids slowly closed over their eyes , and they slept quietly and sweetly , till wakened in the morning by the warbling of songsters who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled their hearts . They were no longer mere children , their every want supplied by others ; but they were youth , and must begin to provide for themselves , and depend upon their own energies . We frequently hear the young robins among the trees , but we seldom see them . We really miss them , and think of them as pleasant visitors who have been spending a few days with us . We hope that Honeysuckleville will not be forsaken ; but that every year the birds will return , and rear their young beneath its fragrant shade , making hearts of the little Dudleys glad , and teaching them to love . " All things , both great and small ; For the dear God who loveth us , Hath made and loveth all . " Illustration " MAY I POP SOME CORN ? " " May I pop some corn ? " asked Eddie . " Yes , " answered his mother ; and laying down her work , she went to the closet and got for him several small ears -- some red and some white -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of common corn . Eddie took a white bowl and sat down on the carpet by his mother with the tiny ears in his apron . He worked away for some time , shelling first one ear and then another , till every little kernel was in the bowl , and nothing but cobs left . These he thought would help to build a " log-house , " so he put them in his play-box , with those he had treasured before , and took his bowl to the kitchen . Kate , the cook , was a coloured woman , and she loved children . When he said to her , " Mother told me I might pop some corn , " she cheerfully placed the iron pan on the stove , and when it was hot enough , told him he might put in the corn . Pretty soon it went Pop ! pop ! pop ! till the pan was filled with snow-white kernels . Eddie always wondered how they could turn inside out and suddenly grow so large . He did not understand that it was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard case , which then burst open to find more room . Illustration : Eddie popping corn . Eddie was very busy for some time in the kitchen attending to his corn . When it was all done , he separated that which was popped from that which was only parched , and put it in different dishes . He gave his dog Philo some of the brown kernels , and he seemed to like them as well as Eddie himself . Eddie enjoyed hearing him crack them with his sharp teeth , and would stroke his great head , and say kindly , " Poor Philo ! you are a good Philo ; " and the dog would wag his tail as much as to say , " Dear Eddie ! you are a good Eddie . " After giving Philo his share , and Kate hers , Eddie carried up a large dishful to his mother and the children . He did not wish to eat it all himself for he was a generous boy and always liked to have others partake of his pleasures , whatever they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tumbler , which he placed on his mother 's work-table . Mrs. Dudley took a little , saying to him , " If you miss your corn , Eddie , you will know what has become of it . " He looked up from his play quite soberly , and said slowly , " Mother , if you wish to eat more you may , but I am not going to . " " Why not , my child ? " " I am going to save it for father . " Mrs. Dudley was pleased to see Eddie willing to deny himself to give to others , so she said to him , " That is right . " When his father came home from his business , Eddie placed the tumbler beside his plate on the tea-table . After the blessing was asked , Mr. Dudley , looking at the children , inquired , " Where did this come from ? " " I popped it , " answered Eddie . And his father thanked him with a kind and loving smile . Eddie was much happier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he had made others happy by his generosity . " It is more blessed to give than to receive , " the Bible tells us ; and Eddie had been learning this truth in the great pleasure he felt in dividing his popped corn with others . I hope you who read this story know how to sympathize with him . If you do not , will you try the experiment , and see if you are not far happier to share your corn , or your candy , or whatever else you may have , with your brothers and sisters , and those around you , than you are to devour it yourself ? I have seen little chickens seize their favourite morsel and run away and hide where they could eat it all alone ; but I should be sorry to think that any child would do so . " WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER I SHOULD DO ? " " Which would you rather I should do ? " asked Eddie of his mother , his large blue eyes filling with tears . " I should rather you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then I will , mother ! " and the tears remained where they were , and did not chase each other down his plump cheeks . A trembling smile played around his mouth ; for he had conquered himself , and had readily yielded to his mother 's wishes . There had been a struggle , severe , but short , in his mind , and when he said , " Then I will , mother , " he meant he could be happy to stay at home , and would not ask again for permission to go with the other children . Mrs. Dudley could not resist the impulse to clasp him to her heart , and tell him he was a good boy ; and this made him still happier . He saw he had pleased her , and her approving smile was worth more to him than any enjoyment could be without it . Eddie , you know , is a little boy , five years old . He has brothers and sisters older than himself , and they have fine sport in sliding and skating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they come home in high spirits , swinging their skates by their sides , and talking loud and fast about it . Eddie has watched them many days from the nursery window , and has longed to be with them ; but his careful mother has feared he would get hurt among so many skaters , or perhaps be lost in one of those " air-holes " which are often found in the most solid ice ; so when Eddie asked her if he might go to the river , she hesitated , for she did not like to deny him . " Which would you rather I would do ? " then inquired the dear boy ; and when his mother told him , he did not tease her , but resumed his place at the window . Mrs. Dudley resolved to go herself with her little son to the river , when the children went again . She did not tell him so , however ; but the next day , when the merry skaters were in the midst of their enjoyment , she put on her hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calling Eddie to her , wrapped him in his wadded coat and woollen tippet , and placing on his head his " liberty-cap , "  - -  knit of red and black worsted , with a tassel dangling from the point -- and pulling it well down over his ears , and covering his fat hands with warm mittens , they started out on the white snow . The snow was frozen sufficiently to bear them , and they had a pleasant walk above the hidden grass and stones . Eddie was in great glee . His mother enjoyed it almost as much as he did , for it was an exhilarating sight . Some of the boys were sliding , some skating , and others pushing sleds before them , on which a mother or sister were sitting . It reminded one of the pictures we often see of skating in Holland ; and , to make the resemblance more perfect , a Dutchman was there with his pipe , defiling the pure , fresh air with its foul odour . Mrs. Dudley was invited to take a ride , and , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated on one of the sleds , and speeding away before a rapid skater . She found it far more swift and agreeable than riding in the usual way . Eddie , too , had a ride , and his little heart was brimfull of happiness . He walked about on the ice quite carefully and fearlessly . The river , on which these children were , rises and falls with the tide . Eddie saw other boys sliding off towards an icy meadow bordering on it , and he thought he would go too . The ice formed an inclined plane ; his feet slipped on its smooth surface , and down he went ; he jumped up , but the blood from his nose , flowing over his face and coat , and staining the snow , frightened him , and he uttered a loud cry . The skaters were with him before his mother , though she was but a few steps away , for she could not move as quickly as they . It was pleasant to see their sympathy , and hear their kind inquiries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cut by the ice as they feared . The blood from his nose testified to a pretty hard bump . He soon forgot the pain , and was as happy as ever . He will long remember his first sled ride on the river . Why do you think , dear children , I have told you this story about a child whom you have never seen ? I wanted to ask you , or rather have you ask yourselves , if you are willing , as Eddie was , to do as your mother thinks best ? Much as he wanted to go on the river , he felt satisfied to do as his mother wished . I hope , when you know what your mother prefers , you will make up your minds to give up your own plans , and be happy in doing so . I am not one of those who imagine children have no trials . I know their lives are not all bright and sunny . I have not forgotten being a child myself . Many a hard battle has to be fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; resolve to conquer yourselves , and subdue every thing that is sinful . Every victory will make you stronger , and render it easier for you to do right . Will you try ? " If at first you do n't succeed , Try , try again . " THE BIRDS AND THE SNOW-STORM . The weather is warm and sunny . The snow of winter has disappeared . The grass is green , and growing finely . The early spring-flowers have opened their blossoms , and we all think summer is so near , that the cold weather must be over . The birds have thought so , too ; for they are flying from tree to tree , singing most beautiful melodies , and peeping about , here and there , making arrangements for summer , and selecting places where to build their pretty nests . But the wind blows chill again . The sky is clouded , and people begin to say , " I think we shall have another snow-storm . " It is not long before the feathery flakes begin to descend . The earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are melted and absorbed . The snow continues to fall , the earth grows colder and colder , and soon it can not melt the snow , but is itself chilled , and accepts it as a mantle . For three days the storm rages . The ground is as white as in mid-winter . What is to become of the birds ? They can find neither food nor shelter . It is painful to see them flying distractedly through the storm , not knowing where to go ; but too cold and too hungry to remain in the trees , and too fearful to seek comfort in the many warm houses , that would have opened their windows , if they would have entered under their protecting roof . Mrs. Dudley 's children are all watching them from the windows , and throwing out hominy and bread-crumbs for them to eat . How cold the little sparrows look , as they pick up their food ! Children 's hearts are generally tender , and always so unless they have been hardened by the practice of cruelty , and Mrs. Dudley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh ! mother ! " said Eddie , the youngest , " if the birds knew how we loved them , they would come into the house ; " but the birds did not know , and they stayed out in the snow , and many of them perished . The children were sadly grieved , when , after the storm , they found many of their feathered friends dead . How much they regretted they could not have saved their lives ! If the birds had only known , as Eddie said , how much the children loved them , they would have flown into the house , and been warmed and fed . There are many dear children who do not know how much Jesus loves them ; how much he wishes them to enter the " ark of safety , " and escape the dangers there are in the world . There are many who have not even heard of him ; and many of those who have , do not know he is their best friend . Do you know how much he loves you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that surround you ? If you have not found refuge in that " high tower , " of which David speaks in the Psalms , you are no safer than were the birds flying through the cold snow , and you surely will be lost if you do not fly to that kind Saviour , who has prepared a way of escape for you . Illustration THE FIRST STRAWBERRY . How bright and red it looked , half-concealed as it was by the green leaves ! It was the first strawberry of the season . Mary gathered it with delight , and ran with it to her mother . " Here is something for you , mother , " she said , holding up the rosy treasure . " Thank you , my dear ! " said Mrs. Dudley , smiling upon her daughter . She ate it with a double relish . She was very fond of the fruit , and she was gratified by this expression of the thoughtful , unselfish love of her dear child . How much more Mary enjoyed that look of love , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luscious strawberry herself ! Every day , Mary , Willie , and Eddie search for the fruit as it ripens , and almost every evening their father and mother find a saucer of berries , with sugar and cream , beside their plates at the tea-table . How pleasant it is to see children think so much of their parents ! I hope they will continue obedient and attentive , for there is no more beautiful sight than an affectionate , united family . God will bless those who honour their parents . " I PRAYED ALL DAY FOR HELP . " It was a beautiful evening early in June . The air was cool and pleasant . The trees and shrubs were covered with luxuriant foliage , and the roses were in their opening beauty . The frogs were croaking in the pond , and the birds singing on the trees . The sun had just sunk beneath the horizon . The clouds which lingered around his pathway received his parting rays , and were most gorgeously decorated with the richest of his colouring . Willie walked about the lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dark gray eye bright with happiness . His heart was attuned to harmony with all nature around him , and he would frequently look up to his mother , who sat by the open window , enjoying the delightful evening . Presently Willie came , and stood by her side . " How happy I am this evening ! " he said to her . She put her arm around him , and drew him towards her . " What makes you so happy ? " she inquired . " Because I have been trying to control my temper , I suppose "  - -  was his answer . " You have not been angry to-day , have you ? " " No , mother . " " Did you pray about it , Willie ? " " Yes , mother . I prayed all day for help . " " How did you pray ? " " I said , Forgive my sins , and give me a new heart . " " God heard your prayers , and he has helped you to control your temper . God always hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope you will never forget to pray for what you need , " said his mother . Willie smiled , and kissed her , and went out of doors again to enjoy the evening --  " So cool , so calm , so bright . " Willie is generally a good boy , but he has a quick temper . When three or four years old , he would sometimes get very angry . I have even known him to throw things at children with whom he was playing , if they did any thing to offend him . He did so one day when his mother was from home . She was much grieved when she heard it , and talked seriously with him . It made a deep impression on his mind . He speaks of it now with great solemnity , and asks his mother if she remembers it . He feels that he committed a great sin . He knows it is wrong to let his temper govern his reason , and he is struggling to control himself . I think he will succeed . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember hearing him say that he was naturally quick-tempered ; but , although I lived in the same house with him , and saw him under a great variety of circumstances , I never heard him speak a hasty word . I hope Willie will obtain as perfect control over himself , and , if he lives to manhood , that his friends will be able to say of him what I can say of his grandfather . Willie was , at one time , playing with some children , and found he was growing angry . He immediately left them , and sat down on the stairs alone . Pretty soon they followed him . He did not feel entirely good-natured , so he again left them , and went into the library . He shut the door and prayed to his Father in heaven for strength to conquer himself . He remained there alone till he felt he had obtained the victory . Willie is not the only little boy who has a quick temper , and I tell this story about him for the sake of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Willie , they will learn to go to God for help , and then , like his , their countenances will be radiant with gladness ; and they , too , can say , " How happy I am ! " " An angry man stirreth up strife , and a furious man aboundeth in transgression . " " He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty ; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city . " " He that hath no rule over his own spirit , is like a city that is broken down , and without walls . " " EVER SO MANY BEAUTIFUL THINGS . " " There are ever so many beautiful things up in the sky , mother ! " said little Eddie , as he sat in his mother 's lap , leaning his head upon her encircling arm . The clouds had gathered about the horizon , and assumed many beautiful and fantastic shapes . Some of them were gorgeously coloured with the rays of the departing sun , and were shaded from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the sun receded farther and farther behind the green hills , they grew darker and darker , and the imaginative boy had seen fancied ships with their sails spread ; steam-vessels with clouds of smoke rolling from their chimneys ; mountains piled upon mountains ; trees , birds , and many other wondrous things which filled his infant mind with admiration . Soon the stars twinkled forth , and they awoke a new interest . At first they appeared one by one , as if timidly venturing to look down upon our beautiful planet , and when fully assured that the king of day had disappeared , they came forth faster and more numerously , till the whole heavens were bespangled with their glittering brightness . Then their companion , the moon , came slowly up , shining with a soft and mellow light , a new beauty in the " blue wilderness of interminable air . " Eddie had long gazed silently before he uttered the exclamation , " There are ever so many beautiful things up in the sky ! " and I suppose he had many thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . He did not often sit up so late that he could see the stars . Eddie is not the only one who has been charmed with the glowing sunset , the gray twilight , or the starry firmament . David loved to look upon the works of God . In one of his psalms , he says , " When I consider the heavens , the work of thy fingers , the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained , what is man , that thou art mindful of him , and the son of man , that thou visitest him ! " It was astonishing to David , that God , who was so infinitely superior to man , and who had given such proofs of his power and greatness in the creation of the heavens , should condescend to notice him , to provide for his minutest wants , and to protect him from danger . I suppose this psalm was written in the night , when the sweet singer of Israel had been looking at just such a sky as drew from Eddie his exclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , how wonderful it is that God has made every thing so beautiful . We need never be weary in studying his works . The more we learn of them , the more we realize his greatness and perfection . " The heavens declare the glory of God , and the firmament showeth his handiwork . " When you look at the clear blue sky , do you remember who has spread it out , and who has created the innumerable worlds which we see , when darkness covers our earth ? " There are , " indeed , " ever so many beautiful things up in the sky , " and it was a Father 's hand that placed them there . They are for us to enjoy , and many a lesson of love and confidence have they taught God 's children . Dear little Eddie ! I hope he will always love nature , and early learn to " look through nature up to nature 's God . " I shall never forget a drive with my father , when I was a child so small that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between him and my mother . We were returning from a visit to Aunt Harriet , at whose house we had been spending the day . It was a fine evening . The air was balmy and pleasant . I remember how the frogs sung in the low ground , and how we listened to their quaint music . We had not ridden far before the moon rose , and the stars , one by one , appeared . My father had a true love for nature , and for whatever was beautiful or grand . We drove on without speaking for a time , each enjoying the evening . My father broke the silence by repeating that beautiful hymn of Addison 's , commencing with these lines --  " The spacious firmament on high , With all the blue ethereal sky , And spangled heavens , a shining frame , Their great Original proclaim . " I was awed by the reverence of his manner , and I felt myself in the presence of my Maker ,  - -  a mere speck amid his vast creations . An ineffaceable impression was made on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died many years ago , while I was still a child , but the lesson of that hour has not been forgotten . Illustration LILY AND HER DUCKLINGS . The white duck , Lily , made a nest on the ground , in a small enclosure , from which some tame rabbits had been removed . She gathered the scattered straw into one corner , and made a much neater nest than the other ducks did , who laid their eggs under the wood-pile among the small chips . She laid several large , smooth , white eggs , and when she had as many as she could conveniently take care of , she began to sit on them to keep them warm , till the little ducks should be ready to peck their way out . She plucked the soft white down from her breast , to line the nest , and to make it of a more even temperature for the eggs ; and , whenever she left to procure food , or to take a short swim on the pond , she carefully covered them . The duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so she has to be much more particular about her nest . She makes it deeper and warmer than Biddy . It is wonderful with what skill all animals rear their young . It shows the great goodness and kindness of God , that he should thus fit the creatures he has made for the duties they must perform . His care is continual , not only over us , but over them all . He hears the young ravens when they cry , and the ducks and the chickens are not forgotten by him . To the duck he has not given the brooding wings of the hen-mother ; but he has given her a coat of down , from which she can make a warm bed for her cherished eggs . It was a very pretty sight to see Lily on her nest , almost covered by the straw , her head turned back , and her broad yellow bill partially hidden beneath her wing . The down lay scattered about like snow-flakes . She looked patient and hopeful , as she opened her eyes to see who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of food , she acts so queerly that you would surely laugh to see her , if you are not accustomed to her odd ways . She bends her head back , and draws it close to her body , and waddles about in the greatest haste , quacking all the time . Lily waited four weeks before the ducklings appeared . Some of the brood were of a straw-colour , and some were marked with spots of black . They were all pretty . When I first saw them , they were partly hidden beneath their mother . Their glossy bills and bright eyes were visible , but they were afraid to venture from their shelter . They were provided with water and food in the old rabbit-house , because , if they followed their mother to the pond , the musk-rats would probably devour some of them . While the little ones remained with their mother , they were safe , but when they became discontented , and wandered from home , they were sometimes lost . The rats were their principal enemies , and those from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurking about to catch the ducklings , and sometimes the defenseless little ones ran directly into their deep holes , from which there was no possibility of escape . Quite a number of Lily 's family came to an untimely end in this way . When I saw them roving about in the high grass , seeking in vain to find their way to their mother 's presence , and hearing their calls for help , and her answering cry of distress , I could but think of the dear children who forget their mother 's counsel , and leave her protection before they are old enough to take care of themselves . The ducklings , I observed , did not know who were their friends ; for , one day , when the prettiest of the brood had found a way out of the rabbit-house , I thought I would catch it , and give it back to its mother . It was much alarmed , and Lily was in equal trouble . It ran away from me , thinking , perhaps that I was a greater enemy than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as I was going to put my hand on it , it hid itself in a rat-hole , from which there was no escape . I could not rescue it , neither could its mother . The next morning , when I went to look at the ducks , and give them their breakfast , there lay the poor duckling , close by the fatal hole . The rat had brought it out , and partly devoured it . Children often think they know what is best for them quite as well , if not better , than their parents , and when told not to do this or that , they are not satisfied to obey quietly , but ask , " Why not ? " I think children may often be told why they are bidden to do this , or forbidden to do that ; but they should obey their parents promptly , whether they know their reasons or not . Sometimes there are reasons which children can not understand , sometimes there are reasons which it would not be wise to tell them , and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherefore . Children are commanded to obey their parents , not the reasons their parents may give them . The young ducks could not understand why their mother did not wish them to go out of that enclosure . They could not comprehend the dangers which surrounded them . They saw the birds flying about in the air , and heard the hum of the bees as they were going abroad for honey , or returning loaded to the hive , and they could not understand why they might not wander about too . The red clover looked very beautiful , and the white clover was so fragrant , they longed to ramble in it . They thought their mother unnecessarily strict , because she wished to keep them with her , instead of permitting them to see all the pretty things of which they could now and then catch a glimpse , as they peeped through the cracks of the rabbit-house . Children sometimes feel unpleasantly because they are not permitted to play in the street . Ah ! they are as ignorant of danger as the poor ducklings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are exposed . Even if their mother should explain it to them , they could realize but little about it . It is by far the better way for children to feel that their mother knows best , and to be satisfied that her reasons are good and sufficient even if they do not know what they are . I once heard a distinguished clergyman say he had always observed that those persons who had learned to obey their parents promptly , most readily yielded to the claims of God , and became converted , while those who had always liked their own way had generally a long , severe struggle , before they were willing to give up their sins , and oftentimes could not make up their minds to do so , and , though deeply convicted , remained impenitent . It is a fearful thought that , if you form a habit of disobedience to your parents , it may cost you the salvation of your soul . PRAYING FOR RAIN . It was the first of July . There had been no rain for several weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The farmer looked anxiously upon his fields of corn , whose deep green leaves had not yet begun to turn yellow , and upon the potatoes , whose blossoms were still unwithered . They could not long remain thus beautiful and thriving , if the refreshing rain was withheld . The ground was so dry that , in hoeing the garden , no moisture could be observed . Mrs. Dudley talked with her children about the need of rain , and the propriety of praying to our heavenly Father to water the earth , that it might " bring forth and bud , " and " give seed to the sower , and bread to the eater . " She told them how Elijah prayed for rain , after there had been none in the land of Canaan for three years and six months , and how God heard his prayer , " and the heaven gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit . " This great drought was a judgment upon the people of Israel for their sin in departing from God , and worshipping idols . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain , a " sore famine . " We read in the book of Kings of one poor woman , who had only a handful of meal in a barrel , and a little oil in a cruse . When Elijah met her , and asked her for water , and a morsel of bread , she told him this was all she had , and that she was gathering two sticks , that she might bake it for herself and her son , that they might eat and die ! She know not where to find any more food for herself or her child , and expected to " pine away , stricken through for want of the fruits of the field , " and to die with hunger . Elijah bid her not to fear , but go and do what she had said . He asked her to make him a little cake first , and bring it to him , and afterwards make one for herself and son . " For thus saith the Lord God of Israel , the barrel of meal shall not waste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth . " It would not have been strange , if this widow of Zarephath had been unwilling to divide her handful of meal with Elijah , or if she had doubted the promise which was made to her , but she did not . She baked the little cake for the stranger , and afterwards one for herself and her boy , and there was plenty of meal and of oil left for another repast . " She , and he , and her house , did eat of it many days . " The barrel of meal wasted not , neither did the cruse of oil fail , till the Lord sent rain upon the earth , and her wants could be supplied in the usual way . She did not lose the reward promised to those who give a cup of cold water to the friends of God . God does not willingly afflict the creatures he has made . He is a gracious God , merciful , and of great kindness , and has compassion even on the beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nineveh , because its inhabitants humbled themselves before him , and turned from their evil way , after having sent him to prophesy to them that in forty days it should be overthrown , he said to Jonah , " Should I not spare Nineveh , that great city , wherein are more than six-score thousand persons that can not discern between their right hand and their left ; and also much cattle ? " In this long drought in the land of Canaan , the cattle must have suffered greatly , and many of them probably perished . Indeed , we read that Ahab , the king of Israel , and Obadiah , the governor of his house , searched the land for the fountains and brooks , to find grass to save , the horses and mules alive , that they might not be all lost . God is a Father , and , like a tender , loving father , he removes his chastisements so soon as they have produced the effect designed . He was " grieved for the misery of Israel . " He told Elijah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , when he saw him , asked , " Art thou he that troubleth Israel ? " Elijah answered , it was Ahab , and his father 's house , who troubled Israel , because they had forsaken the commandments of the Lord , and worshipped Baalim . Elijah went up to the top of Mount Carmel , and earnestly prayed for rain . God had promised that he would send it , and Elijah no doubt pleaded this promise , as he interceded with him . He directed his servant to go where he could look towards the sea . He went and looked , and said , " There is nothing . " Elijah was not discouraged . He knew God would remember his promise , and he sent him seven times more . The seventh time the servant returned , and said , " Behold , there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea , like a man 's hand . " It grew rapidly larger and larger , till the sky was black with clouds and wind , and there was a great rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man availeth much , " and he mentions this instance of prevailing prayer in Elijah , as an encouragement to all Christians to ask for needed blessings . " Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are , " he tells us , and if he prevailed with God , so may others . God is the " same yesterday , to-day , and forever . " He does not change . He is always a hearer of prayer . Mrs. Dudley also told her children that God hears the cry of all who are in distress . She referred to one of the psalms of David , where he describes a storm at sea , and the great terror of the sailors . " Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble , and he delivers them out of their distresses . " God does not forget any creature he has made . He provides the springs and the streams to give drink to the beasts of the field , and to the birds which sing among the branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and herb for the service of man . He feeds the fowls , and clothes the flowers with beauty . He has taught us to ask for our daily bread , and as this must depend upon fruitful seasons it is proper we should ask for rain , whenever it is needed . The children were quite interested in what their mother had told them . They knew that she earnestly desired rain , and that she often asked God to send it , before vegetation perished for want of it . They watched the sky with great anxiety , and when it became cloudy , and continued so from day to day , they thought surely a storm was near . After several days , there was a slight shower , but not enough to refresh the plants . Mary was greatly disappointed " I thought , " ( she said to her mother , ) " it was going to rain in answer to your prayer . " " I thank God for that little rain , " said Eddy , as he talked about it . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pray for more , it was so much needed . The next Sunday Mrs. Dudley was not well , and could not attend church . When her children returned she asked Mary if they prayed for rain . " No , mother ! " she answered ; " but I did . " The sky continued cloudy for some time , and then the rain gently fell for a day and a night , and all nature was refreshed and cheered . Soon afterwards I left Mrs. Dudley 's family . When I had been absent about a fortnight , I received a letter from Mary . She told me about the bantams , and the flowers , and many other things in which I was interested . She wrote that it had " rained on Sunday , and all day Monday . I can not help thinking , " she continued , " how good God is to send us rain when we most need it , and what cause we have for thanksgiving . " I hope Mrs. Dudley 's children will never forget that God is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have people ask him for what they need . Children should think of God as their best friend , and should go to him in prayer , feeling as sure he can and does hear them , as they are that their mother does . In a season of drought they should ask him for rain , and when he sends it to make vegetation grow , they should thank him for that evidence of his loving-kindness . THE GRAPE-CLUSTERS . Very beautiful were the grape-clusters as they hung on the graceful vine , and very tempting to the hand that was near enough to pluck them . Two little boys came on an errand to the lady who lived in the house which the grape-vine shaded . It was reviving to come out of the city 's heat and dust , and enter that pleasant parlour , screened from the fiercer rays of the summer 's sun by its green curtain of leaves . The hot pavement and the glaring walls of the city seemed far distant , for the charm of the country was spread over that retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace and quiet reigned within . The lady was sitting at her desk , writing , when the boys entered . She spoke to them kindly , for they were objects of her kind care , although they did not live with her . They handed her a note which required an answer . She gave them permission to play in the yard , while she should write it . They were very happy , for it was an unusual pleasure for them . They examined the flowers which grew in the narrow bed by the high , close fence , and then they began to look wistfully at the rich bunches of grapes , which were within their reach . The lady had not told them that they might gather any , and they felt that they ought not to do so . But the tempter was near , and they listened to his suggestions . Illustration : The lady was sitting at her desk writing , when the boys entered . Looking towards the house to see if they were observed , they cautiously went up to the vine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate them secretly , that they might avoid detection ; but although they knew it not , there was an eye in the house that saw them , and there was another eye from which their act was not hid -- the eye of the all-seeing God . When the note was written , the boys were recalled to the parlour , and pleasantly dismissed . I think they must have felt somewhat ashamed , that they had abused the confidence reposed in them , and had been guilty of stealing from their kind friend . After they left , the lady was informed what they had done . When she visited " the home , " where they lived , she mentioned the fact to their teacher , although she did not allude to it to them . The teacher took occasion to talk with her scholars about being honest and trustworthy , and asked them what they should think of children who , when sent on errands and permitted to go into the yard to enjoy themselves , should stealthily take the fruit which grew there . They , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they needed , and endeavoured to impress its importance upon their minds . Soon after the close of the school , the two boys who had taken the grapes went to her and told her what they had done . She talked with them kindly . They seemed truly penitent . She asked them if they would like to go to the lady and acknowledge their fault . They said they should , and immediately they put on their straw hats , and their clean sacks , and went cheerfully to make all the reparation in their power for the fault they had committed . Confession is always pleasant to the truly penitent . Again they stood in that shaded parlour . They were affectionately welcomed as before . They confessed freely and fully , what they had done on their previous visit , and asked forgiveness , which was readily granted . Just as they were leaving , they turned and inquired , " Can you ever trust us again ? " The lady assured them that she could , and they went away happy and strengthened in their good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the children . Their characters have much improved and they have been , in all respects , more conscientious and trustworthy . One of the boys has , I think , found a Christian home , and the other is waiting for one . " IT ALMOST MAKES ME CRY . " " It almost makes me cry to think of the heathen , " said Willie Dudley , as he was standing by his mother 's work-table , with his elbow leaning upon it , and his head resting upon his hand . " I do n't wonder missionaries go to them . " His face was thoughtful and sad , and the tears stood in his eyes . He had just been looking at two hideous idols , which had been brought from Africa , and his mother had been telling him that the heathen thought they were gods , and prayed to them . Little Eddie wondered that any people could think these stone images were God . His large , blue eyes looked larger and rounder than ever , they were so filled with amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , mother ! oh , mother ! " in tones which indicated surprise , pity , and horror . Mrs. Dudley told her children that the heathen had not been taught , as we have , that God is a spirit , and that they had never learned the commandment , " Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in the heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth ; thou shalt not bow down thyself to them , nor serve them ; for I , the Lord thy God , am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me , and keep my commandments . " " I do n't wonder that the missionaries go to them , " was the sentiment on the mind of Willie , as he thought of the ignorance and degradation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , and our blessed Saviour , and he knew that God required a pure and spiritual worship . He knew God was the Creator of the world , and that his power and glory could not well be represented or conceived by man . He had often heard of the heathen , and had read about their idols , but to see and handle a stone head which had been actually an object of religious worship , made it seem much more real to him than ever before , that there are many people who have never learned to worship the true God . Willie has always had a great reverence for his heavenly Father . Several years ago , he was reading a description of one of the idols of the Hindoos . The picture was disgustingly repulsive . He went to Mrs. Dudley with his book , saying , " Mother , I do n't like to call g-o-d God here ; I want to call it d-o-g , for I do n't think it is right to call such a thing by that great name . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach the glad tidings of salvation to those who are now sitting in darkness , and in the shadow of death . But if he is not a missionary himself , I trust he will never forget to do what he can for those who , far from their homes and their friends , are fulfilling Christ 's last command , to " go into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature . " All Christians can not be missionaries , but they can all do something to spread a knowledge of true religion throughout the world . They can contribute of their property to this noble purpose . Our heavenly Father accepts the smallest gift , offered in love . We , surely , who live in comfortable homes , and are surrounded by so much that is pleasant , should never forget those who , in foreign lands , are preaching the " unsearchable riches of Christ . " If our Saviour were now upon the earth , I suppose dear children , you think it would be a great pleasure to minister to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any thing he might need . It is delightful to know that what we do for those who love him , he accepts as done to himself . In his Holy Word he says , " Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these , my brethren , ye have done it unto me . " THE BOY WHO STEALS . Mrs. Dudley was sitting at her dining-table . The dessert was before her . There were fine , red water-melons , rich and juicy , with glossy black seeds peeping out from their hiding-places , and musk-melons , fragrant and luscious , which grew in her own garden . They had been gathered early in the morning , by George and Willie , and placed in the cellar , that they might be cool and refreshing . The boys had assisted in planting them in the spring , and with their little hoes they had worked about them during the summer , and subdued the weeds . They had watched their growth , and every day they examined the vines to find those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were so many that their wheelbarrow was quite full . Then they had the pleasure of carrying some to their neighbours . Mrs. Dudley did not consider good ripe fruit injurious , but much more healthy , in summer , than meat , puddings , and pastries , so that melons formed quite an important part of the family dinner . The children enjoyed them particularly , because they had raised them , in part , by their own industry . George asked to be excused from the table . Not long after he left , Mrs. Dudley heard a cry , as if some child was in trouble . She looked around . Mary , and Willie , and Eddie were there . The sounds of distress could not come from George , for he never cried in that way . Mr. and Mrs. Dudley immediately arose and went out upon the lawn . The children followed . They looked here and there , and soon saw a boy near the house . He had a small bundle in his hand , and a little tin pail . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was crying , and calling to a boy who stood at the gate . Mr. Dudley inquired of him , " What is the matter ? " " John wo n't let me go home . " " How does he prevent you ? What does he do to you ? " asked Mrs. Dudley . " He wo n't let me alone . " " Does he try to make you fight ? " she again inquired , for she had frequently seen that large boys often love to tease and torment smaller ones , and she thought perhaps this little fellow was abused by a tyrannical companion . She thought of going to speak to the boy at the gate , but Mr. Dudley made further inquiries , and the child 's answers were not very satisfactory . Mary Dudley now came near her mother , and , speaking in a low voice , said to her , " That is the boy who steals . " While they were talking with him a larger boy came up , and said his teacher had sent him and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why , what has he done ? " asked one of the group which surrounded him . " He has been stealing the children 's dinners . He stole yesterday , and he has been stealing to-day . " This was a sad account to hear . Jimmy begged to be permitted to go home , but Mr. Dudley told him he had better return to the school . He then very reluctantly walked down to the gate with the largest boy , and I suppose was led back to his teacher . Mrs. Dudley had never heard of this child before , but Mr. Dudley said he had known him as a very bad boy . She asked Mary how she happened to know any thing about him . Mary told her that he attended Sunday-school , and that , a few Sundays before , one of the children could not find his cap . A thorough search was made for it , but it could not be found . The superintendent thought some one must have taken it . He suspected Jimmy , because his reputation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jimmy had it on his head , and his own cap was hidden under his sack ! The superintendent of the school talked with Jimmy , who said he would never steal again ; but , alas ! he soon forgot his good resolution . Although he carried a dinner for himself in his tin pail , he took whatever he liked from the baskets of his companions . Mrs. Dudley has seen this boy several times since she heard him crying on the lawn . She says it always makes her feel sad to meet him , for she can not avoid thinking ,  --  " that is the boy who steals . " She has learned that he has no father or mother , but lives with his grandparents . I fear he " will bring down their gray hairs with sorrow to the grave . " He has allowed himself to steal small things , and as he grows older he will probably take articles of more value . He may become a housebreaker or a murderer . It is dangerous to indulge in the least sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that still , small voice , which so often tells children , when they are tempted to do wrong , " That is not right ; you should not do that . " In some Catechism the question is asked , " What is my duty to my neighbour ? " and a part of the answer is , " To keep my hands from picking and stealing . " I suppose " picking " must mean , secretly taking little pieces of cake , or sugar , or any thing of the kind , of small value . I presume Jimmy was in the habit of " picking , " at his grandmother 's before he ventured to steal at school . I could tell you several very sad stories of people who have stolen when they were children , and who have grown more and more wicked , as they have advanced in years , till they became a curse to society and themselves . " The way of transgressors is hard . " These people have no true enjoyment . There is always a fearful looking forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write about bad children , and I should not do it if it were not to warn the dear children I so much love against the formation of wrong and sinful habits . How much better it would be for Jimmy if he had learned to " touch not , taste not , handle not , " that which does not belong to him ! Illustration LOOK AT THE BIRDS ! October , with its golden and crimson hues , its " gentle wind , " and its " fair sunny noon , " has passed away . November has come . The sun shines brightly , and the sky is almost clear of clouds ; but the chill wind blows roughly , and the leaves are rudely torn from the trees where they have gladdened us through the spring and the summer by their refreshing shade , their modest beauty , and their sweet music , as they sung to the gentle breeze which played amid the branches . They lie now , most of them , beneath the trees , wrinkled and faded , or scattered here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast has wafted them . The birds have been taught by their unfailing instinct that summer has departed , and winter is near . They no more warble their rich melodies , or flit in and out of the bowery recesses of the honeysuckles or peep with knowing look under the eaves , or into the arbour . Other purposes prompt to other acts , and they are taking their farewell of the pleasant summer haunts , where they have built their nests and reared their young . This morning , soon after sunrise , Willie was standing on the lawn , contemplating the beauties of nature , and thinking , I suppose , of the changes of the seasons , when all at once I heard him shout , " Look at the birds ! Look at the birds ! " We threw open the window , and there were thousands and thousands of them almost over our heads . Their wings made a noise like the rushing of a steam-engine as it cleaves the air in its speed . They were calling to each other with a short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receiving orders . We watched them till they disappeared over the tree-tops . " There are more ! There are more ! " shouted Mary . We again looked towards the rising sun , and up over the eastern hills came another immense flock , calling to each other as the first , and they too disappeared behind the western hills . " There is another flock ! " and so indeed there was . Up from the meadows and over the hills they came , swaying up and down in their flight , and so near that we could see each bird distinctly . Almost simultaneously they alighted on Clover Hill to rest for a moment . I can never forget their motion so full of grace and beauty , waving and undulating like the gentle swell of the ocean . Soon , another company followed in the same direction , and when they were over Clover Hill , up flew the others , and away they went with them beyond our sight . Flock after flock appeared , each taking the same general direction , and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounded our view on one side , as far as our eye could see on the other . They looked , as Willie said , like bees swarming , only they were much larger . Occasionally a few stragglers could be seen , hurrying on to join their party , which was in advance of them . Perhaps they had delayed to take a last farewell of their pleasant summer homes , or , may be , they were dilatory in their habits , and did not make their morning toilet in season . I hope they will be more prompt in future , for it is a bad habit to be late , and occasions , often , much vexation and inconvenience . I never before saw so many birds together , although I have frequently been startled by the peculiar sound made by large numbers flying in company , and have looked at them with wonder and admiration . The migration of birds is one of the most remarkable phenomena in natural history . " The stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times , and the turtle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of their coming , " and so do all birds of passage . Their Creator has endowed them with a wonderful instinct , which , in some way , unknown to us , teaches them to guard against the severity of the season by seeking a warmer climate , and when " winter is past , " and " the flowers appear on the earth , " and " the vines , with the tender grape , give a good smell , " then " the time of the singing of birds is come , " and their voice is heard in our land . Some of them return , not only to the same country , but to the same place , where they have previously built their nests , and , year after year , raise their broods in the same friendly tree . It is said that , to enable birds to fly with ease , and to continue long on the wing , they must fly against the wind . I observed , this morning , that there was a brisk wind from the west , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps they had been waiting several days for a favourable wind , and that may have been the reason of the great number of flocks we saw . " Behold the fowls of the air , " said our Saviour , in his sermon on the mount ; " for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns , yet your heavenly Father feedeth them . Are ye not much better than they ? " At another time , when he was talking with his disciples about the persecutions they should endure for his sake , he said to them , " Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father . But the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear ye not , therefore ; ye are of more value than many sparrows . " Not one of that immense number of birds , which we saw flying to a warmer country , can perish without God 's knowledge . He sees every one of them . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the sea-shore , and now that winter is approaching , he has taught them to seek other localities , where their appropriate food can be found . Whenever God 's children are tempted to yield to despondency , and to fear that they shall suffer from want , let them remember that they are of more value than many sparrows , and that if they trust their heavenly Father , their bread shall be given them , and their water shall be sure . He who feeds the birds will feed them . May he " Fill " our souls " with trust unshaken In that Being who has taken Care for every living thing , In Summer , Winter , Fall and Spring . " Illustration THE LOST CHILD . It was a Sabbath morning in November , clear , bright and frosty . Mrs. Dudley 's family were preparing for church . They heard Carlo bark violently , and knew a stranger must be near . Carlo is a faithful watch-dog , but his habit of barking at visitors is so disagreeable , that he is usually kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company is expected , he is permitted to go at large . When Mr. Dudley heard Carlo , he immediately threw open the window , and spoke to him . He saw a gentleman , who was evidently much alarmed . None of the family knew him . The stranger soon made known the occasion of his call , by inquiring , " Have you seen any thing of a stray child ? " " No , we have not ; whose child is lost ? " " Mr. McPherson 's . " " How old is the child ? " " About six years old . His mother sent him from home , yesterday , about two o'clock , and she has heard nothing from him since . He had a small tin pail with him to get some yeast . " It is sad to hear that a child is lost , and all the family sympathized with the anxious parents . " How badly you would feel if I was lost ! " said Eddie , and he looked sober and grieved , as he thought of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home , no one knew where . There was much fear that he had fallen into the river , as he had been seen on the dock . At ten o'clock the family started for church . They met people who were searching for the child , and who asked them , as the gentleman had done at the house , " Have you seen any thing of a stray child ? " Notice was given in the churches that a boy was lost , and many a mother 's heart beat quicker as she thought of her own dear little ones , and imagined one of them sleeping , perhaps , through that cold November night on the ground , or ( fearful thought ! ) buried deep in the chill water . After church , you could hear one and another inquiring anxiously , " Has the child been found ? " But no favourable answer was received . In the afternoon , however , many hearts were gladdened by learning that he was safe . He had gone to the village , and got his pennyworth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stopped to play with some boys . He had gone with them to a part of the village with which he was not acquainted and when he wished to go home , he did not know what direction to take . He chose a road leading him from home , and wandered at least five miles . Just before dark an old gentleman and his grandson were walking on the road , and they observed this little boy crying . " What do you suppose he is crying about ? " said the child to his grandfather . " I do n't know . Perhaps he has been sent to the grocery , and does not like to go . " They watched him and found he did not stop , but passed on with his tin pail , crying grievously . They waited for him to come up to them , and asked him , " What are you crying about ? " " I want to go home ! " " Where is your home ? " The boy could not tell . " What is your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , as he should have done , William Hudson McPherson . The old gentleman kindly took him by the hand , and led him to his own home . William 's tears were soon dried , and he became quite contented . It was too late to attempt to find his parents that night , as he could not tell where they lived , and the name of Hudson was not familiar to the good people who had given him shelter . When Sabbath morning came , William was questioned again and again , till at length some clue was obtained of his father 's place of residence . The horse was harnessed , and William , with lame and blistered feet , was placed in the wagon . About noon he safely reached home , and was clasped once more to his mother 's heart . The father had not returned from his search , and he afterwards said , it had seemed to him that he never could go home without his child , on account of the terrible and almost frantic distress of the mother . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw a wagon at the door . His heart leaped with joy , for he thought the lost one was found . He opened the door hopefully , and there , indeed , was William gathered once more with his brothers and sisters around the great cooking-stove , tears of joy flowing down the grateful mother 's cheeks . All this great grief which William 's father and mother endured -- all the anxiety felt throughout the town -- and all the sufferings of the boy himself , were occasioned by William 's stopping to play , when he ought to have gone directly home ! Children often think they are quite as capable of judging for themselves , as their parents are for them . Sooner or later this opinion will lead them into trouble . William thought it was safe to stop and see the boys play marbles , but he found , to his sorrow , that it would have been far better to have resisted temptation and denied himself the short pleasure he enjoyed . Every human heart is grieved when a child like William strays from home . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to his fate . But , oh ! how much more bitter tears a loving mother sheds , when her dear ones stray from the path of virtue , and become disobedient and wicked ! I hope none of the children who read about William will go astray from the right path , but will ever choose that which is pure and lovely and of good report , and which , through the grace of God in Christ Jesus , will safely lead them home to heaven . Illustration THE UNPLEASANT NEIGHBOUR . Eddie 's father has a disagreeable neighbour . In one way or another he is a constant source of annoyance . Sometimes his pigs will creep through the fence , and root up the smooth green lawn . His part of the fence he will not keep in repair , and the hungry cows , in search of food , will break into the garden , and make sad havoc among the cabbages and other vegetables . His fine bay horse , whom he knows will jump over any ordinary fence , is permitted to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanty meal by a hearty lunch among Mr. Dudley 's corn . All these aggressions , and many more , have been borne with the greatest patience . Mr. Dudley has often been advised to resort to the law as a means of defence , yet he has been reluctant to do so . The children have sometimes felt very indignant when they have been obliged to chase the pigs or the cows out of the yard or field , but their parents have endeavoured to teach them Christian forbearance . At one time Eddie had been thinking about Mr. Morrison , for by that name I shall call the unpleasant neighbour ,  - -  and he said very seriously to his mother , " Mother , can Mr. Morrison go to heaven if he dies . " She hesitated a moment how to answer him , for , she had taught him that it is wicked to lie and to swear , and that if a person loves God he will not be in the habit of committing such sins ; so she told him , that unless Mr. Morrison repented he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his mother were talking about God 's love for the beings he has made . She told him that God loves every one . " Does he love Mr. Morrison ? " he inquired . " Yes , God loves Mr. Morrison . He is grieved and offended by his wickedness , but he loves him . You know I love you , when you have done wrong , although I am sorry that you have been naughty . I do not cease to love you . The Bible tells us that while we were sinners , God so loved us as to send his Son to die for us . He loves all , and wishes all to repent and believe in Christ , and be happy . He has provided a way for all who believe to be saved , and it is only because people love sin more than they love holiness , that they are lost . " Nothing can give us a higher idea of God 's love , than the thought that he loves every one -- even his enemies . " God is love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourages us to trust him at all times ! God does not willingly afflict , nor grieve , nor punish any one . All that he does , he does from the truest love . The knowledge that God loves us should lead us to love him . We are naturally disposed to love those who love us , and always do , unless there is something repulsive about them . There can be nothing repulsive about God , for he is love , and we who love him , love him because he first loved us . One night , after little Eddie had repeated the Lord 's Prayer and his usual evening petitions , he raised his head , and said to his mother , " Sha n't I pray for Mr. Morrison , now ? " " Yes , dear , if you wish to , " she answered . He bowed his head again , and uttered a simple prayer for the man who was the occasion of so much trouble and perplexity to his father 's family . He prayed that God would forgive his sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . It was very pleasant to hear Eddie pray thus , and to witness his kind and forgiving spirit . Mr. and Mrs. Dudley have often regretted that the children should have their early memories saddened by such a neighbour , but perhaps their heavenly Father wishes to teach them a lesson of forbearance and love for those who injure them , which they could not so well learn in any other way . Our Saviour , when dying on the cross , taught us practically the duty of forgiveness . He prayed even for those who put him to death . " Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do . " Do you not suppose he was pleased to hear Eddie ask his Father in heaven to forgive Mr. Morrison and make him a good man ? Illustration THE BOY WHO KEPT HIS PURPOSE . " I would not be so mean , " said George Ward to a boy who stood by , while he put the candy he had just bought in his pocket . Illustration : " I would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me mean , " replied Reuben Porter , " because I do n't spend my money for candy . " " You never spend it for any thing , " continued George , tauntingly . It was true . Reuben did not spend his money . Do you suppose it was because he loved it more than other boys do ? Reuben turned slowly away , meditating upon what had occurred . " I will not care for what George thinks , " he at length said to himself ; " I have four dollars now , and when I have sold my cabbages , I shall have another dollar . I shall soon have enough , " and his heart bounded joyfully , his step recovered its elasticity and his pace quickened , as the pleasant thought removed the sting which the accusation of meanness had inflicted on his sensitive spirit . Enough did not mean the same with Reuben as it means with grown people . It had a limit . He hastened cheerfully home , or to the place he called home . He had no father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stead . His father had died two years before , leaving a wife and four children without property to sustain them . Reuben was the eldest , and as he was old enough to assist in the labours of a farm , it was thought best he should leave his mother . Mr. Johnson , a neighbour took him into his family , where he soon became a great favourite . There was one thing about the child , however , which good Mrs. Johnson regarded as a great fault . It was what she called " a spirit of hoarding . " She said she never gave him an orange , or an apple , that he did not carry it to his room , instead of eating it . Perhaps his sisters at home , or dear little brother Benny , could tell what became of them . Mrs. Johnson had noticed , too , in his drawer , a box , which was quite heavy with money . She did not believe he had bought so much as a fish-hook , since he had been in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will grow up to be a miser . Mr. Johnson smiled at his wife 's earnestness , and remarked that with such an example of generosity as Reuben had constantly before him , he could not believe the child was in much danger from the fault she feared . " It must be remembered , " he said , " that Reuben has his own way to make in life . He must early learn to save , or he will always be poor . There are his mother and sisters , too , who need his aid . " In various ways Reuben added to his store . When the snow came , he made nice broad paths about the house , which so attracted the notice of a neighbour , that she asked if he might be allowed to make paths for her . He rose early that he might have time for this extra work , and was well paid for his efforts . The box grew heavier from week to week . Reuben had almost enough . One day there was a barrel of flour left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake about it ; but the man said he was directed at the store to take it to that house . Mrs. Porter went immediately to learn about it , and what was her surprise on finding her son had been the purchaser . How could he pay for a whole barrel of flour ? " The money , " said the merchant ; " he brought in a box . It was in small bits , which took me some time to count , but there was enough . " The mother called , with a full heart , at Mrs. Johnson 's , and related what had occurred . Reuben wondered why his mother should cry so . He thought she would be happy . He was sure he was happy . He had been thinking two years of that barrel of flour , and now he felt more like laughing than crying . Those tears , noble boy , are not tears of sorrow , but of the deepest , fullest joy . You are more than repaid for your self-denial . You have persevered in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course which you marked out as right . You have borne meekly the charge of meanness so galling to your generous spirit , and now you receive your reward . You are happy , and so is your mother , and so are your kind friends , Mr. and Mrs. Johnson . That night , Mr. Johnson remarked to his wife , as they sat together before the cheerful fire , that he had some idea of keeping the little miser and educating him . " A boy who could form such a purpose , and keep it , will , in all probability , make a useful man . " After-years proved the correctness of this conclusion . Reuben is now a man of intelligence and wealth . He is one whom the world delights to honour ; but among his pleasantest memories , I doubt not , is that of the barrel of flour he bought for his beloved mother . " Filial love will never go unrewarded . " Illustration MARY 'S STORY . Mary and Eddie had retired to their little beds . Their mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both a kiss . She was just leaving the room , when Eddie said to his sister , " Now you can tell me about Jesus . " This simple remark revealed to Mrs. Dudley the subject of their conversation after she left them for the night . It gave her great pleasure , for she desires nothing so much as that her children may love the Saviour , and she knows the more they think about him , and the more they learn of his life , the more they will find him worthy of love . Mrs. Dudley offered up a silent prayer to her heavenly Father that the Holy Spirit would teach them and guide them into all truth . She did not remain with the children to hear them as they talked together , but a few days afterwards she asked Eddie what Mary told him about Jesus . He repeated the history of his birth , of the cruel persecution of Herod , of his blameless life , and his death upon the cross . Eddie is too young to realize much about the great love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that we may be happy , but he is not too young to love him . I hope he will never forget the sweet story Mary told him . Jesus loves little children . He is their best friend , always ready to forgive them when they are sorry for doing wrong , and to help them when they try to do what is right . Even now , as I am writing , I hear children singing " There is a happy land Far far away . " The sound grows fainter and fainter -- eyelids are drooping -- sleep is near -- the voices are hushed -- the little ones are slumbering . May " holy angels guard their bed . " Illustration THE SUNNY FACE , AND THE SHADY FACE ; OR , JUNE AND NOVEMBER . " How happy I am to-night ! I love you so much I want to be with you all the time , " said Willie to his mother , as he followed her from the dining-room to the nursery , one stormy evening . What made Willie so happy ? It was not because the day had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of doors , for a chilling snow had been falling , and Willie had been obliged to remain in the house . It was not because he was well , for many hours of the day he had been lying on the bed too ill to sit up all the time . It was not because he had received a handsome present , for none had been given him . There had been nothing unusual to make him so happy , excepting a thought hidden in the secret recesses of his heart . Shall I tell you what that thought was , that made his face so bright and sunny , that made his eyes sparkle , and wreathed his lips with smiles ? I will tell you in his own words , and I hope you will treasure it in your heart . If you do , your face , too , will be cheerful and smiling , and your friends will love to look upon you . When Willie told his mother how happy he was , she put her arm around him , and drew him lovingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she inquired . " I suppose it is because I have been trying to be good , " he answered . " That always makes people happy , " his mother replied . Willie is generally a good boy , but he sometimes does wrong , and wrong-doing always makes him sad . It was a great pleasure to him that he had tried to be good , and had been enabled to overcome temptation . All children are sometimes tempted to do wrong , and it often requires a severe struggle to decide to do right . But every child who overcomes evil feels a conscious happiness and self-respect in so doing . I hope you will " try to be good . " If you do , and look to Christ for strength , he will aid you , and through his grace you will be able to become conqueror over the sins that " so easily beset you . " Henry Maxwell lives in the same town with Willie , and is of the same age . These boys often play together . I regret to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child as Willie . He does not so promptly obey his mother , and of course he can not be so happy . Sometimes he pouts out his lips , when his mother wishes him to do something which he does not exactly like . I one day heard his mother talking to him about his teeth . She wished him to brush them again , as he had not done it thoroughly the first time . It was astonishing to see how that fair , round face was disfigured by that ugly pout , and it was sad to hear his dissatisfied " I do n't want to . " When his mother insisted on obedience , Henry reluctantly complied with her wishes , closing the door behind him with great violence . His face was not sunny and bright like Willie 's , when he had tried to be good , but was dark and shady , like a clouded sky . It was not pleasant to look upon , and it made the heart of his mother heavy and sad to see it . I hope Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his mother , for , if he should not , the expression of his face will grow more and more disagreeable , till , when he is a man , it will look more like a chilly day in November , than a sweet , gladsome day in June . I do not wish you should tell me , but I should like to have you ask yourself , when you have read about these two boys , which of them you are most like . Is your face sunny , or shady ? " IT IS N'T FAIR . I PEEPED . " Willie and Eddie were playing Hide the Button . After they had played some time , and it was Willie 's turn to find it , he came into the nursery with his face flushed , and evidently much excited . " It is n't fair , " said he , and the tears gathered in his eyes , and his lips quivered with emotion , " I peeped . Eddie must hide it again ; " and he went out of the room , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been overcome by temptation . He had done a dishonourable act , but his conscience was quick to reprove him , and he had listened to its admonitions . There had been a short but severe struggle in his mind , and truth and honour had conquered . He was brave enough to confess his fault , and to do what he could to make amends for it . Mrs. Dudley was not at home , but a friend who had charge of the children told her the circumstance . It rejoiced her greatly that her dear boy should have had the manliness to acknowledge his error ; and it encouraged her to hope that he would never be guilty of a similar fault again . Willie is a conscientious boy . He sometimes does wrong , as in this instance , but when he reflects , he is always sorry . Mrs. Dudley did not say any thing to Willie about the occurrence ; but a few evenings afterwards as she was sitting at the tea-table alone , the others having all left , he came to her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , and resting his head upon his hand . She knew by his manner and his serious look that he had something in particular to say to her . She put her arm around him and drew him close to her . " Mother , " said he , " the other day , when you were gone , I peeped while Eddie hid the button ; " and then went on and told her all about it . Mrs. Dudley talked with him a short time , and said he had done right in confessing his fault , and in refusing to profit by his wrong act . She knew he was much happier than he could have been if he had done otherwise . " He that covereth his sins shall not prosper ; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy . " Willie found the happiness of an approving conscience ; and I doubt not that Jesus looked down with love upon him , as he does upon all true penitents . " There is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry for it , his conscience would have been hardened and he would probably have " peeped " another time , when the children played the same game . But now , if he should be tempted in this way again , he would remember how much he suffered in consequence of having once yielded to a similar temptation , and would not allow himself to commit the wrong . It is very important that children should early learn to confess their faults , and not form the habit of endeavouring to hide them from others . If they have injured any individual , they should apologize to that individual . Sometimes it is only necessary to confess to God , but we should not be satisfied with doing it in a general manner . Each wrong act , so far as we remember it , should be mentioned . If we really love our heavenly Father , we shall wish to tell him all about ourselves . We shall have no desire to conceal any thing from him , and it will be a pleasure to us to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie had no wish to conceal from his mother the wrong he had done ; he preferred to tell her about it ; and I have no doubt he had previously told his Father in heaven . " If we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness . " THE CHRYSALIS . " O mother , look here ! What is this ? " exclaimed Eddie , as he was in the garden with his mother and Mary and Willie . He was standing by a tall pole , around which a Lima bean-vine had wound itself . He had been gathering the great dry pods in a basket to preserve them for winter , when his grandmother would come to Clover-Hill to see her dear grandchildren . His attention had been attracted by something peculiar , and he immediately called his mother to come and see it . Mary and Willie ran to look . Mrs. Dudley found it was a beautiful green chrysalis , suspended by its silken cords to the vine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a black line , and with bright golden spots . " Is n't it pretty , mother ? " " How did it get here ? " and many more questions were rapidly asked , while the little folks carefully examined it . Mrs. Dudley told them what it was , and that if they preserved it , they would in a few days see a butterfly escape from it . Eddie looked up astonished . She also told them that it was once a worm , crawling about upon the earth ; that it had climbed up , and suspended itself under the shelter of the leaves , to await its change into a new and more attractive form of being . Mrs. Dudley took the chrysalis from the vine and carried it to the house , and put it on the mantle in her room . Every day the children looked at it to ascertain if there was any change . Soon the colour began to fade , and the delicate pea-green became an ashen white . Then it opened slightly , where there had from the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peep in at the imprisoned insect . The opening became wider and wider , and one day , when Eddie came into the room and went as usual to look at the chrysalis , the shell was empty ! The butterfly had escaped . He uttered an exclamation of mingled surprise and disappointment . As he turned his head , he saw , on the little cotton muff of Mary 's doll , the butterfly for which he had so patiently watched . " Here it is , mother ! " he shouted in the most joyous tones , and his eyes sparkled with delight . Eddie and his mother observed it for some time . Its long , slender legs rested on the muff , and ever and anon it would open and close its brilliant wings , as if to try their power , or to dry the miniature feathers which adorned them . Its colour was a rich orange , shaded from the lighter tints to the deeper , and variegated with stripes of black . The children examined it with a microscope , which made it appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the muff several hours , and then flew to the window , and alighted on the curtain . At evening , it was found on the cushion of a spool-stand , and there it passed the night . The next day it disappeared , and the children saw it no more . It probably flew away through the open window , to enjoy its brief life under the smiling sun . The children talked much about the transformations which had taken place in the life of that caterpillar . Their mother told them that the butterfly was sometimes considered a type of immortality . In this world we are , like the worm , in an inferior state of existence . Our bodies are laid in the grave , but we are not dead , any more than the unmoving chrysalis -- which remained so long on the mantel just where it was placed -- was dead . The spirit still lives , and , after it has freed itself from the imprisoning flesh , is more beautiful than before , and is susceptible of more perfect enjoyment in the pure atmosphere of heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look forward to Christmas with many anticipations of pleasure , for several weeks before it comes . They are quite busy in preparing for it . Their mother is the repository of their secrets , and assists them by her advice in making their arrangements . Many important deliberations take place about mats , pin-cushions , and bookmarks . As the day approached , the children often expressed the wish that it was here . A few days was a long time for them to wait . But time did not hasten . The hours were just sixty minutes , and the minutes just sixty seconds . The clock ticked on as usual . It was unmoved by all the excitement , and never , for an instant , quickened its pace . When Saturday came , their mother proposed that the presents should be distributed that evening . She did not like to have the children wish the Sabbath past , and on Monday morning there would be but little time to make their arrangements before the hour for school . She knew they would be quiet and happy if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be perfectly willing to lay aside other gifts till Monday . Mary wished to decorate the parlour with evergreens . Mrs. Dudley sent a man to get some for her . She and Willie arranged them in bunches and wreaths . Eddie helped all he could , and was as happy as any of them . In the afternoon their mother assisted them . She put the bunches made of the delicate , feathery hemlock , and the dark glossy laurel , over the windows , and suspended the wreaths where the bay-windows projected from the room . Small branches of cedar and spruce were tastefully arranged in vases , relieved by the rich , green leaves of the ivy , and the bright , lively twigs of box . The children wished for a Christmas tree , but the evergreens they had were all too small for that purpose Mrs. Dudley suggested that the hat-stand might be substituted . They were delighted , and immediately busied themselves in adorning it with garlands . It proved quite ornamental , and the pegs served a very useful purpose . Mary arranged on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry Christmas . " The letters were made of the small leaves of the box , and were fastened on with gum-arabic . These were placed amid the wreaths on the transformed hat-stand . When all these arrangements were completed to their satisfaction , they left the room . Mrs. Dudley remained some time longer . When she left , the door was locked . Mr. Dudley returned from the city , where he had been spending the day , bringing some friends with him . Tea was speedily despatched , and then all the family were summoned . The parlour door was unlocked . There were various toys , baskets , and reticules suspended on the hat-stand . There was a nice little felt hat for one of Mary 's dolls , and a looking-glass for the baby-house , and an embroidered cushion , which Willie 's industrious fingers had made for Minnie Dudley , as the doll is called -- a far better employment for him , I think , than throwing it about and treating it roughly , as I have sometimes heard of boys doing . There were humming-tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great spinning-wheel that whirred away in my mother 's kitchen when I was a child . There were graces , and battle-doors , and jack-straws for the amusement of the children when it was too cold or stormy to play out of doors . On a table was an array of slippers , which Mary and her mother had wrought for father and the boys . There was merry capering when they were transferred to the feet of their owners . I shall not tell you whether Mr. Dudley so far forgot his dignity as to partake of the excitement , but I am quite sure he was much gratified by the present Mary had made for him with her own hands , and that he kissed his thanks with great fondness . Most valuable of all to the little folks , and most gladly welcomed , were the books . How eagerly they looked them over . There was a present to Mrs. Dudley from her children , which I must not forget to tell you about . It was a plain gold pin , in which , neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was dark , streaked with gray -- the others were auburn , flaxen , and brown . She knew whence the treasures came to unite in that beautiful mosaic , and the tears were ready to start from her eyes as she received that precious token of family love . When I was a child , I heard little about Christmas . It came and went without my knowledge . But I enjoy the return of it very much now , and sympathize with children in the interest with which they regard it . I like to think they are treasuring up such cheerful memories to make their early home attractive to their age . The little Dudley 's will always like to look back to this pleasant evening , and wherever they are , their hearts will warm more fondly on account of it to their father 's cottage , nestled in the valley , and they will be in less danger of forgetting the lessons of love and kindness they have learned there . I WILL CONQUER MYSELF . In one of the oldest towns of New-England there lived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall call Helen Earle . Her father had been engaged in the East Indian trade , and had accumulated great wealth . Her mother was a sweet , gentle woman , who most tenderly loved her children , and endeavoured to correct their faults , and develop their excellencies . In Helen 's home there was every comfort and every luxury that heart could desire , but she was not always happy . She had one fault , which often made herself and her friends very unhappy . It was the indulgence of a violent temper . She would allow herself to become exceedingly angry , and her usually beautiful face was then disfigured by passion . Her mother was greatly grieved and distressed by these outbreaks of ill temper , and did all in her power to restrain them . She talked with her daughter earnestly in regard to the sin of such a temper . Helen would weep bitter tears , and express much regret for the past , but she could not quite make up her mind to determine to overcome temptation . The task seemed too difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed many tears in secret over this sad failing in her beloved child , and most fervently pleaded for help from Him who had given her the care of this immortal spirit to educate for eternity . She knew that God alone could change Helen 's heart , and give her power to overcome sin , even though assaulted by the fiercest temptation . One day , when Helen was very angry at something which had occurred , her mother led her up stairs to her own room and left her alone . For a time she cried violently , then she grew calm and quiet , and her mother could hear her walking back and forth across the room , talking to herself . She listened . How her heart rejoiced when she heard her repeating , again and again , " I WILL CONQUER MYSELF ! I WILL CONQUER MYSELF ! " And Helen did conquer herself . She had come to the determination , not that she would try to conquer , but that she would conquer , and , by the gracious help which is always given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hour she was able to overcome the temptation , and was not overcome by it . She grew up to womanhood remarkable for the evenness and gentleness of her temper . None , who had not known her in childhood , would have suspected that she was not always thus mild and lovely . Helen did for herself what no earthly friend could do for her . By the power of her will she controlled her impulses , and this triumph was of far more value to her than all the wealth of her father . It made her a blessing to her friends , strengthened all her good purposes , and enabled her to perform the duties of life without the friction which a bad temper always occasions . It gave her that true self-respect which elevates the character , and which none can feel who are not conscious of the power to rule their own spirits . No child is blamed for having a quick temper , but he is blamed if he allows himself to be overpowered by it . If he really determines , as Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old proverb , " Where there is a will , there is a way , " will never fail in such a case as this . " God helps those who help themselves , " and he is ever ready to assist us in subduing what is wrong in our own spirits . The Bible contains many passages which condemn anger : " He that is soon angry , dealeth foolishly . " " Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry , for anger resteth in the bosom of fools . " " Make no friendship with an angry man , and with a furious man thou shalt not go . " " He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding , but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly . " " Let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , slow to wrath ; for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God . " All habits grow stronger by indulgence . If you allow yourself to become angry to-day , you will more easily become so to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less difficult to control it to-morrow . Helen 's victory was obtained by decision . To form the determination to conquer herself required more effort of will and more strength of character than any subsequent struggle with her besetting sin could possibly require . If you have any fault which you wish to correct , you must fully make up your mind to succeed . You must resolve that you will conquer . If you should occasionally be overcome , yield not to despair , but with renewed courage try again . " On yourself and God relying , Try , keep trying . " Illustration SELFISH ELLA . Ella Russell is a little girl with soft , flaxen hair , bright eyes , and a complexion fair and clear . She is neat and orderly in her habits , and is very gentle and mild in her manners . Her musical laugh sometimes rings through the house like a sweet melody . It is so contagious that you would laugh yourself to hear it . Ella is obedient , and needs as little care as any child I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mother , and Ella lives with a Mrs. Lindsley , who has three daughters , two of them older and one younger than Ella . She is much attached to this lady , and feels perfectly at home in her house . Ella 's mother was in feeble health several years before her death . Ella was her constant companion , and nothing gave her more pleasure than to wait upon her and do all in her power to relieve her sufferings and make her more comfortable . Mrs. Russell said her daughter was an excellent nurse , although she was not more than seven or eight years old . It shows how much even small children can do for the comfort of their invalid friends , if they really try . It is very gratifying to a mother to have a child so careful and thoughtful , and Ella and her mother loved each other more and more every day . Mrs. Russell 's disease was consumption , and she could not be restored to health . Poor Ella , how lonely she felt when her mother died ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's home is not far from the city . Her father often goes there , and frequently sends her some delicacy which he knows she would relish -- a box of early strawberries , or a basket of plums or peaches , or whatever fruit may be in season . Mr. Russell is exceedingly generous , and he expects his little daughter to divide the fruit with the family where she has found so excellent a home . Ella , good child as she is in most respects , has one sad fault . She is selfish . When she receives any rarity she would prefer to eat it herself , just as the chickens do when they have found a nice tit-bit . It is really a trial to her that she can not eat a whole basket of peaches before they would spoil ! Indeed , one day , after receiving such a present , she said to a person in the family , " I wish my father would not send so many . I like it better when I have only a small basket , and can keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell sent a basket of peaches to Mrs. Lindsley . Ella was not at home . She had gone out to make a call on some of her friends . She heard this basket had been sent , and hastened back as soon as she could . " I hope they have n't eaten up all my peaches ! " was her first exclamation . She was quite indignant to find the basket had been opened . Mrs. Lindsley gave her all she considered it safe for her to eat ; but Ella was not happy . She felt as if they all ought to be hers , and she really cried about it . A day or two after Ella saw her father , and he told her the peaches were designed for the family . Ella was somewhat mortified , and afterward told Mrs. Lindsley what her father said about the basket of fruit . It seems very strange that Ella should be so selfish , for her father is not at all so , and I know it must grieve him to have a child of his so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make her happy . It occasions her much trouble , and it always will . I know a little boy , six years old , who is very fond of fruit , and who is much delighted when his father brings him an apple ; yet I have seen him , when he had but one , divide it between his brothers and sisters , and reserve no part of it for himself . He seemed entirely happy in doing so . One day he heard his mother say , " I have not even a penny in my purse . " He went up-stairs to his money-box , and brought down a handful of pennies , and gave them to her . His mother kissed his plump , brown cheek , and thanked him for his gift . Illustration : His mother kissed his plump , brown cheek . Which should you prefer to be like -- selfish Ella , or this generous little boy ?

" Let us run and meet him , "  - -  and away they scamper over the lawn to see which will get to him first . They are laughing gaily , and their feet trip lightly , as hatless and bonnetless they hasten to him . Mary 's brown curls are streaming in the wind , and it is a beautiful sight to look upon these children , so full of life and joy and love . Mr. Wilmot greets them with a smile , and stoops to kiss each of them , as they put up their arms to give him a loving welcome to his home . One of them takes his basket , and another his cane , and then the unoccupied hands are claimed by the tiny ones who love to walk by his side . Why do these children hasten so eagerly to meet their father ? It is just because he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with food and clothing , and has given them many pleasant things to enjoy . He loves them , and his love and approbation are very precious to them . They obey his wishes , and strive to please him , and this is one source of the happiness which fills their hearts . I think most of you , dear children , have kind parents , to whom you are warmly attached , and that you do not hear the name of father without emotions of pleasure . Some of you have no earthly father , but you all have one in another and better world . Most of you , in your infancy , have learned to repeat the Lord 's Prayer . How beautiful and expressive are the words with which it commences , " Our Father who art in heaven . " God , then , is your father , and you may go to him as his children . You may tell him all your wants , all your sorrows , and all your joys . You may pour out your heart to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as you would to a stranger , for he is your Father , and knows all about you . He knows every time you suffer , and he sees every thought of your heart . God loves you more than any earthly friends can , and he has enabled them to bestow upon you all the comforts which surround you . When you kneel down to pray , will you not remember that it is to a father you are speaking , and will you not love him as truly and warmly as you do the dear father who takes you on his knee , and speaks so kindly and affectionately to you . Your father in heaven has given you this earthly parent , and you should surely love him for all he has done for you . Do not let the precious words , " Our Father who art in heaven , " be unmeaning ones to you ; but strive to realize the great goodness and condescension of God in permitting you to call him by so sweet a name , and give him the only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" exclaimed Hattie , who knew Herbert loved his mother as dearly as she did . " I mean God . He is better than mother . " " But God is a Father . He is our Father in heaven , " continued Hattie . Herbert was quite satisfied with Hattie 's correction , and was then ready to agree with her , that his mother was the best mother in the world . Herbert was a very little boy , but he had been taught that God was more worthy of love than even his father or mother could be . He was too young to understand much about the being of God , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own mother , it was an expression of his love and reverence . Do you , dear children , when you realize something about the love which your mother feels for you , and which enables her cheerfully to do so much for your comfort , remember that God loves you even more than she does , and that He is far more deserving your strongest affections ? " He that loveth father or mother more than me , " the Saviour said , " is not worthy of me . " God should occupy the first place in your heart , and next to Him you should love your parents . Happy is that child who is so willing to be governed by her mother 's wishes that she is at all times ready to exclaim , " Was there ever so good a mother as my mother !

Sometimes large bequests are made to benevolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous man . Many bless his memory , and his name is cherished with grateful respect . It is right that it should be so . God loves the cheerful giver . I have just read the last " will and testament " of a little boy nine years old , who lived in Ohio . Not very long ago he was taken ill with fever . The disease was violent , and he suffered much . At length it became evident that he must die . A few hours before his death , he looked up to his mother and said : " Do you remember my gold dollar ? " " Yes , my son ; but we had better not think of that now . " " But mother , " said George , " I want you to give it to the missionaries , and my shillings too , and all the pennies . Give it all to the missionaries . " George died , and I trust has gone to heaven .

The sum contributed by the dying child was not large , but it was all he had . In the same town lived a little girl , whose father was a clergyman . One after another of his dear ones were taken from him . A precious babe of seventeen months , a sweet prattler of three years , and another of five , were called to leave this world and grow up with the angels in heaven . Then this child of eleven must go too -- the fourth out of that family circle within one short month ! She had been a follower of the Saviour for three years , and had thought much of the condition of the heathen , who have no knowledge of the way of salvation through Christ .

She looked forward cheerfully and joyfully , to the glorious immortality upon which she was so soon to enter . When dying , she exclaimed , " It is all dark here , but I shall soon be where it is light . I shall be with my heavenly Father , and the blessed Saviour , and all the good people . " One of this child 's last requests was , that her dollar -- the only money she possessed -- should be sent to a missionary society to buy Testaments for heathen children .

Many souls may be converted through the truth these " two mites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLESS GOD FOR THIS DOLL . " When Mary Wilson was about five years old , her aunt Ann came from a distant place to make her mother a visit . She was fond of children , and often talked and played with her little niece , and assisted her in making dresses for her doll . This gratified Mary , and made her love her more and more , as we always love those who are kind to us . Mary 's doll was not pretty , but she liked it very much , and took good care of it . She always undressed it at night , before she went to bed , and put on a nice white night-gown her mother had made for it ; and in the morning she would dress it again for the day . She named it Louisa , but her younger brother always called it Quesa , and , after a time , all the family spoke of it by that name . Mary often wished she could wash Quesa 's face , as her own was washed ; but she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the colour came off its cheeks , and it looked more than ever as if it needed a good rubbing with a sponge . Sometimes , when passing the shop-windows , and seeing the new dolls so temptingly displayed , Mary would ask if she might stop and look at them , and would , perhaps , say , " I should like that doll . " Mrs. Wilson would gladly have purchased one of them for her , but she was obliged to be economical , and could not gratify all her wishes . Mary had early to learn many lessons of self-denial , and I must do her the justice to say she was always satisfied with her mother 's decision . Mary would occasionally go to walk with her aunt Ann , who observed with what delight she looked at the porcelain dolls , so bright and fresh , and she thought she could not make her a more acceptable present than one of them . One day , when Mary was not with her , she bought a doll with rosy lips and cheeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in clothes which could be taken off and put on easily , as all little girls like to have them . It was indeed very pretty , and its face could be washed without injury as often as Mary pleased to do it . Mary knew nothing about the present she was to receive , till all this was done ; and then her aunt , going into the nursery , put it in her arms as she was sitting in her low chair playing with Quesa . Mary looked at the new doll , and then at her aunt , and then at the doll again , as if to say , " What does all this mean ? " Aunt Ann answered the look by saying , " The doll is for you , Mary . " It was just what she had long wanted , and her heart was full of happiness and gratitude . After holding it a moment , she laid it carefully in her chair , and kneeling down , put her little hands together and closing her eyes , said , " Bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God was the giver of every good gift , and she felt , that although aunt Ann gave her the doll , her heavenly Father had put it into her heart to do so , and she wanted to thank him for making her so happy . Perhaps you think that God is too great a being to care about your little wants , and that he does not put the thought into any body 's heart to buy dolls for children , as Mary Wilson did . Nothing which concerns the happiness of the creatures he has made , is too small for his attention . Nothing escapes his notice . " The very hairs of your head are all numbered . " So small a bird as a sparrow , the Bible tells us , can not fall to the ground without his knowledge . If he cares for the birds , he certainly does for children , and wishes them all to be good and happy . God has given you all many gifts , for which you ought to thank him . If I should look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which add to your enjoyment ! In one there is a pasteboard house , with windows and doors , and partitions to divide it into rooms . It is furnished with tables and chairs , and the dolls can sit in them . In another , are blocks with which to build houses , castles , and railways , or any thing the fancy of the young architect may dictate ; and here is Noah 's ark , in miniature , containing himself and family , and many animals . Countless other toys are distributed among my young friends , which make their bright eyes sparkle , and wreathe their lips with smiles . Other treasures , more valuable than these , are not wanting . How many books I see ! and as I open them , one after another , at the fly-leaf , I read your own names and the names of those friends and relatives who have given them to you . Have you ever thanked your heavenly Father , as Mary Wilson did , for these pleasant things which make you so happy , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide you with food and clothes , and many other comforts which you need ; but it is God who enables them to do so , and who fills their hearts with such love for you as to make it a pleasure to watch over and care for you . You should be grateful to them for all their kindness , but you should never forget that to your Father in heaven you owe your gratitude for such loving friends . God himself has taught you to ask him , day by day , for your daily bread . That prayer shows who provides for your wants , and whom you should thank for the pleasant things you enjoy . There is one gift of exceeding great value which the Lord has bestowed upon us -- greater than all others -- but I will tell you about it another time . BESSIE HARTWELL . Children who are called obedient children are often not so prompt in their obedience as they should be . Instead of doing directly as they are bidden , they stop to ask " Why ? " and seem to wish some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a parent . It is often proper to tell children why they should do or should not do certain things ; but children should be careful to remember that they must obey , whether they know the reason of the requirement or not . Bessie Hartwell is about eleven years old . She is generally a good child , but , like all others whom I have known , she has some faults . Although she always intends to obey , she does not always obey instantly . I will tell you a sad accident which befell her in consequence of this tardiness , and you will see it would have been much better for her if she had learned to be prompt . She was travelling with an aunt on a steamboat . She was very happy , for she was going to visit her grandfather and grandmother , and she knew she should enjoy herself on the fine farm , scampering about over the fields , raking the new-mown hay , and riding on the top of the load . Bessie always liked to go to the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only a small yard , not much larger than her grandmother 's capacious kitchen , to play in , and that was surrounded by a high , close fence , so that she could see only the tiny patch of grass beneath and the beautiful blue sky above . Children in the country do not know how to prize their freedom . If they could be penned up in the city for a few months , as Bessie was for the greater part of the year , they would learn to appreciate it , and they would look upon every tree and every blade of grass as a friend . The chirping of the crickets , the singing of the frogs , and the warbling of the birds would be thrice welcome music to them . No wonder Bessie was so happy when she thought of the wide lawn studded with trees , the orchard rich in apples and pears , the hills down which she and her sisters could run , and up whose steep sides they must scramble when the horn sounds for dinner . The country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bestowed freely and profusely upon every one " who in the love of nature holds communion with her visible forms . " It was in the gray twilight of the morning that the steamboat arrived at the wharf . When they went home , Bessie was awakened , and was soon ready , with her travelling-bag on her arm , to leave the boat . Her aunt took her by the hand , to lead her across the gangway . They had but just stepped upon it , when she started forward to reach her uncle , who , with an infant in his arms , had just preceded her . Her aunt called to her to stop . She paid no attention , but passed rapidly on . A car , laden with baggage , was drawn across the gangway . It frightened her . She stepped quickly aside , and fell into the water . Oh ! the agony of that moment ! Her uncle and aunt could not aid her . He besought the people near him to take the infant from his arms , that he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child ; but they would not do it . They held him back , that he might not expose himself to the danger of immediate death ; for he could not swim , and of course he could not render the assistance which was needed . He and her aunt were both obliged to stand and look on , in unutterable anguish , while strangers attempted to save her . Bessie fell in such a way that she did not sink under the water . Her clothes spread out , and buoyed her up like a life-preserver . A man let himself down as soon as possible ; but the rope was not long enough for him to reach Bessie . He could only touch her with his foot . She took hold of it , and he slowly raised her till he grasped her bonnet . In this way they were both pulled up , and Bessie once more stood by the side of her aunt . How freely they all breathed once more , when the terrible suspense was ended , and she was safe ! Bessie seemed scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been perfectly calm , and did not lose her presence of mind ; and it was owing to this , probably , that she was so easily rescued . She tried to save her travelling-bag , but , as she told her aunt , she could not hold it any longer than she did . It was wonderful that Bessie was not drowned . If she had not been supported by her clothes , she would have sunk beneath the water , and when she arose would very probably have come up under the boat , so that it would have been impossible to save her . If Bessie had been in the habit of obeying so soon as she was spoken to , she would not have met with this fearful accident , and her uncle and aunt would have been spared the mental suffering they endured . I should think she never again would forget to obey at the first word from those who have the care of her . I hope , dear children , you will profit as much by Bessie 's accident as I trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be obedient , but promptly obedient . You may not suffer the same mishap that she did , even if you allow yourself to form the same habit ; but it may lead you into as great danger , and even greater , for it may peril the purity and peace of your soul , and that is of far more consequence than the safety of your body . Illustration " MARY 'S GREAT TREASURE " More than twenty years ago , there was a little blue-eyed , curly-haired child playing about one of the pleasant homes in the West . She was happy and kind , and every one loved her . She was only six years old , yet she had a great treasure in her possession -- greater than many of the kings and queens of the earth can claim . What do you suppose this treasure was ? Was it a valuable diamond ? Was it an immense amount of silver and gold ? Something better than diamonds or silver and gold , was in this little girl 's keeping -- something which will be safe when these have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I want you to be as rich as Mary , and , through the great goodness of God , you may all have just such a precious gift . It was a NEW HEART -- a heart that loved her heavenly Father , that loved to pray to him and ask him to keep her from sin . Mary often talked with her companions about Jesus , and before she was ten years old several of them had been brought to love and obey him , and had , like Mary , a new heart . How happy they were together ! How much the Saviour loved them ! Mary is now dead , and has gone to heaven . Do you suppose she is sorry she so early went to Christ and asked him for a new heart ? How pleasant it must have been to her to be able to say , as she looked back over her past life , that she could not remember the time when she did not love the Saviour ; and she surely does not now regret , that when she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her -- she went to Jesus and asked him for a heart to love him . Our heavenly Father will give you a new heart , if you really wish to have it and feel your great need of it . Jesus died that you might be saved from sin , and he loves little children . Will you not go to him , as did Mary , and ask him for a new heart ? If you are sorry for your sins , tell him so ; and if you are not , ask him to help you to feel how wicked sin is , that you may have the " great treasure . " Illustration " SUSAN WILL BE HAPPIER IF I GO WITH HER . " Mary Wilson is a little girl only nine years old . She loves her mother very dearly , and she is always happy to be with her . Mrs. Wilson lives in the country , not far from a pretty village , to which she occasionally goes to make a few purchases or call on a friend . She sometimes takes Mary with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along by her mother 's side , sometimes taking her hand , and sometimes stooping down to gather a wild-flower which blossoms by the roadside ; and then perhaps she runs on and watches the brook that trickles down the hill , on its way to the river . Her smiling face and sparkling eyes show she is happy . One day when she was all ready , with her white sack and blue sun-bonnet on , to accompany her mother along the bank of the river to the village , Susan Grafton called for her to go with her in another direction , on an errand for Mrs. Grafton . Mary was greatly tried . She wished very much to go with her mother , but Susan did not like to go alone . What to do she did not know . Tears were in her eyes , as she told her mother her trouble and asked her what she should do . Mrs. Wilson left the decision entirely to Mary . After a short struggle she smiled through her tears , and said , " I should rather go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I go with her . I think I had better go with her . " Mrs. Wilson kissed the quivering lip of her daughter , and told her she had done right in thinking of Susan 's happiness . Her heart ascended in prayer to God for his blessing on her dear child , that she might ever be unselfish and self-sacrificing . Would not most children be happier than they now are , if , like Mary , they tried to make others happy , and were willing to deny themselves for the sake of their companions ? Although Mary was so much grieved to lose her walk with her mother , she was far happier that afternoon than she would have been without an approving conscience . Will you not pray , dear children , for a kind , unselfish heart ? Illustration THE NEWS-BOYS ' BANK . PART I. " How much money have you in the bank ? " I heard a gentleman inquire of a boy . " A dollar and a half , " he replied . I looked up , and saw before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . The pantaloons he wore had evidently belonged to a full-grown man , and were rolled up at the bottom to make them short enough for the present wearer . His coat had been cut short in the skirts , and the sleeves hung loosely about his hands . His shirt was not particularly clean , neither was it very dirty . His face , however , had been nicely washed , so that there was nothing repulsive about the fellow . The gentleman talked with him a few moments . I was quite interested in the conversation and learned from it that he was one of the news-boys of New York . Illustration : First interview with the news-boy . Patrick -- for by this name I shall call the boy -- sleeps at the lodging-house for news-boys , and is there learning to read . I concluded that I would go there , and see for myself what had been done for the improvement and salvation of these energetic , active boys . I found the building to which I had been directed , but could not readily find the entrance which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some poorly-dressed children where it was . A boy about ten years old guided me . He asked if I wanted a boy . I was sorry to say " No , " for he looked so bright and active that it seemed a pity not to give him some employment . I ascended one flight of stairs , and another , and still another and another , before I came to the right door . I knocked , and was admitted by a gentleman who has the oversight of these boys . The room which I entered was nicely painted and whitewashed . There were many seats with desks as in a a schoolroom , and there were books and slates on them . Maps and pictures hung on the walls , and there was a library for those who could read . The room was neat and tidy , and quite inviting in its appearance . At the farther end of it was an office for the caretaker , and a bathing-room , where water can be used without stint or measure . The boys enjoy the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never bathed in their lives , before they came to the lodging-house . If " cleanliness is next to godliness , " much has been already accomplished . The school or sitting-room opens into the dormitory . This is a large and well-ventilated apartment , and , being in the sixth story , overlooks most of the buildings in the vicinity . There were accommodations for fifty boys , and the room is large enough for eighty . Each boy has a separate bed . They are arranged in two tiers , as in a steamboat . The beds were all neatly made , and looked quite comfortable . Many of these boys have never slept in a bed except in this room . The remarks which they make to each other , when comparing their beds , with their clean sheets and pillow-cases , with the boxes , areas , and crannies where they have been accustomed to sleep , are very amusing . I am happy to know that there has been a constant improvement among the boys . They grow more orderly , and are more easily restrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . They are not allowed to use profane language , to fight , nor to smoke in the rooms , and generally manifest much kindness of feeling toward each other . There was a table in the room , which interested me greatly . It was of black-walnut . In the top there were one hundred and ten different holes , large enough to admit a half-dollar . Each of them was numbered . This was the bank in which Patrick had deposited his money . There were one hundred and ten little divisions in the drawer , corresponding with one hundred and ten openings in the top . The boys each have a certain number for their own use , and if they choose , can safely secure their day 's earnings for a time of need . The superintendent keeps the key of the drawer . Several weeks ago , the boys voted not to take their money from the bank till November , that they might then have the means of purchasing warm clothes for the winter . I had quite a curiosity to look into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In some of the divisions there were only a few pennies , while in others there were several dollars . I never looked upon any bank with so much pleasure , as I did upon this simple one of the news-boys . It was teaching them a lesson of economy and forethought , which I trust they will never forget . When they enjoy their comfortable coats and warm pantaloons in the cold weather of winter , they can not avoid remembering , that it was by taking care of the pennies , that they were enabled so nicely to clothe themselves . The news-boys have never been taught the true value of money . They have not hesitated to gamble it away , or to spend it for segars and tobacco , and other unnecessary and hurtful things . They have been exceedingly improvident and have had no idea of laying up any thing for the future . One evening , as the boys were gathered in their sitting-room , one of them was leaning on the bank . He held up a quarter of a dollar between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said , " You know Simpson , the pawnbroker ? " " Yes . " " He is a friend in need , but here is a friend indeed ! " and the bright silver dropped , jingling , into his bank . Those news-boys all of them possess more than ordinary intelligence and energy of character . " Every one of them , " as a gentleman said , " is worth saving . " They are sure to make men , and to exert an influence in the world . After my return from my visit to their rooms , I told some children about the necessities of these news-boys , and how much they need better clothing . A little girl , whom I know , has determined to make a shirt for one of them . I am sure it will be acceptable ; for , frequently , when they first go to the lodging-house , they are so filthy that something must be given them to make them decent . Perhaps other children may like to do something to benefit those needy ones , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provide for their wants . PART II . When the bank was opened , the first of November it was found to contain seventy-nine dollars and eleven cents ! This sum of money had been saved in seven weeks , by twenty-four boys . They were quite astonished at their own success . They learned the lesson by personal experience , that if they took care of the pennies , the shillings would take care of themselves . Some of them had saved enough to buy a new suit of clothes , others enough for pantaloons , and others for a cap or shoes . They were advised not to spend their money hastily ; but a few were too impatient to wait , and the same evening they received it they went out to make their purchases . Others laid by their money till morning . The news-boys found it was so much better for them to put their money in the bank , than to spend it in gaming , or for cigars , or in other useless ways , that they voted to close it again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of November , nineteen boys saved sixty-three dollars and forty-seven cents . One of them had put in thirteen dollars . He did not spend it all for himself , but gave a part of it to his mother to pay her rent . The boys were delighted with their wealth . " No hard times here ! " they cried . " Money is n't tight with us . There is plenty of it . " One of the boys purchased an entire suit of clothes ; and when he made his appearance among the others , in his nice blue jacket , with bright buttons , his pantaloons to match , and his blue navy-cap , he was greeted with cheers . One and another examined his wardrobe , and all enjoyed his success . " Who are you ? Who 'd think this was Charley  - -   - -   ? Is this a news-boy ? Who 'd believe this was a news-boy ? " and various other exclamations escaped from them . " Charley has done well this time . " Yes , Charley did well , and he will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows more of the true use of money than ever before . The first of December the boys voted to keep the bank closed till the third of January . They decided not to have it opened on the first , because there are so many temptations to spend money that they feared , if they had it in their pockets , they should part with it foolishly . One of the news-boys has been recently run over by a stage . I inquired about him , and learned that he is the very boy whom I met in a friend 's office , and my interest in whom led me first to visit the lodging-house . This is the third time he has narrowly escaped death . The omnibus passed directly over his body . When he was taken up , his companions thought him dying . He was conveyed immediately to the hospital . The boys at the lodging-house were saddened by Patrick 's troubles . They expected he would die . They recounted his excellencies of character . His cheerfulness and ready wit were not forgotten . Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he speaks , it is to the purpose . The boys called at the hospital to see him . The door-keeper said he never knew a boy who had so many cousins ! The next day Patrick was better . It was found that he was not so much injured as was at first supposed . There was great rejoicing in the evening at the lodging-house . A heavy load had been lifted from their hearts . Patrick would soon be among them again . They were cheerful and full of life and spirits . " Patrick must be half made of India-rubber ! " they exclaimed , gleefully . This sympathy with each other is one of the most beautiful traits of their character , and shows a nature that may be nobly developed . They can not but learn much that is good in the hours spent in their reading-room , as they listen to the instruction of those interested in their welfare . Many of them have already found good situations , and give promise of becoming useful men . They appreciate kindness and civility . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was walking with another gentleman and he shook hands with me too , " said one of them triumphantly , as if he had risen in the scale of being , and was more worthy of respect , in consequence of the respect with which he had been treated . Few can estimate the power of sympathy . " Speak gently , kindly , to the poor ; Let no harsh term be heard ; They have enough they must endure , Without an unkind word . " " I have never forgotten your words of kindness , when I was poor and almost discouraged , " wrote one lady to another , and no more will any child of want forget the utterance of a warm , generous heart . I should have told you , that besides the money the boys put in the bank , they earn enough to pay for their lodging , six cents a night , and to purchase their food , and , sometimes , various articles of clothing . They are obliged to be very active , and to be up early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city , crying their papers with loud , piercing voices , and running at full speed from street to street , stopping only to sell papers to any who may buy . It would be well if they had some occupation which would expose them less to bad company and unsteady habits ; but a news-boy can be honest , virtuous , and temperate , as well as any other boy , if he will take the right way to be . Illustration IDA 'S DRESS . At one time , when Mrs. Dudley was spending a few days in the city , she went with a friend to call upon a poor woman whom she heard was in great need . This woman had sent a daughter , about eight years old , to school for one day , and then found that she could not spare her ; she felt obliged to keep her at home to take care of the baby . Mrs. Carter -- for by this name I shall call her -- occupied a house back from the street . The ladies ascended the steps leading to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She is in the basement , " was the answer . They descended into the area . It was neatly swept , and in perfect order . " It must be a genteel woman who lives here , " remarked Mrs. Benton . They knocked . A voice bade them come in . They opened the door and entered . Mrs. Carter was sewing by a table . By her side stood Georgianna , her oldest child , plainly and neatly dressed . At the other end of the table was a little girl about four years old , whose name I forget , and in the rocking-chair before the stove was a dark-haired babe , quietly sleeping . The room was neat and tidy . There was a little fire in the stove , but not enough to thoroughly warm the room . The ladies inquired of Mrs. Carter in regard to her circumstances . They learned that her husband left her last spring , and had gone she knew not where . He was a carpenter by trade , and could earn two dollars a day . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had earned a few dollars a month by binding shoes or doing other sewing . They had lived very comfortably , renting good apartments for eight dollars a month , and knew nothing of want or suffering . Mrs. Carter was obliged to give up her pleasant rooms , to remove to the basement . She has laboured industriously , whenever she can procure work , to pay her rent , three dollars a month , and to provide food for her children . She has known what it is to be both cold and hungry . She has bought coal by the bushel , and has sometimes been without fire in the dead of winter . Her family have lived principally upon bread and water , and the little ones have cried for food when she had none to give them . Little Ida is too young to know her mother 's sorrow . She is a babe of only a few weeks old , and she sleeps as sweetly in that great rocking-chair as any babe ever slept in a cradle . She is warmly wrapped in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarce a change of dresses . When Mrs. Dudley returned to her happy home , she told her children about this family , and particularly about the poor babe , who so increased her mother 's cares and labours , yet repaying it all by the wealth of maternal love her coming had developed . It was pleasing to see Georgianna lay her face so softly on the infant 's , and so gently rock her when her slumbers were disturbed . Mrs. Dudley 's children listened to her story with great interest , and wished to do something for the family . Mary repaired some garments which her mother gave her , and when this was done , she went to her drawer and took out a small piece of calico , which had been given to her to make her doll a dress . She asked her mother if there was enough to make Ida a dress . Mrs. Dudley examined it , and told her there was . So she cut it out for her daughter , and showed her how to make it . This work occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has not much time for sewing . The dress looked very pretty when it was completed . She had embroidered the tiny sleeves with a neat scollop , and had taken great pains to make it strong and neatly . The next time Mrs. Dudley went to the city , she took several small parcels for Mrs. Carter , who was much pleased with them . None gratified her more than the dress for the baby . It will always be a pleasant recollection to Mary that she made the heart of this suffering woman happy by sending a dress to her infant . She learned the pleasure of giving , and of exerting herself to do good to others . If Mrs. Dudley had had the dress made by a seamstress , it would have been equally useful to Mrs. Carter ; but Mary would have lost the reward which she now enjoys in the consciousness of relieving the sufferings of the destitute . I hope Mary will always be benevolent , and never grow " weary in well-doing . " Illustration WHAT MADE WILLIE HAPPY . Willie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and admiring the freshness of the colours . They were a Christmas present to him , and had afforded him much pleasure . " You were very happy the evening they were given to you , " said his mother . " But no happier than I was last evening , " he replied . I will tell you what made him so happy on the evening to which he alluded . At Christmas , two little books had been added to his library , and another had been lent him by one of his companions . When he had read these books , he was very desirous to get still another . He began to inquire how he could earn money enough to buy it , for he thought he should like to purchase it himself . He could think of nothing which could be done in the house , by which he could replenish his purse ; so his mother told him , if he would control his temper for a week , she would get the book for him . If he did get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive it . Every evening Willie came to his mother , and told her how he had succeeded through the day . She observed him very carefully , and she knew that he really tried to conquer himself . She encouraged him in his efforts , and Willie was very happy -- happy because he was succeeding in correcting what was wrong -- and happy in the anticipation of the reward promised him . The last day of the week came , and passed away . Willie 's father returned from the city . He brought with him a parcel done up in soft white paper , and tied with a small red and white twine . His mother opened it , and there was the book for which she had sent . She wrote Willie 's name in it , with the day of the month , and then wrote " A Reward of Merit . " She thought those few words would remind him of the way in which he earned the book , and would encourage him to persevere in overcoming any bad or sinful habit . All these things together made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It always makes people happy to endeavour to subdue what is wrong in themselves , such efforts being their own reward . The consciousness of the approval of our heavenly Father must always occasion the truest pleasure . DO YOU INTEND TO BE A GENTLEMAN ? ( A QUESTION FOR BOYS . ) As I sat at the table a few evenings since , a gentleman called . He was invited to take a seat with us . As he had already supped , he declined . This person is a man of talent and education , but as I turned to look at him , in the course of conversation , I observed a habit which so disgusted me , that it was with an effort I could finish my tea . This circumstance impressed on my mind the importance of forming correct habits in boyhood . " The child is father of the man , " Wordsworth says in one of his poems . The habits and character you form now will , in all probability , be the habits and character you will retain when you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have alluded was entirely unconscious of doing any thing disagreeable . If not , perhaps he did not consider it of much consequence . He may have grown up with the opinion that little things are of small importance . Now , that this is not always so , you may easily see if you drop a spark of fire in a pile of shavings : the whole will be immediately in flames , and will do as much injury as if it had been kindled by a large coal . Our happiness depends quite as much on little things as on great . Small trials are as difficult to bear as any . People often lose their patience when a dress is torn , or a pitcher broken , who would be quiet and calm if some serious misfortune had befallen them . I hope , boys , you intend to be gentlemen . I do not mean fops and dandies , but true gentlemen . You have perhaps seen the remark made , that " dress does not make the man , but after he is made , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manners make the man , but they certainly improve him after he is made , and render him agreeable and prepossessing . A farmer , or a cabinet-maker , or a blacksmith , are no less gentlemen because they are engaged in these useful and honourable employments , than are judges , or merchants , or ministers . To be a gentleman is to be a man of gentle manners ; and who would not desire to be distinguished for such a trait ? If you intend to be gentlemen , you must begin now , by always conducting , under all circumstances , just as well as you know how . Some of you , I suppose , have better advantages of society , and more careful instruction at home , than others ; but no boy of intelligence need fail to be a gentleman if he tries . A true gentleman is always courteous . He answers respectfully when spoken to -- no matter by whom . Do you remember the anecdote of General Washington , who raised his hat and bowed politely to a coloured man he met , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race ? A friend with him expressed surprise . " Do you think , " said he , " I would be less polite than a negro ? " I hope , when you are tempted to be uncivil to those whom you consider beneath you , you will not forget the good example of the Father of his Country . I suppose the secret of Washington 's politeness and greatness was , as his mother proudly said of him , that " George was always a good boy ! " He was a gentleman -- such a gentleman as I should be glad to believe every boy who reads this book will one day be . If you would be polite to all , you must cultivate kind feelings towards all . A gentleman is not a rough man . He may have great energy and power of character , as had Washington , but still he is a gentle-man . GENEROUS NELLY ; OR , THE WILLING MIND . Nelly Wallace is about six years old . She has a pleasant , attractive face . Her long hair curls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatest and most gentle children I ever saw , and gives her mother but little trouble . Indeed , she is so orderly , and active , that she is quite an assistance to her . She sings like a lark , and is patient as a lamb . She is very generous , too .

One day , she heard her mother say to her father that they needed some particular article very much , but he told her he had not money enough to purchase it . She quietly left the room , and went up stairs . Presently she returned , and placed a five-dollar gold-piece , which had been given to her , in her mother 's hand . " Please use my money , mother , " she said ; " I should rather you would use it for what you need , than keep it to buy something for myself . " At another time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Paul , when exhorting the Corinthian church to liberality , says , " If there be first a willing mind , it is accepted according to that a man hath , and not according to that he hath not . " Nelly had a willing mind , and her father was as much gratified by her thoughtful consideration as he would have been if she had been able to furnish him all that he needed . So our heavenly Father is pleased with his children when they do what they can to provide for the wants of the needy ; and the smallest gift , offered in love , is not forgotten by him . You recollect that our Saviour , when he saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had cast in more than they all . They had given of their abundance ; it had cost them no self-denial -- but she , of her penury , had cast in all the living that she had . God looks not only on the outward act , but at the heart . He sees the motives which actuate us . He saw Nelly 's heart , and he approved her generosity . He gave her an approving conscience , which made her very happy -- far happier than she could have been if she had been selfish , and thought only of her own enjoyment . LOVEST THOU ME ? Jesus , after his resurrection from the dead , appeared at various times to his disciples . Once , when Peter , John , and a few others were fishing in the Sea of Tiberias , he stood on the shore , and inquired of them , " Have ye any meat ? " They answered , " No . " Then he directed them to cast their net on the right side of the ship , and they should find fish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The disciples then knew it was Jesus who had spoken to them . After they had secured the fish by drawing the net to the shore , Jesus invited them to dine with him . The disciples had observed , so soon as they came to land , a fire of coals , and " fish laid thereon , and bread . " This was the refreshment our Lord had prepared for them , and he , himself , gave them the simple repast . After they had dined , our Saviour said to Peter three times , " Simon , son of Jonas , lovest thou me ? " The first and the second time Peter answered , " Yea , Lord , thou knowest that I love thee . " Peter was grieved because Jesus said unto him the third time , " Lovest thou me ? " and he replied , " Thou knowest all things ; thou knowest that I love thee . " How did Peter know that he loved Jesus ? It was not because he always did right , for a short time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than once said that he did not know him ! Yet , notwithstanding this , when he was now asked , " Lovest thou me ? " he could unhesitatingly answer , " Thou knowest that I love thee . " If you should be asked , " Do you love your parents ? " you would immediately answer , " Yes . " You know you love them . How do you know it ? It might not be so easy for you to answer this question as the other , but at the same time you are conscious that you do love them . You feel that they are your best friends . They provide for all your wants . They furnish you with food and clothes and the means of education . They take care of you when you are well and when you are ill . You feel grateful to them for what they do for you , and you enjoy being with them , and talking with them . You like to please them , and it makes you sad when you have grieved them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not approve ; but they are always sorry for it , as Peter was when he went out and wept bitterly . If you should be asked , " Do you love your heavenly Father ? " could you as readily answer , " Yes ? " Do you like to hear about him and his wonderful works ? Is the story of Jesus ' love for lost man one that interests you ? Is it pleasant to you to think of living forever with the Lord when you leave this world ? If you love your Father in heaven , you do not love to do what is wrong . If you are overcome by temptation , and sin against him , you are sorry , as you are when you sin against your earthly parents . Children , and grown people too , sometimes seem to think that religion is to be kept by itself , separate and distinct from our daily duties , and that it consists in praying , going to church , hearing sermons , and wearing a sober face . It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who may be so cheerful as he , for there is none that can be so truly happy . True piety extends to all the acts of our lives , and influences them all . It does not forbid our doing any thing that it is right for us to do . A Christian child enjoys play quite as well as any other child . If Jesus should say to you to-day , as he did to Peter , " Lovest thou me ? " could you answer , " Yes , Lord , thou knowest that I love thee ? " It is just as easy for you to know whether you love him as it is for you to know whether you love your father and mother . I trust there are many children who do love the Saviour , and who wish to live to be good and to do good . MY LITTLE BAG . On my table lies a little bag . It has no beauty to render it valuable . It is not made of silk or velvet . The material is plain muslin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not very neatly made . The stitches are irregular . Sometimes they are piled one above another , and again they are scattered far apart . The hemming shows that no skilful seamstress held the needle . And yet this bag has afforded me much pleasure . Every stitch was made by the hand of love , and with a desire to gratify me and add to my happiness . It was a work of toil , for the fingers were unused to such labour . Patient industry and persevering effort were required to accomplish it . Self-denial , too , was practised , for play was forsaken on its account . It was a gift to me from a dear child ; a token of his purest and warmest affection ; and that has made this coarse muslin more precious than the richest material could be , which had no such extraneous value . What a blessing is love ! How it enriches us ! Without it we must ever be poor . " God is love , " and he has taught us to love one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We must love our neighbour as ourselves . " Little deeds of kindness , Little words of love , Make our earth an Eden , Like the heaven above . " No offering of true love is valueless , however small or imperfect it may be . My little bag is rich in pleasant associations , and I never look upon it but with a full heart . God does not accept what we do for him because of any peculiar excellence in our devotion , but because it is the result of our love to him . Illustration DO YOU LIKE YOUR SEAT ? On the day after one Fourth of July , I was obliged to go into the city . The cars were crowded with those who were returning , after spending our national anniversary in the country . How much they must have enjoyed that day of release from city labour , and dust , and close streets bounded by high brick houses ! How beautiful to them the green fields , the shady trees , and the soft-flowing river ! How they gazed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their treasures of wealth and beauty ! " God made the country , " and all his works are perfect . I pity those who are pent up in a large prison-city with nothing but a dwarf-maple before their windows which at all resembles the country , and who have to look up , up , up , before they can get a glimpse of the blue sky , and the fleecy clouds which sail majestically along , ever varying from one form of beauty to another . Thank God , my young friends , that he has given you a country home , and never leave it , unless stern necessity compels you to make your abode in the hot , crowded , feverish city . The cars , on the morning of the fifth , were , as I have told you , crowded , and it was difficult to find unoccupied seats . A gentleman and his wife entered a car , near the door of which were two seats with only one person in each . The first was occupied by a boy about fifteen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another gentleman , that he and the lady who was with him might not be separated . The first impulse of the boy was a civil one , and he started to rise ; but the second thought was ungentlemanly , ungenerous , and extremely selfish . " I like my seat very well , " he muttered , and drew back to the window and looked out . Perhaps even then he began to feel ashamed of such rudeness . The gentleman behind him immediately arose , and offered his seat . It was accepted with a bow , and a " thank you , sir . " The lady was immediately behind the boy , and , as she seated herself , she said to him , in a low , kind voice , " I fear you will never be a gentleman . " He made no reply , nor did he move his face from the window , but his very ears blushed . He was evidently ashamed . During the whole ride he kept nearly the same position , not being willing to meet the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapprobation of his ill-manners ; and before the cars were entirely within the depot , he went out upon the platform to escape from observation . I hope the boy will never be rude in this way again , for he evidently was made unhappy by it . There is only one reason why I fear he will not profit by the well-merited rebuke he received , and that is , because I saw one of his cheeks puffed out with a quid of tobacco ! I confess I do not expect so much improvement from a boy who indulges in such a filthy habit , as from one who does not . A gentlemanly boy must always be happier than one who is rough and selfish . The boy in the car did not enjoy his ride , although , as he said , he liked his seat very well . His impoliteness made it unpleasant and the remembrance of it will never afford him gratification . I hope none of you , who read about him , will be guilty of a similar error . Always try to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do a favour , do it as if it gave you pleasure . You will never have occasion to regret it . Be civil to those in your father 's employment . Their love and respect is of value to you . There are very few sunk so low as not to appreciate true politeness . Above all others , be polite to your parents , and your brothers and sisters . Do not indulge in harsh words . Perhaps the boy of whose history I have given you a single incident never read Peter 's instruction to the early Christians , in his epistle to them , and did not know that the apostle considered politeness of sufficient importance to be worthy of the attention of those to whom he wrote . " Be courteous , " is his direction to them , and I can not give you better advice on the same subject . Illustration THE LITTLE BEGGAR . As I was walking up street , a few days since , I met two little girls who looked very much alike , and were nearly of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far over their good-natured faces . Their calico dresses were neatly made . Their blue woollen stockings looked warm and comfortable , but their shoes were old and much worn . As I passed , the elder held out her hand in a way which I could not mistake , but I thought I would ask her what she wanted . She replied , " A penny to get mother some sugar for her tea . " I talked with the children a few minutes about their mother , and inquired if she sent them out to beg . They said she was obliged to do it , for their father was dead , and she was not able to work . Illustration : The elder held out her hand . The children had such good , honest faces , and gave such evidence , in their general appearance , of more care than most of this class of children usually receive , that I thought I would go home with them , that I might better judge of the correctness of their story , and of the necessities of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother live ? " They named the street . " Will you take me there ? " " Yes , ma'am . We must go this way ; " and they turned off in the direction of their home . " What is your name ? " I inquired of the elder child . " Mary Ann  - -   - -   . " " And what is your 's ? " " Ellen  - -   - -   , " answered the younger . " Have you any brothers and sisters ? " " We have one sister and one brother . Her name is Joanna , and his is Michael . A man took Michael away the fifth of July -- the day after the Fourth -- and we have n't seen him since . Mother thinks we shall never see him again . " They told me that their father was a stone-picker , and while he lived , they did very well , and went to school ; but since he died , their mother had been ill , and had bled at the lungs , and was not strong enough to work . I was pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walk along quite lovingly by my side . They appeared kind and polite to each other , and seemed to think that in me they had found a friend . They talked very fast , and told me many things about themselves and their way of life . " We save our money to pay the rent . " " How much does your mother pay ? " " Three dollars . " " Three dollars a month ! " I said , thinking how much it was for a poor woman , who had herself and three children to feed and clothe . " I do n't know whether it is a month , or a week , or how long ; I only know it is three dollars . " Once we were turned out in the snow . Oh ! how cold my feet were ! " The remembrance of her sufferings seemed almost to make her shiver . " What did you do ? " " A woman took us in her house . " " It is a long walk for you , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avenues , " and we live in the top of the house . " When we reached the house where the children lived , Mary Ann and Ellen ran up before me so fast that I lost sight of them . The hall was so dark that I could not see the stairs , but I could hear their feet pattering quickly on , and I followed as best I could . The last flight of stairs I could see distinctly , for the sky-light was just over them . They were brown with age , but they were evidently often swept and washed . I entered a room in which I saw the children . The woman there they introduced as their mother . She did not receive me with much cordiality . I suppose she wondered why I had come there . Her room was small and scantily furnished . It was heated by a small furnace . The great gray cat was dozing in the corner . I seated myself on a clean wooden chair , and began to talk with the mother about her children . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy as ever stood on two feet , " and her anxiety in regard to him . I attempted to encourage her to hope that so soon as navigation closed , he would return to her , for he had been employed on a coal-boat ; but she refused to be comforted . She wished to find a place for Joanna in the city . Mary Ann , who is nine years old , said she should like to go to the country . She thought she could wash dishes , set the table , and sweep , and I thought so too , for she seemed to me one of the smartest little girls I ever saw . She would have been quite willing to accompany me to the country , if her mother had consented , and I could have taken her . The children 's mother came to this country when she was quite young , and lived for several years as a servant in different families . She showed me several papers which she carefully preserved in a basket . One was a certificate from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she opened her trunk I observed its contents were nicely folded and arranged , as if she had a love of order . She told me she was able to do nothing but sew and could not procure much of that . After the children came in , they combed their hair , and braided it , and washed their hands and faces . I inquired if the children could read . Ellen got her " Easy Lessons , " and came and stood by my side while she read in it . Mary Ann read very well in her geography , and Joanna in some " Reading Lessons " which she had used at school . I asked them if they could write . " I can , " replied Mary Ann . " I can write my name , or I could your 's if I knew it . " I gave each of the children a piece of silver . They immediately handed it , with a bright smile , to their mother . I told them I would call again and see them some time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bade them good-by , they all followed me to the door , and looked so pleased and happy that I felt amply repaid for my long walk . I had gone but a few steps , when Mary Ann came bounding along , and asked , " When will you come to see us again ? " I took her hand , and we walked together to the next street . There are many children as destitute as these little girls , and many , very many , who have not even a feeble mother to care for them . Many poor children are sent out to gather the coal from the streets , or bits of wood where new buildings are being erected , and their bread they beg from door to door . In some of our cities benevolent people have opened schools for these miserable children , where they are taught to sew and read , and to observe to some extent the decencies and proprieties of life . In some , a dinner is given to its pupils , and , where it is possible , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save a part of their money for missionary or other benevolent purposes . I can not conceive a more suitable object for their benefactions than other children who are poor and destitute . " It is more blessed to give than to receive , " the Bible tells us . I hope you do not forget to thank God for the comforts and happiness of home , which you enjoy ; and I hope , also , that you will not forget that we have the poor with us always , and must do them all the good in our power . " Have pity on them , for their life Is full of grief and care ; You do not know one half the woes The very poor must bear ; You do not see the silent tears By many a mother shed , As childhood offers up the prayer , ' Give us our daily bread . ' " LITTLE CHARLEY . Charley was a sweet little babe . It was a pleasure to kiss his plump cheek , and pat his fat and dimpled arms . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our blessed Saviour loved him even more than we did . Before Charley was two years old , he became ill . All that physicians could do was done for him , but he daily grew more and more feeble . The bright blue eyes lost their brilliancy , and became faded and dim . The plump and rosy cheek became hollow and pale . The fat and rounded limbs grew thin and weak , and we all felt that little Charley would soon be taken from us . The same sweet smile lingered about his mouth , although pain and suffering had saddened that baby-face . He no longer tottered about the floor , but was confined constantly to his bed . Not there even was he to remain more than a few short weeks . The angel of death came , and bore him to the Saviour 's bosom . His friends looked at the beautiful casket , and felt that the spirit which had inhabited it , and made it precious , was no more there . They committed it tearfully to the grave , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crib was vacant -- the tiny shoe had no owner -- the rattle lay neglected . There was no need of the noiseless step lest the sleeper should be awakened . Little Charley slept in death . How sad and broken those loving hearts ! Those parents were Christian parents , and they sorrowed not as those without hope . Jesus , their Saviour , had wept , and they knew their tears were not forbidden . One of the cords which bound them to earth was snapped asunder . They had one child in heaven , there to be a pure and sinless spirit in the immediate presence of his Father -- God . There was comfort in the thought that Charley 's tiny bark had safely passed over the sea of life , and was securely anchored in the haven of eternal rest . Charley had a brother , Willie , two years older than himself . Little could he know of death -- but he knew he had no baby-brother now , and his mother told him Charley was in heaven . " I hope , mother , " said he , " the apostles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child ? " " Because they did not want little children to go to Jesus , " was his artless reply . This little boy has recently removed , with his parents , to the city . He does not like it as he did the green grass and shaded fields of the country . He feels lonely without the companionship of the trees and the birds , and he wishes that " God would take him right up to heaven to play with Charley . " How is it with you , my dear child ? Are you ready to be taken " right up to heaven ? " Do you love your Saviour ? Do you obey your parents ? Are you truthful and conscientious ? Do you study your Bible to learn all you can about God , and what he would have you be and do ? Do you pray to him daily for His blessing , and ask Him to keep you from sin ? Do you seek His forgiveness for all you have done that is wrong ? So live , that when the angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Charley is , into the blessed home prepared for all who love God . When He will come , you can not know . Be always ready , and then He will not find you unprepared . Illustration DARLING WILLIE . Willie was an active little boy , just large enough to be dressed in frock and pantaloons . He was very affectionate , and everybody who knew him loved him . When he left the green fields in the country , to come with his parents to the city , he did not feel so happy as in his pleasant home by the river side , where the wild birds sung to him , and where he could watch the branches of the old elm swaying in the breeze . It was autumn when he came to town , and there were no flowers in the yard attached to his city home . The grass was brown and frost-bitten , and soon the white snow came and covered it . The stone walks were swept , and when it was not too cold , Willie could ride around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's parlour , he could make houses with his blocks , or stables for his tin horses , and often he went out to walk or drive with his mother , who always enjoyed taking him with her . The winter passed away , and every month the strong cords of love were binding him still more closely to the hearts of his friends . Spring came -- the fresh grass sprung up , and the dandelions opened their blossoms in Willie 's playground . How he loved to look at them ! Those blades of grass , and the yellow flowers , filled his heart with gladness . His eyes sparkled , and he could scarcely stand still as he talked about them . Willie was , one day , sitting with his grandmother by the open window . The sun had just sunk below the horizon , and the clouds were gorgeously tinted with his parting rays . Some of them were of a rich golden hue , and others were dyed with rosy light . It was an exceedingly beautiful sunset , and Willie , who loved all nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking up to his grandmother 's face , and pointing to the west , " See , grandmother , " said he , " what a beautiful home Charley has ! " Illustration : Willie was one day sitting with his grandmother by the open window . Charley was Willie 's little brother , whom the angels had taken from earth , and carried to live with Jesus . He thought Charley must have felt lonely when he first went to heaven ; but , as he would say , " now he has got acquainted , he is very happy . " Sometimes Willie would ask his mother , " Would you be lonesome without me , mother ? " It was always a pleasant thought to him that he might early die and go to Jesus . Willie liked to look at the blue sky . Perhaps it was because he thought it was Charley 's home . He watched every evening for the moon , with her silvery light , and for the twinkling stars . At one time , a cousin of his called to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover , he said --  " Willie , come , look in my basket . " Willie came as requested . " Oh ! I know what it is ! It is a rabbit for me ! " So it was . George opened the basket , and out jumped a white rabbit , with pink eyes . It was a beautiful animal . Willie capered with delight . He had a live plaything , and it pleased him more than the velocipede , or his blocks , or any of his toys . Willie said he loved his cousin George for bringing him the rabbit , and his cousin Walter for sending it to him . They were happy because they had made him so happy . Not long after this rabbit was added to Willie 's amusements , very sad tidings came to the home of George and Walter . It was said that Willie was dead . It seemed scarcely possible -- for it was only a few days since he had sent a message of love to them . Some member of the family immediately went to town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that Willie was not there ! He had gone to be with the angels . God had heard his prayer . Heaven was a better , safer , happier place for him than even his pleasant home , with his fond parents , and he was taken " right up there , " as he wished , to be with Charley . Saturday evening Willie went to his bed in apparent health . Sabbath morning he complained of not feeling entirely well , and on Wednesday he laid aside his garment of mortality , and put on the beautiful robes made white in the blood of the Lamb , in the spirit-world . He was a lovely child when he dwelt with us here below ; how very lovely he must be in the bright world to which he has gone ! His mother often weeps when she thinks of him , and she misses him more than any one but a mother can . There is no one to play with his blocks , or his tin horses , or his pretty rabbit . Yet Willie is very happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to earth , lonely and desolate as is their once cheerful home . Willie will shed no more tears . He will never feel sad or lonely . He will suffer neither pain , nor hunger , nor weariness . But we , who love him , may weep , as did Jesus when Lazarus lay in the grave ; and we shall never forget the sweet child , so full of life and love , who was given us for a little while , and then taken home to glory . Dear children , who read about Willie , are you prepared to follow him and Charley , where they are gone to dwell with that Saviour who , when he was on earth , took little children in his arms , and blessed them , and said , " of such is the kingdom of heaven ? " Illustration WIDOW CAHOON AND HER GRANDSON . " I wish to make a call in  - -   - -   street , " said a lady to me , as we together were visiting some of the poor of the city . " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly eighty years old . She is infirm and partially blind . She has a little grandson , and she has no means with which to take care of him . We hope to persuade her to give him to us , and let us find a good home , by adoption , for him . " It was a warm winter 's morning . Snow had fallen the day before , but it was rapidly disappearing . The foot sank in the melting mass at every step . The crossings were muddy , and it required some skill to pick our way along dry-shod . We turned into the street , and sought for the number which had been given us . We found it on the door of a low , shed-like building , old and out of repair . " Does Mrs. Smith live here ? " we inquired . " No , ma'am . " " Is there an old lady , who is almost blind , and who has a little grandson , in the house ? "  - -  we further asked , thinking Mrs. Smith might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no such person here . " " Does she live in the neighbourhood ? " " She may be in No.  - -   - -   . " We made inquiries at several doors , dodging in quickly to avoid the great drops which came pattering down on the pavement from the gutterless eaves , but we could learn nothing of the object of our search . At length we came to a grocery , and , stepping in by the mackerel barrels which stood at the door , we repeated our inquiry --  " Can you tell us where Mrs. Smith lives ? She is an old lady , almost blind , and has a little grandson . " " Oh , yes ! I know her well . She is a deserving , needy woman . " The man followed us to the street to point out the house where she lived . As he was telling us , a woman passed by . He spoke to her , saying , " You know where Mrs. Smith lives -- the old lady who is almost blind , and who has a little grandson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ladies the place ? " " Yes . " She walked on with us till she came to a large tenement building , and then directed us to a room in the upper story . We thanked her , and entered the narrow hall , and passed up the still narrower staircase . We knocked at the door , and were bidden to enter . The old lady was not there . We inquired for her again , and learned that she had just gone out . The woman said she would send for her . A boy , ten or twelve years old , went to find her . While he was gone , we talked with his mother ,  - -  a round-faced , good-natured , intelligent Irish woman . We asked her where Mrs. Smith lived , and she said she was most of the time with her . Poor woman ! she had only a living-room and a bed-room for herself and four children , yet she was willing to share them with another as poor and more helpless than herself . She was a widow , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband died last spring . During the summer she had provided for her family by washing and cleaning , but this winter she finds it almost impossible to get work . One of the children is a babe , who was lying on a rough , unpainted board-cradle , rudely put together by some unaccustomed hand . This infant had been taken care of during the summer by his brother , not more than ten or twelve years old , while his mother was absent at work . There was a little girl , about eight years old , who attends the Industrial School . She was quite unwell , and had not been able to go out for several days . She sat in the great rocking-chair , looking sad and disconsolate , as most sick children do . She was comfortably clothed . Her dress she had received at the school , and had sewed on it herself doing all her little fingers could do to make it . Her hair was neatly combed . She was feverish and very thirsty . Sometimes she went to the pail herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get it for her . He seemed kind , gentle , and sympathizing -- a good example for some more favoured boys . Pretty soon the door opened , and an aged woman , bent with years and breathing hard and painfully , entered the room . A boy , with a complexion fair and transparent , through which the blue veins showed themselves , immediately followed her . She greeted us kindly , and took a chair by my side , bending towards us that she might hear more easily , for she was almost deaf . She told us that since her daughter 's death she had been entirely dependent on charity . After talking with her a short time , Mrs. B --  --  , the lady accompanying me , gave her little grandson a penny to buy some candy . She did so , because she wished to talk with his grandmother about him , and thought he had , perhaps , better not be in the room . So soon as he left , she asked the old lady if she had made up her mind to part with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously in regard to it by another lady , and seemed then unwilling that he should leave her . She said she had come to the conclusion that she must give him up , for she was too old and feeble to take care of him , and she was constantly anxious about him . She could not do for him all that he needed , and she knew it would be much better for him to be adopted in some kind family , where he could be brought up as a son . She spoke of him most tenderly and affectionately . He was her earthly all . She had taken care of him from his infancy . She came from Ireland for that very purpose . His father had died before he was old enough to remember him , and his mother had supported him by her own industry . The grandmother 's name was not Smith , as we called her . It was , as she said , widow Cahoon . The daughter 's name was Smith , and the sunny-haired boy was David . Last May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother homeless , and her beautiful boy an orphan . When David returned with a great piece of molasses-candy , he did not keep it all himself . He divided it among the other children without being told to do so . This showed that he was a generous child , and loved to make others happy . When he had eaten his portion , his grandmother washed his face , neck , and hands , and put on his best clothes , which his mother had made for him before her death . He looked very tidy and comfortable in his brown overcoat and his new boots -- a New-Year 's present . The grandmother tied up a pair of shoes and a few socks in a little bundle . When she handed it to David , he burst into tears . He felt that he was really going from his dearest friend . She wept aloud for a few minutes , but when she saw how much it affected him , she wiped away her tears , and attempted to cheer him . He summoned his resolution and became once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and led him down stairs . As he left the room , I gave mine to his grandmother , who uplifted it in both her 's , as if pleading , in silent agony , for strength to bear this new trial . I shall never forget the expression of that wrinkled , up-turned face . Dear old grandmother ! Who will comfort her now ? David will not forget her , but he can not put his arms around her neck , nor cheer her with the sunlight of his bright face . She is alone -- none of her kindred near . The lady who took charge of David will do what she can for her , but her heart must yearn for the dear boy that poverty and age compelled her to give to the fostering care of strangers . When David reached the street , the tears were tracing their way over his round , plump cheek , but soon a smile played around his mouth . Mrs. B --  --  took him into a toy-shop , and purchased for him a tin horse suspended in a wheel , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was delightful to see with how much pleasure he looked at it , as he carried it in his hand . We concluded to make no more calls that day , but to take David directly to Mrs. B --  --  's . When his coat and cap were taken off , he began to roll the horse across the floor . Sometimes he would come and stand by my side , and examine it closely . I said to him --  " Have you ever been in the country ? " " Oh , yes . I was there a month , when we buried mother . " " Where were you ? " " We were with Elek , grandma 's son . " " Why does n't your grandmother live with him ? " " He is n't kind to her . " " Was his wife kind ? " " No ; she said she would n't live with him if grandma did . " " What did you see in the country ? " " I saw the fields , and the trees , and horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow ? " " Yes ; and she went away every day , and at night she came home , and they milked her . " " Did you see any birds ? " " I saw birds no bigger than that , " said he , putting his hand over his horse so as to hide more than half of it , " and they sang all the time . And there were some chickens , that laid eggs , and then Elek 's wife sold the eggs to the baker to pay for bread . " " And had you apples or peaches ? " " I used to throw small stones at the apples , and knock them off . The peaches I could reach with my hand . I had just as many as I wanted . " The little orphan 's month in the country had been a sunny spot in his memory , clouded only by the unkindness of Elek towards the grandmother he loved so much . How strange it is that children can ever forget how much they owe their parents ! When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his infancy . She had carried him in her arms , unmindful of her own weariness , and had done all for him that his helplessness required . But now she is old ; her eyes are dim ; her hearing is impaired ; her hands are tremulous , and she is unable to provide for herself . Yet Elek 's heart is hard . He has forgotten all her love , and will not even give her a home . He can not prosper . I well remember , when a child , what a fearful impression a passage from the " words of Agur " made on my mind : " The eye that mocketh at his father , and despiseth to obey his mother , the ravens of the valley shall pick it out , and the young eagles shall eat it . " " Honour thy father and mother , ( which is the first commandment with promise , " ) Paul writes to the Ephesian children , " that it may be well with thee , and thou mayest live long on the earth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must be dark and sorrowful . His poor old mother uttered a groan , when , as she was talking about David 's mother , I asked if she had any other children . " He is n't kind to her , " explained its meaning . " Sharper than a serpent 's tooth it is To have a thankless child . " I left David with Mrs. B --  --  , who will find him a home in some family where they wish to adopt a little son . " He will make friends for himself , " she said , confidently , and I felt so also , for his sweet , intelligent face is too attractive and winning not to find its way to some loving heart . When Mrs. B --  --  talked with him about his mother , he wept . She soon comforted him , and told him that God would provide for him . He seems to possess a sensitive nature , with , at the same time , the power of self-control . Who of you would like this orphan for an adopted brother ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind lady of my acquaintance , who has adopted two little girls , to inquire if she does not wish to add David to her household treasures . There are many such homeless children in New York , and it is an act of Christian charity to adopt and educate them , and one which is rich in blessings to every heart that is open to receive the fatherless and motherless . Mrs. B --  --  would like to have adopted David herself but she has so much to do for so many orphan children , that she concluded she had not the time to devote to him . She sent him to a place known as the Home of the Friendless . This is a large brick house , built on purpose to shelter those who have no home of their own . There are always many children there , who are kindly taken care of till homes can be obtained for them . Those who are large enough attend school . I was so much interested in David that I often called to see him . The first call was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my little friend , and found him in the wash-room . He was standing by a great towel , and wiping his fair , plump face as nicely as he could . I kissed his clean , rosy cheek , and inquired if he remembered me . He smiled , and said , " Yes , ma'am . " He appeared quite happy and contented . His teacher told me that he was a remarkably good boy . Several applications were made for David by those who heard his story , and found room in their hearts and houses for the fatherless and motherless boy . His grandmother , knowing that she was too aged and feeble to take care of him , gave him to the Home . It was a great trial to do so , but she loved him too well not to seek his best interests . She was willing to live alone , uncheered by the presence and affection of her darling grandchild , if she could only feel that he would be kindly treated and educated by Christian people . A lady in Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wanted David to come to her to supply his place in the home circle , where he would find those whom he might call " father , mother , and grandmother . " A clergyman in Connecticut proposed to adopt him , and was coming to New York the first of May to take him home , if it should be thought best . While David was at the Home for the Friendless , his grandmother occupied a room not far from Mrs. B --  --  's . It was on the lower floor , so that she was no longer exhausted by going up so many flights of stairs . Several ladies united , and each sent her a dinner one day in the week , and saw that she was provided with breakfast and tea . They furnished her with comfortable clothing , for which she manifested much gratitude . It was always pleasant to call upon " Widow Cahoon , " and hear her talk about herself and her previous charge . She told us about his parents and grandparents . His father 's father was a Methodist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most devout woman . She loved to talk of their excellencies of character , and the good they had accomplished . I never heard her without being reminded of God 's faithfulness in showing mercy unto thousands of them that love him and keep his commandments . One day , when I was at Mrs. B --  --  's , " Widow Cahoon " was ushered into her private room -- a back parlour on the second story . She was much out of breath , and it required some time for her to recover herself sufficiently to talk . At length she spoke of her children , some of whom she hoped were living . Two sons and a daughter had come to America long before she did , and had gone to Pennsylvania . She had not heard from them for twelve years . She had often prayed that she might see them before she died , and she hoped still that she should . She had been the mother of eleven children , and here she was entirely alone , no relative near her to care for her in her age and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pennsylvania to make inquiries about her children . It seemed almost a hopeless effort , but , to gratify her , Mrs. B --  --  wrote to the postmaster of the town where her sons were last heard from . In about a week an answer came from the postmaster saying that he was well acquainted with James , and had seen him a short time previously . He spoke highly of him , as an industrious and respectable man , and one who would be happy to provide for his mother . In regard to her other son , he said he did not know him personally . His reputation was good , and his circumstances were such that he could assist in the care of his mother . From James the " Widow Cahoon " afterwards learned that her daughter had married and moved farther west , but she had not been heard from for ten years . When Mrs. B --  --  read the letter to her , she was much overcome , and the tears chased each other down her furrowed cheeks . " Glory be to God ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart . I shall see my sons before I die . Bless the Lord that I ever saw the like of you ! I have been trying seven years to get that letter written ! " I had the pleasure of carrying to her a letter from James , and reading it to her myself . As I entered the room she was sitting by the little stove in a large rocking-chair , looking as comfortable as one could wish . She seemed very happy , and told me about the prospect of seeing her sons . " They will send for me , and I shall go to them , " was a cheering and delightful thought . She said she was expecting every day a letter from James . When I told her I had brought it , her face lighted up , and she uttered expressions of thankfulness , evidently from a full and overflowing heart . She spoke of David , and of being once more with him , if " the boys should send for him . " She wished to do what was best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be adopted , if it was thought desirable . She expressed the utmost confidence in Mrs. B --  --  , and was willing to leave it all to her judgment . This was the last time I ever saw the " Widow Cahoon , " and we shall probably never meet again . She had no earthly treasure to confer upon me , but she gave me her blessing , and , I doubt not , will remember me in her prayers so long as she remains upon earth ; and when the spirit-world is our home , I shall expect her face , unwrinkled by sorrow or age , to beam upon me a heavenly welcome . It was but little I did for this poor widow , and yet that little has been rich in blessings to me , and may be to mine , for whom she fervently prayed . James , in his second letter , sent a check to his mother to pay her fare from New York to Pennsylvania with a request that David might accompany her . He will provide for them both in future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy widow and her little grandson started , under the protection of a friend , for her new home in the country where , I suppose , they now are . What a pleasure it must be to James to have his mother once more with him , and to be able to do something for her who has done so much for him ! Little David will again see the birds and the chickens , and be surrounded by kind and loving friends . The ladies of the Home will occasionally inquire about him , and if he needs their care they will provide for him , as his grandmother made them his legal protectors . If I ever hear more about David which I think will interest you , I shall write you again in regard to him . Illustration : Finis
