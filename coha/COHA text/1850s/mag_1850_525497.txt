AMERICAN REViEW , No . XXVII . FOR MARCH , 1850 . POLICY OF THE NATION IN REGARD TO SLAVERY AND ITS EXTENSION . PRESIDENT 7S SPECIAL MESSAGE ON THE TERRITORIES. * MR . CLAY*S RESOLUTIONS AND SPEECH.t WE APPROACH the subject before us with feelings of unfeigned anxiety ; it is not our intention to discuss it at large , or to weary the reader by repeating what has been already said , or demonstratino in new forms of argument what is alreadestablished . We do not feel called upon to show , that the general government must not interfere with the State sovereignties , nor directly or indirectly attempt any modification of their institutio*s ; nor do we feel obliged to enter again upon a demonstration of the full powers of the central government over the territories of the nation . We look at these things as established , and we are willing that those who differ with us in regard to them , should continue to differ ; awaiting for them , on our part , the slow but certain triumph of reason and common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time will cause it to grow and to prevail . What we now offer to our readers *s an enquiry into the relative merits of three distinct lines of policy which have been proposed to be followed by the nation in the treatment of slavery and its extension . The enquiry is at present the most im portant that can be entered upon ; it must be impartial , and purely deliberative ; from a point of view at once humane and prudent , but from which the interest of the nation as a whole shall be seen as paramount to that of any one of its members ; - a point of view which needs no apology on his part who assumes it , and which , if correctly taken , with a sufficient knowledge of facts and a proper determination to abide by the great laws of nature and necessity , must lead to a conclusion , final , salutary , and that defies exception . The first of these lines of policy is that which has been advocated , and is strongly urged , by the mejority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery in all territories of the United States , by an act of the central government . We propose to discuss the expediency of such a measure ; not its constitutionality ; since we have already claimed for the national government a full and absolute sovereignty over the territories of the nation . We have used the word " cxpediency** as of large import , and having a moral , as well as a prudential significance and value . VOL . V. NO . III . NEW SERIES . 15 *National Intelhigencer , Jan. 22d , 1850. // The experience of every moral being will have taught him that there are situations in life from which the line of abstract justice , in its narrow and restricted sense , can not he pursued . There are virtues in conduct , which , under the names of mercy , generosity , forbearance , and long suffering , are claimed to be among the highest attributes of humanity , revealing traits of divinity in man , and obtaining for him a respect which is denied to the merely just and retributive . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inhumane it may be constitutional , and yet smack of arbitrary power ,  --  of oppression it may , like the Wilmot Proviso , carry with it a sentiment of disrespect towards the minority ; seeming to impugn the motives and discredit the intentions of great numbers - numbers forming a third part of the entire moral and intellectual force of the nation . It may be impolitic , as creating forniidable dangers for the Commonwealth ; enemies , plotters for disunion , conspirators , upon whom the law has no grasp , and against which the nation can not defend itself . Such a measure , it seems to us , would be a legislative act passed in Congress by a mere majority , at the present moment , abolishing slavery , if it exists , and forbidding it if it does not exist , in every portion of the national territory . We hold to , and have steadily defended , the constitutk*iality of such a measure , and under other circumstances , we should advocate its immediate adoption : our first objection to it is its impolicy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are adopted . They may be just and lawful in themselves , but fatal in their consequences . They are impolitic , when their adoption at the present time will ensure their reversal and hopeless defeat at a future time . They are impolitic when , notwithstanding their intrinsic justice , appearances are against them . If* for example , ' appearances are such against the measure called the Wilmot Proviso , that it js regarded by those against whom it is directed , as an insult , or as a stroke for power , or a measure not calculated for itself , but for certain results not foreseen by the public generally and serving factious ends , it would be impolitic to pursue it . Even* though a bare majority might establish it , or something resembling it , if its passage by such a feeble power served only to rally its adversaries to crush it with a second effort , the measure would have been impolitic : it involves too much to be trusted on a bare majority . Those who desire , not for factious ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to witness the final extinction of slavery within the Union-to witness the extinction of an evil by the substitution of a good  --  the extinction of slavery by the only possible humane and equitable method , rendering justice alike to the slave and his master ,  --  the method of amelioration-would do well to consider whether violent attacks upon that institution , are not more likely to prolong its existence than to effect their own truly humane purpose : Such attacks are impolitic . It matters not whether an offensive aggression be direct or oblique ; whether it be couched in courteous or opprobrious language ; whether it be a measure attaehed to a bill , or the bill itself ; whether it be a block thrown before the wheels , or a clog attached behind them : if its motive be insult and aggression , that motive will be penetrated by those against whom it is directed , and the insult will be the more bitterly felt as it is more ingeniously contrived . Let Northern constituents , before they " instruct their Senators or advise their Representatives " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , consider how that measure originated : it was adopted under the supposition that the war with Mexico originated in a secret and unavowed intention of the South to extend the area of slavery . The majority of Southern Senators and Representatives disavowed that intention : a proviso was brought forward which gave them the lie direct : which said to them , if you insist upon the acquisition of territory it shall not at least be slave territory . ' The South openly disavowed this intention : a proviso was brought forward , as a public act , founded upon the supposition*that the majority of the South had been guilty of a falsehood . We have said , the majority . A few there were , certainly , among Southern Representatives , who intimated such intentions as those against which the Pro- // 221 qwq with all the odium and unpopularity attached to it ; never speak of it again ; what you have to do , do openly , directly and manfully , and elutch no more at the tail of the lion , but sieze him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are at present occupied , it is with all and every species of legislation for the prevention of slavery in the territories of the Union . It is against the policy , not against the abstract justice or constitutionality of such measures that we are arguing . Deprecating , as we do , every measure which will tend toward the establishment of slavery on the territories , and holding such extension among the greatest evils to be combatted , we are still averse to the employment of the direct constitutional power of the government for its suppression . XVe now invite the reader 's attention to a brief view of the lines of policy severally indicated by President Taylor in his Message of the 21st of January , and in the subsequent resolutions offered by Mr Clay , touching upon the various topics in agitation between the South and the North . The policy of both is pacific and conciliatory . Neither the President nor Mr. Clay concede anything to the passions of either party , but rather demand of each important concessions , both to the necessities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole . Seriously alarmed at the prospect of a long continued contest between the North and the South for the possession of California and New Mexico , the President was not slow in urging upon the people of that territory the only course which promised peace and security to the Union . The Hon. Thomas Butler King , Bearer of Despatches to California , was instructed by the President to advise the people of that territory to make an early application for admission into the Union . He " did not hesitate to express to them his desire " that each Territory sbould form a plan of a State Constitution , and submitthe same to Congress , with a prayer for admission as a State . Under the Comistitution , every State is the founder and regulater of its own municipal laws and domestic institutions . The subjects thus left exclusively to the States were not designed or expected , " says the President , " to become topics of national agitation . " " Still , as , under the Constitution , Congress has power to make all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every new acquisition of Territory has led to discussions , " whether slavery should not be prohibited in the new Territories . " The periods of excitement from this cause , which have heretofore occurred , have been safely passed , but dui'ing the interval , of whatever length , which may elapse before the admission of the Territories ceded by Mexico as States , it appears probable that similar excitement will prevail to an undue extent . " The President thereupon earnestly recommends the admission of California , as soon as may be consistent with propriety . The policy of the President in the treatment of the claims of Texas to the territory of New Mexico , differs not in purpose or in principle from that offered by Mr. Clay . He proposes that the territory shall be left in statu quo , defended by the general government from the invasion and inroad of its barbarous neighbors , and suffered to form itself as rapidly as possible into a State , which shall then make application for admission into the Union . After the admission of New Mexico as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought before the Supreme Court of the United States and adjusted by the principles of the laws of nations . As it is impossible to improve upon the style of this admirable Message , or to condense its statements , nothing but want of space has prevented our quoting it entire . " Any attempt , " say the President , " to deny to the people of the State the right of self-government , in a matter which peculiarly affects themselves , will infallibly be regarded by them as an invasion of their riotts and , upon * laid down * , the P ' -* ' - 'P* ' * in our own Declaration of independence , they will certainly be sustained by the great mass of the American people . To assert that they are a conquered people , and must , as a State , submit to the will of their conquerors , in this regard , will meet with no cordial response among American freemen . Great numbers of them are native citizens of the United States , not inferior to the rest of our countrymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restrain them in the exercise of // an undoubted right , substantially guarantied to them by the treaty of cession itself , shall ever be uttered by me , or encouraged and sustained by persons acting under my authority . It is to be expected that , in the residue of the territory ceded to us by Mexico , the people residing there will , at the time of their incorporation into the Union as a State , settle all questions of domestic policy to suit themselves . " It is understood , that the State of Texas has no remedy against any decision that may be made against its claim to the territory of New Mexico by the general government . The question is one over which the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction ; the previous decision of Congress being necessarily a law to them . In regard to the admission of California , Mr. Clay is explicit . He holds the same opinion and offers the same line of policy with that adopted by the President . For our own part , we confess to have been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaken , by Southern opposition to the admission of the new sovereignty , than by any previous action of the extreme Southern party . It is understood that in California , out of 15,000 votes or thereabouts , some 800 or 1000 , only , were opposed to a State Constitution adverse to slavery . Such a vote is equivalent to unanimity ; it is the voice of an entire people ; it is a voice , which , if not listened to , will perhaps make itself heard in other and more formidable accents . Are the South so jealous of State sovereignty ? do they hold the voice of a sovereignty in such high respect , in such a sacred regard , and do they believe that a piece of parchment , or an entry in the records of Congress is the divine source from which it sprung ? Do they believe that there is no State , no people in California , until they , the majority of one , have decided that there shall be Would the revolt of any portion of an American Republic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly new and unheard of on this continent ? The road across the deserts is perilous for our troops ; and how is it with them when they arrive in California ? They fraternize with the people , and desert to the mines . We can not carry on a successful war against California ; we can not drive her into the adoption of a Constitution of our own making . We must receive herwe , the sovereignties-as an equal , and a sister sovereignty ; or , if she be of our own spirit she will turn from us in contempt . What need , then , to enact laws for the suppression or the establishment of slavery in California ? for that is one of the points at issue . But , perhaps , the deserts arc in danger of the slave-holder ; the steep defiles and arid plains of New Mexico are in danger of cotton and sugar cane . Nature has settled all that ; why legislate against nature ? Legislation in such a spirit , shows not merely a want of magnanimity , but a want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect an object , but merely to express a passion , it is , indeed , a blow struck into the air ; but it is a shaking of the fist at the adversarya passionate hectoring which will not fail to rouse him to some resentful action , or at least awaken contempt . The general doctrine of the Resolutions offered by Mr. Clay is , that although the power of Congress to make laws for the territories is undeniable , it is , at the present moment , and , under existing circumstances , not only inexpedient , but unnecessary to legislate for them in regard to slavery . That institution having been already forbidden by the laws of Mexico in New Mexico and California , and by the Resolutions of Annexation in the territory lying north of 36 deg. 30 mm. , what need of any farther legislation upon the subject ? If slavery must needs be brought upon the new territories , let the responsibility of this introduction rest upon the new sovereignties which are to be formed upon it . * * * Mr. Clay urges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great controversy , to make concessions ; we conceive the line of policy which he has pointed out for us , to be at once humane and just , and worthy of the eminent position , a position of mediation , in which Mr. Clay has been placed by the universal respect of the nation ; he is held to be a person of sufficient dignity to offer resolutions of mediation and concession ; the nation have permitted him to do this ; have applauded and encouraged him in it ; and already the spirit of toleration and forbearance begins to temper and subdue the heat of party animosity in all parts of the country where the resolutions , and the argument 223 // which defends them , have been read by the people . Because slavery does not exist in the territories acquired from Mexico , and is not likely to be introduced there , that is the reason why it is unnecessary , and , therefore , inexpedient for us , to legislate upon the subject . In regard to the treatment of the claims of Texas upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she calls her own , wishing to include the most populous part of that territory within her own boundaries , Mr. Clay has offered a line of policy somewhat different in principle , though identical in aim with that offered by the President . Claiming for the general government an unquestionable and undivided power of deciding the controversy and fixing the line of boundary , he advises that a certain portion of the debts of Texas shall be assumed by the general government , in compensation for the resignation , by Texas , of all pretensions on her part , to the territory in question . That then , a boundary shall be given to her , adding largely to her extent , and yet not including the populous parts of New Mexico , nor impairing the integrity of that territory , so soon to become an important member of the Union . The language of the resolution of Annexation is , that " Congress doth consent that the territory properly included within , and right*iilly belonging to the Republic of Texas , may be erected into a new State ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , as follows : " Said State to be formed , subject to the adjustment of all questions of boundary , &amp;c. , &amp;e " Mr. Clay argues , that as Mexico and the United States , conjointly , might have fixed the boundaries of Texas , the power now lodges solely in the United States , which was jointly possessed and exercised by her with Mexico . How is it with regard to the limits of new States ? ( we add of ou*selves . ) The people of a certain territory petition to be made a State , . with certain boundaries ; their petition is granted , with such boundaries as Congress , in its wisdom , may see fit to mark out upon the domain ; and this is the mode in which the boundaries of new States have been defined . Mr. Clay adds , that yossibly after tl*.e boundary has been fixed by the United States , Texas may bring the question before the Supreme Court . But that " there are questions too large for any tribunal of that kind to try , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which exceed their limits ; - for such questions their powers are utterly incompetent . " He will not insist that this particular question is beyond the range of the court ; but he claims that the United States are now invested solely and exclusively with that power which was common to both the contracting parties , to fix , ascertain , and settle the western and northern limits of Texas . He contends for the full power of the Government , under a clear and obvious necessity , to dispose of any portion of its territory , as the public good may require , when the limits of that State arc ascertained . With regard to Texas , all is open and unfixed . The territory was purchased from Mexico at the price of $15,000,000 , and a costly bargain and Texas can not claim , as her own , what has been purchased by the nation . Mr. Clay proposes that as Texas had incurred a debt before her annexation , for which her revenues were pledged , the people of the United States , being in the enjoyment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portion of this debt . He states , that in the resolutions of Annexation itis clearly stipulated , that , in no event , should the United States " become liable for , or charged with any portion of the debt or liabilities of Texas ; " but , says Mr. Clay , there is a third party , who was no party to the annexation , that is to say , the creditor of Texas , who advanced the money on the faith of solemn pledges made by Texas to him to re-imburse the loan by the appropr ? aiion of the duties received on imports . foreign By the letter of the law , and the terms of the resolutions of Annexation , we are not under any . obligation to assume any portion of the debts of Texas . But if we should , from other considerati9ns , see fit to do so , then there is a kind of propriety in our assuming that portion for which the revenues were pledged . The policy of Mr. play differs from that of President Taylor , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // New Mexico shall be ascertained . Both agree as to the sufficiency of the laws of Mexico , still in force there , to render any action of Congress upon her territory , in regard to slavery , unnecessary . Mr. Clay , indeed , advises the establishment of a territorial government , by which a line of boundary must , of course , be adopted . President Taylor would only protect the people of New Mexico from aggression , until they shall be strong enough to form a sovereignty of their own , and then have the question of boundary settled by the Supreme Court . The plan of Mr. Clay is probably the one most acceptable to Texas , and , perhaps , to the South generally , were it not fur the prejudice of that portion of the Union against the exercise of power necessary to the fixation of the boundary . It is also , in all probability , the one that will be received with greatest favor in New Mexico , as it promises a speedy protection and liberation . The inhabitants of that territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more efficient government to protect them against the inroads of the Indian tribes , from which they represent they are suffering dreadfully at the present time . They are also strongly opposed to Union with Texas considerations , which will ensure the popularity of Mr. Clay 's plan of legislation . That of the President , on the other hand , avoids much ai*ument , and leaves the question of boundary to be settled by a competent tribunal , if indeed there is any evidence upon which the Court will find it possible to found a decision . Of equal moment in this formidable controversy is the question of the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia . Mr. Clay argues against it ; not upon the ground of its unconstitutionality ,  --  for he contends that the power of Congress to legislate for the district is unquestionable by the very words of the Constitution itself , but because it is necessary to have regard to the idtentions of the ceding States , out of whose territory the district was originally composed . All that remains ofthe District at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion given by Virginia having been subsequently retroceded to that State . The power to abolish slavery in the District does not indeed lodge in Maryland , and it therefore most evidently resides in Congress itself . But it may be highly improper and inexpedient ,  --  perhaps it may even be an act of tyranny and dishonor  --  to employ that power in this particular instance . Mr. Clay urges that it never could have entered into the thoughts of the people of Maryland and Virginia , when they made the cession of their territory , that slavery would be abolished in the District before it was abolished in their States ; and it would be taking an unfair advantage of them to make use of their gift in a manner contrary to their wishes . This is the argument from dishonor . It is necessary also to consult justice . If slavery is abolished in the District , the owners of the slaves must be fully compensated for their loss ; and , moreover , as the wishes of the people ought , in all important cases , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District must be obtained , if we would remove from the act the imputation of tyranny . The people of the District have no representation ; and , it is , therefore , necessary to use the greatest delicacy and caution in making laws for them , and to consult their wishes in so momentous a matter . These conditions must all be fully satisfied , Mr. Clay argues , before it can be either just , honorable or expedient to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia . In regard to the slave trade in that District , however , Mr. Clay speaks of it in terms of the severest condemnation and abhorrence , and would have it immediately abolished , by authority of the general government . It seems , at first view , an intolerable thing that the scat of government of a free country should be contaminated by the presence of a slave . This is the enthusiastic view of the matter : we forget , in indulging it , that the District , being chiefly inhabited by officers of the government , and representatives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely the free , but the slave States . Southern Representatives residing in the District , become citizens of the District . They , of course , bring with them their domestic servants , to whom they are personally , often tenderly , attached . It is necessary to pay a regard to their feelings , in this matter at least . The District repre* sents tbe entire nation , and the domestic 225 // institutions of every State in the nation ; a consideration not merely therotic , but very practical ; and which , lying as it were latent , and unrecognized , in the mind of Northern legislators , has made them hitherto extremely reluctant to employ the power of Congress against slavery in the District . In regard to the securing and restitution of runaway slaves , the action of the Northern States has been , in many instances , adverse to that provision of the Constitution which requires it . Mr. Clay hopes that the Legislatures of Northern States may be induced , by calmer considerations , to retrace their steps in this direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern people to the re-delivery of slaves , has arisen from the very general opinion entertained there that negroes are badly treated by their mastcrs in the South ; that they are made merchandize of , and bought and sold without remorse . This opinion has arisen chiefly from the observations of Northerners residing in the District of Columbia , where they see a traffic in slaves carried on within sight of the Capitol . The abolition of this traffic , it appears to us , would be not merely a humane , but a highly politic measure for the South , and would serve to quiet excitement and agitation . iVir . Clay 's last resolution , that Congress has no power to prohibit or obstruct the trade in slaves between the slave-holding State 's , seems to be almost a necessary deduction from the admission of a sovereign power in those States over the institution itself . The owner of a slave , in one State , is also the owner of him in the State adjoining ; he , therefore , has an unquestionable right to move him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two sovereignties themselves . Laying aside , for the present , all propositions for a direct legislative prohibition of slavery in the territories , not as they are unconstitutional , but as they are *ll-timcd and unnecessary , we come upon the second line of policy which has been proposedthe policy of establishing a line of compromise on one side of which slavery shall be prohibited , and on the other , permitted , if not tacitly established . The objections to this measure are obvious and insuperable . Whatever line is adopted will be , of ne cessity , a shifting line ; it can not be fixed upon any equitable principles . If an equal division of territory is to be made , ( and it is now necessary to exclude California , she having declared against the introduction of slavery ; and New Mexico is in a fair way , also , to take a similar course with her sister territory , ) between the North and the South , it will be either equivalent to a direct legislation , establishing slavery in one part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be a measure wholly useless and of no avail to the South . By whatever means the introduction or prohibition is legalized , whether by a joint resolution of compromise , or by an act , or a proviso attached to an act , such legalization by act , by resolution , or proviso , will be an implied denial , a giving up of the great doctrine of the South ,  --  for which it has contended so stoutly ,  --  that Congress has no power to legislate for the territories . Adverse to that doctrine , and iasisting , for our own part , on the constitutionality of a direct legislation for the entire territory , we are unwilling to admit the principle of such a compromise as has been proposed , as a basis of legislative action . The establishment of a line of compromise , dividing one part of the territory from another , is a division of what ought not to be divided ; a division of sovereignty ; it is a denationalization of the public councils ; we even doubt the constitutionality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sovereignty over the new terntories as the South ; and is it allowable for a majority in Congress tacitly to yield the power of legislation , the sovereign power which is inherent in the North as truly as it is in the South-which is inherent not in any one State or group of States , but in the entire nation ? Not so , however , in case the power were expressly reserved of legislating in future for the territory South of the line as might seem expedient : but the South would not agree to any reservation ; if a line is adopted the adoption is final . Mr. Clay is opposed to the adoption of a line . Were the line established , he says , it would be illusory to the South ; - that slavery will not establish itself there , being already interdicted by nature , and the fiat of the people in California and New Mexico : and it would be mere madness to attempt // a direct legislative action , establishing slavery where it is interdicted , both by nature and by circumstance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , the South will have gained nothing , unless it be established by the same act , south of the line ; but that is an impossibility : there could not be twenty votes got in favor of it . It has been said , he continues , that non-legislation on this point , in regard to California , implies the same thing as the exclusion of slavery from that region . * says Mr. Clay , " we can not help that , Congress is not reproachable for . if nature has pronounced the doom of slavery upon those territories - if she has declared , by her immutable laws , that slavery can not and shall not be introduced there , whom can you reproach but nature , or nature 's God ? Congress we can not ; - Congress abstains ; - Congress is passive ; - Congress is non-active in the plan which proposes to extend no line ; - leaves the entire theatre of these territories untouched by legislative enactment , either to exclude or admit slavery . " " I ask again , " he continues , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispassionate reason , -I ask of any man from the South to rise and tell me , if it is not better for his section of the Union that Congress should remain passive , on both sides of any ideal line , than that it should interdict slavery on one side of the line , and be passive in regard*o it on the other side of the line ? " A compromise line adopted by resolution , is an act equivalent to the establishment of a fundamental law . Though it be not an act in a strictly legal sense , it is a something more than an act ; it is more effectual , because it is irreversible , irrevocable , and can not be repealed . It is a resignation , or rather a division , of the highest function , that of sovereignty over persons , by a mere majority , between two sections of the nation . We say , therefore , it is equivalent to a fundamental law , and in so far as it has any effects whatever ; must have the effects of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equitable line , should be a shifting line ; nor should it be a parallel of latitude , as it is a division of property ,  --  nay , more , a division of sovereignty ; it must be drawn , if justly , with regard not merely to the extent but the probable value of the territory so divided . It must be a shifting line , because with every new addition of territory a new division must be made . Should the line be drawn through New Mexico , and a portion of that territory given up to the South , and the division regarded as an equitable one , no sooner then shall we have added Cuba , or , by cession from Mexico , the countries south of Texas , the line has ceased to be equitable and must be moved farther south . We need not speak now of Canada , though it is easy to see how the addition of the two Canadian States , with the vast territories attached to them , would rouse the jealousy of the South , who would then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettled , or if not , then the purchase of more territory to maintain the balance on their side . But the adoption of such a line implies an idea , false , and contrary to nature , of the causes of this great controversy The people of the North , looking upon slavery merely as a form of government , and which might be erected upon any soil and in any climate , have placed too little confidence in nature and necessity . They have not considered that slavery can not be carried out over the prairies of the West , or into the defiles of the Rocky Mountains . The growers of cotton , of tobacco , of rice , and of sugar , seek out such fields as are suitable to the products which they cultivate and these are the only products to which slave labor can be profitably applied ; there is a limit to this institution , beyond which if it is attempted to be forced , as it has been in some parts of the continent , it is depressed and extinguished by the slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate of slavery in Connecticut , in New York , in New Jersey , in Pennsylvania , and such , beyond all reasonable doubt , must be its fate in Delaware , in Maryland , in Virginia , in Tennessee , in Kentucky , and in Missouri . The negro laborer thrives in climates where the white laborer perishes ; negro labor is not profitable excepting under circumstances peculiarly favorable ; the crop must be one of four kinds , already mentioned ; for though maize and other grains are largely cultivated at the South , they are not counted among the great sources of wealth : were corn to be the only export of the South , her wealth might be soon counted . The 227 // fixing , therefore , of a line of compromise would be , in another sense of the word , a compromise of the laws of nature . Were the line so drawn as to embrace countries in which negro labor is unprofitable , the institution of slavery would be forced out upon territories wholly unfitted to receive it-territories like New Mexico and California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tillers of the soil , is not only possible but profitable . Governments have a weighty responsibility in directing the course of the emigrant ; in preparing the way for him ; in showing him to what lands , to what waters he should repair ,  --  in p reserving him from the rapacity of speculators , and from the disastrous effects of his own ignorance . But it is perhaps all in vain to speak of these things in this age of individual enterprise. ** Governments have now only to bury the dead , if we accept the tenets of a certain school . Visions of colonial prosperity are dashed by the experience of a single man ; if one man can not make wheat grow in the deserts , a thousand never will ; if rice and sugar abhor the climate of New Mexico , if cotton refuses to be profitable there , the South will storm and legislate to little purpose . The master may take his slaves into a new region , to contend there with new difficulties , but it were far better for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction to their energies at home , than to follows dream . But when the madness of the private man is stimulated by legislation , when he is gravely sent to his ruin by Senates and Houses of Assembly , then comes calamity indeed ; and the State buries her citizens in the wilderness , she buries her treasures there , something better than gold ,  --  the spirit and the energy of young adventure . And what is the origin of this monstrous procedure ? this attempt to force out the institution of slavery upon soils unfitted to sustain it ? To maintain what ? The BALANCE of POWER ! There are now fifteen against fifteen . California , New Mexico , the coming States of Oregon and Minesota , and perhaps the two Canadas , will turn the scale ; and then , what becomes of your Balance of Power We have admitted Texas ; we are bound , therefore , by obligations as solemn as oaths , to admit California . When the Canadas offer , we must accept them too ; Minesota and Oregon will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At best , we can only defer and procrastinate ; they must come in ; they are knocking at the door , and if we , the door-keepers , refuse them entrance , the nation will , without much controversy , elect new door-keepers more hospitable than we . Balance of Power - who holds it ? Who is it that wedges in this detestable delusion between the Northern and Southern sides of this body of one soul and one life ? The States of Europe , existing in a condition of perpetual hatred and alarm , held together by no principle of right , no declaration of liberty , but if at all , by temporary and interested alliances , confessions of mutual weakness or wickedness ; their governments , the prize of every nihtary adventurer ; the system itself a chaos , changeful as rolling smoke clouds , which assume every instant a new figure and position ; to-day , a monarchy , and the affiliation ofmonarchies ; to-morrow a revolution , a demagogue ehanging swiftly into a despot , and then an expansive and soon collapsing empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself , but maintain a BALANCE of POWER ? England holds the Balance of Power for Europe ; wisely and prudently for the most part , with a clear head , and an unflinching resolution , she watches the contending powers of the continent , and , when the scale turns to her own disadvantage , hurls in her cannon and her ships to make the balance again even . England holds the Balance of Power for Europe ; but who holds it here ? There is no analogy . America contemns , denies and denounces this doctrine of divisions . Late in the day we have this new delusion of a Balance of Power , sprung upon us by the State of South Carolina . Is she the third party , forsooth , between the Northern and the Southern halves of this great empire , of this nation of twenty millions , absorbing a continent , and holding the destinies of arts , arms and commerce in her hopeful future ? In the closing remarks of his speech , Mr. Clay alludes , with great force , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cecession from it , of any portion of the slave States . Were the Union dissolved , it would be no remedy nor redress // of grievances for the South ; the territories would not thereby be converted into slave territories . In the event of this dissolution , slavery would not be restored in the District of Columbia had it already been abolished there . Were the several States independent of each other , slaves escaping into the non-slave holding States , could never , in any instance , be recovered . Where one slave escapes now , hundreds and thousands would escape if the Union were dissolved , no matter where or how the division might be made . The attempt to recover these slaves upon the borders would keep up a perpetual civil war , until slavery in the border States of the South was extinct and every negro converted into an insurrectionist . " In less than sixty days " after such an event , " war would be blazing in every part of this now happy and peaceful land . " But more forcible than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mr. Clay here enforces in his most eloquent and powerful manner , that the secession of a State is impossible without an entire destruction of the system . Were that system broken up , " there would be a confederacy of the North , a confederacy of ' the Southern Atlantic slave holding States  --  and a confederacy of the Valley of Mississippi . " My life upon it , the vast population which has already concentrated , and will concentrate , on the head waters of the tri*utaries of the Mississippi will never give their consent that the mouth of that river shall be held subject to the power of any foreign State or community whatever . Such , I believe , would be the consequences of a dissolution of the Union , immediately ensuing ; but other confederacies would spring up from time to time , as dissatisfaction and discontent were disseminated throughout the country  --  the confederacy of the Lakes , perhaps the confederacy of New England , or of the Middle States . Ah , sir , the veil which covers those sad and disastrous evetits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrated or lifted by any mortal eye or hand . " The distinguished orator declares that he is for staying within the Union , and fighting for his rights , if necessary , within the bounds and under the safeguard of the Union . He will not be driven out of the Union by any portion of this confederacy . One or more States have no right to secede from the Union . " The Constitution was not made merely for the generation that then existed , but for posterity-unlimited , undefined , endless , perpetual posterity , " and every State that has come into the Union has bound itself by indissoluble bands , " to remain within it by its posterity forever . " There can be no divorce-there must be conciliation and forbearance . War and dissolution are inseparable  --  a war , terrible , exhausting , exterminating , until some Philip or Alexander , some Ciesar or Napoleon , should arise and cut the Gordian knot , and solve at length the problem of the capacity of man for self-government . In the course of the preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative action upon the territories , and second of the adoption of a line of compromise , we have sufficiently developed the principles of the third line of policy , which has been so ably indicated and defended in the Message of the President and the resolutions and speech of Mr. Clay . This policy neither assaults the prejudices , nor compromises the principles of either section . It is based upon the general opinion of the nation , that slavery is not a system which we should desire , for its own sake , to see extended , and which ought in-. deed to be restricted ; but that the ne .. cessary restriction having been already made by nature , and by circumstance ,  --  it would be unwise , to say the least , to move at the present junction , for any legislative action , either by compromise , or by direct prohibition , against the extension of slavery .
