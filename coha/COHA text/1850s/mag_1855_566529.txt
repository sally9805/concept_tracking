ART . P1. - COMMON SChOOL SYSTEM OF MASSAChUSETTS . Eighteenth Annual Report of the Secretary of the ihlassachu setts Board of Education . WE have read this report with unusual interest . It contains a review of the last six years  --  the period of the official service of the present secretary  --  a survey of the modifications introduced under his administration , their tendencies and results . It is written in the terse and felicitous style which characterizes all the author 's productions . Massachusetts has been peculiarly fortunate in its selection of men for this important office . The earnest and able efforts of the first secretary gave a new impulse to the cause of popular education throughout the state , and indeed far beyond the limits of his official relations ; and now , after the trial of six years , it is a matter of congratulation that Mr. Mann , on his retirement , was succeeded by a scholar of so rare and varied attainments , a teacher of so large and successful experience , and a man of so excellent judgment and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the confidence and esteem of all parties throughout the commonwealth . This report may fitly introduce an inquiry as to the value and importance of recent improvements and modifications in common schools , particularly as tested and illustrated in Afassachnsetts . For it is generally conceded that the Massachusetts School policy is in advance of all others , both in respect to its completeness as a system , and the munificent patronage of the state in carrying out its plans . Among all her distinctions , her schools stand prominent . It is now the liberal aim of the state to make these her crowning glory . This is no mean praise . Popular Education is by far the most important interest with which the legislation of any state can have to do . Aside from the divinely appointed agencies of religion-which in this land of religious liberty are not matters of civil legislation-there is no interest and no ruling power like that of the Common Schools . Nothing else leaves such an impress upon our social character and our institutions . We can not here alledge the numberless considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rank . it is impossible to // Feb. extol too much this great interest , whose blessings are beyond price . The report before us opens with an allusion to the adaptation of certain well defined doctrines in regard to the theory of education , and to the efforts now making ' views and to give * b to popularize these hem general currency among the people . The theory of Education is in our judgment an important point . While there is general agreement as to the end of Collegiate studies , widely different views still prevail in regard to the primary purposes of a ( *ommon School education , and of course to the processes of attaining it , for the theory of education which is adapted , will subordinate all the processes to itself . Correct views on this subject are of the utmost importance . It is very desirable that parents as well as teachers and School Committees , should thoroughly investigate this topic and acquire definite and settled views upon it , in order that there may be harmony of plans and sentiments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the mistaken impression , that the attainment of knowledge is the first and chief thing to be aimed at in school , while the training of the faculties is regarded by them as a matter of secondary importance . The power of repeating , parrot-like , what has been crowded into the memory , is looked upon as the highest evidence of scholarship . The quantity , rather than the quality of attainment , is with them the test of improvement . The great work of education is thus reduced to a mere system of innemnotechny . Instead of seeking to discipline and develop the faculties of the pupil , his mind is treated as a mere receptacle , which is some/ww-and in their view it matCers little how  --  to be filled . It is not strange that where such views prevail , a mechanical method of instruction should be adopted , which goes through a certain routine of mnemonic exercises , without any definite aim to train the mind and awaken thought and reflection . Nor should it be a matter of surprise , when we witness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through the ordinary course of study with little control over their minds , utterly deficient in the power of application , with little interest in study , and without any purpose or prospect of future improvement . Thus the most ample and varied acquisitions become of little worth , because there is no power to use them , to arrange and classify them , and form new combinations . For it is the power of using the faculties and resources of the mind , in which lies the secret of success . // All the elements of the several branches may be fixed indelibly in a child 's memory ; he may have the leading facts and principles of the sciences upon his tongue 's end , and become a walking encyclopedia , and yet be only a learned driveler . He can tell you what he has read or heard , and nothing more . Take him off the beaten track-ask him any inference from the stores which he has gained inemoriter  --  and he is dumb . He has not learned to think for himself , nor ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw out and exercise the reflective faculties . The habit of learning words and formal propositions without understanding their meaning , is still too prevalent in schools . This practice arises from the mistaken theory of education under consideration . Such superficial attainments are always chaotic , and often worse than useless . They lead the pupil complacently to imagine that he has the substance , when he has only the shell and semblance of knowledge . lie has studied the book , but not the subject of which it treats . A sense of our ignorance is the first step towards knowledo*e ; but a system*of instruction which leads pupils to over-estimate their attainments , fosters conceit and indolence , and removes the incentives to study . When a teacher retains a school for a single term only , as was the former custom in Massachusetts , and as is still the general practice in many of the states , he finds it much easier to hear recitations repeated by rote , than to secure a thorough comprehension of the principles which they involve . He is strongly tempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the desired tokens of progress . This course is more productive of immediate and showy results . It is supposed to make a fine display at examinations . Hence the lesson must be committed to memory , whether understood or not . The pupils must rehearse fluently , although , to borrow a simile of Lord Bolingbroke , " they rattle on as meanino'less as ml clocks that have been prematurely sprung . " * arm It sometimes appears to be the chief aim of the teacher , and still more generally of parents , to secure simply a rapid rehearsal of lessons and text-books-as if the repetition of the words , with a voluble ton*ue , was ample evidence of the acquirement and comprehension of the thoughts . But it is doing violence to the soul , to its innate love of truth , and of growth by the nutriment of truth , to feed it thus with the mere " husks of knowledge , rather than knowledge itself . " Such training is quite as likely to make pupils flippant as fluent . They learn every thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a // time , and are encouraged to enter upon advanced studies before they understand the simple rndiments . They forget that true progress depends less on the number of branches pursued , than on the thoroughness with which a few are mastered . Undertaking to learn too much , they become smatterers in every thing . Their acquirements are as superficial as they are extensive . Their knowledge will be more apt to make them wordy than wise ; and , " Words are like leaves , and where they most abound , Much fruit of sense is rarely found . " They seem to act upon the principle that " knowledge is power , ** but not in the sense of the great author of this maxim , who also tells us that " knowledge is the concoction of reading into judgment . " This system of instruction tends to Inflate pupils with an over-estimate of their attainments , and such conceit as an element of juvenile character obvionsly has other tendenciesquite as pernicious as those to which we have referred . But the appropriate effect of true mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modesty . Since the first lesson which science teaches is the greatness of our ignorance and the littleness of our knowledge . It has been well said , *- .. " the greater the circle of our knowledge , the greater the horizon of ignorance that bounds it . " - Those who , flushed with their fancied achievements , are already complacently reposing on the very pinnacle of science , are invited to spend a little of their ample leisure in pondering a conplet of Cowper : " Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much ; Wisdom is humble that he knows no more . " Or , if attic salt would give a better " relish , " we would commend to their notice a classic proverb : " Thou may'st of double ignorance boast , Who know'st not that thou nothing know'st ; The pride of man in what he knows , Keeps lessening as his knowledge grows . " But in plain terms , the conceit of wisdom is in inverse ratio to one 's attainments . The less he knows , the more he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a little learning is a dangerous thing . " That pupil has not yet advanced far , who has not learned enongh to know that his highest acquisitions are yet meagre indeed . The truly learned man feels that his knowledge is but a drop out of the boundless ocean of truth , " a few pebbles gathered from its shore . " Thus , for example , Socrates represented his knowledge as // nothing ; Bishop Butler compared his to a point ; and Newton his to a few pebbles which a child picks up on the shore . - The very prevalent evils to which we have adverted , are the natural result of an erroneous , but common idea as to the primary objects of education . This error is fundamental . It would greatly impair the best system of instruction . A want of agreement and of concurrent action on this point is frequently the occasion of serious embarrassment , even to the best teachers . The most judicious instructors are particularly liable to incur the complaints and objections of parents , because their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles to thoroughness , and one which the most successful teachers are continually encountering , is found in the impatience of pupils at reviews , encouraged and sustained by the undue eagerness of parents to have their children get through the text-books. it should therefore be a familiar maxim in all common school instruction , that while the object of education is always two-fold , discipline of the mind is more important than storing it with facts . However valuable these may be , they should be learned , not primarily for their own sake , but as instruments of forming right mental habits . All the teacher 's plans and methods tf instruction should be modified by the paramount consideration that the prescribed studies are to be pursued-not so much as ends , as means to the higher end of disciplining and developing the mental powers . Knowledge is indeed essential to education , but , as we have already shown , does not constitute it . If right habits of mental activity and self-reliance are formed , knowledge will come in due time , as a matter of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline , will be of little use . It is the discipline of the intellectual and moral faculties that constitutes the nian , and gives him his individual character and power . It is by the means of this discipline that he will be able to excel in any pursuit or profession . Now the object of the Common School is not to finish the education , but to lay the foundation for future and higher attaimnents ; to teach the pupil kow to study , and to inspire him with a love of learning . If this be done , he will , for the rest , educate himself . He will feel that his education is only begun , when his school days are ended . To complete it , will be the aim and pleasure of his life . Place him where you will , let his calling be what it may , he will find leisure for study , and will feel an insatiable desire for self-improvement . Every child can ordinarily be so trained , that he will be a scholar through life , and occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherished work of mental improvement . This great end of study should determine the methods of instruction . Such discipline is not to be gained by learning a few text-books by rote , nor by any degree of skill in mnemonics . It is the result of mental discipline , secured by close application and the thorough understanding of every branch pursued . From what has been said , it is obvious that it is the teacher 's chief business to see , not how much he can get into the heads of his pupils , but how much he can get out of them . Drawing out is , in the end , the best way to put in . The culture of the mind is to be measured not by what it contains , but by what it can do . Efficiency is the proper test of mental impro vement . Hence the teacher should make every effort to awaken and sustain a spirit of self-reliance . He should throw the pupil upon his own resources , and make him feel that he must train himself by his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that " every one is the architect of his own fortune . " In the breast of each pupil are the germs of those plastic faculties , which he can mould and shape as he will , and which , if rightly trained , will secure his usefulness and happiness . They are always the best taught , who in the highest sense of the term , are self-taught , ' who make use of the lessons of their teachers , chiefly as guides in the work of self training . The best scholars in our schools are those who lean least upon their instructors , and rely most upon themselves . It is the teacher 's office not so much to impart knowledge as to show his pupils how to get it ; to give a strong impulse to their minds , and lead them , in conscious self.reliance , to put forth their utmost energies . He will thus inspire them with a love of study and delight in mastering difficulties , till they feel all the incitements of victors , and are encouraged to go on from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits of study , is no easy task . Under the most favorable circumstances , it will involve great difficulty and demand persevering effort . The accomplishment of this one rcsult is the greatest achievement of the successful teacher . it is the cardinal secret of a good education . These principles should guide committees in the selection of teachers ; and any one who , on trial , is found to lack this important faculty , however excellent in other respects , and however popular in the district , is not equal to the responsible task assumed . It is a radical defect for which no degree of literary attainments or suavity of manners can compensate . Boys or girls educated on the system advocated above , can hardly fail of success , whmen they pursue , in a like spirit , their // appropriate callings in life . They will have clear ideas-and know what they are talking about when they speak at all . If they undertake to write , they will be capable of concentrating all their powers upon a given subject , and will write sensibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the business of life , to decide in some novel emergency , they will think accurately , and decide promptly , for a thoroughly disciplined mind will always furnish a clue for the solution of the problem . Such a mind , even when overtaken by an unusual combination of circumstances , will not resolve on one thing to-day , and to-morrow the opposite ; nor begin to doubt and waver as soon as any thing positive has been determined upon . It is not difficult to recognize such a person as well in a brief conversation , as in the whole course of life . He is distinguishable , at a glance , from those who are forever lingering among unexecuted resolutions and abandoned projects-always making up their minds , but never reaching a fixed and an abiding conclusion . Those who are alternately drawn in opposite directions , soon find their efforts frustrating one another , and come to feel demeaned in their own eyes . Conscious that they are powerless , they have neither the heart to attempt , nor the force to accomplish anything . Suoh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency against which our youth need to be guarded with special care . The erroneous theory of education under consideration directly fosters fickleness , while thorough mental discipline imparts unity and force to the character . *Without such discipline , a man will not think for himself-he will waver and hesitate-now almost persuaded , and soon not persuaded at all . He will have neither accurate discrimination nor sound judgment ; he may be very learned in appearance , but never strong , self-relying and original . We have said that pupils can be so trained in the common school , and form such settled habits of thoroughness in study , that they will be studious through life , however early may be the daily summons to business or labor , and however late their release . To illustrate this point , we will cite a single instance out of many others which have fallen under our observation . An operative in one of the large ruanufactories of Massachusetts , who had enjoyed no advantages beyond a thorough common school education , was in the habit of spending all the leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the study of the Differential and Integral Calculus , and the higher and more recondite branches of Mathematics . The late Professor of Mathematics in Yale College gave a particular commendation of his new and improved demonstrations of VOL irn. 4 // " Taylor 's and Maclaurin 's Theorems , " and other theorems ' in the Calculus , and expressed in a letter to the writer , his strong hope that the mind which could achieve such results , in the face of such obstacles , should find some more fit and congenial employment  --  a wish that has since been realized by the transfer of the operative to time Office of the United States Coast Survey . Many similar facts might be mentioned for the encouragement of those just entering upon the active pursuits of life , who are so apt to think that they can find no time for selfculture . But is the little leisure which they have well improved ? Should the evenings be idled away because the days are occupied with business or labor ? how did Elihu Burnt get time at the anvil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where did Franklin find time to educate himself in the printing shop for the philosopher and statesman ? It is due to the &amp;rcellency and thoroughness of the Common Schools of Massachusetts , that so many of her sons have lately risen to eminence from the humblest walks of industry . Many of the agents and superintendents of her largest manufacturing establishments-receiving salaries higher than those of any civil office within the gift of the commonwealth-commenced their course as common operatives . Many prominent public men in Lowell , and elsewhere in the state , had an equally humble origin and enjoyed no educational privileges above those furnished in the Public Schools . Among them are found Mayors of cities , Members and Presidents of the State Senate , Speakers of the Massachusetts House of Representatives , including the present incumbent , and Representatives to Congress . We might speak in the same connection of an eminently successf*l Boston merchant  --  a worthy representative of many others of the same class ,  --  who though burdened with the widely different cares of extensive mercantile , commercial , and manufacturing departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refinements of letters and the thorough study of the sciences , and who has made valuable discoveries in natural history-particularly in entomology and its practical application to horticulture . Indeed , facts sthnd out on every side , which clearly show that Massachusetts has never before furnished such facilities for intellectual improvement , nor presented incentives and encouragements so well fitted to call forth the highest aspirations of her youth . It might be inferred from what has been said , that " keys in mathematics " woukl meet with little favor in Massachusetts . Indeed , a strong , though in some quarters ineffectual influence , has been employed for their suppression . In many towns , // teachers have been instructed to treat them as " contraband goods , " and have accumulated small collections of these confiscated articles . Common as they are , it is yet certain that no judicious teacher or parent will tolerate them . In view of ' the principles already set forth , it is obvious that they must impair or defeat the primary object of education . They discourage patient thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indolence , superficiality and conceit . The pupil who has simply copied a solution , comes to the recitation with a flattering and complacent assumption that he understands the problem , when it can be truly understood only by being worked out . The best excuse pupils can give for using them , is the usual one , " We can get along so fast with them , " and the best plea we have ever heard for making them , was the frank confession offered by the venerable author of a popular series of school mathematics before the American Institute of instruction , " Because they sell so well . " It is difficult to induce pupils in their hot haste " to get through the book , " to pause long enough to consider that the proper discipline of the mind is gained more effectually by doing a few things well , than by any eager attempts to get over a wide field . A child is a creature of habit , and if dependence upon such aids be permitted , the habit will be soon fixed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if rightly pursued , will tend to the culture of self-reliance. iNot only are keys to be discarded ; but the practice , formerly very common , of " doing sums " for pupils without a clear explanation of the principles upon which they are founded , is equally reprehensible . If the learner meets with a difficulty , instead of working out the roblem for him , or plainly telling him the operation , the teac*ier should endeavor to discover that difficulty as it lies in the pupil 's mind , and make such suggestions as will put him on the track , and enable him to reason it out for himself . Perhaps he does not fully understand the question ; then the data of the problem should be simplified and explained to him . Perhaps the solution involves some former principle which does not readily recur to his mind ; then his memory should be refreshed on that point . Some such mode is always preferable to the practice , still too common , of telling the pupil directly the process , or doing it for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by seeing the teacher perform the operation , than his physical system to be invigorated by idly witnessing the gymnastic feats of an athlete . The process is sometimes worse than lost , leading the pupil to pass over the book with the complacent idea that he understands it . // When the learner requires assistance too often , it is an in*Iication that some previous principles have not been thoroughly understood , and that he should go back and review . But at this point , parents often fail to render that countenance to the teacher which the best good of their children requires , and manifest too ready a sympathy with their complaints , because they are obliged to retrace their steps . They seem to measure the depth of their children 's kno*vledo-e which it is spread . * by the surface over Many parents formerly remonstrated against the rule , requiring the book to be withheld at recitations from all classes in mental arithmetic . The considerations already advanced will indicate the reason and propriety of this rule . It is designed that the scholars should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry on the processes entirely in their own minds , unassisted by any associations of the book . This method is better fitted to fix attention and task the reason and memory . The working of this plan , and tIme pleasant results already witnessed , have converted the remonstrants to whom we have alluded into its warum supporters . To corroborate the views we have thus far presented , and at the same time indicate the theory of education held by the present Secretary and applied by the best teachers in IMI assachusetts , we give the following extract from a previous Re-port : " It is a very common error to regard education a consisting chiefly in the acquisition of knowledge . Persons who entertain this view genernily estimate knowledge by its extent rather than by its depth . If we look into the schools where education is conducted on such a principle  --  and it would not be difficult to find them-we shall see the pupils laboring to store the memory with an immense mass of words and sentences , which are to them often little better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without understanding their nature , relations or uses . The minds of such persons are like furniture rooms , crammed with articles without utility or order . The acquisitions made are not deeply fixed in the mind . The objects presented to view leave no distinct picture on the imagination . They are not compared , classified and arranged into a system by the intellect of the pupil , and consequently the memory holds them by a slight tenure . Knowledge thus acquired is too superficial to deserve the name , and rather injures than improves the mind . The habit of taking up with first impressions and specious appearances , of allowing loose and inaccurate ideas to float in the mind , is most pernicious in its influences . It tends to weaken the understanding , to destroy its soundness and integrity , and to render it incapable of those decisive and sure acts which are necessary to command reliance . What is chiefly to be aimed at in training this faculty is to give it power and precision , so that it may be both effective and safe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by patient , exact , and thorough training . Mental discipline is a primary o4ject of edacatiou , to which the acquisition of knowledge is but secondary . The latter is , in this stage of study , chiefly important as a means of intellectual training , having at the same time a true but subordinate value in itself . Extensive knowledge is not necessary // to mental discipline . A little that is well known and thoroughly digested is vastly superior in worth to a great amount hastily and superficially acquired . Not only is its effect upon the mind better , but its value as an instrument of future acquisition is greater . If elementary knowledge be of a faulty character , all that higher knowledge which depends upon it will be equally so . The principle here laid down will appear the more important , if we consider that its influence is not limited to the elementary schools , but extends to all our higher institutions of learning . The weakest point in the whole system of American education , is its deficiency in thoroughness in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much preparatory study as they now have . In our academies , pupils enter upon the study of the ancient languages with a very defective English education . And it will be found , upon examination , that the whole superstructure of our higher education is insecure in consequence of the slender foundation laid in the elementary schools . The evil spreads from the root of the tree to all its branches , and can be effectually arrested only where it originates . If every exercise in the school were such in its disciplinary character that it might serve as a pattern to be copied in all the remaining studies and business of life , this one feature in a system of education would be so valuable that , in comparison with it , all the ostentations attainments made without method or discipline would be o'f little account . Habits of order , of accuracy and thoroughness , lie at the foundation of all success in business , no less than in scholarship . This building up of the solid frame-work of the mind , giving it capacity and aptitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of education . A contrary coui-se impairs the strength of the intellect , weakens the whole foundation of character , begets disgust with intellectual effort , leads to sciolism and conceit , and produces just such a character as it is the business of true education to guard against . There has been a marked change in Massachusetts in respect to the permanency of teachers . Under the old system of semiannual changes , with male teachers in the winter and females in the summer , such a result as we have above described is little less than impossible . There can be no definite system , no well defined plan consistently sustained and cat-ned out . It often *:equires nearly a term to initiate a new teacher into the policy of the school committee who officially direct his plans . He can not , perhaps , in less time , correct the mistakes and bad habits formed under his predecessor and get his own plans and processes fully into operation , and the result is the neglect of system . The conviction that there will not be tune to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be wholly counteracted by an incompetent successor , discourages the attempt . It is a conceded point among all successful teachers that a second term is worth at least one-thii-d more than time first . The old practice of " rotation in office " involved a dead loss of more than thirty per cent . of the expenditures made for schools . A teacher must learn the characters of his pupils before he can successfully teach them ; until he knows the peculiarities , the attainments and wants of each pupil , he can not adapt himself to them , and must work in the dark . But a permanent teacher , who knows every scholar , // and every class , can enter upon a new term without any abatement of interest , and at the outset suit the modes of instruction to the character and standing of each pupil . The teacher for the time being stands in the p lace of the parent . And what results would be realized in the family , were a new step-father , or step-mother , to be semi-annually invested wilim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , as it would be in the household . What would be the effect of a semi-annual change of clerks and book-keepers in our mercantile establishments , or of agents and overseers in our manufactories , or of financiers in our banks ? Shrewd men never make such blunders in business matters , although such frequent changes would be less disastrous to worldly enterprises than they are to the best interests of schools . We have said that no one can teach successfully , without a *morough acquaintance with his pupil . He must learn both the faults and excellencies of his heart , and the difficult and easy processes of his mind . He must avail himself of every means to find out his entire character , as a discriminating physician watches closely all the symptoms of his patient , in order to understand what ought to be done for him . However large the school , the teacher should regard an intimate knowledge of each pupil as essential to his thorough instruction . This knowledge can not be obtained intuitively , or by the facile process of phrenology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study . And it is worth all the labor it costs . This most valuable acquisition belongs only to the permanent teacher . It is his most available capital . The report before us speaks of a general and decided advance in the qaal*ftcation8 of teachers during the period under review . This change is attributed chiefly to the influence of the Institutes and Normal Schools . Mere literary attainments are no longer regarded as comprising the sole qualifications of the teacher . The subject of Didactics has assumed new importance and now constitutes a prominent part of the preparatory course of the teacher . The studies and training of teachers should be such as to facilitate the knowledge of individual character , and enable them to analyze the mind of a child-to understand its elementary powers , and their mutual connection and dependence , and the order and method in which they are to be addressed and developed .. It is the great business of the teacher to work upon the mind . It is in the sphere of mind that he lives , and acts , and operates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind . Its profound and comprehensive principles should be familiar truths . // The art of applying these principles should be no less diligently studied . It doserves the name of an Art . In its right culture and exercise , as well as in its refining , elevating , *st1ietic infinence , it is not a whit inferior to any of the noblest arts . It is an art founded on the noblest science-that of mind ; and directed to the noblest end  --  the culture of the immortal soul . In the Normal School , the theory and practice of education are studied , both as a science and an art . Teaching assumes the character of a distinct profession . And no profession more imperatively demands a distinct school for instruction in its appropriate science . It is a difficult science . It includes , as already indicated , the study of character , the laws and capacities of the juvenile mind , the philosophy of persuasion , of discipline , and of influence , in its application to the young . The highest literary attainments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The process of studying any given subject for the mere purpose of recitation , is a very different timing from that required for the purpose of teaching the same branch . The one exercises chiefly the memory , the other the judgment . But when a subject is studied with the intention of explaining every difficulty it contains , to the comprehension of a child , it must be thoroughly understood in itself and in all its collateral relations . There is a great variety of methods of illustrating the same lesson ; and only the teacher who understands both his profession and the character of his pupils , can adapt the countless varieties of method to the various diversities of mind . The teacher should understand the best methods to subdue the obstinate , stimulate the indolent , arouse the stupid , and make the careless hunger and thirst for lnowledge , and to win the confidence and affections of all . Bad habits are to be broken up , evil tendencies to be checked , the attractions of virtue to be set forth , and the sanctions of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the most exalted talents , enriched by all the treasures of science , will find ample employment for all their resources . How great , then , is the responsibility of the teacher ! Shall we commit the guidance of such precious interests , for both worlds , to every college stripling who resorts to teaching , during his winter vacation , as a temporary and often very tedious expedient to replenish an empty pocket ? or to any persons who can find nothing else to do in the interval of their summer labors ? Shall those who despair of success in* any employment , be allowed to take up school-keeping as an ultimate resource ? // It may be thought by some that we have drawn too high ' a standard of qualifications , especially for the teachers in our Primary Schools . We are aware that it is a current opinion , that teachers of inferior attainments will answer for primary schools , and that almost anybody can teach small children . But this is a great mistake . It is all-important to start aright in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very first and simplest rudiments . In education , that which comes earliest , transcends everything else in importance . Habits of study are very soon formed , and when once formed , it is almost impossible to change them . The bent and bias of pliant childhood will shape and direct the growth of maturer years . " The dew-drop on the infant plant Has warped the giant oak forever . " " The mind-impressible and soft-with ease Imbibes and copies what she hears and sees ; And through life 's labyrinth , holds fast the clew That first instruction gives her-false or true . " Above* all others , should the first teacher of the juvenile mind be vigilant , and competent " To guide its first development , to watch The dawn of little thoughts  --  to see and aid Almost its very growth . " It is necessary for such a teacher to have clear and settled views as to what faculties are to be first called into exercise , and the true method to teach each subject to beginners . Their fondness or avei'sion for study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will depend very much upon their first methods of instruction . A disrelish for study-deep , settled and lasting as life , is often formed in the primary school . There are numerous instances of those who have been pronounced dull and unpromising by their first teachers , who have made great proficiency as soon as they came under the influence of instructors who understood them , who had the sagacity to perceive their peculiar character and wants , and the skill to adapt the processes of instruction to their peculiarities of mind . To cite one of the many examples that might be given , the early teacher of the celebrated Dr. Adam Clarke often chastised him for his dullness , and expressed his fears that he never could be made to learn . fins apprehensions would probably have proved true , and the slumbering powers of the lad remained undeveloped , had he not come under better influences . But fortunately for him , at the age of eight years he was placed under a teacher who at once discovered his latent talent , and who knew how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouragement , by methods adapted to his peculiar state and disposition , aroused the dormant energies of his mind . Since the existence of the Board of Education in Massachusetts , and the consequent revival of interest in the subject , there has been a regular diminution in the number of male teachers , and a rapid increase of the number of female teachers . The number of male teachers in the public schools in the state in 1837 was 2,370 , and the number of female teachers was 3,591 . But the present Report of the Secretary of the Board of Education gives the number of male , teachers as 1,932 , and the number of females as 5,166 . Thus in seventeen years , while schools have been rapidly multiplying and the whole number of teachers is 1137 greater than in 1837 , the number of male teachers has fallen off 438 , and the number of female teachers has increased 1575 . These statistics clearly show , that the more thoroughly the complicated subject of education is investigated and understood , the more general is the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now offering simply for winter s*hools , who have given any attention to a proper preparation for this great work . They are usually but partially educated , and that education had no reference to teaching . They take it up as a catchpenny business at odd intervals , without experience , and with no thought of making it a permanent business , with little interest iii the work , and often with a positive and strong aversion to it ; and , as a natural consequence , with little care whether they succeed or not . The rapid expansion of business , of late , has increased the demand for competent young men . Those who have the requisite qualifications to make teachers , avoid this poorly paid profession , and readily obtain some more lucrative employment . Those who offer from our colleges-it is said-are usually indigent young men , and should therefore be employed in our schools as means of assisting them in their education . We do not deny that they are worthy and excellent young men-often young men of great promise . We heartily sympathize with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their earnest and persevering efforts . They ought to be encouraged and supplied with the needful " material aid . " But this aid should be given in some better way . In this land of free schools , mione who thirst for knowledge should be denied the privilege of obtaining it . Public or private charity seldom does a nobler work , than iii helping forward a young man of talent through that thorough educational course which will // qualify him for eminent usefulness . But if the requisite a'id could be furnished in no other way , it would be better economy to make a direct appropriation from the treasury of the towns for their benefit , than to employ them as teachers of our youth . They are still students . Their sympathies and interests are at college . Their terms of teaching usually exceed the college vacations . Much of their time and thoughts are occupied with their own studies , in the attempt to keep pace with their classes at college . A double task is undertaken , and , in the end , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as prejudicial to their own scholarship and standing in college , as it is detrimental to the best interest of their schools . Tim cy may be accurate scholars in Latin and Greek , but are often exceedingly deficient in the simple English rudiments . Any knowledge of higher branches , will not compensate for ignorance of the elementary studies pursued in our Common Schools . School Committees in Massachusetts have not unfrequently-felt compelled to reject College students , who on examination were found decidedly inferior in spelling , arithmetic , grammar and geography , to many pupils in the schools they were engaged to teach . It it is usually with quite a sophomoric air that the disappointed candidates express their surprise that they , memhers of College , can not p ass an examination before a Common School Committee , when the wonder is , that they ever were members of any College . If they are an average sample , the standard of admission in certain Institutions must be such as to demand at once a new professorship-the Chair of Spelling and Belles lettres EUmentarie. * Such is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The precious interests of education should not be committed to those who make it only a temporary resource in the prosecution of some other calling or profession . " Oh ! let not then unskillful hands attempt To play the harp whose tones , whose living tones Are left forever in the strings . Better far That heaven 's lightnings blast his very soul , And sink it hack to chaos ' lowest depths , Than knowingly , by word or deed , he send A blight upon the trusting mind of youth . " There is , happily , no longer any necessity in Massachusetts for employing any other than competent and well trained * There are exceptions to all rules , and it is but justice to say that some undergraduate teachers have evidently possessed superior qualifications , evinced great skill and tact , and accomplished the happiest results , // teachers ; Her High Schools and Academies , and more than all her numerous Institutes and Normal Schools , are supplying the increasing demand for thoroughly qualified female teachers for her public Schools . Already in many towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As their wages are usually about half those of male teachers , some towns have gained an additional term by this change , and secured annual schools . So far as the experiment has been fully tried , the result has demonstrated the wisdom and propriety of the change . Should not then a system which has already succeeded so well in Massachusetts , which is becoming increasingly popular and prevalent in that state , and which furnishes teachers of decidedly better qualifications at half the wsual wages of male teachers-be more extensively adopted in other states . This is a practical question of so great importance and of such immediate interest to all friends of popular education as to require a further exposition of the reasons which favor the general adoption of this arrangement . Females seem to be better adapted by nature to the work of teaching . There is more truth than hyperbole in a remark recently made to a body of teachers by Dr. Wayland , that " it is a rare thing to find a man who has a gift for teaching , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not teach well . " It ts " a rare th ing'to find men who have a peculiar tact for teaching the young . Experience evinces their adaptation to their ordinary and appropriate pursuits . A larger proportion of men are found to distinguish themselves , for ability and success , in other departments of life , than in the profession of teaching . But a small number of male teachers leave their impress clearly marked upon their pupils . They lack the requisite gentleness-patience and perseverance in little thingsthe quick discernment of character  --  the sympathy and sensibility to penetrate th' youthful spirit and arouse its latent powers . Above all , they are destitute of those delicate arts which are so requisite to win the affections of children , to call forth and direct their earliest aspirations , and to impart the needful impulse to their minds . Cheerfulness and enthusiasm , courtesy and kindness , and the power of easy , quiet , unconscious influence , are requisites indispensable to the attractiveness , order and efficiency of the school . Females are endowed with a more bountiful share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges-where mind , in its maturing state and fuller development , is stimulated by the strongest incentives to study , and subjected to the severest discipline , and led onward into the higher departments of literature and sci // ence-it is obviously better to employ permanent male teachers . But in all elementary instruction , the very structure of her mind fits woman for the task . Nature has marked her out for this great work . Outside of the family , she nowhere seems so truly to occupy her appropriate here . All her attainments and powers can here be active y and earnestly employed . The work is adapted to her mental and moral constitution . No occupation harmonizes better with her character , or yields her more genuine pleasure . We are not alone in the views we have advocated on this subject . The statistics we have given , indicate their increasing prevalence . They are believed to accord with the sentiments of the most distinguished friends of education in the country . Says Governor Seward , of New York : " He , it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that it was the intention of the Creator to commit to females a higher and greater portion of responsibility in the education of youth of both sexes . They are the natural guardians of the young . Their abstraction from the engrossing cares of life affords them leisure both to acquire and communicate knowledge . From them the young more willingly receive it , because the severity of discipline is relieved with greater tenderness and affection ; while their more quick apprehension , enduring patience , expansive benevolence , higher purity , more delicate taste , and elevated moral feelings , qualify them for excellence in all departments of learning , except , perhaps , the exact sciences . I fthis be true , how many a repulsive , bigoted and indolent professor will , in the general improvement of education , be compelled to resign his claim to modest , assiduous and affectionate woman ! And how many conceited pretenders , who may wield the rod in our common schools , without the knowledge of human nature requisite for its discreet exercise-too indolent to improve , and too proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere ! " The leading objectiowto the policy here advocated , is founded on the supposition that delicate and timid women will not succeed so well in the government of a school in which rough and refractory boys are gathered together . This is the most common and plansable objection , and is worthy of respectful consideration . It was formerly supposed that physical strength was a prime characteristic of a good disciplinarian , and that brute force was the chief agency in school government . The objection under consideration has some affinity to this antiquated notion . Horace Mann has well said : " A man may keep a difficult school by means of authority and physical force ; a // woman can do it only by dignity of character , affection , and such a superiority in attainment as is too conspicuous to be questioned . " A silent moral power ought to reign in the school-room , rather than ostentatious and coercive measures . Its influence is more happy , effective and permanent . Corporeal punishments may be used as a dernier resort in extreme cases . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevention , rather than in the punishment of offensesin cultivating the better feelings of our nature , truthfulness , generosity , kindness and self-respect . Such influences women are preeminently fitted to wield . iRefined and lady-like manners , with a mellow and winning voice , will exert a peculiar sway , even upon the rudest and most unmannerly youth . There is a silent power in the very face of a teacher beaming with love for her pupils , and enthusiasm in her noble work . We shall pursue the subject farther .
