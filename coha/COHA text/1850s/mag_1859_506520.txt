At home in Virginia , I found myself disagreeing with everybody as usual . By the Patriots I was voted ( as indeed I professed myself to be ) a Tory ; by the Tories I was presently declared to be a dangerous Republican . The time was utterly out of joint . 0 cursed spite ! Ere I had been a year in Virginia , how I wished myself back by the banks of Waveney ! But the aspect of affairs was so troublous that I could not leave my mother , a lone lady , to face possible war and disaster , nor would she quit the country at such a juncture , nor should a man of spirit leave it . At his Excellency 's table , and over his Excellency 's plentiful claret that point was agreed on by numbers of the well affected , that vow was vowed over countless brimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We Cavaliers would all rally round it ; and at these times our Governor talked like the bravest of the brave . Now , I will say , of all my Virginian acquaintance , Madam Esmond was the most consistent . Our gentlefolks had come in numbers to Williamsburg ; and a great number of them proposed to treat her Excellency , the Governor 's lady , to a ball when the news reached us of the Boston Port Bill . Straightway the House of Burgesses adopts an indignant protest against this measure of the British Parliament , and decrees a solemn day of fast and humiliation throughout the country , and of solemn prayer to Heaven to avert the calamity of Civil War . Meanwhile , the invitation to my Lady Dunmore having been already given and accepted , the gentlemen agreed that their ball should take place on the appointed evening , and then sackcloth and ashes . should be assumed some days afterward . " A ball ! " says Madam Esmond . " I go to a ball which is given by a set of rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward ! I will die sooner ! " And she wrote to the gentlemen who were stewards for the occasion to say , that viewing the dangerous state of the country , she , for her part , could not think of attending a ball . What was her surprise then , the next time she went abroad in her chair , to he cheered by a hundred persons , white and black , and shouts of " Huzzah , Madam ! " " Heaven bless your Ladyship ! " They evidently thought her patriotism had caused her determination not to go to the ball . Madam , that there should be no mistake , puts her head out of the chair , and cries out God save the King , as loud as she can . The people cried God save the King , too . Every body cried God save the King in those days .

My Lady Warrington and her humble servant , as being strangers in the country , and English people as it were , were permitted by Madam to CHAPTER LXXXVII . THE LAST OF GOD SAVE TEE KING .

When the day of fast and humiliation was appointed , and when he attended the service which our new clergyman performed . She invited Mr. Belman to dinner that day , and sundry colonial authorities . The clergyman excused himself . Madam Esmond tossed up her head , and said he might do as he liked . She made a parade of a dinner ; she lighted her house up at night , when all the rest of the city was in darkness and gloom ; she begged Mr. Hardy , one of his Excellency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to which the people in the street outside listened , thinking that it might be a part of some religious service which Madam was celebrating ; but then she called for " Britons , strike home I " which the simple young gentleman just from Europe began to perform , when a great yell arose in the street , and a large stone , flung from some rebellious hand , plumped into the punch-bowl before me , and scattered it and its contents about our dining-room . My mother went to the window , nothing daunted . I can see her rigid little figure now , as she stands with a tossed-up head , outstretched , frilled arms , and the twinkling stars for a back-ground , and sings in chorus , " Britons , strike home ! strike home ! " The crowd in front of the palings shout and roar , " Silence ! for shame ! go back ! " but she will not go back , not she . " Fling more stones , if you dare ! " says the brave little lady ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the Haley Tavern interpose with the crowd . " You must n't insult a lady , " says a voice I think I know . " Huzza , Colonel ! Hurrah , Captain ! " God bless your honor ! " say the people in the street . And thus the enemies are pacified . My mother protesting that the whole disturbance was over , would have had Mr. Hardy sing another song ; but he gave a sickly grill , and said " he really did not like to sing to such accompaniments , " and the concert for that evening was ended ; though I am bound to say that some scoundrels returned at night , frightened my poor wife almost out of wits , and broke every single window in the front of our tenement . " Britons , strike home ! " was a little too much . Madam should have contented herself with " God save the King ! " Militia was drilled , bullets were cast , supplies of ammunition got ready , cunning plans for disappointing the royal ordinances devised and carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the King " was the cry every where ; and in reply to my objections to the gentlemenpatriots , " Why , you are scheming for a separation ; you are bringing down upon you the inevitable wrath of the greatest power in the world the answer to me always was , " We mean no separation at all ; we yield to no men in loyalty ; we glory in the name of Britons , " and so forth , and so forth . The powder-barrels were heaped in the cellar , the train was laid , but Mr. Fawkes was persistent in his dutiful petitions to King and Parliament , and meant no harm , not he ! T is true when I speke of the power of our *ountry I imagined she would exert it ; that she would not expect to overcome three millions of fellow-Britons on their own soil with a few battalions , a half-dozen generals from Bond Street , and a few thousand bravos hired out of Germany . As if we wanted to insult the thirteen colonies as well as to subdue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hessians , and the murderers out of the Indian wigwams . Was our great quarrel not to be fought without tali auxilio and istis d*frnsoribus ? Ah ! t is easy , now we are worsted , to look over the map of the great empire wrested from us , and show how we ought not to have lost it . Long Island ought to have exterminated Washington 's army ; he ought never to have come out of Valley Forge except as a prisoner . The South was ours after the battle of Camden , but for the inconceivable meddling of the Commander-in-Chief at New York , who paralyzed the exertions of the only capable British General who appeared during the war , and sent him into that miserable cul-de-sac at York Town , whence he could only issue defeated and a prisoner . Oh for a week more ! a day more , an hour more of darkness or light ! In reading over our American campaigns , from their unhappy commencement to their inglorious end , now that we are able to see the enemy 's movements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see how an advance , a march , might have put enemies into our power who had no means to withstand it , and changed the entire issue of the struggle . But it was ordained by Heaven , and for the good , as we can now have no doubt , of both empires , that the great Western Republic should separate from us : and the gallant soldiers who fought on her side , their indomitable and heroic Chief above all , had the glory of facing and overcoming , not only veteran soldiers amply provided and inured to war , but wretchedness , cold , hunger , dissensions , treason within their own camp , where all must have gone to rack , but for the pure , unquenchable flame of patriotism that was forever burning in the bosom of the heroic leader . What a constancy , what a magnanimity , what a surprising persistence against fortune ! Washington before the enemy was no better nor braver than hundreds that fought with him or against him ( who has not heard the repeated sneers against " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulge ? ) : but Washington , the Chief of a nation in arms , doing battle with distracted parties ; calm in the midst of conspiracy ; serene against the open foe before him and the darker enemies at his back ; Washington , inspiring order and spirit into troops hungry and in rags ; stung by ingratitude , but betraying no anger , and ever ready to forgive ; in defeat invincible , magnanimous in conquest , and never so sublime as on that day when he laid down his victorious sword and sought his noble retirement - here indeed is a character to admire and re . vere ; a life without a stain , a fame without a flaw . Quando inveajes parem ? In that more extensive work which I have planned and partly written on the subject of this great war , I hope // I have done justice to the character of its great est leader . * And this from the sheer force of respect which his eminent virtues extorted . With the young Mr. Washington of my own early days I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose character is much more frank and affectionate than mine , was always his fast friend in early times , when they were equals , as in latter days when the General , as I do own and think , was all mankind 's superior . I have mentioned that contrariety in my disposition , and , perhaps , in my brother 's , which somehow placed us on wrong sides in the quarrel which ensued , and which from this time forth raged for five years , until the mother country was fain to acknowledge her defeat . Harry should have been the Tory , and I the Whig . Theoretically my opinions were very much more liberal than those of my brother , who , especially after his marriage , became what our Indian anbobs call a Bahadoor  --  a person ceremonious , stately , and exacting respect . When my Lord Duamore , for instance , talked about liberating the negroes , so as to induce them to join the king 's standard , Hal was for hanging the Governor and the Black Guards ( as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you gentlemen are fighting for freedom , " says I , " sure the negroes may fight too . " On which Harry roars out , shaking his fist , " Infernal villains , if I meet any of em , they shall die by this hand ! " And my mother agreed that this idea of a negro insurrection was the most abominable and parricidal notion which had ever sprung np in her unhappy country . She at least was more consistent than Brother Hal . She would have black and white obedient to the powers that be : whereas Hal only could admit that freedom was the right of the latter color . As a proof of her argument , Madam Esmond and Harry too would point to an instance in our own family in the person of Mr. Gumbo . Having got his freedom from me , as a reward for his admirable love and fidelity to me when times were hard , Gumbo , on his return to Virginia , was scarce a welcome guest in his old quarters , among my mother 's servants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as it were a centre of insurrection . He gave himself no small airs of protection and consequence among them ; bragging of his friends in Europe ( " at home , " as he called it ) and his doings there ; and for a while bringing the household round about him to listen to him and admire him , like the monkey who had seen the world . Now Sady , Hal 's boy , who went to America of his own desire , was not free . Hence jealousies between him and Mr. Gum : and battles in which they both practiced the noble art of boxing and butting , which they had learned at Marybone Gardens and Hockley-inthe-Hole . Nor was Sady the only jealous person : almost all my mother 's servants hated Signor Gumbo for the airs which he gave himself ; and I am sorry to say that our faithful Molly , his wife , was as jealous as his old fellow-servants . The blacks could not pardon her for having demeaned herself so far as to marry one of their kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : came to her mistress with ceaseless complaints of the idleness , knavery , lies , stealing of the black people , and finally with a story of jealousy against a certain Dinah , or Diana , who I heartily trust was as innocent as her namesake the moonlight visitant of Endymion . Now on the article of morality Madam Esmond was a very Draconess ; and a person accused was a person guilty . She made charges against Mr. Gumbo , to which he replied with asperity . Forgetting that he was a free gentleman , my mother now ordered Gumbo to be whipped , on which Molly flew at her ladyship , all her wrath at her husband 's infidelity vanishing at the idea of the indignity put upon him there was a rebellion in our house at Castlewood . A quarrel took place between me and my mother , as I took my man 's side . Hal and Fanny sided with her , on the contrary ; and in so far the difference did good , as it brought about some little intimacy between Madam and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was clear that the Standard of Insurrection must be removed out of our house ; and we determined that Mr. Gumbo and his lady should return to Europe . My wife and I would willingly have gone with them , God wot , for our boy sickened and lost his strength , and caught the fever in our swampy country ; but at this time she was expecting to lie in ( of our son Henry ) , and she knew , too , that I had promised to stay in Virginia . It was agreed that we should send the two back ; but when I offered Theo to go , she said her place was with her husband-her father and Hetty at home would take care of our children ; and she scarce would allow me to see a tear in her eyes while she was making her preparations for the departure of her little ones . Dost thou remember the time , Madam , and the silence round the work-tables , as the piles of little shirts aie made ready for the voyage ? and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Theo 's children returned with the Reverend Mr. Hagan and my Lady Maria on board , who meekly chose to resign her rank , and was known in the colony ( which was not to be a colony very long ) only as Mrs. Hagan . At the time when I was in favor with my Lord Dunmore , a living falling vacant in Westmoreland County , he gave it to our kinsman , who arrived in Virginia time enough to christen our boy Henry , and to preach some sermons on the then gloomy state of affairs , which Madam Esmond pronounced to be prodigious fine . I think my Lady Maria won Madam 's heart by insisting on going out of the room after her . " My father , your brother , was an earl , t is true , " says she , " but you know your ladyship is a marquis 's daughter , and I never can think of taking precedence of you ! " So fond did Madam become of her niece , that she even allowed Hagan to read plays-my own humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was merit in the tragedy of Pocahontas , which our parson delivered with uncommon energy and fire . Hal and his wife came but rarely to Castlewood and Richmond when the chaplain and his lady were with us . Fanny was very curt and rude with Maria , used to giggle and laugh strangely in her company , and repeatedly remind her of her age , to our mother 's astonishment , who would often ask , was there any cause of quarrel between her niece and her daughterin-law ? I kept my own counsel on these occasions , and was often not a little touched by the meekness with which the elder lady bore her persecutions . Fanny loved to torture her in her husband 's presence ( who , poor fellow ! was also in a happy ignorance about his wife 's early history ) , and the other bore her agony , wincing as little as might be . I sometimes would remonstrate with Madam Harry , and ask her was she a red Indian , that she tortured her victims so ? " Have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young lady , and looked as though she was determined to pay back the ifijuries inflicted on her . " Nay , " says I , " you were bred in our wigwam , and I do n't remember any thing but kind-ness " Kindness ! " cries she . " No slave was ever treated as I was . The blows which wound most , often are those which never are aimed . The people who hate us are not those we have injured . " I thought of little Fanny in our early days , silent , smiling , willing to run and do all our biddings for us . I grieved for my poor brother , who had taken this sly creature into his bosom . CHAPTER LXXXVIII . YANKEE DOODLE COMES TO TOWN . ONE of the uses to which we put America in the days of our British dominion was to make it a refuge for our sinners . Besides convicts and assigned servants whom we transported to our colonies , we discharged on their shores scape-* graces and younger sons , for whom dissipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as Mr. Cook , in his voyages , made his newly-discovered islanders presents of English animals ( and other specimens of European civilization ) , we used to take care to send samples of our black sheep over to the colonies , there to browse as best they might , and propagate their precious breed . I myself was perhaps a little guilty in this matter , in busying myself to find a living in America for the worthy Hagan , husband of my kinswoman-at least , was guilty in so far as this , that as we could get him no employment in England , we were glad to ship him to Virginia , and give him a colonial pulpitcushion to thump . He demeaned himself there as a brave honest gentleman , to be sure ; he did his duty thoroughly by his congregation , and his king too ; and in so far did credit to my small patronage . Madam Theo used to urge this when I confided to her my scruples of conscience on this subject , and show , as her custom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in all other matters , was dictated by the highest principle of morality and honor . But would I have given Hagan our living at home , and selected him and his wife to minister to our parish ? I fear not . I never had a doubt of our cousin 's sincere repentance ; but I think I was secretly glad when she went to work it out in the wilderness . And I say this , acknowledging my pride and my error . Twice , when I wanted them most , this kind Maria aided me with her sympathy and friendship . She bore // her own distresses courageously , and soothed those of others with admirable affection and devotion . And yet I , and some of mine ( not Theo ) , would look down upon her . Oh , for shame , for shame on our pride ! My poor Lady Maria was not the only one of our family who was to be sent out of the way to American wildernesses . Having borrowed , stolen , cheated at home , until he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honorable William Esmond , Esquire , was accommodated with a place at New York ; and his noble brother and royal master heartily desired that they might see him no more . When the troubles began , we heard of the fellow and his doings in his new habitation . Lies and mischief were his avant couriers wherever he traveled . My Lord Dunmore informed me that Mr. Will declared publicly , that our estate of Castlewood was only ours during his brother 's pleasure ; that his father , out of consideration for Madam Esmond , his lordship 's half-sister , had given her the place for life , and that he , William , was in negotiation with his brother , the present Lord Castlewood , for the purchase of the reversion of the estate ! We had the deed of gift in our strong room at Castlewood , and it was furthermore registered in due form at Williamsburg ; so that we were easy on that score . But the intention was every thing ; and Hal and I promised , as soon as ever we met Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty story . What Madam Es*mond 's feelings and expressions were when she heard it , I need scarcely here particularize . " What ! my father , the Marquis of Esmond was a liar , and I am a cheat , am I ? " cries my mother . " He will take my son 's property at my death , will he ! " And she was for writing , not only to Lord Castlewood in England , but to His Majesty himself at St. James 's , and was only prevented by my assurances that Mr. Will 's lies were notorious among all his acquaintance , and that we could not expect , in our own case , that he should be so inconsistent as to tell the truth . We heard of him presently as one of the loudest among the Loyalists in New York , as Captain , and presently Major of a corps of volunteers who were sending their addresses to the well-disposed in all the other colonies , and announcing their perfect readiness to die for the mother country . We could not lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shutters of that unlucky mansion we had hired at Williamsburg , Madam Esmond left our little capital , and my family returned to Richmond , which also was deserted by the members of the ( dissolved ) Assembly . Captain Hal and his wife returned pretty early to their plantation ; and I , not a little annoyed at the course which events were taking , divided my time pretty much between my own family and that of our Governor , who professed himself very eager to have my advice and company . There were the strongest political differences , but as yet no actual personal quarrel . Even after the dissolution of our House of Assembly , the members of which adjourned to a tavern , and there held that famous meeting where , I believe , the idea of a congress of all the colonies was first proposed , the gentlemen who were strongest in opposition remained good friends with his Excellency , partook of his hospitality , and joined him in excursions of pleasure . The session over , the gentry went home and had meetings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other provinces having been also abruptly dissolved , it was agreed every where that a general congress should be held . Philadelphia , as the largest and most important city on our continent , was selected as the place of meeting ; and those celebrated conferences began , which were but the angry preface of war . We were still at God save the King ; we were still presenting our humble petitions to the throne ; but when I went to visit my brother Harry at Fanny 's Mount ( his new plantation lay not far from ours , but with Rappahannock between us , and toward Mattaponey River ) , he rode out on business one morning , and I in the afternoon happened to ride too , and was told by one of the grooms that Master was gone toward Willis 's Ordinary ; in which direction , thinking no harm , I followed . And upon a clear place not far from Willis 's , as I advance out of the wood , I come on Captain Hal on horseback , with three or four-and-thirty countrymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pike , scythe , fowling-piece , and musket ; and the Captain , with two or three likely young fellows as officers under him , putting the men through their exercise . As I rode up a queer expression comes over Hal 's face . " Present arms ! " says he ( and the army tries to perform the salute as well as they could ) , " Captain Cade , this is my brother , Sir George Warrington . " " As a relation of yours , Colonel , " says the individual addressed as captain , " the gentleman is welcome , " and he holds out a hand accordingly . " And  --  and a true friend to Virginia , " says Hal , with a reddening face . " Yes , please God ! gentlemen , " say I , on which the regiment gives a hearty huzzay for the Colonel and his brother . The drill over , the officers , and the men too , were for adjourning to Willis 's and taking some refreshment , but Colonel Hal said he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " So , Hal , the cat 's out of the bag ! " I said . He gave me a hard look . " I guess there 's wilder cats in it . It must come to this , George . I say , you must n't tell Madam , " he adds . " Good God ! " I cried , " do you mean that with fellows such as those I saw yonder , you and your friends are going to make fight against the greatest nation and the best army in the world ? " " I guess we shall get an awful whipping , " says Hal , " and that 's the fact . But then , George , " he added , with his sweet kind smile , " we are young , and a whipping or two may do us good . Wo n't it do us good , Dolly , you old slut ? " and he gives a playful touch with his whip toan old dogofalltradesthatwas running byhim. // I did not try to urge upon him ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British side of the question , the side which appears to me to be the best . He was accustomed to put off my reasons by saying , " All mighty well , brother ; yon speak as an Englishman , and have cast in your lot with your country , as I have with mine . " To this argument I own there is no answer , and all that remains for the disputants is to fight the matter out , when the strongest is in the right . Which had the right in the wars of the last century ? The king or the parliament ? The side that was uppermost was the right , and , on the whole , much more humane in their victory than the Cavaliers would have been had they won . Nay , suppose we Tories had won the day in America , how frightful and bloody that triumph would have been ! What ropes and scaffolds one imagines ; what noble heads laid low ! A strange feeling this I ownI was on the Loyalist side , and yet wanted the Whigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , who distinguished himself greatly with his regiment , never allowed a word of disrespect against the enemy whom he opposed . " The officers of the British army , " he used to say , " are **/7 2* &lt;4-A REHEARSAL . // gentlemen : at least , I have not heard that they are very much changed since my . time . There may be scoundrels and ruffians among the enemy 's troops ; I dare say we could find some such among our own . Our business is to beat his Majesty 's forces , not call them names ; any rascal can do that . " And from a name which Mr. Lee gave my brother , and many of his rough horsemen did not understand , Harry was often called " Chevaleer Baird " iu the Continental army . He was a knight , indeed , without fear and without reproach . As for the argument , " What could such people as those you were drilling do against the British army ? " Hal had as confident answer : " They canbeat them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they can do . " " Great Heavens ! " I cry , " do you mean with your company of Wolfe 's you would hesitate to attack five hundred such ? " " With my company of the 67th I would go any where . And , agreed with you , that at this present moment I know more of soldiering than they ; but place me on that open ground where you found us , nrmed as you please , and half a dozen of my friends , with rifles , in the woods round about me ; which would get the better ? You know best , Mr. Braddock 's aid-de-camp ! " There was no arguing with such a determination as this . " Thou knowest my way of thinking , Hal , " I said ; " and having surprised you at your work , I must tell my lord what I have seen . " " Tell him , of course . You have seen our county militia exercising . You will see as much in every colony from here to the Saint Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have elected me Colonel . What more natural ? Come , brother , let us trot on ; dinner will be ready , and Mrs. Fan does not like me to keep it waiting . " And so we made for his house , which was open like all the houses of our Virginian gentlemen , and where not only every friend and neighbor , but every stranger and traveler , was sure to find a welcome . " So , Mrs. Fan , " I said , " I have found out what game my brother has been playing . " " I trust the Colonel will have plenty of sport ere long , " says she , with a toss of her head . My wife thought Harry had been hunting , and I did not care to undeceive her , though what I had seen and he had told me made me naturally very anxious . CHAPTER LXXXIX . A cOLONEL WITHOUT A 1tEGIMENT . WHEN my visit to my brother was concluded , and my wife and young child had returned to our maternal house at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our Governor , then at his country-house , near Williamsburg , and confer with him regarding these open preparations for war , which were being made not only in our own province , but in every one of the colonies , as far as we could learn . Gentlemen , with whose names history has since made all the world familiar , were appointed from Virginia as Delegates to the General Congress about to be held in Philadelphia . In Massachusetts the people and the Royal troops were facing each other almost in open hostility : in Maryland and Pennsylvania we flattered ourselves that a much more loyal spirit was prevalent : in the Carolinas and Georgia the mother country could reckon upon stanch adherents , and a great majority of the inhabitants : and it never was to be supposed that our own Virginia would forego its ancient loyalty . We had but few troops in the province , but its gentry were proud of their descent from the Cavaliers of the old times ; and round about our Governor were swarms of loud and confident Loyalists , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sword , and scatter the rascally rebels before them . Of course , in these meetings I was forced to hear many a hard word against my poor Harry . His wife , all agreed ( and not without good reason , perhaps ) , had led him to adopt these extreme anti-British opinions which he had of late declared ; and he was infatuated by his attachment to the gentleman of Mount Vernon , it was farther said , whose opinions my brother always followed , and who , day by day , was committing himself farther in the dreadful and desperate course of resistance . " This is your friend , " the people about his Excellency said ; " this is the man you favored , who has had your special confidence , and who has repeatedly shared your hospitality ! " It could not Jut be owned much of this was true : though what some of our eager Loyalists called treachery was indeed rather a proof of the longing desire Mr. Washington and other gentlemen had not to withdraw from their allegiance to the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very last chance of reconciliation , before they risked the other terrible alternativeof revolt and separation . Let traitors arm , and villains draw the parricidal sword ! We at least would remain faithful ; the unconquerable power of England would be exerted , and the misguided and ungrateful provinces punished and brought back to their obedience . With what cheers we drank his Majesty 's health after our banquets ! We would die in defense of his rights ; we would have a Prince of his Royal house to come and govern his ancient dominions ! In consideration of my own and my excellent mother 's loyalty , my brother 's benighted coi*1uct should be forgiven . Was it yet too late to secure him by offering him a good command ? Would I not intercede with him , who , it was known , had a great influence over him ? In our Williamsburg councils we were alternately in every state of exaltation and triumph , of hope , of fury against the rebels , of anxious expectancy of home succor , of doubt , distrust , and gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to him , I own , with but little hope of success , repeating , and trying to strengthen the arguments which I had many a time used in our conversations . My mother too , used her authority ; but from this , I own , I expected little advantage . She assailed him , as her habit was , with such texts of Scripture as she thought bore out her own opinion , and threatened punishment to him . She menaced him with the penalties which must fall upon those who were disobedient to the powers that be . She pointed to his elder brother 's example ; and hinted , I fear , at his subjection to his wife , the very worst argument she could use in such a controversy . She did not show me her own letter to him ; possibly she knew I might find fault with the energy of some of the expressions she thought proper to employ ; but she showed me his answer , from which I gathered what the style and tenor of her argumeat had been . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hal , to my surprise , brought scores of texts to bear upon her in reply , and addressed her in a very neat , temperate , and even elegant composition , which I thought his wife herself was scarcely capable of penning . Indeed , I found he had enlisted the services of Mr. Belman , the New Richmond clergyman , who had lately taken up strong opinions on the Whig side , and who preached and printed sermons against Hagan , who , as I have said , was of our faction , in which I fear Belman had the best of the dispute . My exhortations to Hal had no more success than our mother 's . He did not answer my letters . Being still farther pressed by the friends of the Government , I wrote over most imprudently to say I would visit him at the end of the week at Fanny 's Mount ; but , on arriving , I only found my sister , who received me with perfect cordiality , but informed me that Hal was gone into the country , ever so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , and was to VOL . XIX. - No. 113-X x be away-she *id not know how long he was to be away ! I knew then there was no hope . " My dear , " I said , " as far as I can judge from the signs of the times , the train that has been laid these years must have a match put to it before long . Harry is riding away . God knows to what end . " " The Lord prosper the righteous cause , Sir George ! " says she . " Amen ! with a11 my heart . You and he speak as Americans ; I as an Englishman . Tell him from me , that when any thing in the course of nature shall happen to our mother , I have enough for me and mine in England , and shall resign all our land here in Virginia to him . " " You do n't mean that , George ? " she cries , with brightening eyes . " Well , to be sure , it is hut right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , who are the eldest but by an hour , have every thing ? a palace and lands in England  --  the plantation here  --  the title-and children  --  and my poor Harry none ?

Give my love to sister Theo ! " And she offers me a cheek to kiss ere I ride away from her door . With such a woman as Fanny to guide him , how could I hope to make a convert of my brother ? Having met with this poor success in my enterprise , I rode back to our Governor , with whom I agreed that it was time to arm in earnest , and prepare ourselves against the shock that certainly was at hand . He and his whole Court of Officials were not a little agitated and excited ; needlessly savage , I thought , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts of Old England forever ; but they were all eager for the day when the contending parties could meet hand to hand , and they could have an opportunity of . riding those wicked Whigs down . And I left my lord , having received the thanks of His Excellency in Council , and engaged to do my best endeavors to raise a body of men in defense of the Crown . Hence the corps , called afterward the Westmoreland Defenders , had its rise , of which I had the honor to be appointed Colonel , and which I was to command when it appeared in the field . And that fortunate event must straightway take place so soon as the county knew that a gentleman of my station and name would take the command of the force . The announcement was duly made in the Government Gazette , and we filled in our officers readily enough ; but the recruits , it must be owned , were slow to come in , and quick to disappear . Nevertheless , friend Ilagan eagerly came forward to offer himself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressed about the country engaging volunteers ; but the most eager recruiter of all was my good old tutor , little Mr. Dempster , who had been out as a boy on the Jacobite side in Scotland , and who went specially into the Carolinas , among the children of his banished old comrades , who had worn the // white cockade of Prince Charles , mid whom most of all showed themselves in this contest still loyal to the Crown . Hal 's expedition in search of horses led him not only so far as the Blue Mountains in our colony , but thence on a long journey to Annapolis and Baltimore ; and from Baltimore to Philadelphia , to be sure ; where a second General Congress was now sitting , attended by our Virginiun gentlemen of the last year . Meanwhile , all the almanacs tell what had happened . Lexington bad happened , and the first shots were fired in the war which was to end in the independence of our native country . We still protested of our loyalty to his Majesty ; but we stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty thousand of our loyal petitioners assembled round about Boston with arms in their hands and cannon , to which they bad helped themselves out of the government stores . Mr. Arnold had begun that career which was to end so brilliantly , by the daring and burgiarious capture of two forts , of which he forced the doors . Three generals from Bond Street , with a large reinforcement , were on their way to help Mr. Gage out of his ugly position at Boston . Presently the armies were actually engaged ; and our British generals commenced their career of conquest and pacification in the colonies by the glorious blunder of Breed 's Hill . Here they fortified themselves , feeling themselves not strong enough for the moment to win any more glorious victories over the rebels ; and the two armies lay watching each other while Congress was deliberating at Philadelphia who should command the forces of the confederated colonies . We all know on whom the most fortunate choice of the nation fell . Of the Virginian regiments which marched to join the new Generalin-Chief ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Captain in his Majesty 's service ; and by his side rode his little wife , of whose bravery we often subsequently heard . I was glad , for one , that she had quitted Virginia ; for , had she remained after her husband 's departure , our mother would infallibly have gone over to give her battle ; and I was thankful , at least , that that terrific incident of civil war was spared to our family and history . The rush of our farmers and country-folk was almost all directed toward the new Northern army ; and our people were not a little flattered at the selection of a Virginian gentleman for the principal command . With a thrill of wrath and fury the provinces heard of the blood drawn at Lexington ; audmen yelleddenunciations against the cruelty and wantonness of the bloody British invader . The invader was but doing his duty , and was met and resisted by men in arms , who wished to prevent him from helping himself to his own ; but people do not stay to weigh their words when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their side ; and , with what I own to be a natural spirit and ardor , were determined to have a trial of strength with the braggard domineering mother country . Breed 's Hill became a mountain , as it were , which all men of the American Continent might behold , with Libertj , Victory , Glory , on its flaming summit . These dreaded troops could be withstood , then , by farmers and plowmen ! These famous officers could be out-generaled by Doctors , Lawyers , and Civilians ! Granted that Britons could conquer all the world-here were their children who could match and conquer Britons ! Indeed , I do n't know which of the two deserves the palm , either for bravery or vainglory . We are in the habit of laughing at our French neighbors for boasting , gasconading , and so forth ; but for a steady self-esteem , and indomitable confidence in our own courage , greatness , magnanimity-who can compare with Britons , except their children across the Atlan-tic ? The people round about us took the people 's side for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , Sir George Warrington found his regiment of Westmoreland Defenders but very thinly manned at the commencement , and woefully diminished in numbers presently , not only after the news of battle from the North , but in consequence of the behavior of my lord our Governor , whose conduct enraged no one more than his own immediate partisans , and the loyal adherents of the Crown throughout the colony . That he would plant the King 's standard , and summon all loyal gentlemen to rally round it , had been a measure agreed in countless meetings , and applauded over thousands of bumpers . I have a pretty good memory , and coul4 mention the name of many a gentleman , now a smug officer of the United States Government , whom I have heard hiccup out a prayer that he might be allowed to perish under the folds of his country 's flag ; or rear a challenge to the bloody traitors absent with the rebel army . But let by-gones be by-gones . This , however , is matter of public history that his Lordship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sovereign 's representative in his Old Dominion , who so loudly invited all the lieges to join the King 's standard , was the first to put it in his pocket , and fly to his ships out of reach of danger . He would not leave them , save as a pirate at midnight to burn and destroy . Meanwhile we loyal gentry remained on shore , committed to our cause , and only subject to greater danger in consequence of the weakness and cruelty of him who ought to have been our leader . It was the beginning of June , our orchards and gardens were all blooming with plenty and summer ; a week before I had been over at Williamsburg , exchanging compliments with his Excellency , devising plans for future movements by which we should be able to make good head against rebellion , shaking hands heartily at parting , and viacere out mon the very last words upon all our lips . Our little family was gathered at Richmond , talking over , as we did daily , the prospect of affairs in the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by whom they had been afresh convened , when our ghastly Hagan rushes into our parlor // qwq no mercenary motives in regard to the conduct I pursued . It was not worth while to undeceive others ; what were life worth , if a man were forced to feel himself &amp; la iliste of all the calumflies uttered against him ? And I do not quite know to this present day how it happened that my mother , that notorious Loyalist , was left for several years quite undisturhed in her house at Castlewood , a stray troop or company of Continentals being occasionally quartered upon her . I do not know for certain , I say , how this piece of good fortune happened , though I can give a pretty shrewd guess as to the cause of it . Madam Fanny , after a campaign before Boston , came hack to Fanny 's Mount , leaving her Colonel . My modest Hal , until the conclusion of the war , would accept no higher rank , believing that in command of a regiment he could be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I say , came back , and it was remarkable , after her return , how her old asperity toward my mother seemed to be removed , and what an nffection she showed for her and all the property .

And it was we who fought with such weapons , and enlisted qwq risk of all of us ! We must have them away to Boston or New York . Do n't talk about defending me !

" This she said , in part , perhaps , because t was reasonable ; more so because she would have me and my family out of the danger : and danger or not , for her part felt that she was determined to remain in the land where her father was buried and she was born . She was living backward , so to speak . She had seen the new generation , and blessed them , and bade them farewell . She belonged to the past , and old days nud memories . While we were debating about the Boston scheme comes the news that the British have evacuated that luckless city altogether , never having ventured to attack Mr. Washington in his camp at Cambridge , though he lay there for many months without powder at our mercy ; but waiting until he procured ammunition , and seized and fortified Dorchester Heights , which commanded the town , out of which the whole British army and colony was obliged to beat a retreat . That the King 's troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more doubt than that they beat the French at Blenheim ; but through the war their chiefs seem constantly to have been afraid of assaulting intrenched Continentals afterward ; else why , from July to March , hesitate to strike an almost defenseless enemy ? Why the hesitation at Long Island , when the Continental army was in our hand ? Why that astonishing timorousness of Howe before Valley Forge ; where the relics of a force starving , sickcuing , and in rags , could scarcely man the lines , which they held before a great , victorious , and perfectly appointed army ? As the hopes and fears of the contending partics rose and fell , it was curious to mark the altered tone of the partisans of either . When the news caine to us in the country of the evacuation of Boston every little Whig in the neighborhood made his bow to Madam , and advised her to a speedy submission . She did not carry her loyalty quite so openly as heretofore , and flaunt her flag in the faces of the public , hut she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor Hagan prayed for the Royal Family in our own household , and on Sundays any neighbors were welcome to attend the service , where my mother acted as a very emphatic clerk , and the prayer for the High Court of Parliament under our most religions and gracious King was very stoutly delivered . The brave Hagan was a parson without a living , as I was a Militia Colonel without a regiment . Hagan had continued to tray stoutly for King George in Williamsburg , long after his Excellency our Governor had run away ; but on coming to church one Sunday to l ) erform his duty , he found a corporal 's guard at the church door , who told him that the Committee of Safety had put another divine in his place , and he was requested to keep a quiet tongue in his head . He told the men to " lead him before their chiefs " ( our honest friend always loved tall words and tragic attitudes ) ; and accordingly was marched through the streets to the Capitol , with a chorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown ; and had an interview with Messrs . henry and the new State officers , and confronted the robbers , as he said , in their den . Of course he was for making a heroic speech before these gentlemen ( and was one of many men who perhaps would have no ol*ection to be made martyrs , so that they might be roasted corain populo , or tortured in a full rouse ) . But Mr. Hebry was determined to give him no such chance . After keeping Hagan three or four hours waiting in an ante-room in the company of negroes ; when the worthy divine entered the new chief magistrate 's room with an undaunted mien , and began a prepared speech with , " Sir , by what authority am I , a minister of the- " " Mr. Hagan , " says the other , interrupting him , " I am too busy to listen to speeches . And as for King George , he has henceforth no more authority in this country than King Nebuchadnezzar . Mind you that , and hold your tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , and King Macbeth ; and if you will send round your benefit-tickets , all the Assembly shall come and hear you . Did you ever see Mr. Hagan on the boards when you was in London , General ? " And so saying , Henry turns round upon Mr. Washington 's second in command , General Lee , who was now come into Virginia upon State affairs , and our shamefaced good Hagan was bustled out of the room , reddening , and almost crying with shame . After this event we thought that Hagan 's ministrations were best confined to us in the country , and removed the worthy pastor from his restive lambs in the city . The selection of Virginians to the very highest civil and military appointments of the new government bribed and flattered many of our leading people who , otherwise , and but for the outrageous conduct of our government , might have remained faithful to the Crown , and made good head against the rising rebellion . But although we loyalists were gagged and muzzled , though the Capitol was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal recruits so many Falstaff 's regiments for the most part , the faithful still kept intelligences with one another in the colony , and with our neighbors ; and though we did not rise , and though we ran away , and though in examination before committees , trustees , and so forth , some of our frightened people gave themselves Republican airs , and vowed perdition to kings and nobles ; yet we knew each other pretty well , and-according as the chances were more or less favorable to us , the master more or less hard-we concealed our colors , showed our colors , half showed our colors , sor downright apostatized for the nonce , and cried " Down with King George ! " Our negroes bore about , from house to house , all sorts of messages and tokens . Endless underhand plots and schemes were engaged in by those who could not // afford the light . The battle over , the neutrals come and join the winning side , and shout as loudly as the patriots . The runaways are not counted . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Declaration of Independence were not in a minority of the nation , and that the minority did not win ? We knew that a part of the defeated army of Massachusetts was about to make an important expedition Southward , upon the success of which the very greatest hopes were founded ; and I , for one , being anxious to make a movement as soon as there was any chance of activity , had put myself in communication With the ex-Governor Martin , of North Carolina , whom I proposed to join , with three or four of our Virginian gentlemen , officers of that notable corps of which we only wanted privates . We made no particular mystery about our departure from Castlewood ; the affairs of Congress were not going so well yet that the new government could afford to lay any particular stress or tyranny upon persons of a doubtful way of thinking . Gentlemen 's houses were still open ; and in our Southern fashion we would visit our friends for months at a time . My wife and I , with our infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madam Esmond on a visit to a neighboring plantation . We went thence to another friend 's house , and then to another ; till finally we reached Wilmington , in North Carolina , which was the point at which we expected to stretch a hand to the succors which were coming to meet us . Ere our arrival , our brother Carolinian Royalists had shown themselves in some force . Their encounters with the Whigs had been unlucky . The poor Highlanders had been no more fortunate in their present contest in favor of King George than when they had drawn their swords against him in their own country . We did not reach Wilmington until the end of May , by which time we found Admiral Parker 's squadron there , with General Clinton and five British regiments on board , whose object was a descent upon Charleston . The General , to whom I immediately made myself known , seeing that my regiment consisted of Lady Warrington , our infant , whom she was nursing , and three negro servants , received us at first with a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frigate , who had been on the Jamaica station , and received , like all the rest of the world , many kindnesses from our dear Governor there , when he heard that my wife was General Lambert 's daughter , eagerly received her on board , and gave up his best cabin to our scrvice ; and so we were refugees , too , like my Lord Dunmore , having waved our flag , to be sure , and pocketed it , and slipped out at the back door . From Wilmington we bore away quickly to Charleston , and in the course of the voyage and our delay in the river , previous to our as- sault on the place , I made some acquaintance with Mr. Clinton , which increased to a further intimacy . It was the King 's birthday when we appeared in the river : we determined it was a glorious day for commencement of the expedition . It did not take place for some days after , and I leave out , purposely , all descriptions of my Penelope parting from her Hector , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hector is perfectly well ( though a little gouty ) , nor has any rascal of a Pyrrhus made a prize of his widow : and in times of war and commotion , are not such scenes of woe and terror , and parting , occurring every hour ? I can see the gentle face yet over the bulwark as we descend the ship 's side into the boats , and the smile of the infant on her arm . What old stories , to be sure ! Captain Miles , having no natural taste for poetry , you have forgot the verses , no doubt , in Mr. Pope 's Homer , in which you are described as parting with your heroic father ; but your mother often read them to you as a boy , and keeps the gorget I wore on that day somewhere among her dressing-boxes now . My second venture at fighting was no more lucky than my first . We came back to our ships that evening thoroughly beaten . The madcap Lee , whom Clinton had faced at Boston , now met him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brilliant and most successful resistance . The fort on Sullivan 's Island , which we attacked , was a nut we could not crack . The fire of all our frigates was not strong enough to pound its shell ; the passage by which we moved up to the assault of the place was not fordable , as those officers found-Sir Henry at the head of them , who was always the first to charge-who attempted to wade it . Death by shot , by drowning , by catching my death of cold , I had braved before I returned to my wife ; and our frigate being aground for a time and got off with difficulty was agreeably cannonaded by the enemy until she got off her bank . A small incident in the midst of this unlucky struggle was the occasion of a subsequent intimacy which arose between me and Sir Harry Clinton , and bound me to that most gallant officer during the period in which it was my fortune to follow the war . Of his qualifications as a leader there may be many opinions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect and admire there ought only to be one . Of his personal bearing and his courage there can be no doubt ; he was always eager to show it ; and whether at the final charge on Breed 's Hill , when at the head of the rallied troops he carried the Continental lines , or here before Sullivan 's Fort , or a year later at Fort Washington , when , standard in hand , he swept up the height , and entered the fort at the head of the storming column , Clinton was always foremost in the race of battle , and the King 's service knew no more admirable soldier . We were taking to the water from our boats , with the intention of forcing a column to the fort , through a way which our own guns had rendered practicable , when a shot struck a boat alongside of us , so well aimed as actually to put three-fourths of the boat 's crew hors de combat , // and knock down the officer steering , and the flag behind him . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " for no ninepins ever went down more helplessiy than these poor fellows before the round shot . Then the General , turning round to me , says , rather grimly , " Sir , the behavior of the enemy seems to please you " I am pleased , Sir , " says I , " that my countrymen yonder should fight as becomes our nation . " We floundered on toward the fort in the midst of the same amiable attentions from small arms and great , until we found the water was up to our breasts and deepening at every step , when we were fain to take to our boats again and pull out of harm 's way . Sir Henry waited upon my Lady Warrington on board the Sphinx after this , and was very gracious to her , and mighty facetious regarding the character of the humble writer of the present memoir , whom his Excellency always described as a rebel at heart . I pray my children may live to see or engage in no great revolutions-such as that , for instance , raging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very , very few indeed , the actors in those great tragedies do not bear to be scanned too closely ; the chiefs are often no better than ranting quacks ; the heroes ignoble puppets ; the heroines any thing but pure . The prize is not always to the brave . In our revolution it certainly did fall , for once and for a wonder , to the most deserving ; but who knows his enemies now ? His great and surprising triumphs were not in those rare engagements with the enemy where he obtained a trifling mastery ; but over Congress ; over hunger and disease ; over lukewarm friends , or smiling foes in his own camp , whom his great spirit had to meet and master . When the struggle was over , and our impotent chiefs who had conducted it began to squabble and accuse each other in their own defense before the nation-what charges and counter-charges were brought ; what pretexts of delay were urged ; what piteous excuses were put forward that this fleet arrived too late ; that that regiment mistook its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and so to the end of the chapter ! Here was a general who beat us with no shot at times ; and no powder ; and no money ; and he never thought of a convention ; his courage never capitulated ! Through all the doubt and darkness , the danger and long tempest of the war , I think it was only the American leader 's indomitable soul that remained entirely steady . Of course our Charleston Expedition was made the most of , and pronounced a prodigious victory by the enemy , who had learned ( from their parents , perhaps ) to cry victory if a corporal 's guard were surprised , as loud as if we had won a pitched battle . Mr. Lee rushed back to New York , the conqueror of conquerors , trumpeting his glory , and by no man received with more eager delight than by the Commander-in-Chief of the American army . It was my dear Lee and my dear General between them , then ; and it hath always touched me in the history of our early Revolution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wont to regard officers under him who had happened previously to serve with the King 's army . So the Mexieaas of old looked and wondered when they first saw an armed Spanish horseman ! And this mad , flashy braggart ( and another Continental general , whose name and whose luck afterward were sufficiently notorious ) , you may be sure took advantage of the modesty of the Commander-in-Chief , and advised , and blustered , and sneered , and disobeyed orders ; daily presenting fresh obstacles ( as if he had not enough otherwise ! ) in the path over which only Mr. Washington 's astonishing endurance could have enabled him to march . While we were away on our South Carolina Expedition the famous Fourth of July had tak .. en place , and we and the thirteen United States were parted forever . My own native State of Virginia had also distinguished itself by announcing that all men are equally free ; that all power is vested in the people , who have an inalienable right to alter , reform , or abolish their form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary first magistrate is unnatural and absurd ! Our General presented me with this document fresh from Williamsburg , as we were sailing Northward by the Virginia capes , and , amidst not a little amusement and laughter , pointed out to me the faith to which , from the Fourth instant , inclusive , I was bound . There was no help for it ; I was a Virginian-my godfathers had promised and vowed , in my name , that all men were equally free ( including , of course , the race of poor Gumbo ) , that the idea of a monarchy is absurd , and that I had the right to alter my form of government at pleasure . I thought of Madam Esmond at home , and how she would look when these articles of faith were brought her to subscribe ; how would Hagan receive them ? He demolished them in a sermon , in which all the logic was on his side , but the United States Government has not , somehow , been affected by the discourse ; and when he came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore Gumbo , and Sady , and Nathan had assuredly a right to go to Congress , " Tnt , tnt ! my good Mr. Hagan , " says my mother , " let us hear no more of this nonsense ; but leave such wickedness and folly to the rebels ! " By the middle of August we were before New York , whither Mr. Howe had brought his army that had betaken itself to Halifax after its inglorious expulsion from Boston . The American Commander-in-Chief was at New York , and a great battle inevitable ; and I looked forward to it with an inexpressible feeling of doubt and anxiety , knowing that my dearest brother and his regiment formed part of the troops whom we must attack and could not but overpowered . Almost the whole of the American army came over to fight on a small island , where every officer on both sides knew that they were to be beaten , and whence they had not a chance of es // cape . Two frigates , out of a hundred we had placed so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across East River to New York , would have destroyed every bark in which he sought to fly , and compelled hm to lay down his arms on shore . He fought ; his hasty levies were utterly overthrown ; some of his generals , his best troops , his artillery taken ; the remnant huddled into their intrenched camp after their rout , the pursuers entering it with them . The victors were called back ; the enemy was then pent up in a corner of the island and could not escape . " They are at our mercy , and are ours to4norrow , " says the gentle General . Not a ship was set to watch the American force ; not a sentinel of ours could see a movement in their camp . A whole army crossed under our eyes in one single night to the main land without the loss of a single man ; and General Howe was suffered to remain in command after this feat , and to complete his glories of Long Island and Breed 's Hill at Philadelphia ! A friend , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy 's army was being ferried over , but he fell upon a picket of Germans ; they could not understand him : their commander was boozing or asleep . In the morning , when the spy was brought to some one who could comprehend the American language , the whole Continental force had crossed the East River , and the empire over thirteen colonies had slipped away . The opinions I had about our chief were by no means uncommon in the army ; though , perhaps , wisely kept secret by gentlemen under Mr. I-lowe 's immediate command . Am I more unlucky than other folks , I wonder ? or why are my imprudent sayings carried about more than my neighbors ' ? My rage that such a use was made of such a victory was no greater than that of scores of gentlemen with the army . Why must my name forsooth be given up to the Commander-in-Chief as that of the most guilty of the grumblers ? Personally , General Howe was perfectly brave , amiable , and good-humored . " So , Sir George , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a military man , because there was a fog after the battle on Long Island , and your friends , the Continentals , gave me the slip ! Surely we took and killed enough of them ; but there is no satisfying you gentlemen amateurs ! " and he turned his back on me , and shrugged his shoulders , and talked to some one else . Amateur I might be , and he the most amiable of men ; but if King George had said to him , " Never more be officer of mine , " yonder agreeable and pleasant Cassio would most certainly have had his desert . I soon found how our Chief had come in possession of his information regarding myself . My admirable cousin , Mr. William Esmond-who , of course , had forsook New York and his post when all the Royal authorities fled out of the place and Washington occupied it - returned along with our troops and fleets ; and , being a gentleman of good birth and name , and well acquainted with the city , made himself agreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloods , merry fellows , and macaronis , by introducing them to play-tables , taverns , and yet worse places , with which the worthy gentleman continued to be familiar in the Old World as in the New . C*durn non animum . However Will had changed his air , or whithersoever he transported his carcass , he carried a rascal in his skin . I had heard a dozen stories of his sayings regarding my family , and was determined neither to avoid him nor seek him ; but to call him to account whensoever we met ; and chancing one day to be at a coffee-house in a friend 's company , my worthy kinsman swaggered in with a couple of young lads of the army , whom he found it was his pleasure and profit now to lead into every kind of dissipation . I happened to know one of Mr. Will 's young companions , an aid-de-camp of General Clinton 's , who had been in my close company both at Charlestown , before Sullivan 's Island , and in the action of Brooklyn , where our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They took a box without noticing us at first , though I heard my name three or four times mentioned by my brawling kinsman , who ended some drunken speech he was making by slapping his fist on the table and swearing , " By I will do for him , and the bloody rebel , his brother " Ah ! Mr. Esmond , " says I , coming forward with my hat on . ( He looked a little pale behind his punch-bowl . ) " I have long wanted to see you , to set some little matters right about which there has been a difference between us . ' ' " And what may those be , Sir ? " says he , with a volley of oaths . " You have chosen to cast a doubt upon my courage , and say that I shirked a meeting with you when we were young men . Our relationship and our age ought to prevent us from having recourse to such murderous follies . " ( Mr. Will started up looking fierce and relieved . ) " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ford to overlook lies against myself , if I hear from you a word in disparagement of my brother , Colonel Warrington , of the Continental Army , I will hold you accountable . " " Indeed , gentlemen . Mighty fine , indeed . You take notice of Sir George Warrington 's words ! " cries Mr. Will over his punch-bowl . " You have been pleased to say , " I continued , growing angry as I spoke , and being a fool therefore for my pains , " that the very estates we hold in this country are not ours , but of right revert to your family ! " " So they are ours ! By George , they 're ours ! I 've heard my brother Castlewood say so a score of times ! " swears Mr. Will . " In that case , Sir , " says I , hotly , " your brother , my Lord Castlewood , tells no more truth than yourself . We have the titles at home in Virginia . They are registered in the courts there ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall call you to account where no constables will be at hand to interfere I " // " I wonder , " cries *vVill , in a choking voice , " that I do n't cut him into twenty thousand pieces as he stands there before me with his confounded yellow face . It was my brother Castlewood won his money - no , it was his brother ; d- you , which are you , the rebel or the other ? I hate the ugly faces of both of you , and , hic ! - if you are for the King , show you are for the King , and drink his health ! " and he sank down into his box with a hiccup and a wild laugh , which he repeated a dozen times , with a hundred more oaths and vociferous ontcries that I should drink the King 's health . To reason with a creature in this condition , or ask explanations or apologies from him , was absurd . I left Mr. Will to reel to his lodgings under the care of his young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so suddenly affected and so utterly prostrated by liquor ; and limped home to my wife , whom I found happy in possession of a brief letter from Hal , which a countryman had brought in ; and who said not a word about the affairs of the Continentals with whom he was engaged , but wrote a couple of pages of rapturous eulogiums upon his brother 's behavior in the field , which my dear Hal was pleased to admire , as he admired every thing I said and did . I rather looked for a messenger from my amiable kinsman in consequence of the speeches which had passed between us the night before , and did not know but that I might be called by Will to make my words good ; and when accordingly Mr. Lacy , our companion of the previous evening , made his appearance at an early hour of the forenoon , I was beckoning my Lady Warrington to leave us , when , with a laugh and a cry of " Oh dear no ! " Mr. Lacy begged her ladyship not to disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a gentleman who begs to send you his apoldgies , if he uttered a word last night which could offend you . " " What apologies ? what words ? " asks the anxious wife . I explained that roaring Will Esmond had met me in a coffee-house on the previous evening , and quarreled with me , as he had done with hundreds before . " It appears the fellow is constantly abusive , and invariably pleads drunkenness , and apologizes the next morning , unless he is caned over-night , " remarked Captain Lacy . And my lady , I dare say , makes a little sermon , and asks why we gentlemen will go to idle coffeehouses and run the risk of meeting roaring , roistering XYill Esmonds ? Our sojourn in New York was enlivened by a project for burning the city which some ardent patriots entertained and partially executed .
