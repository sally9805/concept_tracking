Then it was thought that we were doomed to go And tend the Silver-Mines of Mexico ; But Lopez , a Castillian , who was kind , Persuaded them to let me stay behind .

But when he said that we should meet no more , I never felt so sorrowful before ! For fatal , fatal , fatal was the day When Chactas left old Pensacola Bay . But ere my feet had touched my native sod , Because I had refused to worship God  --  ( As Lopez had foretold me on that day  --  ) The Muscogulgees caught me by the way , And bound me , in the midst of all my grief , And took me back to Simighan , their Chief , Who called aloud to me to speak my name ?

Ah ! fatal , fatal , fatal was the day When Chactas came from Pensacola Bay ! I knew , from that sad hour , that but to die Was all my portion  --  yet , made no reply . And as they bore me through the mighty throng , I chaunted out aloud mine own Death-Song !

" You have the Magic Words to cancel pain , And though we part , yet we shall meet again ! " Pleased with my flattery , they then gave to me A Bowl of Syrup from the Maple-tree .

A golden stream of purest Poetry Flowed from her lips in Pythian inspiration  --  Storming my heart , with its deep melody , To love immortal as her jubilation  --  Which ruled my thoughts within as God rules the creation . Her eyes were like two Violets bathed in dew , Upon one lily-bed , now close together , As if just melted out of Heaven 's own blue , Wherein two stars , unmelted , burned , or , rather , Sparkled , which made them look like rain in fairest weather .

Out of the lutestrings of her heart she wove , Like Israfel in Heaven , with he sweet singing , A subtle web of Poesy , which Love Around my heart then wound , wherewith , upspringing , She to the Mount of Fame her way with me went winging . Then , from their rosy nest in her pure heart , Her snow-white , dove-winged thoughts to Heaven went soaring  --  Climbing , with unpremeditated Art , From star to star , up to the sun , downpouring A deluge of deep song with Angel-like adoring .

Where the songs of Angels shall never cease , In that Beautiful Land of Eternal Peace  --  To the Bowers of Bliss , where the friends of youth All renew their vows of eternal truth ! Then come  --  oh ! quickly come ! And see God in thy heavenly Home ! Come to Astarte , who loves thee best , And recline once more on her peaceful breast  --  Wandering alone through the flowery Meads , In the silver Vales of the sighing Reeds , By the Living Streams , in the Violet Skies  --  And re-sun thy soul in her beautiful eyes ! Now come ! oh ! quickly come ! And rejoice in thy heavenly Home ! Villa Allegra , Ga. , May 5 , 1836 . Chivers , T. H. ( Thomas Holley ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1853 ) Ye ask me in your senselessness of heart  --  " Why do you weep ? what you have lost , we lose ! From Adam down all men have felt the smart Of parting from their mothers  --  which you choose To dwell upon so long , as if to part From yours was more than ours to part from those That we love best ! We all have felt the dart Enter our souls !  --  we , too , have felt thy woes ! " Peace , heartless wretch ! ye know not of the throes Your senselessness hath caused !  --  ye have no art Even to conceal your want of that which knows In me no bounds  --  which ye have caused to start Anew , in pity for thee , from repose ! New York , March 8 , 1841 . Chivers , T. H. ( Thomas Holley ) , 1809-1858 : SPRING . from Virginalia ( 1853 ) " Tempus adest cantus avium ; Et vox turturis in terra nostra auditer. "  --  Solomon 's Songs . Thy glorious smile , oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest  --  every bird upon the wing  --  The smiling Vales below  --  the Heavens above  --  And every cloud that slumbers in the sky  --  Even God himself  --  are glad that thou art nigh . Thy genial influence Pervades all things with life-imparting power ! Thou art the Season of the soul 's deep sense Of all that is most beautiful ! Each flower , By thee on Nature 's page now written , is A word by which the soul tells of its bliss . In the Woods , in Connecticut , April 1 , 1841 . Chivers , T. H.

Farewell , Harp ! oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though my soul doth love thee well , All my vows are quickly spoken  --  Fare-thee-well !
