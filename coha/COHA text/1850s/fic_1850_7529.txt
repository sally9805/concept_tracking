Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : THE ISRAELITES CROSSING THE RED SEA . from The Israelites crossing the Red Sea ( 1850 ) Night had passed in the pomp Of her splendor away , And Morning unbarred The gold portals of day : On the banners of Egypt , Far floated the flame Of the sunrise , that witnessed Her glory and shame : But darkening before them The cloud-pillar rose , And hid from their vision The camp of their foes ,  --  That column which towered Sublimely to heaven , That wonderful guide , To the wanderer given , Which frowned upon Egypt , Terrific in wrath , But shone , with soft light , O'er the Israelites ' path : Yet onward they poured , In their grandeur and pride , The omen unheeded , The danger defied ; To the sound of their cymbals Wild , musical clash , In their gem-illumed armor , On  --  onward they dash ! With their chariots of gold , And their steeds of rare might , They rush to their ruin , In music and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came , Like a tempest , that gathers With thunder and flame . Too late ! They have paused , In unspeakable fear  --  The cymbal is silent , " What marvel is here ? " Lo ! chanting an anthem , Serenely and slow , ' Mid the waters dividing , The Israelites go ! And stayed by God 's word , The great floods in their might Stand firm " like a wall , On the left and the right . " A moment they gaze , Then , with shouts of fierce pride The cohorts of Egypt Dash on ' mid the tide ; But the war-cry is changed To a moan of dismay , As the wild waters meet , O'er that splendid array ; And they perish by thousands , In rage and despair , While the Hebrews ' glad anthem Floats by on the air ! " Sing to the Lord of Hosts , High and victorious ! Clash the glad cymbal , For freedom so glorious ! " Sing to the Lord of Hosts , Israel 's daughters ; Egypt 's proud army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing , The floods he divided , Safely we passed , By his mighty hand guided . " Strike the wild timbrel , To Him  --  our Salvation ! He hath delivered , From peril , his nation . " Sing for the Lord of Hosts ! Tell the proud story , Egypt is shorn Of her grandeur and glory . " Lo ! where before us , Majestic and solemn , Moveth serenely , The God-lighted column ! " Sing to the Lord of Hosts , Great and victorious ! Praise him for ever , For freedom so glorious !
