But none of these can convey a lively impression of the grace and condescension of God , in coming to the doors of the soul-houses of men , and knocking to be admitted into their darkness , squalidness and misery 1 For it is not because they are beautiful that God comes , or because he is mistaken about their condition , or thinks them better than they are . It is because He knows the darkness and the emptiness of some ; the abuses and misery in others ; the rioting and desecration in others . And to all he comes to bring light for darkness , cleansing for foulness , furniture for emptiness , and order for confusion ! He comes to turn the rusted locks , and to open the closed doors of every chamber - to let men up into every part of themselves - and to fill the whole dwelling of the soul , from foujidation to dome , with light and gladness , with music and singing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door cmd TcnockP Christ comes to the soul-house , and stands there and knocks . On getting no answer , he goes away only to come and knock again . He waits at the door , and listens for a voice within , and goes away . He comes again , and waits , and goes away ! He knocks , not at one door , but goes round to every door , and waits for an answer . As one who returns to his dwelling in the night , after a journey , and finding it locked , knocks at the accustomed door of entrance in the front , and getting no answer goes /z/ to the door in the rear , then to the side door - if there be one - and then to every other door , in order , if possible , to get into his house ; so Christ , who longs to enter into the soul , goes to every door in succession , and knocks , and listens for an invitation to come in , and leaves not one chamber in the soul-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of Eeason ; at the door of Fear ; at the door of Hope ; at the door of Imagination and Taste , of Benevolence and Love , of Conscience , of Memory and Gratitnde 1 He does not neglect a single one ! Beginning at the upper and the noblest , where he ought to come in as a King of Glory , through gates of triumph , he comes round and down to the last and lowest , and retreats wistfully and reluctantly , returning often - morning , noon , and night - continually seeking entrance , with marvelous patience , accepting no refusal , repulsed by no indifference to his presence , and no neglect of his message ! - If he be admitted , joy unspeakable is in the house , and shall be henceforth .

It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned whether hymns and music do not divide power with preaching . K the sources of popular religious doctrinal knowledge could be examined , it is suspected that the hymn and psalm would be found to be the real sermon , and singing the most effectual ' preaching . It is very certain that strong religious feelings incline men to the use of singing . ' And the apostle prescribes psalms , hymns and spiritual songs as a means both of gaining and of expressing religious feeling . Religious reformations seem always to have developed singing . Under Luther 's administration , and Calvin 's government , singing became so general and.characteristic that psalm-singing and the Protestant heresy were synonymous terms . The great reformation under theWesleys was marked by the outburst of religious music . In the revivals of New England , not far from the same period , there was as marked a revival in singing as in religion . Indeed , so full were the young converts of song , that they went to and /z/ returned from church with the voice of psalms and hymns ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the religious history of that period , to a justification of this practice , agamst those who unduly censured it . Whenever revivals of religion visit communities , their presence is attested by new zeal in singing , nd it is to be noticed , also , that not only is the spirit of singing revived , but , as with a common instinct , all exhibitory music is dropped as dead or sapless , and the heart feels after hymns of deep emotion , and after tunes which are bom of the heart , and not of the head . Revival melodies are but another name for tunes that express strong feeling . It is quite remarkable how a congregation , in times of spiritual coldness and musical propriety , will tolerate only classical music , or those tunes which the reigning musical pedants of the day favor . The choir sings as clocks strike , with mechanical accuracy , and with the warmth and enthusiasm of a clock . But as soon as a congregation are really brought together under the power of a common earnest religious feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild airs , plaintive melodies , or passionate and imploring tunes , take their place without regret or a thought of musical* dignity and propriety . But though music holds so high a place of power , and is susceptible of such beneficent effects , it is doubtful whether it is not the most troublesome thing in the whole administration of public worship . It would seem as if the history of music were but /z/ the history of continual expedients . Churches are undergoing perpetual musical revolutions . There do not seem to be any principles which are known and recognized , and which underlie musical administrations in our churches , and give them unity and efficiency . The Eoman and the Episcopal services incoi-porate music with their service , congruously and harmoniously with the whole system of worship . The skill or efficiency of musical execution may vary ; but this never affects the basis upon which music stands . But with our other churches there does not seem to be any musical stability whatever . There is hardly anywhere a deep and controlling feeling that music is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embellishment at the best . Churches that have choirs wish they had none . They that have none wish they ha I i choir - until they get it . A large choir falls into confusion very easily . It is too unwieldy to be kept up without great labor , time , and expense ; and thus it is an open magazine , subject to explosion at any moment . If the clumsiness of a large choir is got rid of by substituting a quartette , the church usually rids itself of discord and of religious feeling at the same time . The quartette is professional . Skill is the criterion . Music exhibits itself ; but it never exhibits religious truth . Four singers in the gallery forbid anybody to sing in the pew . One might as well talk in sermon-time as to sing in singing-time , when a quartette is performing . I do not say that four persons could not be deeply religious , and sing so as to edify the Christian congregation . But I do /z/ say , that foxir persons who are musically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing , are not easily found , and when found , are seldom under the control of deep religious feeling . Experience shows that trained singers , worldly , and religiously indifferent , constitute the greatest number of quartette choirs. / As music grows less robust , and more and more cold , as it becomes more and more " classical , " a revolution takes place . It is determined to have congregational singing . It is not asked whether there is any congregational feeling , or whether the church is only a caravansary of one hundred and fifty separate pews , with separate families , in separate circles of life , anxiously keeping themselves clear of improper social connection with each other . It is not asked whether there is any common religious feeling that demands a common channel of expression . It is not considered whether or not the church has been trained to feel , act , or work together , or whether the members hang like icicles upon the eaves , united only by being frozen together . Congregational singing* rmbst either spring from a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; or else it will not long live at all . But , in multitudes of cases , congregational music flourishes only while it is a novelty . A leader is appointed . The choir is got rid of with unnecessary dispatch , and the best voices , perhaps , in the congregation are mortified and offended . Good tunes are to be sung . Slow tunes are supposed to be very pious . Very slow and very solemn tunes are used . For a few /z/ Sundays all goes well . But first the young people are dissatisfied . It is very dull and most unmusical to them . But it is the voices of the young that always must give power to congregational singing . As they fall oflF , the sound grows thin and meager . A wet day , or the leader sick , leaves the decorous congregation to a mortifying experience of ludicrous failure . In a year , at most , the experiment ends . It was begun without knowledge , and ended as it begun . It was a caprice , an expedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choir is inaugurated , a new leader , a new dispensation of ambitious display , of musical sensitiveness , of quarrelling and disgust , of revolution and quartette , mtil at length , in some congregations , all that any one hopes or dreams of is , singing that shall not damage all the rest of worship . ' In other churches , having lost every vestige of sanctity , music is regarded outright as one of those forms of moral amusement in which men may indulge without sin , in the church , and on the Sabbath ; and they plunge their hands into their pockets and pay for professional singing . Then . King David finds himself in the hands of the Philistines . The unwashed lips that all the week sang the disgustful words of glorious music in operas , now sing the rapture of the old Hebrew bard , or the passion of the suffering Kedeemer , with all the inspiration of vanity and brandy . When the exquisite mockery is done , and the opera-glasses are all closed , the audience close their eyes too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostatizing from piety , is no longer a heavenly bird , but a peacock , that struts and flares lier gaudy plujnes for admiration 1 The loss of positive good is not the whole mischief of this state of things . This false liingiiig desecrates whatever it touches . The hynms which are used are killed . They become suggestive of drawling discords , or of pedantic accuracy and dullness , or of ostentatious trill and shake , or of quarrels and troubles . The divine flavor goes out of them , and they lie sapless and dry . And thus music , that should nurse hymns upon its bosom , abuses them , like a cruel step-mother , and thrusts them away . Hundreds of hymns have been served worse than Herod served the innocents - for he killed them outright ; but a hymn cursed by musical associations , can not die , but creeps aside like a crippled bird , to hide its wounds in a songless covert , until time healing them , gives them wing and song again 1 Meanwhile , only those who are unblessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest sufferers . The pastor sees constantly recurring quarrels in the congregation . One by one good men attempt to do something ; but being caught in a passionate musical eddy , and whirled about for a time , disgusted and irritated , they get ii ; ( ii the shore , with a solemn vow never to meddle with music again . So deeply are some good men impressed with the mischief of music , that not a few , and those who aforetime have been leaders in musical matters , seri- csnscH Musio. 23 ously ponder whether religion would not gain by the utter exclusion of music from the church ! Are trouble and music twin brothers ? Is there no way of edification through music , or must we regard and endure it as a necessary evil ? /z/ A CHILD has an exalted idea of the knowledge and power of its parent . A father stands in a child 's mind as the type of courage and capacity ; and a mother , of love and goodness . The feeling of trust is perfect . Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own manifold wants . There is an inexhaustible certainty that everything will be thought of , sought , and procured by their parents for to-day , to-morrow , next week , the month , and the whole year . Nor does sickness or trouble diminish this feeling . It then grows even stronger . Trouble sends the child right home to the parental bosom . It is this experience that God employs to designate the relations of confidence and implicit trust that should exist between every human heart and Christ . The earthly parent succeeds very poorly in reproducing love , care , kindness , foresight , providence . He is trying to do , on a small scale , in a narrow nature , in a sinful world , what God does gloriously , in an infinite sphere , with a perfect nature , and with transcendent excellence . God is unlike an earthly father , but it is on the side of excess , abundance , profusion . He cares not less , but infinitely more , for every child , than any earthly parent ever can . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abundantly. /z/ But few Christians , however , reproduce the feeling of children towards a parent in respect to trust . They believe in God upon visible evidence . Prosperity makes them trustful . Trouble leaves them without a ray of quiet light . Men trust in God when they are in health , in strength , when successful in their affairs , or when surrounded by all that heart can wish . When sick , alone , baffled in their business , vexed and troubled , hemmed in and shut up , they fall away from confidence , and go into despair . / You can leave your affairs to God when they go well ; can you when they go ill ? You can rest quietly in God 's hands when you are in health ; can you when sick ? You can trust your family with God when you are comfortable and happy ; can you when you are perplexed how to get along , and your children are sick , and long sick t But what is a trust in God good for that departs when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get along without it ? What is a ship good for that is safe in a harbor but unsafe on the ocean ? What is a sail good for that is sound in a calm , but splits in the first wind ? What patience is that which only lasts when there is nothing to bear ? Courage , when there is no danger ; firmness , where is no pressure ; hope when everything is before the eyes ; what are all these worth ? But such is the trust which most Christians have in God . It has no virtue in it . It is like a lighthouse that bums only in daylight , and is extinguished at sundown. /z/ We need a trust that shall take hold upon God /z/ with such a large beUef of his love and constancy , as shall carry ns right on over rough as well as over smooth ground ; right on through light and darkness ; right on through sickness , bereavement , loss , trouble , and long-pressing afflictions . At noon one does not need a torch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes God communicates his goodness to us through our worldly conditions . Every day and every hour seem mails from heaven bringing letters of divine remembrance and tokens of love . But , at other times , God prefers other channels . He chooses to- approach us by other instruments . A Christian should understand that every experience contains the love and presence of Christ . God wears many robes . He comes in new apparel . Whatever change takes place , it is only God in another dress . A Christian should learn to look at the face and not at the dress . If your father or your mother came to you , you would know them by the eye , by the mouth , by the expression , no matter how strangely they were dressed . We should feel mortified to finti that a dear friend did not enough know us to carry the firm trust of friendship through all our moods and changes of appearance . It will be a lielp towards this state , if every Christian will reckon with himself in a manner exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which you feel in hours of glee or prosperity . Consider that only to be genuine trust in God which you have in hours of darkness . Begin there . Put your criterion and standard /z/ there . If yon have none there , you have none at anytime . / " Although the figtree shall not Hossom neither shall frmt he in the vines / the labor of the oli/ve shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat / the fijock shall he cut off from the fold and there shall he no herd in the stalls ; YET , will I rejoice in the Zord I will joy in the God of my salvaiion. /z/ Even a glance of the sun is cheering , in a day of storms , or of clouds , which , without storming , fill the air with sullenness , and make twilight even at noonday . But what is this compared with the brightness of the unobstructed sun all the day long , filling the air above , overlaying the earth , and pouring gold upon every tree , stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But the sunlight of a single day brings forth nothing . Such days come in December , in January , and amid the boisterous weeks of February , and the tumult of March . But nothing springs up . The tree makes no growth . The light does not enter in . It lies wide abroad , indeed most beautiful , but nothing is created by it ; for burnished , icicles and frostdrops are the only stems and flowers which come from the slant and cold brightness of the winter 's sun . It is only when , at length , the sun returns from its equatorial pilgrimage , and enters into the earth , and abides within it , that life is awakened . The eartli knows his coming . In winter , nature lies as if dead . The sun stretches itself upon it , as did the prophet upon the woman 's son , and from every part there is resurrection of root , stem , bud , and flower . But none of these things happen to casual and infrequent shining . They are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters in , and abides in the soil , not till days and nights are struck through with warmth , is there life and glory . If this be so of the lower physical nature , how much more eminently it is true of the human soul , and of its Sun of Kighteousness ! It is a gladsome thing in toil and trouble , to have a single bright flash from the face of God . A prisoner in a dungeon may have but one small window , and that far up , and out of the way of the sun , while for months and months not one single day does the yellow sun send one single and solitary ray through the poor little window . But at length , in changing its place in the heavens , there comes a day in which , to his surprise and joy , a flash of light springs through and quivers on the wall . It vibrates upon his heart still more tremulously than on the waU . Even thus much gives joy . It warms nothing , and lights but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It tells him that the sun is not dead , but walks the heavens yet . That single ray speaks of fields , of trees , of birds , and of the whole blue heavens I So is it , often , in life . It is in the power of one blessed thought , in a truly Christian heart , to send light and joy for hours and days . But that is not enough . It is not enough for Christian growth , or Christian nourishment , that despondency sometimes hopes , and darkness sometimes smiles into light . A Christian is to be a child of light , and to dwell in the light . The whiteness of heavenly robes is the light which they reflect from the face of God . A Christian is to bear miuih fruit . This he can not , unless ' he abides in summer . For mere relief , even a /z/ casual visit of God 's grace is potential . But for fruit - much fruit , and ripened fruit - nothing will suffice but the whole summer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is both to be prayed for , and to be possessed . There is provision in the Gt ) spel for this very blessing . It is the promise of the Father , and the pledge of the Son . It is made to be a Christian 's duty to pray for it and to expect it . For , in very deed , there can be no true and full Christian ripeness without it . The soul forms no habits , and comes to no spiritual conformity to God , by the jets and flashes of excitement . These have their use , and are to be gladly accepted . But the soul must lie long in the light ; it must abide in divine warmth . There must be spiritual summer where there is to be much fruit . * Our thoughts are like our bodies ; men can not come to good breeding by an occasional entrance into good society . It is habitual commerce with grace and amenity that fashions a man to politeness . It is living in studious habits that makes a man learned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having the indwelling of God with us , that bring the soul to good manners and in divine things . It seems an impossible thing , to many , to carry the presence and influence of the Spirit of God througli all the whirl and occupation of life . Is it impossible for a young soldier to carry the spirit of love with him , through camp , march , and battle ? Is it difficult for the parent to carry his soul full of domestic affections through the business of the day ? Is it impossible , or even difficult for us to carry within us /z/ any feeling which is deep and strong , and which we love , in spite of exterior disturbance ? Nay , do we not see every day that the heart , by such enthusiasms or deep emotions , not only goes imchanged through burdensome life , but casts out of itself a flood of radiance , and makes its path light by its own cheerfulness or joy ? Love in the soul is like perfume in the garments . Heat can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds blow it away . Going forth or coming home , it scatters itself but is not wasted ; it is forever going but never gone . And the love of God shed abroad in the soul surpasses all fragrance , in inexhaustible diffusiveness . K men have only a little love , an occasional spark , it may be troublesome to nourish it when the world casts down on it green fuel . A large fire waxes larger by that very vrfnd which blows out a small flame . It is even as St. Peter saith : " K these things be in you , cmd abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ . " /z/ As there is something piquant and memorable in the novelty of first experience , so there is something sad , and even solemn , in the view of last times . And yet , the two antitheses in a man 's own life , his birth and his death , are usually without experience or consciousness . Birth and death are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost nothing to memory . Then come only a few clusters for the memory . We are five or six years in the world before we have brain Enough and nerve , - enough to receive durable impressions . And , looking the other way , by far the greatest number of people die without apparent pain , without mental sensibility - apparently as little conscious of failing life as flowers are of the loss of their petals , when ripeness plucks them one by one . But it is a very different experience that we have , when in full manhood - in strength , vigor , nerve , we take record , day by day , of change ; passing from some things forever , entering upon some , and palpitating with various emotions - sadness for the past or hope for the future I But , as one may carelessly read a book and fail of half its meaning ; as one may but glance at a picture and perceive not half its beauty ; as one may part from a traveling acquaintance almost without any insight ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregularly dealt with . We glance off from events before we see even a tithe of their meaning ; we hasten on to new things without reading yet more valuable lessons in the old . Should such things be put in a book as are happening to each of us every day , we should hang over the chapters as if a strange enchantment possessed us . Let us redeem some thoughts from the past . Let us call up its shadows . Let us pass the events again before us , and pour upon them the light of sober reflection . When speaking of the end of time , we do not reflect that it is ending every day , every hour . While we are looking forward to the close of our history , we neglect to look back and perceive that our history has been a series of closings ; that the past is heaped up and crowded full of things - left , ended , finished forever . All the periods of time which have appeared days and years to us , are as effectually ended as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angel shall lift up his hand and swear before him that liveth forever and ever that time shall be no more . Tell me , what can you remember , and what recite , of your Jst jwe yea/rs f They are gone without a trace . To you the time is not only gone , but it left you almost without a remembrance . Of the next five years , how much can you recount ? A glancing thing , here and there , is reproducible in your thought . But the years - the years - they are rolled away , died out , and gone as have the clouds of last summer 1 /z/ 34 : TH ) larrS FOR THE CLOSE OF THK TKAR . Then , year followed year . They came , grew , orbed to the full , waned , died , and went like shadows ! Years that wrought upon you like eternity - whose marks you will carry forever , dissolved and passed like drops of dew .

Nothing can retouch their period , nor add to their record . Is it a solemn consideration to look forward to that time when you shall stand on the brink of life , and look back on all your years ? It is a great deal more affecting to you to stand in the freshness of youth , or midlife , and look back upon what years are gone I They are registered and judged ! Not when God 's judgment-day dawns will they be more fixed and judged , than they are already ! Not only is there room for solemn thought in the larger periods of time , but there is something affecting in the subdivisions of time . Every Saturday evening has , to my ear , a gentle knell . The week tolls itself away - one , two , three , four , five , six , and the perfect seven - and I can almost hear the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were drifting down the stream , but beating faint measures as they recede ! And of every one , I may say - ended ! gone ! I shall see thee no more ! Days likewise have some voice in dying . They scowl and shut down drearily sometimes , but oftener die in gorgeous apparel . As the sun /z/ stoops in the west , passes the horizon and is gone , I hear no audible voice . The scene speaks to the soul , as no voice may to the ear - " The day is gone - forever . " No temple was ever builded as some days are - of wondrous deeds , of strange thoughts , of marvelous fancies , of deep feelings , of strange experiences . All the frescoes upon the Vatican are not so wonderful as those which our experience paints upon single days - that move on to the horizon , sink and go to the bottom , with all that they have I In like manner it is with seasons - the promise of spring - the flush of summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long sleep - winter ! Each of them goes , with a gradual and lingering step - so that we can not remark their exit ; and y we only know their departure after they have gone . Memory may glean them , but never renew . Upon the future we cast hopes - but none upon the past ! Upon the future we throw good resolutions of amendment - but none upon the past . Upon the future we cast a fertile fancy , and fill it with thick deeds ; but the past - upon that we cast only sighs or tears , or faint joys - faint as dried flowers are fragrant of the summer that is gone I But how much more marked are the completions of experiences - the era of early youth , the beginnings of things whose endings are with us yet ; the seeds whose stalks are yet growing ; the foundations upon whose walls we are still building 1 We can look back to days of sorrow that gathered as clouds for storms - that rained and drenched us ; thftt /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and now lie in memory , rounded out and completed things . How many hopes , bom , ripened , perished ? How many fears that quivered , struck - like harmless lightnings in summer evenings - and ended ! How many aspirations that flew , soaring high , till the head was dizzy with height I How many loves lighted the path of those who are gone , while the love shines on , like sepulchral lamps , fed by the living to cast their faithful light upon the ashes of those that are for earth no more . How , when the whole reality comes back to us , do we stand struck with wonder at the deeds done - the events accomplished , the experiences ripened , the transitions completed ? Of our youthful companions how many are with us yet ? What part of old companionship is left ?

How wise it is to make an estimate of our own place , our character , our prospects /z/ Another year is gone . Before we enter the next , let us reckon with ourselves earnestly and /z/ honestly , what the old year has done for us and with us . And should it be our last year , let us make such timely preparation , that at whatever hour the summons comes , we may depart gladly , rise with triumph , and take hold of immortality in Heaven . /z/ ' * Like as a father pitieth his children , so the Lord pitieth them that fear him .

Noble old warrior ! Thou didst send dismay to thine enemies , and breathe joy among thy friends . Thy bow abode in strength , and thine arrows were terrible in the day of battle . But those silver shafts of song , from a lyre surpassing the fabled sweetness of Apollo 's have sped through the dusky years , through thousands of them , and are flying yet ; not for wounding , but for life and healing .

While David was filling Jerusalem with these matchless lyrics . Homer , the blind wanderer of Greece , whom the world has since made a universal citizen , was singing of the Grecian gods .

Pity is a mode or particular development of benevolence . It is sympathy for persons on account of weakness or suffering . It is not mere compassion , but is mingled with a desire to aid and relieve . 40 god 's pity . /z/ Pity and compassion are the antitheses of those affections by which we take hold of men who are good , lovely , desirable for their grace of nobleness and purity ; or of those who are prosperous , strong , and happy .

God has gladness for those who are glad , and pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as disclosed in this psalm , is the working out of the whole divine nature of goodness toward the human family , in their unformed , immature , sinful , struggling existence . The race was not bom perfect - men were sown as seeds are . They come of germs , turn to leaves , shoot forth a slender stem , grow little by little to branches , and find firmness and solidity only after a long probation of weakness , temptation , sin , and all its sorrows . This is tiue of individual men . It is true historically of mankind . The need of compassion for the race has been just as great as is the need in every household of compassion towards babes and young children . It is still the need of each man and of the whole world .

It requires punishment ; but it needs pity even more than avenging justice . While , therefore , the divine character drawn in the Bible hath great depth of shadow injustice , all its salient points stand forth in the high lights of love and mercy 1 God is full of near , real , overflowing , and inexhaustible compassion for man 1 But , it is declared that God 's pity is not simply pity - it is a/athers pity . If a man be found weltering by the road , wounded , and a stranger comes who never before had even seen him , he will pity him . No matter if born under a different heaven , or speaking a different tongue , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the heart of man speaks one language the world over , and suffering wakes compassion . But if , instead of being a stranger it were a near neighbor , how much more and more tender the pity , as he ran to his help . But if , instead of one who stood only in the offices of general and neighborhood kindness , it were a strong personal friend - yea , a brother - how much more intense would be the throbbing emotion of tenderness and pity 1 But all these fade away before the wild outcry of the man 's own father , who would give his life for his son , and who gives pity , now , not by measure , but with such a volume that it is as if a soul were gushing out in all its life ! But the noblest heart on earth is but a trickling 42 god 's pity . Btream from a faint and wasting fountain , compared with the ineffable soul and heart of God , the everlasting father 1 The pity of God is like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and full , but not in scope and power . For every one of God 's feelings moves in the sphere of the infinite . His pity has all the scope and divinity which belong to power , wisdom , justice 1 Yea , power , wisdom , and justice are God 's lesser ways , and come towards that side of his being where there would be restriction , if anywhere ; while love and mercy are God 's peculiar glory . In these he finds the most glorious liberty of the divine nature . Nothing so soon wears out and exhausts men as deep feelings and strong sympathies , especially those which have in them an element of pain , as pity hath . Our life requires to be broken in two each day and replanted , that it may spring up again from sleep , as new blossoms out of soil . We are buried every night for a resurrection of each morning ; and thus our life is not a continuous line , unbroken , but a series of lives and deaths , of deaths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no rest and requires no slumber , but holds straight on without weariness , wearing out the ages , himself unworn ; changing all things , himself without variableness or shadow of turning 1 God is like the sun at noon , that casts down straight rays , and so throws down the shadows upon the ground underneath each tree ; but he never , like the sun , goes westward towards his setting , turning all shadows from under the trees . OOD 's PITT . 43 and slanting them upon the ground . Gpd stands in eternal fullness , like a sun that knows neither morning nor evening , nor night , but only noon , and noon always 1 God 's pity abides , even as he abides , and partakes of the divine grandeur and omnipotence . There is a whole eternity in it , for substance and duration . As God himself can not be measured with lines of latitude and longitude , but is boundless , so is his every attribute . His pity is infinite , moving with equal step to all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far forth as omniscience doth ; it paces with omnipresence along the circuits of infinity 1 For as heaven is high above the earth , so great is his mercy towards them that fear him . As far as the east is from the west , so far hath he removed our transgressions from us ! God 's pity is not as some sweet cordial , poured in dainty drops from a golden phial . It is not like the musical water-drops of some slender rill , murmuring down the dark sides of Mount Sinai . It is wide as the whole cope of heaven . It is abundant as all the air . If one had art to gather up all the golden sunlight that to-day falls wide over all this continent - falling through every silent hour ; and all that is dispersed over the whole ocean , flashing from every wave ; and all that is poured refulgent over the northern wastes of ice , and along the whole continent of Europe , and the vast outlying Asia and torrid Africa ; if one could in anywise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 god 's PITT . sunlight that falls down through the bnght hours , and runs in liquid ether about the mountains , and fills all the plains , and sends innumerable rays through every secret place , pouring over and filling every flower , shining down the sides of every blade of grass , resting in glorious humility upon the humblest things - on stick , and stone , and pebble ; - on the spider 's web , the sparrow 's nest , the threshold of the young foxes ' hole , where they play and warm themselves ; - that rests on the prisoner 's window , that strikes radiant beams through the slave 's tear , that puts gold upon the widow 's weeds , that plates and roofs the city with burnished gold , and goes on in its wild abundance up and down the earth , shining everywhere and always , since the day of primal creation , without faltering , without stint , without waste or diminution ; as full , as fresh , as overflowing to-day as if it were the very first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this boundless , endless , infinite treasure , to measure it , then might he tell the height and depth , and unending glory of the pity of God 1 The Light , and the Sun its source , are God 's own figures of the immensity and copiousness of his mercy and compassion . ( Ps . Ixxxiv. 11-12 ; Is . Iv . 6-13 . ) This divine pity applies to us on account of our weakness . God looks upon our littleness , as compared with his angels that excel in strength , much , it may be supposed , as we look upon little children as compared with grown-up men . Divine pity is , also , exercised in view of our sufferings , both of body and of mind . We sometimes fear god 's pttt. 45 /z/ to bring our troubles to God , because they must seem so small to Him who sitteth on the circle of the earth . But if they are large enough to vex and endanger our welfare , they are large enough to touch his heart of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales , nor with a surveyor 's chain . It hath a delicacy which is unknown in any handling of material substances . It sometimes seems as if God cared for nothing . The wicked are at ease . The good are vexed incessantly . The world is full of misrule and confusion . The darling of the flock is always made the sacrifice . Some child in the very midst of its glee becomes suddenly silent - as a music-box , its spring giving way , stops in the midst of its strain , and never plays out the melody . The mother staggers , and wanders blindly as though day and night were mingled into one , and struck through with preternatural influence of woe . But think not that God 's silence is coldness or indifference 1 When Christ stood by the dead , the silence of tears interpreted his sympathy more wonderfully than even that voice which afterwards called back the footsteps of the brother from the grave , and planted them in life again ! When birds are on the nest , preparing to bring forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of brooding . Not one tear shall be shed by you that does not hang heavier at his heart than any world upon his hand !

Now no affliction " for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous ; nevertheless , afterwards it yieldeththe peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby . " Trouble is like any other crop . It needs time for growing , for blossoming , and for fruiting . /z/ And when he bad sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray ; and when the eyening was come , he was there alone . " - Matt. xIy. 23 . He left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turfy fields , Christ came to the edges of the mountains . His pulse throbbed , and his breath quickened , as he clomb , as ours does when we climb . The sparrow , not knowing its creator and protector , flew away from his coming . His form cast its shadow , as he passed , over bush , and flower , and grass , and they knew not that their Maker overshadowed them . Sounds grew fainter behind him . Those who had followed him , one by one , dropped off , and the last eye that looked after him had lost his form amid the wavering leaves , and was withdrawn . He was in the mountain , and alone . The day was passing . The last red light followed him , and stained tho air of the forest with ruddy hues . At length the sun went down , and it was twilight in the . mountains , though bright yet in the open field . But when it was twilight in the field , it was already dark in the mountain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer drawn outward by the wants of the crowd , what were the thoughts of such a soul ? And /z/ is THE MOUNTAIN AND THE CLOSET . /z/ what were the prayers ? Even if Christ were but a man , such an errand and of such a man , would be sublime ! But how foolish are all words which would approach the grandeur of Christ 's solitude upon the mountain , if we regard him as very God , though incarnated , communing with his coequal Father I What was the varied prayer ? What tears were shed , what groans were breathed , what silent yearnings , what voiceless utterances of desire , no man may know . Walking to and fro , or sitting upon some fallen rock , or prostrate in overpowering emotion , the hours passed on until morning dawned . When he went down to his disciples , they neither inquired nor did he speak of his mountain watch . K prayer be the communion of the soul with God , it is but a little part of it that can be uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take form of words in the presence of others . Of outward wants , of outward things , of one 's purely earthly estate , we can speak freely . But of the soul 's inward life - of its struggles with itself , its hopes , yearnings , griefs , loves , joys , of its very personality , it is reserved , and to such a degree , that there can be no prayer expressive of the inward life , until we have entered into the closet , and shut to the door . Every Christian whose life has developed itself into great experience of secret prayer , knows that the hidden things of the closet transcend all uttered prayer as much in depth , richness , and power , as they do in volume and space . Sometimes we mourn the loss of old books in ancient libraries ; we marvel whet more the world /z/ iTOuld have had if the Alexandrian library had not perished ; we regret the decay of parchments , the rude waste of monks with their stupid palimpsests . We sorrow for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grecian art lie buried from research ; that the Parthenon should come down within two hundred years of our time , with its wealth of magnificence , a voice in stone from the old world to the new , and yet perish almost before our eyes 1 But when one reflects upon the secret history which has transpired in men 's thoughts , and that the noblest natures have been they whose richest experiences could never have been drawn forth through the pen , or recorded in books ; but have found utterance through prayer , and before the conscious glory of the Invisible Presence ; I am persuaded that the silent literature of the Closet is infinitely more wonderful in every attribute of excellence , than all that has been sung in song , or recorded in literature , or lost in all the concussions of time . If rarest classical fragments , the perished histories and poets of every people , could be revived , they would be as nothing in comparison with the effusions of the Closet , could they be gathered and recorded . The noblest natures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rarest inspiration rests upon them . Flying between the heavens and the earth , with winged faith , they reach out into glories which do not descend to the lower spheres of thought . How many souls , so large and noble , that they rose up in those days of persecution , and left home and love for the faith* of Christ , and went to the wil- a /z/ derness and dwelt therein , gave fortli in prayer their whole life 1 Doubtless their daily prayers were rich and deep in spiritual life . But there are peculiar days to all - days of vision - days when we see all human life as in a picture , and all futui-e life as in a vision ; and when the reason , the imagination , the affections , and the experiences of life , are so tempered together , that we consciously live more in an . hour than at other times in months . Every man has his mountains of transfiguration , and sees and talks with the revealed and radiant dead . In such experiences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noblest natures - rich in all goodness , deeply cultured in knowledge , refined in all taste , and enriched in pure lives , but driven out among the wild shaking leaves of the wilderness for their faith 's sake , poured out their whole soul before God ; their conscious weakness and sinfulness , their yearnings and trials , their hopes and strivings , their sense of this life , and their view of the other , their longing for God 's church on earth , and their prospect of the glorified church in heaven ! What if some listener had made haste to put down the prayers of Luther , with all his strong crying and tears , if that had been possible ! How many noble natures gave up to celibacy and virginity the wondrous treasures of multitudinous affections . And when at periods of heart-swellings , in hours when the secret tide set in upon men from the eternal ocean , and carried them upon mighty longings and yearnings towards God , before whom they poured forth in mingled sobs and words those affections which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but which , hindered and choked , found tumultuous vent in mighty prayer to God ! Consider what mothers ' hearts have always been . How many thousand thousands of them have watched day and night over the cradle till the body failed , but the spirit waxed even keener ; and , with what wondrous gushes of words , such as would disdain to be called eloquence , have they besought God , with every persuasion , for the life of the child 1 We judge these things by our own experience . All the words that w6re ever spoken , and all the thoughts that we have conceived , are unfit to bear up the skirt of those prayers , which burst , without words , right out of our hearts , for the life of dying children 1 Consider what a heavenly wonder must be the Book of Prayer that lies before God I For groans are interpreted there . Mute joys gain tongue before God . Unutterable desires , that go silently up from the heart , burst forth into divine pleadings when , touched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts or aspirations be made visible , could they assume a form that befitted their nature , what an endless procession would be seen going towards the throne of God , day and night 1 Consider the wrestlings of all the wretched , the cry of orphans , the ceaseless pleadings of the bereaved , and of those fearing bereavement ; the prayer of trust betrayed , of hope darkened , of home deserted , of joy quenched ; the prayers of faithful men from dungeons and prison-houses ; the prayers of slaves , who found man , law , and the church twined around /z/ and set against them , and had no way left to look but upward towards God 1 The hearts of men by myriads have been pressed by the world as grapes are trodden in a wine-press , and have given forth a heavenly wine . Beds of long lingering sickness have learned such thoughts of resignation , and such patient trust and joy , that the heavenly book is bright with the footprints of their prayers 1 The very silence of sickness is often more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever been 1 - " And when he had taken the book , the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb , having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors , which are the prayers of the saintsP And the other magnificence of the scene one may read in the fifth chapter of that gorgeous book of divine pictures , the Revelations of St. John I How remarkable would it seem , if it were revealed to us that there dwelt in the air a race of fine and fairy spirits , whose work it was to watch all flowers of the earth , and catch their perfumed breath and preserve it in golden vials for heavenly use I But how much more grand is the thought that all over the earth , God 's angels have caught the heart 's breath , its prayers and love , and that in heaven they are before God like precious odors poured from golden vases by saintly hands I Again the divine head is anointed with precious ointment , not now from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by heavenly hands poured sweeter still from broken hearts on earth . The influences which brood upon the soul in such a covert as the closet , are not like the coarse stimulants /z/ of eartlily thought . It is no fierce rivalry , no conflict for victory , no hope of praise or hunger of fame , that throw lurid light upon the mind . The soul rises to its highest nature , and meets the influence that rests upon it from above . " What is the depth of calmness , what is the vision of faith , what is the rapture , the ecstasy of love , the closet knows more grandly than any other place of human experience I /z/ THE LIBEPwTY OF PRAYER . One may perceive at a glance how exceedingly wide is the scope of prayer It will begin with a supplication for our temporal wants . These are first felt , and felt longest ; and , by greatest number of the world , felt chiefly . Next higher , will come petitions for relief from trouble , for remedy , for shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may exercise its own liberty ; there are no metes nor bounds . Then , next , prayer is drawn forth by heart-sorrow . A wounded spirit , a bruised heart , naturally turns for confidence and soothing towards God . Its prayer may be supplication for help , or it may be only recitation for the sake of peace . Next , and far higher , prayer becomes the resource of a heart exercised for its own religious growth . It is the cry for help against temptation . It is the voice of confession . It is a recital of sins committed , and a plaint of sorrow for them . It is the soul 's liberty to go to its father with all its growing pains , its labor and travail in spiritual things . Prayer , also , to one who lives in daily service of God , oftentimes takes the form of simple communion , the spreading out of our life to one who is worthy , whom we love and trust , not for sake of any special advice , nor for sake of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing itself . For none love con- /z/ fidences so much as they who rarely have them . None love to speak so much , when the mood of speaking comes , as they who are naturally taciturn . None love to lean and recline entirely upon another so much , as strong natures that ordinarily do not lean at all . And so the heart that goes shaded and shut , that hides its thoughts and dreads the knowledge of men 's eyes , flings itself wide open to the eye of God . Thus , I have sat down within the forest , and while men were passing , feet tramping , and voices shouting , everything in the boughs and among the leaves hid itself . But after the noise had died out , sitting still and motionless as the tree I leaned against , I have heard a sweet note sounded near me ; then a brief response from yonder bush ; a bird had hopped down upon the leaves , squirrels had come forth lithe and merry ; and in a few moments all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And thus it is in the soul that shuts itself and holds its peace while the world is near , but grows securer in silence of contemplation , and lets out its gentle thoughts and whispering joys , its hopes or sad fears , unto the listening ear and before the kindly eye of Godl But in souls which have caught something of the beauty of the divine life , prayer in many of its moods becomes more than this . There are times of yearning and longing , far beyond the help of the most hopeful . There is a prayer which is the voice of the soul pleading its birthright , crying out for its immortality ; it is heavenly home-sickness ! /z/ There are times , too , of great joys and gratitudes - times in which nothing is so congenial as to exprsss the soul 's thoughts of gladness , its spiritual gaiety . In some lovely morning of spring , after days of storm have made nature mute , when the bright , warm dawning comes , can any man tell what it is or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sit singing with perpetual warbling ? Can any man tell whj it is that they fly singing , turn an wheel in the air with every fantastic gyration , or briskly leap from bough to bough , and twig to twig , or sportively whirl in a feathery fury of mingled delight , a hundred voices crossing and mingling , with strange melody of dissonance ? And can any man , then , give a square and solid reason for those experiences that sometimes come to all - and that come often to some , when thoughts are high and imaginations divinely radiant , and the affections full of vibrations of joy , and the whole soul is fuU of rising gladness , gratitude , happiness , and at times ecstasies ? Have you never felt this ? I am sorry for the man that has not 1 One day , one hour , of such peaceful joy , were worth a year of common pleasure ! But the soul does not always live willingly itself with itself . There is a privilege of . sympathy with God which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the privilege of God 's people to come into such spiritual relationship with him that they shall have meditations , almost visions , of the divine goodness and glory , which will take away from them all thought of self-worth or demerit , of joy or sorrow , of thrift or adversity ; and will fill them with over- /z/ powering gladness for the greatness and the glory of God 1 As one who stands before some magnificence of nature , or in the presence of some stupendous marvel , or before an outspread and glorious work of art or in a cathedral full of dreamy beauty , or within a gallery of paintings , where there is a perfect wilderness of colors and forms , as if there were as many as there are flowers in the wilderness ; - as persons , amid such surroundings , are utterly unconscious of self , and forgetful whether they are in the body or out of it , whether rich or poor , whether in trouble or in joy , but are carried quite out of themselves , and made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; so , and much more , is it in the power of God to open such views of himself to the soul , as to fill and overfiow its capacity and to make its life , for the time , a life beyond the body - a life that goes forth , as it were , out of doors , and mounts up to the very heavens , and stands before the eternal glory of Love , and among the radiant multitudes in the endless processions of heavenly hosts that are for ever praising God ! Who shall lay tax upon the tongue , or upon the thoughts , in such glorious visions as these ? Who shall criticise or regulate the prayer that springs from such experiences as these ? Let a man arrogantly teach rain how to fall , or clouds how to shape themselves , and with what paces to march their airy rounds , or the season how to plant , and tend and gamer ; but let him not teach a soul how to pray , upon whom the Holy Ghost thus broods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not but bear the burden of the Lord in earthly things . Christ 's cause , and glory in the salvation of souls , will oftentimes move their prayers with deep and inexhaustible desires . They may not seek such experiences . They do not come by common asking . They are given to them who are one with Christ ; who have entered into such sympathy with God , that they must needs bear his cross and , as it were , be crucified for sinners . And , in like manner , God makes his servants to bear the burden of God 's cause on earth at large ; so that , at times , the desires , the yearnings and prayers for the prosperity of Zion , will be almost more than flesh can bear ; so that in the expressive language of Scripture , they travail in birth for God 's work on earth I There are yet other modes of prayer ; but who shall frame words to express what that communion is which the soul holds when , in the fullness of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how great is the folly of those who decry prayer as being useless , inasmuch as God knows what we need - as if asking for enjoyable things is all that a soul does in prayer . What if a man should have an idea as ignoble as this of sounds and space , and should say that no words or sounds are sensible , or of any value and desirableness , except such as articulate well-deflned wants ; as if they were of no use in exclamations of gladness , in tones and words of joy , in the mazes and tropical exuberance of love , in the sweet endearments of friendship ; as if they /z/ were of no use in music , in shouts of gladness , and , in short , in any utterance except those for servile uses ! With regard to forms of prayer , these are of use , and are proper to be used by all who need them ; but they can never include the whole of that utterance which the soul shovld express to God in prayer ! Some persons are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be emembered by such that the confidence of love is not irreverence . God permits his people to plead with him , and to pour out their confidence freely . The exhortation is explicit , " Let us come holdly to the throne of grace 1 " Some are discouraged , when after continued communion with God , they do not find any such range and progression in prayer . To pray is , to many , like speaking a new and foreign language . It must be learned . One is not surprised that a foreign tongue is slowly and brokenly spoken at first . Prayer gains in scope and richness as the elements of spirituality increase and the habit of expression is formed . /z/ Pbivate prayer ought to be regarded as a plea* sure and privilege , not as a duty . But public prayer may fitly be spoken of as a duty , since it is seldom that one would of choice pray publicly for his own devotion , but only because it is his duty to the brotherhood . No service needs more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of instruction . This is an exercise in which men can not be drilled . It is ungracious even to criticise what purports to be an address to God . Yet , there are some suggestions which we shall venture to make . We think it very important tliat the pastor , or some leading ofiicer , should be faithful with the younger members of the church in pointing out blemishes and faults , which may easily be corrected at first , but which , if suffered to go on , will become ineradicable . One man falls into a whining tone , another prays in an inaudible whisper , another exalts his voice far beyond the natural conversational pitch , and others lose the natural tones entirely , and pray in a kind of sacred falsetto . Some talk in tenor , but pray in base ; some converse in upper-base notes , but pray in tenor notes . If a brother first speaks , and then prays , a stranger , listening from the outside , would think two different men had been speaking . Tliis Iiabit becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of whom come , at length , to have a conversation voice , a praying voice , a hymn voice , a reading voice , and a preaching voice . Men are seldom entirely true to themselves and natural in their prayers . There is a certain round of topics supposed to be necessary to a symmetrical prayer . These they punctiliously introduce , whether their heart craves such utterance or not . Of all forms of prayer , extemporaneous forms are the worst . They have all the evils of written prayers without their propriety . If , when a Christian brother were in full tide of prayer along the regular succession of topics , Christ should really appear before him , how extremely impertinent would most of the petitions seem , addressed to a living and visibie Saviour 1 Thus a man 's real feeling is not expressed , and matters quite good in themselves , but almost wholly indifferent to him , constitute the bulk of petition . Eeverential tones and well-connected sentences , expressing very proper ideas , do not constitute prayer . The very essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thoughts of the suppliant . When a man really reveres God , how simple is the language of veneration I But if his heart is breaking with sorrow , or depressed by care , or fretted by ill-adjusted affairs , why should he leave the real strain of feeling , and strike into a false key ? It is remarkable how skillfully men will contrive to avoid all real interests , and express almost wholly those which are not real to them . A man prays for the glory of God , for the advance of his kingdom , for the evangelization of the world ; but , in that very /z/ time , he will not allude to the very things in which his own life may stand , nor to the wants which every day are working their impress upon his character . The cares , the petty annoyances , the impatience of temper , pride , self-indulgence , selfishness , conscious and unconscious ; or , on the other hand , the gladnesses of daily life , the blessings of home , the felicities of friendship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the things which one would talk of to a venerable mother , in an hour of confidence , are excluded from prayer among the brotherhood . Without a doubt , there is to be reserve and delicacy exercised in the disclosure of one 's secret and private experiences . But this is not to be carried so far as to strip prayer of all its leaves and blossoms , and leave it like a formal bush or tree in winter , with barren branches standing in sharp outline against a cold sky . We must enter a solemn protest against the desecration of the name of God , so very common in prayer . There would seem to be no necessity , in a prayer of ordinary length , and upon ordinary occasions , of more than one or two repetitiojis of the divine name . Instead of this , it is often repeated from twenty to forty times . Every sentence begins , " O Lord I " Often the middle of a sentence is pivoted upon the divine name . It is made to be a word on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gather breath . It is a word used simply to begin a sentence or to close it up . In short , the name of God degenerates into a mere rhetorical embellishment , and is the wasteword of the prayer . For our own part , prayers interlarded /z/ in this manner are extremely repulsive , and even shocking . The prayer of intense feeling , of nncontroUable sorrow , or desire , are the exception . And no one would shrink from any repetition of the Divine name , which seems like the clinging and pleading of an earnest and yearning heart . Nor can we consent , any more , to be moved by the interjections and epithets of prayer . Many prayers are rolling full of O 's , and the voice runs through half a semicircular scale of gracious intonation with every other sentence . It is , O do this , and O do that , O send , O give , O bless , O help , O teach , O look , O smile , O come , O forgive , O spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O watch - O ! O ! O ! O 1 through the whole petition , with every variation of inflection . Some O 's are deep and sad ; some are shrill and short , some are blunt and decisive , but more are long , very long , affectingly long ! It is sometimes painful to hear men getting their prayers to a close . After advancing through the topics for a proper time , it seems as if it were thought needful to throw in a collection of very short petitions , or to come to the close through a certain cadence of petitions , until at last the gate is reached , and the man comes out in regular style through the " forever and ever , Amenl " And so habituated have men become to this , that a prayer that begins without a certain conventional opening , and closes without the regular gradations , is thought singular and irreverent . The familiarity of deep feeling , the boldness of love , the artless sentences of unconscious sincerity , are to some undevout , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no oflfence , if the manner is only solemn . Solemnity is a mask behind which levity and thoughtlessness heap up endless fantasies . It is the arch-patron of hypocrisy . The use of Scriptural language in prayer becomes often a serious vice . Of course , when fitly used , no language can be more elevated and apprcriate . But when texts or scraps , and fragments of texts are strung together , or when certain favorite texts recur in every prayer , long after they have ceased to convey to the hearer the thoughts originally coupled with them , the use of Scripture , instead of edifying , injures . A prayer is not a thread on which men are to see how many texts they can string . An improper use of figurative language in prayers , is a source of positive mischief . We take no exception to figurative language . when it springs fresh from the imagination . Then it augments the tide of thought and feeling . But there are certain figures , and not all of them Biblical , which have been repeated over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except a false sense . They come to be , at length , in effect , the assertion of literal truths . And a figure that was meant simply to kinde the imagination , finds itself in a didactic position , teaching the strangest conceivable things . Some men are always " opening the windows of heaven , " " raining a rain of mercy , " " laying down the weapons of rebellion . " " Stony hearts , " " unclean hands , " " blind eyes , " " deaf ears , " at length /z/ transfer the thoughts to the outward symbol , and quite hide the inward and specific spiritual state . Some men never say humble , or humility , except by such expressions as " on the bended knee of the soul , " and going down into the valley of humiliation . " Many men have apparently forgotten the name of Christ . They always use the word " cross " instead . They pray to be reconciled to the " Cross , " they exhort men to come to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to lay down their sins at the foot of the " Cross . " We once heard an ordination sermon of great ability upon salvation by Christ , in which that name was not once mentioned , the " Cross " becoming the synonym . Had a heathen stranger been present , he would have supposed the name of the God whom we worshipped to be " Cross . " This is the more unfortunate , because it not only sinks the power of a living personality , but presents in its stead a symbol which , however precious , and historically affecting , may , by too great familiarity , lose entirely from sight the Saviour , and leave only the wood ; a relic worse than any which Bomish superstition has presented . /z/ We have always been affected by the petition of the disciples to the Saviour , " Lord , teach ns how to pray . " How many yet would fain address the same request , with simplicity and conscious want , to Christ ! It is not our purpose to say anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prayer , and made its language as familiar to them as their motlier-tongue ; but to them only who are vexed with the troubles incident to beginning . If the first moments of the morning , the very first thoughts of the day , are given to prayer , it will be found , at least in many cases , to give direction to the feelings of the whole day . The key-note of the day is struck early . And simple as it may seem , we have forced a few moments in the morning to hold the day to its course , as a rudder does the ship . Some persons , we suspect , fail of interest in prayer , by attempting to pray by the clock . They have been taught that a regular time and an appointed llace are eminently beneficial . They have tried the time with so many failures , that the place , by association and memory of ill success , becomes disgustful . We are not about to say that punctuality and regularity are not good , but only that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience shows that /z/ they hinder and do not help , Christians are under no law to the clock . Persons of regulated feelings , of methodical habits , and of uniform occupations , find great advantage in stated hours of prayer . People of mercurial dispositions , who live without special arrangement and system , will find , on the contrary , that such attempts at punctuality will not help them , except as an exercise in method and regularity . If a man should insist upon wallowing in the sand when the tide was out , because he had made up his mind to bathe in one place and at one hour , he would not be much unlike him who prays when his watch , and not when his heart , tells him the time . Christians are to remember that they are children of liberty . They are not bound up , as the Jews were , to times and seasons , to places and methods . Prayer may become a yoke of superstition , instead of the wings of liberty . It may be briefly said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refreshing . Leani from your ow experience how and when prayer is best for you . You are under bonds to no man , be he minister or layman . We think that one may very much aid himself , by taking a few moments of his brightest hours for silent prayer . The Jews were taught to present their best fruits for offerings . We should not choose refuse lioui 's , good for nothing else , to pray in . No matter where you are , nor what you are doing , send a glance Godward from the top of every exalted hour - as from a hill top , a child , going home , would /z/ strive to catch a glimpse of his father 's house . In this manner , after a little , the soul would layup remembrances of many sweet and noble experiences , and would fight discouragements by hope drawn from past success . We suspect that many persons mar this enjoyment by very erroneous ideas of quantity . They read of eminent Christians who pray by the hour , they hear sennons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . all , they are told that Christ prayed all night . They therefore attempt immense prayer . Of course they fail . A man might as well attempt to imitate the old prophets who ate in preparation of forty days ' fast . If a man is moved to pray only five minutes , it is his duty to stop there . If he is moved to pray an hour , he is at liberty to do so . But in every case , prayer is to be regulated by your own inward want , and not from the outside by somebody 's example . Indeed , we meet every day with persons who would be injured by long praying . They have but little to say . K Christ were on earth , and they were disciples , they would listen rather than speak . There is communion by thinking as well as speaking . There is unuttered prayer as well as vocal . Thoughts that roll silently are more significant , often , than those which can clothe themselves in words . It is possible to pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond your real want or desire . Christians bring themselves into trouble by very false ideas of prayer . They select impassioned prayers as models , and judge themselves to be praying in /z/ proportion as they approacli these examples . But what if your wants are few , your feelings tranquil , your thoughts simple , and your whole mind and experience formed upon a different basis ? Is prayer some objective exercise to be copied ? or is it the presenting before God of just what you think , feel , of need ? One single sentence is a suflSicient prayer . There is no one who can not command his thoughts long enough for that . If your thoughts wander , the probability is that you are trying to pray too much . Be shorter . Say just as much as there is in you to say . If there is nothing , say nothing ; if little , say little ; silence is better than mockery . Consider the Lord 's prayer , how short , how simple . It contains the whole world 's want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer as liberty , and not a bondage . Use it in any manner that will be of profit . Go often and tarry but a little , or go and tarry all night , if you will , upon the mount . You pray if there is but one sentence - God be merciful to me a sinner - just as freely as if there were a thousand be sides . /z/ We have known men - upon whose grounds waved magnificent trees of centimes ' growth , lifted up into the air with vast breadth , and full of twilight at mid-day - who cut down all these mighty monarchs , and cleared the ground bare ; and then , when the desolation was complete , and the fierce sununer gazed full into their face with its fixe , they bethought themselves of shade , and forthwith set out a generation of thin , shadowless sticks , pining and waiting till they should stretch out their boughs with protection and darken the ground with grateful shadow . Such folly is theirs who refuse the tree of life , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the feeble trees of their own planting , whose tops will never be broad enough to shield them , and whose boughs will never voice to them the music of the air . Some of the most remarkable figures of the Bible are made to illustrate this sad truth . The mountains lift their tops so high in the air that towering clouds , which have no rest in the sky , love to come to them , and wrapping about their tops , distill their moisture upon them . Thus mountains hold commerce with God 's upper ocean , and , like good men , draw supplies from the invisible . And so it is , that in the times of drought in the vales below , the rocks are always wet . Tlie mountain moss is /z/ always green . The seams and crevices are always dripping , and rock-veins are throbbing a full pulse , while all the scene down below faints for want of moisture . In some virgin gorge , unwedded by the sun , these cold rills bubble up and issue forth upon their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain but meet and tap these springs in the mountain , and lay his artificial channels to the very source , he would never know when drought cometh . For mountain springs never grow dry so long as clouds brood the hill tops . Day and night they gush and fall with liquid plash and unheard music ; except when thirsty birds - to whose song the rivulet all day long has been a bass - stoop to drink at their crystal edges I And he who has put himself into communication with these mountain springs shall never be unsupplied . While artificial cisterns dry up , and crack for dryness , this mountain fountain comes night and day with cool abundance . While others , with weary strokes , force up from deep wells a penurious supply of turbid water , he that has joined himself to a mountain spring , has its voice in his dwelling night and day , summer and winter , without work or stroke of laboring pump , clear , sweet , and cheerful ; running of its own accord to serve , and singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in its song bringing suggestions of its mountain home - the dark recess , the rock which was its father , the cloud which was its mother , and the teeming heaven broad above both rock and cloud 1 With such a spring , near , accessible , urging itself upon the eye and ear , how great would be his folly /z/ who should abandon it , and fill his attic with a leaden cistern , that for ever leaked when full , and was dry when it did not leak 1 Listen , then , to the word of God : " My people have committed two evils : they have forsaken me , the fountain of living waters , and have hewed them out cisterns , broken cisterns , that can hold no water . " Man is not made to be independent in his powers . With all his endowments he is made to lean on every side for support ; and should his connections on either side be cut , he would droop and wither like a tree whose roots had been sundered . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight from the luminous element without . The ear hath no sound within it , but only receives it from without . The tongue and throat beat upon the air for vibrations , as a musician strikes for musical sounds ; and if hindered in their connections or broken from their dependencies , ear , tongue , and eye would fall back into voiceless darkness . And every bodily function is directly or immediately joined to the physical world in such a way , that , while man is lord of creation , he is also its subject and dependent , and must ask leave to exist from the earth , the air , the sun and the clouds . These dependent relations symbolize the yet more important relations which the soul sustains to God . Man is not made to exist in rounded , perfect , and independent spiritual fe in his own right and nature . He only is a perfect man who has himself in the embrace of God . The soul only when divinely brooded receives its power . Our faculties , like the eye that /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their power from above . It is the divine energy acting through the human faculty , that gives to man his real existence . Nor does any man know his power , his nature , his richness of emotion , the height and depth of his being until he unfolds under the stimulus of God 's imbreathed influence . What is that effluence ? What is this spirit which acts within or upon the soul ? I will tell you when you will tell me what it is in light and heat that works upon the root to bring forth the stem ; what it is that works within the stem to bring forth the bud ; what it is that works upon the bud to persuade it into blossom ; and what that mysterious spirit is , that , dismissing the beauty of the bloom , holds back its life in the new form of fruit . It is light , it is heat , it is moisture , it is the soil , it is the plant , it is the vital energy of nature . Thus we stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not search nor find out . " So is every one that is born of the Spirit . " But of the fact itself , it is full of blessedness to know that the soul has a relationship to God , personal , direct , vital , and that it grows and blossoms by it , while it languishes and dwarfs without it . The body grows by its true connections with material nature ; the social affections grow by their true relations to men and society ; and the spiritual powers must grow by their true relatious to God . In the material world , the roots of trees are in the ground , while the top moves freely above . But the soul roots upward , and so like long , pendulous vines /z/ of air-plants , that root upon tropical branches , has its liberty down towards the earth . We are the branches of Christ . " As the branch can not bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine , no more can ye except ye abide in me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfishness it may be ; but not to love . Selfishness grows strong by shrinking , for concentration is the nature of selfishness . But love grows by pressing outward and evolving . That we are bound to God is as great a restriction of our liberty as it is to a plant 's freedom to be held by the sun ; to the child 's liberty that the double-orbed love of father and mother bear it up from cradled nothingness to manly power ; or to the human heart 's liberty , when , finding another life , two souls move through the sphere of love , flying now with double wings , but one spirit . No man has come to himself who has not known what it is to be utterly forgetful of self in loving . And no man has yet learned to love who has not felt his heart beat upon the bosom of God . As a bird bom in a cage , and singing there , amid short , impatient hops , from perch to wire , from wire to ring , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As this bird , when darting through the opened door , feels with wondrous thrill the wide sweep of the open air , and dare not sing for joy , but goes from ground to limb , from lower limb to higher , until the topmost bough be reached , and then , stooping for a moment , springs upward and flies with wild delight , and fills the air as it goes with all its sounds of ransomed joy -- eo is /z/ the soul that first learns its liberty in God , and goes singing heavenward in all " the light and liberty of the sons of God . " He who forsakes God for a greater liberty , is like a babe lost from its mother . They who refrain from God for the sake of pleasure , are like men running from the free air to seek sunlight amid shadows and in dungeons . They who withdraw from God that they may have wider circuits of personal power are like birds that forsake the forests and fly within the fowler 's cage , to find a larger bound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bridle the whole body , " one is at first surprised . It would seem to place the sum of virtue in a very little thing . But a larger experience of life would change our opinion . The tongue is the exponent of the soul . It is the flame which it issues , as lightning is the tongue of the clouds . It is the sword of anger , the club of brutal rage , the sting of envy . It is the soul 's right hand , by which it strikes with wasting power . On the other hand , the tongue is the soul 's voice of mercy , the . string on which its love vibrates as music ; the pencil with which it fashions its fairest pictures ; the almoner of its gifts ; the messenger of its bounties ! By speech a man may touch human life within and without . No sceptre has such power in a king 's hand , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this advantage , that well uttered words , never die , but go sounding on to the end of the world , not lost when seemingly silent , but rising and falling between the generations of men , as ships rise and fall between waves , hidden at times , but not sunken . A fit speech is like a sweet and favorite tune . Once struck out , it may be sung or played forever . It flies from man to man , and makgs its /z/ nest in the heart as birds do in trees . This is remarkably exemplified in maxims and proverbs . A generation of men by their experience prove some moral truth , and all know it as a matter of consciousness . By and by , some happy man puts the truth into words , and ten thousand people say , He got that from me ; for a proverb is a child born from ten thousand parents . Afterwards the proverb has the liberty of the world . A good proverb wears a crown and defies revolution or dethronement . It walks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man might frame and set loose a star to roll in its orbit , and yet not have done so memorable a thing before God as he who lets go a golden-orbed speech to roll through the generations of time . The tongue may be likened to an organ , which , - though but one instrument , has within it an array of different pipes and stops , and discourses in innumerable combinations . If one man sits before it not skilled to control its powers , he shall make it but a nronstrous jargon . But when one comes who knows its ways , and has control of its powers , then it becomes a mountain of melody , and another might well think he heard the city of God in the hour of its singing . Tlie tongue is the key-board of the soul . But it makes a world of difference who sits to play upon it . " Therewith bless we God , and therewith curse we men . " It is sweeter than honey . It is bitterer than gall . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tooth . It is a wand that touches with hope , and lifts us up . It is a mace that beats us down , and leaves us wounded /z/ upon the ground . One trumpet , but how different the blasts blown upon it , by love , by joy , by humility , or by hatred , pride , anger 1 A heart that is full of goodness , that loves and pities , that yearns to invest the richest of its mercy in the souls of those that need it - how sweet a tongue hath such a heart 1 A flute sounded in a wood , in the stillness of evening , and rising up among leaves that are not stirred- by the moonlight above , or by those murmuring sounds beneath ; a clock , that sighs at half hours , and at the full hours beats its silver bell so gently , that we know not whence the sound comes , unless it falls through the air from heaven , with soimds as sweet as dew-drops make , in heaven , falling upon flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blossomed tree , so that it speaks in its sleep with a note so soft that sound and sleep strive together , and neither conquer , but the sound rocks itself upon the bosom of sleep , each charming the other ; a brook that brings down the greeting of the mountains to the meadows , and sings a serenade all the way to the faces that watch themselves ill its brightness , these , and a hundred like figures , the imagination brings to liken thereunto the charms of a tongue which love plays upon . Even its silence is beautiful . Under a green tree we see the stream so clear that nothing is hidden to its bottom . We cast in round , white pebbles to hear them plash , and to see the crystal-eyed fish run in , and sail out again . So there are some whose speaking is like the fall of jasper stones upon the silent river , and whose stillness follows speech , as silent /z/ fish that move like dreams beneath the untroubled water ! It was in some such dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesome tongue is a tree of life . " And what fruit grows thereon , he explains , when he afterwards says , " A word fitly spoken , is like apples of gold in baskets of silver , " - beautiful whether seen through the silver network of the sides , or looked upon from above , resting their orbed ripeness upon the firetted edge of the silver bed . /z/ It was about half-past nine o'clock at night that the conductor upon the Naugatuck Railroad train called out " Litchfield ! " We stepped out into the light of the brightest moon , and looked about only to see two or three snug houses , and a little bit of a station-house . The town lay four miles to the west , i. e.j by daylight , and with a nimble team . It was at least ten miles that night . But we did not care . Nothing is more befitting than to return to one 's native place in the quiet of night , and with the witchery of moonlight , that at the same time reveals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since either of us , my venerable father or myself , had been on this road . We had been back to the town before , but had approached it from a different point . As we climbed up hill after hill , the driver , an intelligent man , gave us the names of the places , and what power was there in many of them to evoke the past , and bring up its faded scenes in a pastor 's heart ! Litchfield was a large township , and the inhabitants were in neighborhoods among the hills , and along the clefts and valleys . It was necessary to have preaching places in every direction . On the Sabbath , the farmers would come to the " town-hill " meeting-house , but during the week , there were lectures and conference meetings appointed , in turn , /z/ AN AGED PASTOb 's BETDBN. 81 in every neighborhood , at distances from two to six miles from the centre . As we rode along , the aged pastor , who was returning to the scenes of his early ministry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called . In this house he used to lecture ; in that , he remembered an aflfecting funeral ; yonder , he used to hold conference meetings ; and all the region about was storied with religious interest . The seventeen years which Dr. Lyman Beecher spent in Litchfield , though not the most influential , perhaps , upon the whole country , were probably the most laborious and energetic of his life . Some passages of his history here would seem almost fabulous to the economical workers of our day . It was half-past ten o'clock when we reached the mansion-house . The Eev . Leonard Bacon , jr. , received us cordially - the fifth pastor who has succeeded in the ministry of the white-haired patriarch whom he now greeted . In the thirty-one years that separate these two ministries , what a histoiy has transpired ? And as the young pastor led the aged one across the old common to his house , is it strange that we followed with more thoughts than can well be put into expression ? A good fire blazed on the hearth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , had we come back to Litchfiela to find a coal fire , or worse than that , to find a black hole in the comer of the ' room puffing out dry heat , instead of the old , hospitable fireplace , with ashes and coals , and the longfingered blaze that opens and shuts its red palm with every grace and sleight of hand . A good Litchfield /z/ fire of Litchfield wood , even if it was only the first week of September , was the very fittest banner that could be spread out to greet us , and every fold and flicker of flame brought back from the past old shapes and long-buried scenes , that used to flit round the fireplace , years ago , before railroads were dreamed of , and when New York lay a week 's journey from us ; when the old red or yellow stages came once a day from the north , once from the south , and once from the east ; when the drivers blew the horns as they came into town , and boys heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stage-driver was the greatest man on earth , and that to hold four reins and a whip in one hand , while the other held to the pouting lips the long tin horn , noisy at both ends , was the most wonderful feat of skill ever achieved 1 The next day it was sent out far and wide that Dr. Beecher was in town . Though the great body of his former parishioners had passed away , some remained that were old when he preached here . As we passed the graveyard coming into town my father , pointing to it , said , " There is the congregation to which I preached when I was here ! " Silent now and without memory . The unconscious assembly gave no greeting as we passed , but kept their long Sabbath without bell or tithing-man 1 But some yet remained alive . Men now of fifty years were boys when my father left . Those who blushed to think of love and husband yet , now rocked their grandchildren 's cradle ! Those who were then in the prime middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BETUSN. 88 And indeed LitcMeld is the last place one should settle in who desires to go early to his rest . It seems difficult to obtain release from earth on this clear hilltop . Men are counted very young at fifty , and sound at seventy-five , and not very old at eighty . One old man , near ninety , modestly told us that his mind had been affected by a shock ; but surely he had more wit and sprightlinss , after aUtiis loss , than most men have to begin with . He was peculiarly thankful that while he was too old to do much himself , God had been pleased to give him a young wife . She was only seventy-five , he informed us . A man past eighty , going through the streets to visit all the fathers and mothers in Israel that had been young in his ministry there , was a scene not a little memorable . One patriarch , in his ninety-ninth year , when his former pastor came into the room , spoke not a word , but rose up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into tears . Did he see in that moment , as by the opening of a door , all the way he had walked till that hour , and all the companions who had walked with him ? and did he feel , standing by the venerable pastor , two old men , how few there were that yet kept step with him upon the bleak way of life ? Passing his own former home , my father broke out with a swing of his arm , " Oh , how many thoughts and associations hang about that place 1 They fill the air like swarms of bees , and yet I can not speak one of them I " The particular errand which brought us hither was a lecture . A new organ was to be bought . All // Litchfield boys were permitted to help . Our contribution was asked in the shape of a lecture , and it was soon done . Then the aged pastor came forward . A crowd of old and young gathered at the pulpit stairs to grasp the hand that had baptized them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a scene of few words . One woman gave her name , but was not recognized in her married name . She then mentioned her maiden name . That touched a hidden spring . Both burst into tears , but spoke no words . The history came up instantly before both , but silently , which had occasioned the preaching of those " Six Sermons upon Intemperance . " That volume is in every land on earth , and in many languages . It is preaching and working with unwasting vigor . Those that read it know only that it is a cry and pleading that few men can hear without deep feeling . But not many know that it was a cry of love , the utter effort of a heart of love to save a dear friend imperilled , or two friends , rather , closely related . One of them was rescued . These sudden openings of memory to scenes that included in them the strangest experiences of life , pictures painted on the past , with strokes of thought as sudden and as revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth with wide sheeting flash , and shuts again with obliterating darkness , can not be drawn or described upon paper . The second morning , also , was memorable for greetings , and conversations whose roots were forty years deep in the soil of the past . For ourselves , we hovered about as a mere shadow among those AN AGED pastor 's RETUBN. 85 who had a right to be principals in these sacred meetings . If an angel could write all that transpires when an aged warrior in the church militant comes back to the earlier fields of his achievements , and meets the companions of his toils , where tears and prayers , hopes and joys , sorrows and deaths , and troubles worse than death , were common experiences , it would be a history of more matter and depth than all the volumes that are stuffed with empires , and buffoon kings , aud prelates . Last of all , as we departed , it was fit that we should stand silently by those stones that record mother and wife , sister and son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the stream and its contents that has flooded between the two points of time , the first when I , a little babe , my father came to the burial ground , bearing the wife of his youth to her rest ; and the second , when leaning on my stronger strength , his failing steps came again , and probably for the last time , to behold the grass that again waves , as it has yearly waved for forty-six years I Between these two comings hither , then and now , a great army of events hath marched . While witnessing such scenes , it is strange that one can not foresee a like experience . But men seldom look forward to see old age . They look into the future with young eyes . It seems very vague and doubtful to me whether I shall ever walk with trembling steps , and bedimmed eye , among early scenes , an old man , waiting for permission to go home ! /z/ ' * When it is evening , ye say , It will be fair weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , It will be foul weather to-day ; for the sky is red and lowering . 0 , ye hypocrites 1 ye can discern the face of the sky ; but can ye not discern the signs of the times ? " Every season is indebted to that which has gone before . Yet , the first labor of the new life of grass is to push away the old and overlying growth . Many trees are obliged to begin the spring by casting off the leaves of the previous year . Thus it was in the moral world at the advent . Christ 's first and last adversaries were those who represented the religion of the times . They were the men who were religiously conceited ; and who , under the pretence of sanctity , of truth and the venerableness of holy things , refused to let the new growth come on which God appoints to every generation . They were the religious conservatives of that day . Clamorous about the truths of the past , and very ignorant of the truths of the present , they seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world were already issued ; and that they were the King 's post , in which these teachings , sealed up like letters , were to be conveyed to another generation ; and they supposed that their business was that of sacred mail-carriers , to convey unopened and unused the sealed messages of God to those who should come after them . /z/ Of course , such men would scorn the ethical activity of their age . Men 's business was to take care of the legacy of the past , not to plough and sow for new harvests . It was this kind of men that met Christ at every step ; that were shocked because he ate and drank like common men ; because he went among common people , and thought religious truth , not in the consecrated language of rabbinical schools , but in the vernacular ; because he sat in their houses at meat with them ; because he gave men liberty on the Sabbath day , and declared that that day was not meant to restrict but to help men ; because he let his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he preached to the outcast , and took the side of publicans and harlots against the respectable Pharisees ; in short , because he took the part of religion against the religious institutions ; because he took sides with religious spirit , which is always yoimg and vegetating , against religious usages , which are always venerable in proportion as they are nothing else . It was against this kind of religion , and these stubbom , conceited , unlearning , and impracticable religious men that he uttered these words . Men who had apparently never suspected that God had any way of teaching the world except through them ; who would as soon have looked out into the street for gold and silver , as to have looked there for divine revelations ; and who , when God sent armies to Jerusalem or drove them away , when he sent the yoke or broke the yoke , when he raised up world-wide commotions or gave peace to the foaming waves of // contention , heard no moral lesson , saw no divinity , but looked point blank upon God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attentive to that voice which sounded a thousand years before upon Sinai , that they did not hear the silent thunder of God 's voice now in their own streets , and right at their own door I Christ rebuked them . He put their conduct in a striking light , by comparing it to their habits in trifling things . The state of the weather they could judge by looking at the elements of the weather . But the state of God 's kingdom in their midst , while miracles were wrought , truths wonderfully spoken , the poor relieved , the sick graciously healed , and God 's law of love , which they had changed to stone , was smitten and caused to gush forth with divine water for the poor multitudes that lay athirst in the community - from all these things they never suspected that the kingdom of God had come nigh to them . The truth to be remarked is this , that we are bound to understand Prod 's dealings with the times in which we live . Because by such discreet consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and test the wisdom of various courses . Because , by such study , we come to right apprehensions of God 's moral government over this world . It is a thing to be remarked , how little benefit men have derived in the long experience of commercial life . The same mischiefs occur every ten or fifteen /z/ years . Courses upon wlucli the Bible pronounced sentence two thousand years ago , are entered upon again and again , as if nothing were known of them . God has spoken to him who hath ears to hear , upon the nature of greedy selfishness , upon unscrupulous devices in business ; upon making haste to be rich ; upon pride and hard-handedness ; upon deceit and guile ; upon the infatuations of hope , and the supreme folly of unwarrantable conceit ; the blessings of contentment ; the blessings of a good name ; the blessings of God 's service instead of mammon 's bondage ; all these have been proved over and over again , and yet almost without impression . I. It is remarkable to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but simply by difficulty of commercial breathing . K the human body be stricken with fever or palsy ; if cholera or plague attack it ; or if the sword or bullet smite it ; or if some weight fall suddenly and crush it ; or some secret wound draw out , drop by drop , the blood - we do not marvel . There is a cause adequate to the effect . But if you put a man into an exhausted receiver , under a bell-glass , without ' a particle of air , the mischief is just the same . No organ suffers , no tissue is lacerated , no muscle crushed , no part is poisoned , none wasted or drained of its vital fluids , and yet the man effectually dies . The course of affairs among us has not been disturbed by the unnatural invasions of war . The harvests have not failed , and famine has not reached out its gaunt hands among us . Disease has not striven in our midst , nor has industry ceased for lack /z/ either of legitimate enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , in full health , with uncounted abundance of harvests , in its young manhood , stalwart , eager , hopeful , is suddenly brought up , and trembles , and staggers , as if it would lie down in faintness . What is the matter ? It is the want of air . The city can not breathe . What , then , is this commercial air , which is so needful to life and activity ? It is the faith of man in man . It is mutual trust . It is confidence . This is the air which commerce breathes . And now , in our midst , although there have been indiscretions , there have been none which the country could not bear almost without a check . Men speak of overstocking the market , or over-manufacturing , of over-importations , and of extravagance of various kinds . I do not say that there have not been mistakes in these respects , and great mistakes . But I do* say that we are too strong a people to be brought into such confusion by mere mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such elements of power , that surface mistakes will never damage it seriously . There is money enough , property enough , and need for goods and manufacturing , but men are all paralyzed to-day chiefly by fear of each other . Men look at the best concerns , as in times of siege they look at bombshells , expectiug that every one will burst , and that the only difference between one and another , is in the length of the fuse , and the time it will take to bum out . But why should there be this sudden cessation /z/ of confidence ? Ton tmsted those men yesterday to go around the globe with yonr money , whom now yon will not trust to carry it from the bank to the store I No change has come over these men . They are just as honest now as then . Their morals are as good . Their business is as safe . On whatever foundation you stood five months ago , the materials of that foundation remain untouched to-day . Tour ships are there . Tour goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not niggards nor simulating friends . They are the same men that you always knew , just as good , just as bad , unchanged either for better or for worse . But the city is under a spasm . No one will take things to be as they seem . No one trusts . Every one doubts and fears . Now it is to the last degree important to inquire , Why has confidence gone , and gone so suddenly and so completely ? Testerday it blossomed like flowers over the field ; to-day frost has fallen , and all are black and drooping ! What wind has sent that withering frost t In reply to this inquiry , I would say that in part this panic of fear is without proper ground . It is the overaction of causes , of which I shall speak , which are real . But we have not stopped at the legitimate potency of those causes , but allowed our imagination to carry our fear headlong , and with it our confidence in each other . Merchants are now like men awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AH scream and run , one crying out one thing , another another , all stumbling over each /z/ other with insane fear . Now there may be a cause for some fear , for some precautions , for some earnest defence . But there is , and there has been , no cause for the excessive reaction from hope which has taken place . The roots of business are sound . There never was , upon the whole , more health with so much life . And hundreds of men will be upset by nothing but because they are run against by affrighted men . Hundreds of men will go down , and lose years of toil , and the fruits of honorable industry , for no adequate reason except that men are scared , and in their unreasonable affright , like persons in a crowd , they tread each other down . It is a shame I I am not in biusiness . I have not one penny invested in stocks or goods , and never had . If the market touches the sun , or goes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine with it either way , and I am , therefore , not biased by my interest . And I look upon this convulsion and trouble with unfeigned amazement , as reckless , needless , wanton cowardice . The business-men of this country are suffering at this hour from a contagious cowardice 1 The whole continent is unstrung by nothing but fear . Nothing , I say , for that of which I shall speak by and by , and which is the ultimate of this iniquitous evil , was not of any such proportions of power as to justify any such breadth of effect : and fears have been added to real trouble in such unwarrantable proportions that it is scarcely immoderate to say , that we are all lightning-struck with fear . /z/ And the cure , if it could but be taken , might be effectual in one day , as much as in a month or a year . Hope and trust to-morrow would set the blood going again , and bring color to white faces . For the mischief is not in the business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , but in you I The country is like a ship under a stiff gale and a rolling sea ; in the watch of night , the man at the wheel and the watch think they see a ghost , and abandoning their post , they all run gibbering and tumbling headlong down the hatchway . The ship falls off and rolls in the trough of the sea , until , if some one does not help her , she will roll her masts out , or come upon her beam ends . But , if there be a heart of oak among them that can cure these frightened sailors with the thunder of imperious scorn and indignation - if they will go again upon duty , seize the wheel , set the sail , and bring the ship out of her wallowing , to her course again , all will be well ! And I speak my honest conviction when I say , that all which the country wants just now is manliness . Your banks can not cure you . The government can not cure you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I pronounce the patient to be in a prostrated condition , from causeless excitement of fear , and my prescription is - Let there be men for nurses , and give them large doses of courage , to be taken every hour until the blood comes to the skin , and the patient can use his feet . Then turn him out , and say . Else up , walk , and work ! n . But there was a beginning to this fright . There was cause enough for fear , but not enough for fright . /z/ What was that cause that destroyed confidence and paralyzed hope i A relaxation of moral integrity , and a special development of it in connection with the management of stocks , and the vast interests which they represent , have introduced an element of profligacy and untrustworthiness , which threatens to move the foundations of trust of man in man . And unless there can be the infusion of moral integrity in the transactions of business-men , in the immense interests represented in markets by stocks , unless those swamps can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast up for men to walk on through the poisonous growths of this forest , the land will suffer , season by season , with malaria , and commerce will never be free from chills and fever , until moral tonics are used . The conscience of stock-dealers needs quinine /z/ The boards of directors , in our greatest enterprises of this kind - railroads - have permitted themselves to employ the power for selfish ends , by unscrupulous methods . I believe myself to be strictly justified , when I say that the revelations of the last ten years show that in the management of these great and useful corporations , our most eminent business-men have not scrupled to do or to wink and connive at courses of conduct which involved directly , or indirectly , almost every crime against property known to our laws . I aver my solemn belief that most eminent business-men , banded together , and acting as a board of direction , have pursued methods which , if a single /z/ man in his private capacity should pursue , would convict him irredeemably of crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been , that one of the most importantH-yea , indiBpensable-elementB of property in this land is so associated with deceit and fraud that it is likely to become a by-word and a hissing /z/ Now , when one by one eminent financiers , who manage these interests , all at once like a midnight house on fire , burst into conflagrations of dishonesty ; when next whole corporations are detected at games of swindling , which , if practised in the park with a lliimble , would send a man to the Tombs ; when , yet further , it is found that banks ar inveigled and are made to be left-handed partners in schemes that will not bear the sun ; and when , yet further , strong business men are discovered to have stepped from their legitimate calling , and to have lent their names to devices for obtaining fands that are unwarrantable even in commerce , and utterly abominable in morals ; when all these things are re* vealed , is it strange that men do not know whom to trust ? and that men , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are liars ? " Springing from this , and coupled with it , is the monstrous and over-bloated sin of stock-gambling . There is no more sin in buying and selling stocks than in buying or selling bank bills , or any species of property . But it is one thing to buy and sell legitimately , and another to buy and sell as gamblers do . /z/ Many honorable men pursue an honorable business in the brokerage of stocks . But it is quite notorious that millions and thousands of millions of dollars of stock are sold every month under the lawful forms of the Stock-Brokers ' Exchange , which can be shown to differ in no moral or material respect from undisguised gambling . It is not necessary to enter minutely into the distinctions between right and wrong in buying or selling stocks . It is enough to say , that he who buys stock as a hond fide method of investing his funds , looking for dividends , or for some benefit from the interest represented by the stock , buys legitimately and without moral blame . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to make money upon the bet that they will rise or that they will fall , is a scheme of gambling . Men that do it are gamblers . All the soft names on earth can not be dissolved to make a varnish strong enough to cover the real wickedness . Men wiU resent the imputation . No man likes to be called a gambler . But the way to avoid the title is to avoid the thing . In this gambling game the whole community have more or less participated . Some devote their time to it . Since my day , I remember , I think , one concern to have failed four times ; it fails to-day , is on its feet io-morrow , in as good credit as ever . For when the business is fraud , and the customs of it are dishonesties , it does not take a man long to repair any little cracks in his reputation . Merchants are forsaking their legitimate business . /z/ and dabbling in this pool . Their clerks , following their example , gamble too . Simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard earnings , and go to gambling likewise . The lawyer follows suit ; and that there may be no want of moral sanction , ministers of the Gospel are found , not a few I am informed , secretly buying and selling stocks . Now when the company themselves are gigantic speculators by fraudulent and dishonest means ; and when the stock of the company goes up and down the street , carrying in its hand a bowl drugged with gambling , and crowds rush to drink its intoxication , is it strange that at length the head is sick , the whole body ftdnt , and that the commonwealth lies at length upon the ground , wallowing like one possessed , foaming , and rending itself ? It is supposed that there are one thousand million doUarS'invested in railway property . Can this mountain of power be used against good morals , against commercial prudence , and the country not reel and stagger ? Can this prodigious weight be cast rudely hither and thither upon the deck and the keel lie level ? There is not an honest man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not in the power of these irregular forces . There can be no permanent security , if financiers can , at pleasure , draw up such enormous elements of power , and hold them suspended , like water-spouts , to bursfand flood down desolation the moment tley are touched with misfortune . And if commercial men will not draw tight the reins of morals upon /z/ these unprincipled men , they will have their own neglect to thank for the mischiefs which will have come upon them in some sense by their connivance. ni . Now , what lessons do these times teach i 1 . We are to learn that commercial prosperity stands indissolnbly connected with public morals . In their heat , men cast aside moral scruples , as one would throw off his garments in a race . Where everybody sins together , men fondly think that their concord is a law of nature . Little by little success domineers over conscience . The permission of custom , the sole condition of accomplishing , the fact of accruing wealth , with its praise and influence and power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitate to violate rectitude by ranks and multitudes . They systematize selfishness and organize injustice . But all seeds demand time between sowing and reaping . Wlien first sown , thistles are as good as com . But when the reaping-time comes , they that sow grain shall carry their bosom full of sheaves , and they that sow thistles shall have their skins pierced full of spines and poisonous prickles . In commercial intoxication it is as in drunkenness by strong drink - first the pleasing exhilaration , but aftenvards the bursting headache . No class of men are more interested in a high tone of public morals than business men . Their life depends upon credit as much as their bodily life stands in air fit to breathe . Credit demands the solid rock of integrity . It /z/ will not stand upon the shifting sands of custom . The merchant should be a Puritan . Whoever else may permit the public conscience to be tampered with , the merchant is interested by the whole force of self-interest , that the consciences of men touch God , and anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sanctity of the divine law , to admit anything to be higher in human affairs than religious rectitude , is preparation for unfaith and untrust of man to man . Tbe merchant that destroys good morals plucks off the planks from the bottom of the ship which carries him and all his goods . He will founder . He will be carried down , sooner or later , by inevitable leakage . 2 . Public indifference to immoralities , will be avenged as if it were participation . The bills which wicked men draw against the- public treasury to pay for their crimes and vices , are always indorsed by the virtuous men of the community ; and in the end , the sober always pay for the intemperate ; the pure pay the expenses of the debauched ; the honest man pays for the knave 's debts ; the working and frugal man pays for the indolent and spendthrift ; and in such times as these it is seen that the headlong and swindling speculators run the commercial world into desperate straits , and then the criminals step aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In prosperous times men attend to their own business and will not be troubled with public interests . This is a selfishness which God never will forget . In thb : /z/ hour of distrcBS they find out that indifference to pub* lie morals is itself a crime , and that Providence , in due season , punishes honest and good men for the misconduct of wicked - men , which they could have prevented but would not . 3 . These are the times for men to detect unnamed vices and crimes , and give them their place and proper designation on the list of evils . In all vigorous communities , where enterprise attempts new things , by new measures , we may be sure that selfishness will pioneer conscience . Many things will be done , as now we clearly see they have been done , which are wrong to the last degree . But because men had not yet analyzed them or sat in judgment upon them by moral rules , they were permitted to go on as if right and permissible . God 's providence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find out what is wrong by the punishment with which we are surprised , rather than by the use of our moral judgment . It is a shame that God 's whip should have to be a better judge and interpreter of rectitude than a Christian man 's conscience . 4 . These times ought to point out the attention of men to the sure punishment of greediness . Haste to be rich comes more speedily through the stage in which they give equivalents , of skill , or benefit , for wealth received , into the always wicked and demoralizing stage in which men desire to enter without giving fair equivalents for gains . This appetite has no bounds when once planted . It is a raging fever of avarice . It is the peculiar disease /z/ of speculators , of stock-gamblers , and of all other gamblers . A man who deliberately purposes to gain wealth without earning it by some substantial equivalent rendered to the community , is a thief . He may be called , down here , by much softer names . But above he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice silent or motionless . While these men are ripening , the sickle is patient ; but that is all that it waits for . Where now are all the eager financiers ? Where are those inflated speculators that use Gkxl 's great round of time and providence as a gambler 's box to throw their dice with , who venture a penny , and rise from the table with uncounted gold ? Where are these greedy men and their greedy associates , and where are their gains now ? " He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye , and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him . " God has written these words so high up that all financiering hands that reach around the world greedily can not reach to rub them out . And every generation of men , whether they like the ritual or not , are compelled to say . Amen . At this time , men are affirming this truth with deep and bitter pronunciation . " Hie ship that was struck by this mighty gale and well-nigh overturned , is abeady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed ? Already streaks of light are appearing . There will yet be a struggle , but the fierceness of it is over . Some will yet go down , but those who are strong will stand ; and now , if there be Christians among these thousand merchants , who can rise a little above their own selfish /z/ ness , and , though in distress , go to help their fellows , how true and devout a gospel shall such disinterested and heroic conduct be ! There is many and many a friend whom you may cheer , encourage , and help ; and your coming to such in this stormy hour , will be to them almost like Christ walking on the sea in the night and tempest , pressing down the waves to tranquillity with his feet , and casting serenity into the storm from the peace of his own divine face . Not again in a man 's lifetime may it be permitted him to do so much for God and Christ , by heroic endurance , by cheerfulness amid danger by helpfulness when the instincts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true men ! Christian men I all ! take hold of hands , put shoulder to shoulder , stand and make others stand ! After a little more trial you shall come forth as Nelson 's ships came from the smoke of battle , pierced and crippled it may be , but floating still , and able to float ; and afterwards , every shot , every wound and every loss shall be healed by victory , and then become insignia of glory ! " The night is far spent , the day is at hand . " /z/ DuBiNG the BTimmer , on western rivers , as you are riding or even wading across the ford , you may see , lying a little below you , great flat-bottomed boats , used for ferrying . During the summer , while waters are low , and men can cross without help and without danger , these craft lie moored to the shore with nothing to do . But when heavy rains have swollen the river , and the ford is drowned out , so that no man may dare to venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat swung round , and by cords and poles forced across the swift running waters for the convenience of those who must pass over . All our emergencies are like streams . So long as we can cross them without help we use the ford . But when our affairs are beyond our own skill or strength , God sends round his promises which had lain along the shore , tied up and disused , to bear us over the black swelling waters . And blessed is he who is willing and able to venture across real troubles upon God 's staunch promises . In times of trouble , every Christian man will find wonderful comfort in the psalms of David . Now their true colors will shine out . Tlie psalms are like diamonds , which , though bright in the daylight , do /z/ not give forth their peculiar brilliance until night and artificial light cause them to flash . And so are those great lyrics of the world sung not to any lover 's lute , or even Homeric harp , but Sung from the chords of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep as human life , wide as the earth , and far reaching as immortality . And in times of trouble men ought to walk in the garden of this Book and comfort themselves with its fruits and flowers . It is not the design of God 's promises to help us so long as we can help ourselves . They are like defensive arms which men wear in a wilderness among robbers , not to be fired incessantly , but hidden for emergency , and then brought forth for self-protection . They are like a mountaineer 's staff , though good for level ground , not meant specially for that ; but to be relied on chiefiy among rocks and sharp acclivities . What is a man 's faith in God good for , which only holds liim up when he can hold himself up without help , and breaks under him when he needs to lean upon it ? What is a belief in God 's special and particular providence worth , if it applies only to fair weather , and dissolves in storms of trou-ble ? K one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences , he will find that God 's promises were first made to men in the most bitter trials . They are not summer promises . They are not general nor indefinite . They were made to touch exactly such cases as yet occur every day . /z/ Are hopes ever baffled ? God has bahn for that . Is an honest pride sorely wounded ? God has spoken consolation for that . Is a man 's good name shot at ? ' That too has been done to ten thousand men before , and God girded them with promises which held them up . The men have died , but their charmed girdles are left . God 's armory is full of them . Do your enemies triumph over you ? There are blessings thick as spring flowers among old grasses for those who suflfer evil and bear it patiently . Now , while men are rowing in darkness , and upon a dreadful sea , they may expect to see Christ coming to them walking upon the water . Or , it may be that he is abeady in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prayer to come forth upon the elements , sovereign over their wild tumult ! Methinks I hear Christ saying to all his disciples the very words which he variously pronounced while upon earth . Some are beseeching him to relieve their fear and bring back prosperity . They can not bear the thorn in their side that threatens to reach their heart . But Christ 's answer is , I will not remove the trouble , but my grace shall be sufficient to enable you to bear it . Another bewails his misfortunes , and cries out , " Lord , why is this ? " The reply is , " The servant is not greater than his Lord . It is enough for the disciple that he be as his Master , and the servant as /z/ his Lord . " None of us are reduced as low as was Christ for our sakes . And it is a comfort to every penitent heart to feel , at each step down , that he is not going away from light and love but towards them . Christ lives near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate of heaven . They who abase themselves are going towards God . And when Christian men are going down , step by step , nearer the bottoin , let them say , " why not ? why should I demand for myself what my Lord and my God gave up freely for my sake ? " Men often put questions the wrong way , and when they are bereaved , they say . Why should I be afflicted ? When they meet losses , they say , * Why should I have such misfortimes ? But , would it not be soberer and more sensible if men should say . Why should not I have trouble ? Am I not a man in a world of trial ? Am I too good to be touched ? Shall all God 's elect since the world began drink of the bitter cup , and I claim exemption ? What have I done that God should honor me ? What use have I made of my strength and wealth , that I should demand their continuance ? How have I brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrew them from me , and placed them in his own bosom ? Shall Christ walk in poverty , and I disdain that experience ? Shall he not have whereon to lay his head even , and I complain in the midst of home , food , comfort , and love ? How very good a man must be , who can afford to be surprised when God unclothes him of superfluous /z/ wealth , and makes him walk as near to the edge of necessity as the best men of the world have done before , and still do ! We are not to affect stoical indifference , and still less rail ont bitterly at wealth ; and seek , thus , to cover over our disappointment by a false pretence of anger . How much better is Paul 's spirit ( TPhil. iv . 11 ) , " I have learned , in whatsoever state I am , therewith to be content . I know both how to be abased , and I know how to abound . I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do all things through Christ that strengtheneth me . " " Which of these extremes is the more difficult , it is not our purpose to consider . Far more difficult than either is the spirit that can play back and forth between them both . A Christian man 's life is laid in the loom of time to a pattern which he does not see , but God does ; and his heart is a shuttle . On one side of the loom is sorrow , and on the other is joy ; and the shuttle struck alternately by each , flies back and forth , carrying the thread , which is white or black , as the pattern needs ; and , in the ' end , when God shall lift up the finished garment and all its changing hues shall glance out , it will then appear that the deep and dark colors were as needful to beauty as the bright and high colors . Meanwhile , as God 's children are going through unwonted and bitter trials , it is affecting to see with what royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that convoyed his flock of children , in a flight by night , from a savage foe , would whisper words to this one , and cheer that /z/ one - now lifting up , and then for a little way even carrying some , meanwhile encouraging them , and saying , it will soon be light , hold on , and hold out , my brave children , we are almost through ; so God hovers about his flock in days of sore adversity , saying , " Be of good cheer ; because I live ye shalllive also ; I will never leave you nor forsaJke you . I am not angry , nor gone away from you ; I chasten because I love you . Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth . Ye are my sons . Cast all your cares upon me , for I care for jsn . Let not your hearts be troubled , neither be ye afraid . If God be for you , who can be against you . Think it not strange concerning . this fiery trial , as if some strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have scourged every son that I ever received . Slessed is he that endureth affliction . To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the midst of the Paradise of God ! " Wherefore comfort one another with these words I /z/ Whoever enters this world with an expectation of finding or making a life of uninterrupted joy , will enter blindfold , but tronble will quicUy open his eyes . The wish to be happy is natural and normal . But the expectation of happiness unalloyed is most unreasonable . Life is a probation more or less severe with all , but severe in different degrees to different men . Some seem only dipped into life , as we plunge children into a bath . They come for a moment within the horizon and depart again . Some appear to have answered the earthly conditions of their existence in a few years . There is no interpreter to God 's Providence , and God is silent . Some persons appear to have an end in life which requires an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ od , neither exalted by great joys nor depressed by burdensome sorrows . Others are sent into life armed to resist the pressure of external things . They have hope , courage , elasticity , and they meet and vanquish assaults with almost gladness . But others still there are to whom is appointed a much more difficult task . Their troubles are within . /z/ As a shipmaster who carries an insubordinate and mutinous crew has his enemies in his own ship , so many men have a disposition so wild , so untempered , a mind so unbalanced , that their chief work of life is in their own souls . Others still are children of special sorrow . God seems to deal with them as Apollo is fabled to have dealt with Niobe - slaying all their hopes . Many persons carry their own troubles ; others find them in their social dependence and connections . But there are many troubles that do not seem to bear any relation to our wisdom or to moral obliquity . They are like silver arrows shot from the bow of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In such a world it is folly to expect exemption . They who escape have reason to fear evil . But some there are who meet their troubles with such cheer that they hardly remember them as trials . As the sun converts clouds to a glorious drapery , firing them with gorgeous hues , and draping the whole horizon with its glorious costume , and writing victory in fiery colors along the vanquished front of every cloud , so sometimes a radiant heart lets forth its hope upon its sorrow and all the blackness flies , and troubles that trooped to appall , crowd around as a triumphal group around the steps of a victor . Now these need not fear that they are not the sons of God . Tliey seem but little tried because they have such singular victory . But those who have no troubles , and gain no victories , have never striven TROUBLES . Ill for a higher place in life than nature gave . A man without aspiration is stale indeed . But aspiration brings endeavor , and endeavor strife , and strife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rear our children to avoid trouble . Instinct will do that sufficiently . It should be ours , rather , to teach them how to vanquish one part , and how to endure the other . And enduring is the greater . Secular troubles , or troubles from without - troubles by men , troubles from affairs , troubles of business , should always be met with greater force than they bring . Many troubles can be cut at the root and cease . Many can be strangled . Many can be overcome by direct attack . We should count worldly trouble to be only an excitant , and by it be aroused to an energy and force which otherwise we could not have felt . Such trials are only occasions of victory . Meet and resist them I Some troubles and trials can be thrown off . Diseases are repelled by great animal vigor ; and troubles may be repelled by great mental vigor . Every one perceives this in his own experience . In the morning we can carry the world like Atlas . At noon we stoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us down and we are under it . The very troubles of to-day were about you yesterday , and you did not know them . For you were engaged in things that fired the mind with higher excitements . Very many troubles of life are nothing but your weakness . Stand up and they are gone /z/ They are like gnats , which , while one is still , settle and bite , but rising up and working , the whole swarm fly off or do but buzz . But the moment the man rests , they , alight . Thus , activity is exemption , and sleep is defeat . The want of proper occupation is the cause of more than half of the petty frets of life . And right occupation will be a medicine for half the minor ills of life . A man without any proper aim in life , without moral inspiration , too rich to be industrious , and a prey to the thousand frets of unoccupied leisure , sometimes sets himself to pray against his troubles . Now a man might as well pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man pray against petty troubles . - Therefore it happens , sometimes , that bankruptcy brings to a man what all his wealth failed to give - happiness ; for he has real troubles , and trouble is a good medicine for trouble . There is a moral counterirritation. /z/ Many troubles , unlike the above , that are real , can be medicated by Hope . For so is it , that we can bear much when the prospect before us is cheerful and assured . If a man lets his troubles come between him and the sun , they will cast a shadow and interpose their substance too . But if he will put himself between the sun and his troubles , then his own form will fall upon the over-shadowed evil and half eclipse it . It is for this that hope is given . " We are saved by hope , it is said . Hope is an anchor that holds on to the bottom while the storms handle the ship , and enables it to outride the tempest . /z/ Happy is lie that lias liope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no elasiticity in his foot , and could spring over no pool , nor ditch , nor roughness , but went leadenly through them all , how burdensome would his journey be ! But by an elastic ankle he springs over a hundred hindrances , and never knows their annoyance . Many of our troubles should be overspmng . V Many troubles in life cease when we cease to nurse them . We take them up , we dandle them upon our knee , we carry them in our bosom . When they seem to sleep , we wake them up , and insist upon sharpening their point . We ruminate oxir cud , which was a thistle at first , and make mean and fretful martyrs of ourselves . If one wiU be unhappy , if bitter is craved by the palate , there is no need for remedy . Many real troubles there are which will cease the moment our heart accepts them and submits itself to them as a part of a Divine Providence . For many , many troubles are but the strain which we endure when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist upon going the wrong 1 When two walk arm in arm , if one would turn and the other would not , either they must pull diversely or else must separate . But God never lets go his children 's arms , and if they struggle and hold back , they are dragged . Let them submit to be led , nor struggle , nor hold back . In that instant the trouble goes . This is specially true of all troubles which involve loss of property and worldly comfort , as though they /z/ were necessary to happiness , when myriads live most happily without them . " Many of- our troubles are instantly cured by holding them up in the light of God 's countenance . They arise from seeing things in a false light , or from seeing things in the half-light of this world . When they are surveyed in the great sphere and in the light of heaven , they dissolve like snow-flakes . This is the reason of the experience of many Christians . They go under a cloud , and finally , pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of God , filled with hope and cheer , when they begin to think of their petition , it is gone . The air of heaven has health in it . There is peace in the very presence of God . They that touch the . hem of his garment are often as much healed as those whom he takes by the hand I The same is true of music ; a little hymn , childwarbled , has sometimes done more for a man in one moment than all his own philosophy , his strivings , and his labor ! For a hymn is like the touch given to the servant 's eyes by the prophet . It opens the air , and it is full of God 's messengers . There be troubles that may be worn out . A patient endurance will destroy them . Like tides , they can not be checked nor resisted when rising . But , like tides , if patiently waited upon , they will tmn and flow out of themselves ! Nay , rather let me say that they are inundations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sends clouds to the mountains . From their bosom all the mountain-springs nurse , and are full . /z/ But when from the fullness of the rain the streams swell , and branch adds to branch its tribute , the over-swollen river spreads wide over all - the neighboring meadows . Trees wade deep ; bushes , halfhidden , seem cut in twain , and the earth is lost . But with a few days the stream sucks back its waters and drives them out to the sea . Now see the drenched earth all aslime . Mud , mud , mud 1 But go again in two months and see the children of the mud - grass that waves its little forest - flowers that carry heaven in heir bosom - com and grain that exult in richness and vigor . Troubles come to us like mire and filth . But , when mingled with the soil , they change to flower and fruit . / /z/ Thb art of being happy is less cultivated in this land than in almost any other . We make extravagant preparations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we heap up material ; we go through an immense experience preparatory to being happy . But , in the main , it is the very thing wmch we forget to extract from an abundant preparation . Contentment is a quality which few know how to reconcile with aspiration , and still less with enterprise . Satisfaction , therefore , is the bright ideal of the future . It never blossoms to-day . It is always for to-morrow . Men never come up with their hope . The short and intense excitements which we misname enjoyment are paroxysms , not steady pulsations . At length it comes to pass that men do not enjoy life in the midst of heaped-up prosperity . And amid reverses they bemoan themselves when the topmost leaves of the banyan tree are plucked by the wind , and refuse to shelter themselves beneath the vast breadth of what remains . The whole land stands in surprise and complaint at a sudden and violent revolution . Our disasters are in every mouth . The change of circumstances is the fertile theme . A little while ago and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but darkness . Then it was noon all the while ; now it is /z/ midnight . In neither case was there balance and just judgment . The h'ght was too bright then , and the darkness is too dense now . It becomes us to estimate - to sit down and puf one thing over against another , and to frame a judgment upon a view of all sides of our case . There are imdoubted evidences of the advance of the world in true civilization . Within the last ten years the most extraordinary wars and civil revolutions have taken place on the globe . Once such a combination and movement as we have but lately beheld , would have affected the whole globe witii terror . Since the French Emperor put his bloody foot upon the steps of the throne , there have been set on foot the most wide-spread combinations of governments , the most prodigious armies and navies , such as turn tiie historic Armada into a mere affair of yachts . Once the globe would have trembled to the footsteps of such an unparalleled war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in military things , that , a hundred or two hundred years ago , such a history would have drawn with it the world 's nerve and blood and vitality . But now aU western Europe rose up and the world did not tremble . All Bussia gathered together and the Orient did not feel it . And the pounding of war in that gigantic conflict disturbed the world as little as a thresher 's flail upon the bam-floor disturbs the earth beneatii it . " Not even the nations that carried such battle in their hands tiiought it heavy . Great Britain took but her left hand . Not a wheel stopped in her manufactories . Not an acre the less was tilled in France ; and the world upon this side /z/ read the account simply as news . It produced no more effect than Hie last serial story that drags its long and tedious tail through the cheap and stupid magazines . But now , upon these western shores , over-eager capitalists and operators have pushed their trade too far and built their plans too fast . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives way in Pennsylvania . This shook the continent more than all tiie cannonade of Sevastopol . Next , the banks of New York suspended . All business stopped . Society was tremulous from top to bottom 1 The tidings are borne across the ocean . That wonderful island , whose top is narrow , but whose base is broad as the whole earth , began to quiver , and that silent panic brought her down quicker than an axe brings down the ox . War could not make her plumes to quiver ; but Commerce , by a look , cast her upon the ground . And it stands apparent to the world by the grandest demonstration , that in valid influence Commerce has supplanted " War , and is its master . The general 's sword , the marshal 's truncheon , the king 's crown , are no longer the strongest things . The world 's strength lies in die million hands of producers and exchangers . Power has shifted . No matter who reigns - the merchant reigns . No matter what the form of government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people . The king 's hand is weaker than the banker 's . Wax can not convulse the world , but Capital can . This should not be mentioned as if it were an unmixed good . It has its own mischiefs , for every event grows in a husk , which at first proserves and /z/ then cumbers the ain ; and commerce kas its dangers and tyrannies ; but it marks the direction the world is pursuing , and the progress of the march . The growth which is everywhere to be witnessed is away from dynasties , from imperious governments , and towards the great masses of men . This is one of the signs of the times which wise men are able to discern in the present crisis . It is true , a man that was rich yesterday , but is bankrupt to-day , may not find consolation in being told that his facile destruction was one of the straws which show which way the wind blows ; but , notwithstanding , it does show it ; and though we are sorry for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse some alleviation . The conditions of growth in our age and nation are unlike those of past times , and are not to be measured by them . Germany , France , Great Britain , began in a barbarous state , and through centuries developed their civilization . Their growth was slow ; their wants did not require any ingenuity or skill for supply . Slowness gives nations a chance to be steady . Our nation had no interior infancy . Our fathers were ripe men , for their age . Society in America has begun , at the beginning , with all the wants which , abroad , came gradually through centuries . The inevitable - result of such condition was twofold : Now to give an extraordinary impulse to our people in industrial directions ; and to oblige them to devise every possible means of operating . With no accumulated capital , with no past beliind us , that had builded towns , roads , and structures for us - we yet had the same tastes , the same intellectual /z/ wants , the same scale of social ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations had . It was impossible that men who were imder such conditions - a quick , enterprising , industrious , ambitious people - should not be powerfully influenced , and that in the earlier stages of national life the propelling power should not be in excess , and the consolidating and steadying power relatively deficient . Never was there a people truer to their circumstances . Had they tried to live in the past they would have been like a plant trying to grow away from the light . God put their life in their future . They pressed towards it . Even the present was but one broad step , by which to go further towards the future . And all the developments among us have been those which were necessary - in the imperfect way in which the world always grows - to this answering of our people to their true nature 1 The central faculty which warms , incites , and intensely influences the American mind , is hope . And while we are served and blessed by this power we must take it , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and judiciously combined , works out full and fruitful enterprises , and gives light and pleasure to industry . But this feeling is subject to various conditions and diseases . Gambling , in the worst sense , is nothing but the last and worst development of diseased hope . The distance and difference between the mild beginning and the terrific end of this action is immense . The risks and ventures of the stock market is another source . The element of speculation is derived /z/ from the same feeling . Hence nationally , and as a fact of our race , Hope is large . Past and present circtimstances have powerfully developed and inspired it . It has given to us in our circumstances , a character of adventurousness not only , but a great part of our material prosperity has arisen from this very thing . To construct thirty or forty thousand miles of railroad in twenty-five years could never have been done by merely prudent men . There seems an overruling element in affairs that provides tendencies to fit the exigency . If our border men were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too much for them . Even when cut off they are less a loss . living or dying they seem fitted to their place and work . And so in early periods of commercial development there is need of pioneers . Men who have nothing to lose and everything to gain in venturesome enterprises , must take the lead . We are fortunate in having such . We owe to them an immense obligation . It is the ruined men of the community who make the prosperous men . They went before . They ventured as no others would have done . They foresaw , or thought they did . They had that mind element which made it as easy for them to do this , as it would have been hard for others . Even in the mutations and upsettings of this class of men there is to be observed a wisdom of affairs . It does not hurt a sanguine man , full of spring and hope , to be destroyed . Some men are like some of the earlier forms of worms ; cutting them in pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a head , and finishes ont a new tail , and moves along . You may tm-n a life-boat over and it will right again ; but it would not do to upset a frigate or line-of-battle-ship . Many men in New York get so used to failures that they expect them as much as ten-pins expect to be tripped up ; it is part of the game . If tiiey do not expect it , their neighbors do . When a community is moving under suclf influence and pressure , there is neither legislation , nor experience , nor any other regulating power , that can prevent gradual and increasing tendency to excess . Some men will live too fast . Some will venture too far . Gradually , competitions and strivings in a large and free acting community will engender heat . Heat wiU carry people further than they have calculated ; it will tend to develop that most powerful element - credit , which carries in its right hand blessings , and in its left curses , but ten blessings to one curse . In varyhig periods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , men will have ventured so far along , that a reckoning day will come . And such crises are but that relief which the great system needs . It is but a fever , arising from the reaction of nature - the throwing off of morbid matter . In this process , sufferings of pride , honor , and even personal and bodily , tend to keep men 's faces too close to their affairs to let them see the benefit of the whole operation . One would think by the exclamations of ruin , disaster , dismay , that crises are deadly ! Almost the whole evil rests , upon indi- /z/ vidiials , without inflicting any considerable damage upon society . And even that which falls upon individuals is temporary , and compensated by collateral benefits , which , upon the whole , in a large way of judging , are beneficial . It should be borne in mind , and thought of with thankfulness , that although a heavy pecuniary pressure has been resting on the community , the great incalculable mercy of health , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that abundance for man 's sustenance was never greater , and for the general national want never so available ; that it is only particular points that suffer ; that the average virtue , intelligence , and progress of the masses is onward , and not backward ; that we are not tangled or wasted by foreign wars ; that our great national struggles are pointing towards victory ; that free labor was never so strong as now ; and that discussion never was so free , so thorough , and so satisfactory . It should be borne in mind , also , that with this crisis nothing perishes . No ships will rot , as under embargo ; stores will not fall down ; not a wheel will rust , but only rest ; the raiboads whose creation has cost us so much , are created , and will not go back , but thunder on . Not an acre will go Bgain to forest ; not a seed will rot . We shall hold all the substantial elements gained , losing no art , no science , no ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a little temporary comfort ; and for that we shall receive back steadiness , safety , reality , and consolidation , worth a thousand fold . /z/ Many passages of the ' Scripture are like hnndreds of wayside flowers , which for months and years are unnoticed by us , simply because we have been accustomed from our childhood to see them without stooping to pluck or to examine them . Many of the homeliest flowers would appear transcendently beautiful if we would take the trouble to study them minutely , to magnify their parts , and to bring out their constituent elements . And so , we were taught to read the Bible so early , in the family and in the village school , and we have so often and often walked along the chapters , that we have beaten a dusty path in them , and some of their most precious and beautiful things are neither precious nor beautiful to us , simply because we look at them and not vrdo them . Many parts of the Bible may be compared to those exquisite creations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have collected dust and grime and weather-stains , that hundreds of persons go past them every day , never cleansing them , never restoring feature nor color , nor bringing out the artist 's embodied thought , so that they are quite unconscious , till they see them restored in the picture of some book , or till some enthusiastic Buskin brings them out , and teaches us /z/ Iiow beautiful are the things that we have slighted as uncoinely . So the Scriptures are often overlidd , and , frequently , some of the passages that really are the most resplendent are those which seem only conmaon and ordinary . Just such a passage is to be found in the third chapter of the Ephesians , in which Paul says : " For this cause I bow my knees unto tiie Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named , that he would grant you , according to the riches of his glory , to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man ; that Christ may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being rooted and groimded in love , may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth , and length , and depth , and height ; and to know the love of Christ , which passeth knowledge , that ye might be filled with aU the fullness of God . " What a passage is this I But this is not aU . This is a prayer ; and the apostle having made a prayer which few men can climb , takes a still higher flight , and says : " Now unto Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that worketh in us , imto Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages , world without end . Amen . " These words are , throughout , a sublime strain against despondency . Paul was ; in prison . " For this cause , " the chapter begins , " I , Paul the prisoner . " His design was to present such a view of the fuUness of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as should be an offset against any // /z/ poBBible weakness , disaster , oyerthrow , or trouble in life , to OhristianB both as individuals and as chnrclies . It is a presentation of God in such a light as shall enkindle praise . " Now unto Him " - the very words indicate the mood of devont ascription . He wonld excite joy and adoration in view of God 's royal generosity and large-heartedness . The Divine generosity is measured not only by our wants but by our thoughts and desires above our wants , and it equals and transcends both . He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think . " The word abundance " expresses the idea of more than enough . Enough " is a measuring word . It is the complete filling of a given measure . It satisfies the demand . It just equals the-want . But abundance " is something over and above . It is " enough and to spare . " A handful of berries or dried fruits given to a pilgrinrwho is ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strength and satisfy his appetite ; but if instead of this , the kind heart of sympathy should throw open the garden-gate and the orchard , and say to him , ' Go in , pluck and eat , " even when the lively appetite had sated itself upon the nearest fruits , there would still be on every bush and bough , in himdreds of rows and ranks , throughout the garden and the orchard , multitudes of kinds and the utmost abundance in quantity , of sweet and delicious fruits , which he could not begin to eat nor even to taste . In the one case he would have simply " enough , " in the other " abundance . " Saith the armorer , " I will not be wasteful , " and he uses steel with an economic , eye in forging the /z/ blade , and the smith mestanres his iron for each pnr* pose . So he that pays a debt at the bank lays down the exact amount to a penny , but no more . The apothecary takes the physician 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in measuring the ingredients of the medicine , but puts it up by drachms and scruples with rigid exactitude . So God does not measure in creating , or in sustaining , or in administering . On the other hand , the thought of God which the apostle conveys is that of a being of magnificent richness , who does everything in overmeasure . The whole divine character and administration , the whole conception of God set forth in the Bible and in nature , is of a being of magnificence and munificence , of abundance and superabundance . Did you ever take the trouble to look at a lazy bank that bears nothing for itself ? It has no trees growing out of it for grateful shade , and no vines with cooling clusters , and no grass which herds may browse upon , and no flowers that lap over it , and yet the hair of ten thousand reeds will be combed upon its brow , and it will be spotted and patched with moss , of ten thousand patterns of exquisite beauty , so that any artist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , would make himself a master-spirit in art , and immortal in fame . God 's least thought in the barrenest places of nature is more prolific than man 's greatest abundance . ' ' God is a being of great thoughts , great feelings , great actions . Whenever he does anything , he never does it narrowly , certainly not meanly . He never cuts out such a pattern , and then works up to it with even /z/ edge . He is a royal Creator , who says to the earth , " Let it swarm abundantly , " and to the sea , " Let it be endlessly filled . ' ' He touches the sand of the shore , and it stands forth as a representative of the abundance of his thought . He spreads out the heavens , and no man can count the fiery stars . He orders the seasons , and they all speak in their endless procession of this one thought of Gkd - His everlasting abimdance I But " abundance " is a relative word . What is abundance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was abundant for a nomad , a wandering shepherd , would not be for a settled farmer , with crops and stock , with bams and houses . . But what is abundant for a farmer , would not be for a merchant ; and what is abundant for a merchant would be very sparse and scant for a prince ; and even among prilices there is great difference of degree . The abundance of a petty German prince would be poverty for the court of the royal Czar . Now put the word , with its relative and increased significance , upon God . Divine abundance ! The fullness of God 1 It is not in the power of man to conceive it ! If God might be supposed to have worked narrowly anywhere it would be on the earth , his footstool . But the earth is infinitely full of God 's thought . And yet , great as the earth is , absolutely it is relatively little , and all symbols " and figures drawn from earthly things stop this side of the divine idea of abundance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is able to do exceedmg abundantly . " What a vision he /z/ must have had I How grandly in that moment did the divine thought rise before his enrapt mind , when he so linked words together , seeking by combinations to express what no one word had the power to flash forth . He could not by the mightiest single word express his own thought and feeling , and so he joined golden word with golden word , as if he fain would encompass it with a chain I But Paul employs a measure of comparison even over and above all this , " above all that we can ask or think . " That is , above the measure of all human aspirations . How much can a man ask or think ? When the deepest convictions of sin are upon him , in his hour of deep despondency , in critical and trying circumstances , when fears come upon his soul as storms came on the lake of Galilee , consider how much a man would then ask , and how much more think 1 Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes life as full as mountains make the streams in spring-time , and hope is the sun by day and the moon by night , in those gloriously elate hours in which he seems no longer fixed to space and time , but , springing as if the body were forgotten by the soul , wings his way through the realms of aspiration and conception , consider how much a man then thmks ! All books are diy and tame compared with that great unwritten book prayed in the closet . The prayers of exiles I The prayers of martyrs 1 The prayers of missionaries 1 The prayers of the Waldensesl The prayers of the AlbigensesI The prayers of the Covenanters I The sighs , the groans /z/ the inarticulate cries of Buffering men , whom tyrants have buried alive in dungeons - whom the world may forget , but God never ! If some angel , catching them as they were uttered , should drop them down from heaven , what a liturgy they ' would make ! Can any epic equal those imwritten words that pour into the ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , what epic can equal the unspoken words , that never find the lip , but go up to heaven in unutterable longings and aspirations ! Words are but the bannerets of a great army ; thoughts are the main body of the footmen , Words show here and there a little gleam in the air , but the great multitude of thoughts march unseen below . Words can not follow aspiration even in its tamer flights ; still less when it takes wings and flies upward , borne by the breath of God 's holy spirit . I see the gulls fim my window day by day , making circuits against the north wind . They mount up above the masts of vessels in the stream , and then suddenly drop almost to the water 's edge , flying first in one direction and then in another , that they may find some eddy unobstructed by that steady blowing blast , until they turn finally with the wind , and then like a gleam of Kght their white wings fiash down the bay faster than any eye can follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some divine wind towards heaven , they take swift upward flight , and no words can follow them I Consider what a soul thinks in yearnings for itself , and in yearnings even moye for others ; what a saint thinks in hours of vision and aspiration , when /z/ he reflects how all his life long , through good report and through evil report , through manifold trials of temper , of mind , of feeling in his family and out , the hand of God has led him every day , and his cup has been filled to overflowing ; consider what a dying man thinks in view of death and of judgment and immortality awaiting him beyond the grave I What wonderful thoughts I What wonderful feelings ! And yet the apostle 's measurement is more than all these , for he says : " Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think ! " iHow true it is tliat God 's riches are unsearchable /z/ This is the idea of God toward which men ought always to repent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is drudgery in a mean man , but in no one else . There is a kind of mean repentance that needs to be repented of . But when a child knows that his misconduct has really hurt a loving parent , the child is more pained than the parent . When a noble spirit has done wrong to a friend , through some misunderstanding that has sprung up between them , such a man demcmda the liberty of restoring himself more than the other demands that he shall restore himself When we have injured a friend , it is our privilege to make it good . It is necessary to our thought of manhood that we should repair a wrong done . How much more when we have wronged Christ , our elder brother , our redeemer , our friend , our joy , and our comfort , should we make haste to repent - not as a duty , but as a sweet privilege ; not with the thought that our /z/ repentance is a necessity made so by him , but made necessary by our own honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to cry so much , and to feel so bad , and to monm so long , is not repentance . True repentance springs out of the most generous feelings of a Christian heart . It is a man 's better nature triutnphing over his lower and meaner . A Christian should never say , " I must repent , " but " Let me repent . " It is the goodness of God that should lead us to repentance , not his justice and his terrors . Many persons suppose that God sits on the throne of the heavens as storm-clouds that float in summer skies , full of bolts and lightnings ; and they are either repelled , or they think they must come to him under the covert of some excuse . But repentance ought to lead us to God as toward light , toward summer , toward heaven made glorious with his presence , toward his everlasting goodness . His eye is not dark with vengeance , nor his heart turbulent with wrath , and to repent toward his justice and vindictiveness must be always from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is with such a conception of God that Christians should come before him with their wants . It is a glorious comfort that God 's love is as infinite as his power . We are all apt to think of his power as infinite , and we call him omnipotent ; but we too often forget that his love also is infinite . It has no end , no measure , no bound . A man 's generous feeKngs are often like the buds at this season of the year - wrapped up in coverings to keep them from the selfishness and coldness of the world . By and by /z/ they may burst out and bloom , yet now they are circumscribed . But we do not have in ourselves the measure of the love of Grod . How base it is , then , when we have some gift to ask of him , to go with shrinking confidence and with piteous look , as though there were need of importunity . Is it possible , if with men " it is more blessed to give than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with God i To a true Christian heart , next to the pain of being unable to do for those who are in want , is the pleasure of being approached by them , when we have it in our power to help them . Is it not the same , and in an infinitely higher degree with God ? The happiest being in the universe is God , because he has an infinite desire of benevolence , and infinite means of gratifying it . There is with him no Umitation , either of heart or hand . Such a view of God , habitually taken , will deliver us from unworthy fears , and will inspire in us great boldness of approach , and access with confidence , unto the throne of his grace . It will tend to comfort Christians who are in despondency respecting their rectitude through life , their victory in death , and their glorification in heaven ; for these things are thus made to stand , not in a Christian 's feeble desire for them , but on God 's infinite desire and abundant grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vast circuits , not knowing their way , if they were conscious and sentient , they might feel hopeless of maintaining their revolutions and orbits , and might despair in the face of coming ages !

But the sun is but a thing , itself driven and held ; and shall not He , who created the heavens , and appointed all the stars to their places , and gave the sun his power , be able to hold you by the attraction of his heart , the strength of his hands , and the onmipotence of his affectionate wiU ?

That is the alpha and the omega 1 That is the beginning and the ' ending ! That is the offer ; that is the promise . And what shall be the response of every Christian heart , if it be not those final and sublimest words of the great Eevelator , " Even so . Lord Jesus , Come quickly ? " CHRIST m YOU , THE HOPE OF GLORY . Lar joumeying through a hilly country we are often able to see only the objects close at hand , the windings of the road , the ravines , or the forest-covered portions of the path , hiding the connection of one part with another . Now and then we come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aU the region , and the whole scene breaks upon the eye at one vfew . The separate steps which we made are invisible ; the particular dells and hills are now but lights and shadows of a great whole which fills the eye . It is thus that we journey through life , occupied with single hours and single days ; with successive individual labors and cares ; we rise over the summits of individual successes or joys , and are chilled in the intervals of trouble and sorrow . But now and then , there is some experience , whose nature it is to lift man up above all his daily round , and to flash forth to his conception the whole past of his life , the whole prospect of it . Yesterday , in his counting-room or shop , question of life to come and immortality seemed so unreal as to suggest a painful doubt of their reality , and the themes of religion , exhaling like dews , from all tangible things , seemed to hang so high in the air of meditation as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vapor . But to-morrow , God 's providence strikes down upon him , no matter by what implement , and he finds himself lifted up out of the drudging and iosensitive habits of business , his prospect widened , and his soul made keenly cognizant of spiritual truth . Then the honors of life dissolve before him ; his own ambitions seem dream-like ; the domineering cares that had bent his back , and wrung out his best services , are , to his thinking , like the smnmer dust which the whirling wheels roll up in the highways . Then , the truths of Grod , of the soul 's truest good , of the connection of life and after-life ; of the nobleness of Justice , Truth , Purity , and Love ; of the reality of a Divine Providence , and the sense of God 's presence , as of one who listens , and observes , and influences the heart , - sink down from the recesses far up , where they had hidden , and invisible things , relations , conceptional truths become more real to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the senses . That tidiQgs of death , or sudden losses , or the disclosure of disease in oneself , should give such projection to the mind , we can well understand . But how shall we account for such intense recognitions of spiritual truth and such wide prospects of things at other times hidden , or seen in detail , and disconnectedly , and so , unimpressively , when there is no exciting cause - no shock that electrifies the nerves , and arouses the mind to a state of exaltation ?

Do they come without willing , and refuse t ) come at mind harnessed from the first moment , and ready to dart off in some special direction ? Why , sometimes , is there such , a sense of the wickedness of oppression and injustice , such a conception of the facts of life - the strong consuming the weak , the skillful , the wise , the refined , only armed by their excellence With the meansof injury to their fellows ; coupled with such a grief and indignation as shakes the very soul , and makes it resound , as old castles howl to the roar of intrusive tempests ?

K these states arose from the presence of objects or events which naturally led to such reflections , or if they arose from any principle of reaction , or as the contrast and antithesis of any reverse actions , we should ascribe them to such influences . But often they defy both explanations .

They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it only a normal activity of the soul , in a higher range , for whose solution we simply lack familiar knowledge of ourselves ?

It surely seems to us that the promises of Christ , that He will dwell within us , that He will give us a Comforter , an Enlightener , might reasonably be expected to produce other and higher fruits than those which spring fronu the force /z/ ol onr own volition* And if such thoughts and sach emotions , setting always toward God , toward Justice , toward Love , full of Hope , and Trust , and Heaven , are the things of Gkxd 's Spirit , unsphering us from sensuous life , and giving us a prescience of life to come , then there is a glorious meaning in the promises of Christ . ( Thus we understand how He manifests himself to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ An tmknown friend in New Jersey has written ns a sincere request for a form of prayer suitable for a prayer-meeting . We should be glad to oblige him , if we thought such a form would be of any use . But a form is not what he needs . A form may do for a congregation , where it is understood that prayer is to comprehend only the wants that are general and common to all . But it seems to us that forms would destroy the very conception of a social meeting for prayer . What is a prayer - meeting ? It is a place for social religious life . It is not for preaching . It is not for exhortation . It is the place where Christian men excite each other , and instruct and strengthen each other , by the free and familiar development of their religious emotions . Every Chnstian brings a brand , each places it upon the altar , and the fire is the joint flame of many hearts . What would be thought of an appKcation for a form of conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doing general business on ' Change ? For a form of impassioned utterance , for the use of loving hearts ? A form of family greeting , to be used in vacations when the children come home ? But forms would be every whit as sensible in such circumstances as in a social gathering of Christians for reUgious conference . The very secret of conducting prayer-meetings , is /z/ to force people out of their conyentional ways : to to inspire a genial and devout Euniliarity ; to keep off those impertinent moths called exhorters , that &j; about the flame of rising Reeling ; to chann men into a forgetfalness , if possible , that it is a meeting , and make them talk artlessly and sensibly . qwq meeting feeling just as he does feel ; and not pretending to anything else , simply because he thinks he ought to feel something else . This pretentious mood , this artificial and clumsily hutched up feeling , overlays the mind as straw and dead leaves do the soil , that nothing can shoot up . What if men should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and disposition , but , one striving to be brilliant , another to be witty , another to be instructive ; who could endure the sham ? We need to have men willing to stand simply and only on what they are and what they have . The speaking in prayer-meetings should be conversational , and so , natural . Usually , when a man has nothing to say , he gets up and exhorts sinners to repent . Another empty soul informs the churcli that tliey are very cold , and live far beneath their privileges . When such men pray , they usually begin at Adam and go on to KevelatiAns : /z/ and then , sometimes , nnable to stop , go back and strike in about midway , and back oiH both ways , through all manner of religious platitudes . How many prayer-meetings begin a long half hour * after the time appointed ! First comes a hymn , then a chapter in the Bible , then the deacon prays , then a hynm ; and so on , a hymn and a deacon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laments that there are few men , besides those whose ordination obliges them to pray , that take part in meetings . But why are there no more ? What has been done to increase the number of praying members ? Have they been encouraged to do what they could do ? Or is the spirit of the church such , that no man prays to edification , who does not pray smoothly and ornately , or with a round , sonorous , guttural solemnity . Humble prayers , timid prayers , half-inaudible prayers , the utterances of uncultured lips , may cut a poor figure , as lecture-room literature . But are they to be scomfolly disdained ? If a child may not talk at all till it can speak fluent English , will it ever learn to speak well ? There should be a process of education going on continually , by which all the members of the church shaU be able to contribute of their experiences and gifts ; and in such a course of development , the first hesitating , stumbling , ungrammatical prayer of a confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best prayer of the most eloquent pastor . The prayer may be but little ; but it is not a little thing that a church has one man more to pray than it had before . In order to this , pastors , or whoever conducts the // prayer-meetmg statedly , should have a distinct conception of wbat a prajeivmeetiiig is to do . It is a mutual instmction class ; a place for religions feeling to develop itself through the social element ; and the conductor of the meeting is to draw out the timid , check the obtmsiYe , encourage simple and true speaking , and apply religious truths to those wants , and struggles , and experiences which are freely mentioned there . A few hints , gathered from experience , will be , perhaps , of some benefit to those who are young , and beginning to assume the duties of pastor . There is no meeting for which one needs more preparation than a prayer-meeting . But it is not a preparation of thoughts , ideas , and topics , so much as of the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the meeting with vigor and fullness of feeling , and ab-eady eager when he first sits down . The way in which a meeting opens will often determine its whole character . If the brethren are scattered through a large room , bring them closer together . Slow and long services at the beginning increase the sluggishness which too often is brought in . A short hymn , adapted to move the feelings , sung quickly - so quickly that every one has to arouse himself to keep up - wlU frequently give life to the whole scene . A church should be trained to courage . They should bo thoroughly indoctrinated not to despise the gifts of the meanest member . When there is piety in a church , and the prayer- PBAYEB-MBfiTTNGS. 145 meeting becomes the exponent of it , then it will become the most powerful and important meeting in the whole series of church meetings . A fair account , from grateful lips , of what God is doing in the hearts of a whole church , can not but be better than the ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak he ever so wisely . But if our friend still wants a form of prayer , for a prayer-meeting , we must refer him to numerous churches , where forms of prayer have prevailed for uncounted years , although they are called extemporaneous ; and , if he have some skill at stenography , he can soon supply himself with a book of forms of prayer . /z/ Wk hardly know of a more unprofitable exercise in social religious mejtings than what is called exhortation. l3oubtle88 there is a scriptural warrant for exhortation . But what is the nature of the exercise ? It is the persuasion of a man to accept or obey some view of truth . The force of it depends upon the force given to the truth . It must needs relate principally to conduct . If one desires to produce intellectual convictions , the way is not to exhort to them , but to present truths which of their own nature will convict . If one desires to enkindle feeling it is folly to exhort to it ; for feeling arises from the view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must employ the truths which have a power to do it : or he must impart it by sympathy , being himself full of emotion ; or what is better , and the true method , he must present the right truth from a soul already glowing with the feeling which it is sought to enkindle . Tlierefore , when a brother arises in a prayer and conference meeting , unmoved himself , and exliorts men to repent , without presenting powerful motives through such views of its necessity as shall incline them to it , and without any exhibition of a deeply penitential feeling in himself , he throws away his efforts , and sometimes does harm rather than good . We have heard man after man in succession arise /z/ and exhort Christian brethren with such a deadening effect that if there was a spark aKve at fst , it was quenched past all rekindling before the exhortation was done . During many a long , dry , sound , sober exhortation which has been inflicted upon long-suifering meetings , we have seen men exhorted into sleep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and there would be but a single truth that seemed to touch a genuine chord of feeling during the whole meeting , and that was the truth that it was time to close the meeting . A dull , unmeaning , religious meeting is simply an abomination . K a husband and wife should get together , once a week , and without a particle of feeling or earnestness , go through with an hour of affectionate etiquette , it would be regarded as a supreme absurdity . K business men should gather together once or twice a week in grave consideration of things which no one of them at the time cared anything about , and talk them over on this side and on that , each one forgetting at the door what he , and what his neighbor had said , men would say that they were fools . Such things are seldom or never done in things in which men are alive . But for months and months together , men will gather , without a ray of warmth , without any real earnestness , and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths that were ever addressed to the human knowledge , in such a lifeless method that not a single thought moved responsive , and not a single emotion throbbed I Let us imagine a man suffering the deepest afflio /z/ tions and pressed by trouble beyond all ordinary power of endurance standing up among a score of friends in like afflictions , and saying in a gentle voic whose tones were mellowed by the deepest emotions , " Dear friends , the hand of God is upon us . Let us not sink . Let patience have a perfect work . We must be tried . Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth . We are now in the fire , but God is with us . Let us be patient . " Every heart would yield to such an exhortation . For conscious troubles would be the i/ruth and an exhortation to patience would have a vital relation to their Kving wants . But what if , amidst great abundance , with homes , and friends , and affluence , in times of peace , and when life flowed with music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringed shrubs , a reasonably good man should commence a scriptural exhortation about patience - its virtues , it necessities , our obligations to exercise it , etc. , who would be reached ? Perhaps here and there a conscientious soul might reproach itself because it did Twt feel ; but feeling , under such unnatural circumstances , is past all conscience-invocation . Li like manner Christians are very composedly told that they are dead and good for nothing ; that they are not doing their duty . One man , with a familiar fluency evincing long practice will declare in the soberest and quietest way imaginable that he is a great sinner , and he is conscious of it , and that he feels that he ought to repent , and thinks that the brethren ought to join him in the impression . One man for the fortieth time during the year , exhorts ONE CAr8K OF DULL MEETINGS . 149 brethren to awake because the night is far spent and the day is at hand . Another thinks that Christians ought to rejoice in God , and without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty of joy , and sits down to hear another brother say the same thing over again , in another set of words , if possible more gloomy than those in which he had enunciated it . In this manner , too , we have heard men , profoundly engrossed in the world , rise up and exhort sinners to repent ; to repent before it was too late ; to repent now - it was their duty ; it was dangerous to put it oflF , etc. , but not a sign of feeling had they . No heart-heaving - no deep and disclosed sense of the hatefulness of sin , none of that softening and gushing which belong to penitence . It is worse than absurd , it is monstrous for men to mouth the most solemn facts , the most profoundly ajQfecting truths of religion , as if they were rolling marbles , or discussing some trifle to while away an hour withal . The ear of a congregation often and often has been beaten hard as a macadamized road by the weekly tramp of exhortation about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what not . Life is the characteristic of God . Life is the characteristic of Religion . Life is the characteristic of Trr th . A dull assembly , with lifeless men talking about dead topics , is a scandal upon real religion . This matter grows even worse , if possible , when one listens to the dissuasives from courses to which the persons addressed have not the remotest liability . Thus a church dead beyond all budding or blossoming , is exhorted to beware of wildfire and fanaticism ; a slow-moulded methodical brotherhood , exact as /z/ clock , are exhorted to discretion , to deliberation , and cautioned against impulses . A man of the most incorrigible literalness , whose matter-of-fact soul never had a glimpse of any quality which was not measurable by one of his senses , will descant upon the wiles of the imagination , and warn the young against fancy and fiction . A close-fisted man is in great dread of spendthrift benevolence , and thinks that Christians should always give upon principle and not on feeling . On the other hand we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be left to a heartless control of his judgment I Thus men ' impose upon themselves ; and social religious meetings degenerate into absurd formalities . If any one thinks that liturgies and set forms of worship are the only means of dullness and formality , they surely can not have been much acquainted with prayer-meetings . They can not have heard the same prayers substantially repeated by the same men , varying only in a growing glibness and dryness , for years and years ; they can not have heard the juiceless , tasetless exhortations about feelings , jfrom persons without feeling to persons without feeling ; they can not have seen the hour and a half of weekly conference run the same dreary round , beginning and ending , with intermediate consistency , without a sign of life , but with an utterly lying semblance , a pretence of caring for what they did not care for ; of renouncing what all the world knew they did not renounce ; of asking what they did not desire , and desiring what they did not dare to ask . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation is not directly and absolutely a divine gift . It is not made over by God to man as a complete thing . A perfect title to a piece of property puts a man in possession of it just as absolutely on the first day when it is given as in twenty years after . " When a man gives a flower , it is a perfect gift . But the gift of grace is rather the gift of a flower-seed . It contains within it all the elements necessary for growth , which the sun is yet to warm and develop , until it comes to blossom and fruit . When men are called effectually by the power of God 's Spirit , that is purely the office of God , and not of a human power . The calling is of God , and the forgiveness and amnesty are altogether of His free goodness . The efficacious influence of the Spirit upon the heart is God 's work , and not man 's . But when this has taken place , and men are awakened and brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just begun . There is now to be a development of a Christ-like disposition . There is to be a life within , which is to consist in a development of every part of the mind , so that the whole soul shall be reeducated by spiritual influences . There is to be also a corresponding outward life - a course of Christ-like conduct . Every man is called , and graciously aided by God , that he may take care /z/ both of the work which respects his own disposition , and the work which respects his outward . conduct . And when the Apostle says , " Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling , " it is not meant with servile or painful fear , but fear in the sense of solicitude ; fear , in distinction from presumptuous confidence . But , it is added , " for it is God that worketh in you . " Here is the inspiration of man 's liberty , and the charter of his hope . Standing in the atmosphere of the divine heart , every one finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that every man must wait till God moves him . It is a conmiand to go forward , with a reason attached . It is an encouragement , not a dissuasion . It is wrong , by the twists of perverse reasoning , to change a divine truth right about , and put its back where God put its face . Many teachers have made an anchor out of this text , which God spread for a sail , and have , in effect , cautioned people not to move till God attracted them ; as if the chief danger of men was too great alertness in matters pertaining to religion . When God , calls men to awake , it is implied that the morning has come . When God says , Plant , it is implied that soil , air , and summer are prepared ; and he speaks to April , not to January ! And when God says , Work , it is implied that there are all those conditions of providence and divine overshadowing which make it worth a man 's while to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be God that is to work within me ? " Well , if a father , going out into his garden where his child is at work among /z/ the flower-beds , sliould say to him , " Now my son work with a will , I will help you and work with you , " what would be thought if the child should suddenly look up and say , " But if you are going to work , how can I work ? " Is there anything incongruous or paradoxical in the idea that , though God worketh in us , we also are to work out our own salvation ? It is not said that God performs the work , but that he influences us to perform it . It is not , that God works/br , but w , us 1 The work of the Spirit is not to supersede , but to help our faculties . It is akin to parental training , to education , to the action and influence of one mind upon another . Not that God 's mind acts upon ours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no warrant for saying this . But the illustration is sufficient to show , . that one mind may stimulate another to action without destroying its libei'ty . The young artist , while he sits under Kaphael , or Michael Angelo , or Correggio , does not expect to have his work done by his master . He goes to witness and to catch his master 's enthusiasm , that his own eye may be fired and his own hand guided . We bring up our children by the action of our minds upon theirs . Our influence over the child does not take away anything from the child 's power , but on the contrary adds to it . And so , God says to us , " Work out your own salvation , for I am working in you . " It is like a father saying to his children , " Here am I working among you , adding my experience , my wisdom , and my power to yours ; therefore be hopeful and courageous , and enter with zeal upon youi /z/ work . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waiting and faltering . It is an argument to begin now , and not to delay , with the vain thought that God will finally do all the work and leave us nothing to do . If it be asked how shall we distinguish divine influence from natural , the reply is , We can not always do it . There is no intimation in the New Testament that anybody can tell . If a husbandman wishes to know whether he is under the influence of right farming , he must go and look at his harvests . If , therefore , a man says , " How can I tell whether this feeling is of God or of Satan ? " he can not tell by the feeling , but by its results . It is the same act that plants good or bad seed . It is the same string and bow , whether a scraping beginner or a Paganini play . The music evolved must determine whether a master or a bungler touches the violin . The human faculties , whether acted upon by sinister spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act within the lines and limits of their own laws and nature . And it is not any difference in sensation or consciousness which can distinguish divine influence from any other . " We must abide by Christ 's rule of estimate , " By their fruit shall ye know them . " Is the fruit good , is there enough of it , is it continuous ? It is very certain that a disposition of deep benevolence , a heart of unfeigned love , will lead a man in the right direction , and he need not spend one anxious thought lest the devil should have inspired him with such influence . /z/ On the other hand , conceited and presumptuous men are found , who , assuming that they are under the divine influence and guidance , follow out their own selfish and fleshly lusts , and attribute it all to God . But no man can have any evidence that he is moved by the Spirit of God , except so far as the fruit is divine . There is nothing in mere consciousness , nothing in sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any degree or kind of exhilaration , nothing in the pleasurableness or other quality of the feeling . The moral quality of the life determines whether one is a child of God , or of the Devil . What , then , is the use of the truth of God 's Spirit , if you can not discern its presence or action ? It is good for general hopefulness . It gives men courage to know that they are divinely helped , though they may not perceive the special acts . It is an exorcism to fear and superstition . For it exhibits the world , as illumined and overcome by the gracious presence of God working both in Providence and in grace , and throwing around all who will do well an atmosphere of protection and genial incitement , in which they shall thrive and bring forth abundant fruit . /z/ In a true Christian 's devout aspirations , it is not from instruction or habit , but from spontaneous impulse that he exclaims " Our Father ! " His thoughts go out after God . His heart yearns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his abiding presence . He comes with a truly filial spirit before God , and it is perfectly easy and natural for him to say " Our Father . " And he has a right to say it . He is the child of God , and he knows it ; for " the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirits that we are the children of God . " Being the child of his Father , and away from his Father 's house , he yearns for it , and at times is homesick - as children that are kept at school away from their parents long for the day of vacation , that they may go home ; and these yearnings are the testimony of the Spirit that we are the children of God . The man who has these feelings , and has them habitually , need not hesitate to call himself a child of God , or to address God as " Our Father . " There are some Christians who always seem to have entire and unwavering faith in God as their Father . Tliey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that whatever may be the happenings of Providence , everything will be for the best , and that they will be taken care of , and never left alone . /z/ They are confident in him , and seem never for a moment to doubt . Their cup always runs over , because they always think it runs over . But , on the other hand , there are others who , while they are blessed abundantly , never see or think that they are blessed at all . And this class comprises the multitude of men . They call God " Our Father , " only because the Lord 's Prayer begins so , and not because their own prayer naturally and spontaneously confesses that they are his children , and that he is their Father . They have doubts and glooms . They have fightings without , and fears within . They allow small things to perplex them , and great things to overwhelm them . They distrust Gtod - not intentionally , but really . They doubt his providence , though they would hardly believe that they doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and excuse themselves for it by saying that they are constitutionally melancholy ; whereas , the fault is nothing more nor less than a practical want of faith . It is an unconscious skepticism of God . Men theoretically extol their faith , but practically deny it . They give way before every ti'ouble , instead of conquering it ; and in every dark hour flee for refuge , not to God , but to themselves . Now all Christians , whether hopeful or despondent , are sometimes like the disciples on the Sea of Galilee - driven hither and thither by contrary winds . They toU. all the night upon the deep , casting their nets , but taking nothing . Nay , oftentimes , their sea is without a Christ walking upon the water , and their Bhip without a Christ even asleep . Yet when they desire his coming upon the sea , and cry out to him , /z/ they soon see him walking to them over the waves . When they desire his awakening in the ship , they soon see him rising to rebnke. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " until there is a great calm . God hides his face only to disclose it again ; and his hidings are oftentimes as full of mercy as his manifested presence . But whether to their feeble-sighted eyes he is present or absent , they may always know that " He is not far from them at any time . " When there are clouds so that they can not see him , they may look at him through faith , and discern that he is not far off . And as they that go down upon the deep , and are overmastered by storms in the darkness of the night , knowing not on what strange shores they may be thrown , cast anchor and wait for day , so in the midst of trial and temptation , when the storm is fierce and the night is dark , when the lights are quenched and the signals gone , they may at least cast anchor ; and if they wait in faith and hope for the day , it will surely dawn . The darkness will always hide itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night so long that the day did not overtake it . There never was a morning without its morning star . There never was a day without its sun . God can reveal himself to his own people as he does not to the world . He can give to every Christian heart , to the timid as well as to the strong , to the sorrowing as well as to the hopeful , those divine intimations , those precious thoughts , those sweet-breathed feelings , which are evidence that there is summer m the soul . He can inspire the heart with that perfect love which casteth out fear . He can take away all /z/ doubts and misglvingSj all gloomy misappreliensions , all dreary forebodings of the future . He can make sunshine out of shadow , and day out of midnight . When our fears have been like growing thorns in our side , he can pluck away the thorns , and heal the wounds ; and he can turn every spear which has pierced us into a rod and staif , which , instead of wounding shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast us down may be made to hold us up . He can so deal with us as to make every yoke easy , and every burden light ; so that the heavy-laden may come to him to be relieved of their loads . He can touch the fountains of our sorrow , and make our tears like gems and crystals , more precious than pearls or diamonds . Our tears are oftentimes among his most precious treasures . The things that we call treasures , he counts as of very little worth . The human soul is his treasury , out of which he coins unspeakable riches . Thoughts and feelings , desires and yearnings , faith and hope - these are the most precious things which God finds in us . He can do all things for us , whatsoever we need , and more than we need . We are too slow to believe in his generosity . We do not often enough think that as he has infinite desires to help us , so also he has infinite powers . He is able to carry out all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like man . Our means are limited . With us , wishing to possess is far from possessing ; wishing to do is far from doing ; but with him , the wish and the power are one . His desires are fully equalled by his means. - He is " able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can /z/ ask or think . " Things that are great to us are small to him . The favors that we ask of him seem to ns to be large and royal ; yet to him they are very little things . The gifts he has power to bestow are not only greater than we ever ask , but ever can ask , or even think . He is always willing to give special grace for special entfergency . K men are suddenly brought into trouble , He is " a very present help in time of need . " When rich men , by some unexpected reverse of fortune , are made poor , he can sustain them under their burdens , when without him they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when families are broken and scattered by death , when the mother loses her child , and weeps because the cradle is no longer to S rocked , and the sweet laugh is hushed in the house , God can give " the oil of joy for mourning . " Whenever his childi'en suffer disappointment , when clouds cast shadows over their path , when troubles brood heavily before them , when they are in trials of business or in greater trials of bereavement , he can take off the heavy weights . He can make the rough places smooth , and the crooked ways straight . When sorrow comes that seems to forbid all consolation , he can gently wipe away the tears , and bring back joy and hope once more . He is a physician who only waits to be called ; he is a friend who longs to be trusted ; he is a helper who only wants us to ask his aid . But he wants us to ask him heartily and truthfully . He wishes us to reach up our hand , and take covenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our care upon him , for he careth for us . He commands us to confide entirely in him . He wants us to havno hesitancy in our faith . And this is reasonable . It is what men ask every day of their own children . A father expects his child to confide in him , A child expects to trust freely in his father . And we ought'to goto God , being his children , with less distrust and more confidence . We ought to take him at his word , and to have faith in his promises . K he has said , " I will never leave thee nor forsake thee , " we ought boldly to say , " The Lord is my helper ; I will not fear what man shall do unto me . " But when we borrow trouble , and look forward into the future to see what storms are coming , and distress ourselves before they come as to how we shall avert them if they ever do come , we lose our proper trustfulness in God . When we torment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have already parted with that perfect love which casteth out fear . Mothers sometimes fret themselves , and are made miserable about the future career of their children - whether they will turn out drunkards gr not , whether they will go to the gallows or not , whether they will be a disgrace to their parentage or not . Now all this is simply an evidence of a lack of faith . There are majiy persons in good health , with all their faculties in active exercise , who , having nothing else to worry about , rob themselves of sleep at night by thinking , " if they should suddenly be taken away , what would become of their familiea /z/ and who would take care of their children ? " Such distrust of God is dishonorable to Christian men ; and it is only because of his exceeding patience - which is the most wonderful attribute of the divine nature - that he does not signally rebuke and punish it whenever it is manifested . When persons are taken sick , they ought to bear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten , even among Christian men , repine and murmur . When they are visited with any trouble , their first thought is apt to be , " How grievously I am afflicted I " though the nobler thought would be , " How graciously I am sustained ! " When a cross is laid upon them , they cry out , " What a burden I have to carry ! " whereas they might better say , " What a burden Christ carries for me ! " A Christian sailor , who lost one of his legs in the battle of Trafalgar , said that he could very often measure the faith of the people who conversed with him by the way in which they alluded to his misfortune . Nine out of every ten would exclaim , " What a pity that you lost your leg ! " and only one in ten , " What a blessing that the other was preserved ! " When God comes into the family and takes away one child , instead of complaining because he has taken one , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or he may crush a man 's business , and strip him of all his worldly wealth , and yet leave untouched and uninvaded what is dearer than all - the cradle of his only child . Would it not be nobler for such a man to be thankful for what God left than to murmur for what he took away ? " The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away , " but /z/ he always gives more than he takes away . If God robs a man of his riches , he leaves him his health , which is better than riches . If he taken health he leaves wealth . K he takes both , he leaves friends . And if he takes all these - liouse and home , and worldly goods - God 's providence is not yet exhausted , and he can make blessings out of other things which remain . He never strips a man entirely bare .

" /z/ Who that goes into the garden to-day would ever dream that summer had been there ? In midsummer , what covering of the earth , what abundance of leaves , what fragrance of blossoms , what tangled masses of pendulous vines 1 All is growth , luxuriance , eveMprouting varieties-the passing away of short-lived things covered by the fresh growth of new kinds I A sound comes from the north 1 It is the voice of Winter 1 In one night his nimble legions come , and the sickling frost cuts down summer to the ground . In a few weeks decay is over ; freezing succeeds frost , and summer is wiped away , with all its colors , it sights , its sounds ; and sad winds mourn over the play grounds of flowers 1 When , in winter , we remember the summer , its glories seem like a dream ; it is no longer a fact , but a thing imagined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and drive all men from the fields , and the house is populous , the family is gathered , and the night , having grown long by robbing the day at both ends , morning and evening , of many hours , the household cheer themselves with industry and study . And at evening , all gather to /z/ their various tasks - the father to his books , the mother to her children 's treasures , the elder children to their school tasks , while the rosy child , with curled pate , climbs the . nurse 's knee - and she drones to him the long story , hundred-times told , and yet falling fresh as new upon the story-grdy ears of childhood 1 He laughs , he weeps - he sighs , he shudders - he glows and expands , or shrinks and cowers , till the tale is done - then sitting for a while upon the stool by the mother 's foot , the child grows abstracted , gazing into the pictured embers , seeing all manner of fantastic figures and changing forms upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes , till the eye sinks and the head nods , and the drooping little sleeper is borne off safe to bed . In the morning , he wakes and hungers . The night is forgotten . A vague remembrance rests with him of the sweet excitement of the night . But the day clears off these " fancies ; they grow more and more dim ; they lie in the mind as films of spider-web float with long thread glistening in the summerair . And thus , saith the Psalmist , we spend our days I As a tale that is told ! Tears , with all their vast variety of incident , are remembered vaguely - they are thin and dreamy 1 The present glows and even burns with intensity . But it is quenched when a few days are past ! Days come in with form , and sound , and motion like the coming in of crested waves . Like them , they break upon the shore of the present ; they cover it with a million evanescent gems ; they dissolve and flow out in undertow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - while new days , like new waves , foam , sparkle and break , as did they I One by one come to us days and years . Coming , they have individuality I But receding from us they lose all separateness , and the past is one indistinguishable whole . Who can analyze and separate the years of his childhood ? From birth till one is four or five , the unripe brain receives few impressions that last . It is all blank . As in a printed book , at either end , are bound up many blank leaves , without print or writing on them , so is human life , at either end , begun and ended with blank years , preserving no record - leaving no mark ! But , then come the youthful days - fuU of romp , of hunger , of growth , of childish exhilaration ! How do they seem to you now ? Are they separable ? Can you thread them , and paint them by memory ? Only one or two things peculiary significant remain . The days are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; , and you think back upon twenty years as if they were but a hand-breadth ! It is as with a landscape to a traveller . Having journeyed all day , at evening reaching some high hill , he sits down to trace his path . The grass at his feet is plain enough , and the ants that run express up and down every stalk have brisk distinctness . The near bushes and the trees are so plain that the boughs , and separate leaves , stand out in their individual forms . But , as the view recedes , gradually he loses all these ; and a little farther off , leaves lie upon leaves , grass is matted upon grass , and is no longer /z/ form , but only color . Yet farther , and trees begin to fade ; tree stands np upon tree , and at length whole forests are to the eye but faint clouds , with not one distinct line , and hills are rubbed out , and all the inequalities of the way , which the complaining foot felt in travelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there a single peak or mountain remains clear and individual against the all-bounding sky ! Thus is it in life . Our nearer hours report themselves ; a little farther , and days only , not hours , are discerned ; then days lapse , and weeks or months are like long aerial distances , in one line , whose continuity is measured by no prominent object . At length , years only can be seen , and not even these finally . For , aasaUors leavmg the harbor cany with them for a long time the sight of shore , but sailing still , lose first the low water-lines , but cling by the eye to the higher masses , which in time , in tiie ever sailing , fade and sink , leaving nothing but some height lifted far up like Teneriffe , which , after the night is passed , is all gone , hidden by the bend of the earth 's surface 1 - so , even high-topped years at length are shut down from our memory by the bend of the vast cycles of Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives as a tale that is told ! Come , go back with me . Who were the members of your father 's family 1 Besides your brothers and sisters , who dwelt there ? Who visited ? Who came and went ? Who were the neighbors ? These things were vivid realities to you when a child . What are they now ? Mere marks . As a landscape artist plants in the foreground /z/ figures with limbs and features clear , but in the faroff distance , when he would paint a figure , taking his brush and spots down a mere dash - sl formless colormark ; so to us are the living things of the neighborhood . Some , to be sure , stand up and remain ! But a million are forgotten where one remains . Who went with you to the village school ? Call the roll 1 Who were the successive teachers - Popes of the ferule 1 Who were the girls ? Who the boys ? Thetiy when the uproarious school broke forth in tumult at dismissal , if I had asked you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up ! Who sat by you on tie right ? who on the left ? Who were in the first class ? who in the second ? These were important things then . Wlio was whipped ? and who was never once struck ? These , to you were then more important than the roar of European revolution , the burning of Moscow , the battle of Waterloo ; but what do you remember of them ? Some memories are more tenacious than others . A few will reproduce much ; more , some ; most , but little if any I How much can you recall from the church ? Who went with you ? Who sat about you ? Who were the old men ? Who were in their prime ? And who , like yourself , were young ? And if these living and throbbing realities are faded out , it will be useless for me to ask you after the sermons . They were gone before they were finished . They fell upon your dissolving ear as flakes of snow upon water , and were gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you recall from the green grave- /z/ yard ?

But , let us change the method , and try the truth of this description in another way . Call up the unwritten dreams and reveries of the past ! They have filled years in ail . You have woven fabrics of every pattern in the loom of fancy . You have reared up castles , peopled them with heroes ; you have lost and found treasures ; travelled and explored , fought and conquered , loved and won , all in airy fantasies ; and thus worn out the watchful night , or wiled pain from consciousness in the weary sickness . Is that part of your life gone ? All gone 1 Birds gathered for flight in autumn , rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , often chance in their course to cast a feather , from the wing which carries them through the air - brilliant in color , and curved like a bow - which , wavering , and swaying , falls into some thicket , while they flock on . And when , the seasons changing , they are recalled , and fly now northward over the same ranges , they reach the spot where dropped the spent feather , can they see it , or find it any more ? It is lost and hidden forever ! And so our youthful fancies , which carried us far above human life and reality , are fallen , and like the downiest feather from the wing , are lost and forgotten 1 If a tale that is /z/ told fades , how much rather those untold traceries of thought and subtilest evolutions of inarticulate fancy ! Where are the admirations which set the mind all a-sparkle ? Where is the record of the wonders , the surprises , the ten thousand excitements which broke the level of life , and brought interjections to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not strange . But where are the salient experiences of life , the events which beat upon the attention like a drum , or roused up your paasions Uke a trumpet ? Only a few of all the myriads remain ! As one who goes forth from a populous town , often looking back , sees it shrinking and growing smaller , houses fading , and the complexity of streets and buildings growing to a mere spot , and at length , only beholds here and there a long spire against the sky , or single tower , all the rest confused and hidden ; so , in the past , but one or two high-reaching experiences remain , while all the diverse and populous experiences besides are covered down and forgotten 1 Your years of the past have been built of the same materials as go now to build your days . What rising and falling emotions , what flow of endless thought , what perpetual succession of events , which arrest the attention and occupy the feelings , what endeavors , what successes , what failures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each so important as to seem to leave indelible marks upon the memory ! Yet , though there have been ten millions of these , and though they were of strength sufficient to hold you in their thrall , and excite you with pleasure , or agitate you with alarm , or afflict you with grief , sweeping the /z/ soul as wind sweeps the sea , and raising as many tumultuous feelings as the sea hath waves ; yet , now the smooth memory has shed them all I The trees will sooner remember all the successive leaves whose bosoms prepared the food for the growth of the wood , than you will recall the innumerable experiences - of the past which have formed and fashioned you to the shape which you wear ! The burdens which you could not carry for their weight are forgotten , the sorrows that pierced you to the heart have left scarcely thqir name ; the troubles that blocked your way , the dangers that shook your courage , and all those things which in their time wrung from you cries and prayers for relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-lived , but mostly forgotten . Love , alone , stands with an undiminished memory 1 What we have once really loved we never forget I The friendship of youth , the warm and generous confidences of true affection , the tender worship of a true heart , are immutable ! All other feelings write their memories upon glass with crayons - Love writes upon crystal with a diamond . For , of all the heart 's powers , this alone is sovereign . And , being sovereign , God has crowned it with immortality , and given to Memory charge to keep unwasted all its experiences ! And Memory , that is tenacious of nothing else , lets nothing slip of the experiences of true loving . Another year has passed ! Its months and its weeks abeady are bmied . Only days and hours remain . These are passing . One more sunrise only /z/ hath this year I The next morning shall shine upon the face of a new year !

Farewell to the babe that was ours , and is God 's , and therefore more than ever ours , though beyond the reach of ou5-arms 1 But , the heart tends it yet , and cradles it more vigilantly than ever ! Farewell to our Christian brethren , who have heard the trumpet before us , and gone forward ! Year ! thy march is ending ! Thy work is done ! Pass ! Disappear ! " We shall see thee no more , until re-ascending , we shall behold thy record in the All-judging Day 1 /z/ It is a fact somewhat remarkable that most of the conversions narrated in the Bibje were rapid and in some instances instantaneous . Paul , on his way to Damascus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of God . He saw a great light at mid-day , and heard a voice saying , " Saul , Saul , why persecutcst thou me ? " and he was so suddenly and overwhelmingly impressed by this manifestation that he could do nothing but yield to the power of God ; so that from being a persecutor of the Church , he was at that moment changed to be its chiefest apostle . Matthew , the publican , sitting at the receipt of custom , was met by Christ , who said to him , " Follow thou me , " and it is said that " he arose and followed him . " The conversion of the thief on the cross , during the very last moments of his life , attlie eleventh hour of hope , was almost marvellously sudden , yet not on that account doubtful ; for Christ confirmed it by saying , " Tliis day shalt thou be with me in Paradise . " And there are similar instances at the present day . Sudden and unexpected conversions are not unknown to any Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however some may affect to ridicule it . A conversion which takes no longer time to begin and end , than the sun to rise from day-break /z/ to the mountain-top , may be just as undoubted as though it had been the work of a month or a year . The impression that a spiritual change , in order to be genuine , must be a long and gradual process , dragging itself through weary weeks and months , during which the mind is to pass through much anguish and tribulation , until finally the light shall arise and shine , is simply foolish . Time adds nothing to the thoroughness of conversion , nor suffering to the evidence of it . In many cases much time is taken , and much suffering felt , but neither of these is to be considered as an absolutely necessary part of it . Yet there are many persons whose conversion is a long and severe struggle , during which they alternate week after week , and month after month , between hope and fear , who , were it not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to do and to be done with , might go up the mountain almost without going through the valley . Such instances have occurred among the most eminent Christians . It is known that John Bunyan went through awful terrors , as a consequence of a long-continued exercise of mind , before he found religious peace ; and his experiences are embalmed in some of the best writing in the English language . But it is our impression that the conversion of Bunyan might just as well have been a work of days as of montlis . John Wesley also went well-nigh three years before he found what he sought . This was a period of great effort , of continued urging up to duty , of watchfulness and carefulness , involving almost unutterable trouble of mind . He finally went among the Mora- /z/ yians and there reached those Wews which finally gave him quiet in Jesus Christ . Tliere are not only single instances like these , but multitudes of others - of persons who have for years been bound , as it were , by some invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The difficulty in many cases results from an erroneous apprehension of what is to be taken as evidence of conversion . Men make a common mistake between what is a religious life , and certain expected fruits of a religious life , and confound the two things . Now , to be a Christian is to obey Christ , no matter how you feel ; but many persons think that after this obedience is rendered , there will bo plunged into their souls wliat is called a Christian experience ; and that this experience , coming afterwards , is piety . They therefore attempt to conform to the love of Christ , and then wait for a projected or interjected experience which is supposed to be a religious state . It is no doubt better to have the feeling tliat follows , than to be without it ; but the feeling itself is not to be taken for that of which it is simply the fruit , and if there is no feeling , it is not to be taken as evidence that there is no real religious life . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet of music before him , and touching the keys that correspond to the notes that he reads , it is certainly better to be able to hear the sounds that follow . But Beethoven - one of the saddest instances in history of Imman greatness and suffering - becoming deaf in the latter part of his life , used to sit down to the harpsichord , and play tunes of which he heard not a /z/ single note . Even though his instrument fell into all manner of jangling discords , by becoming long out of tune , yet he still played upon it all tLose grand , swelling harmonies which were tumultuous in his soul . Now if Beethoven had waited till his ear could have become conscious of the playing , he would not have played at all . And it is the same , with persons who try to live a religious life . There are two things which they must avoid confounding . They should mark the difference between following Christ , and the sensations which come in consequence of following him . If a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so by sitting down and waiting for a certain preconceived state of mind to come to him , as he might wait for a pair of wings to sprout out of his shoulders , he must not be surprised if he is disappointed . But many earnestminded persons - who are near the kingdom of heaven , and desire to enter it - hinder themselves by just such difficulties . They deny to their own minds the evidence of their own conversion , simply because they do not experience the feelings which oilwr persons are known to have experienced . They are nearer than they think to their Father 's house , yet not believing that they are near , they do not go in . Being so close to the gate that if they were close ? they must certainly enter , they yet sit down and tarry without - mourning all the while that they can not se their Father 's face . Such a mistake is one of the saddest that can happen a man 's life , and should be guarded against by more careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to some remarks in The NefO ) York Examiner a Baptist religious journal , in which we are called to account for certain words said to have been uttered by us in a recent lecture in Boston , and also for giving the lecture at all in the " Fraternity Course . " Although several other religious journals , as I am informed , have commented upon the same topics , I select The Examiner s editorial for reply , for two reasons : - first , because I have not seen the others ; and secondly and especially , because its tone is in the main kind . And we desire to say , that if all papers were as fair and frank as The Examiner there would be more pleasure in the public interchange of views than is usually the case . And we beg the editors to understand the earnestness of our reply as applying more to the subject than to them . " Mr. Beecher is not to be held accountable for a newspaper report of his words - unless , having knowledge that certain words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . Tke Boston Journal quoted him as saying to the Fraternity , that * every selfish Aian believes in total depravity , ' and added , that the remark was loudly cheered . Now , every man who has discretion enough to speak in public at all , is bound to consider , not only whether a given sentiment is trae , but whether it is true in the sense in which it will inevitably be understood by his audience . There are objections to the phrase * total depravity . ' In the sense which would , perhaps , be most obvi-/z/ " total depravity. " 179 008 to ordinary minds ; in that sense , certainly , which Unitarians have diligently labored to associate with the words , they convey a falsehood . There is no wrong in discountenancing their use , for the purpose of substituting a phraseology less liable to misrepresentation . But that is a distinction which not one in a hundred of those who applauded Mr. Beecher would ever think of making . If he did say what is attributed to him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human nature , without which there can be no logical or reasonable necessity for a supernatural redemption . If he has been falsely reported , we should be happy to know it . " We admit in many cases that a man is to be considered as accepting words attributed to bim if , when widely published , and brought to his notice , he permits them to stand imcontradicted . But it is plain that this must not be formed into a rule , and that much must be left to the discretion of the persons concerned . If there are a thousand little things trumped up for the sake of provoking an answer ; if men lie in wait , and watch how they may catch a speaker , strewing words and speeches along the way of controversy , as corn is strewn toward traps - is a man to run into the snare ? Life would be a perpetual flea-hunt , if one were obliged to run down all the innuendoes , the inveracities , the insinuations , and the suspicions which the style of modem honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even where there is no unkindness meant , and when no meanness employs religion as a cloak , and even where words or opinions are attributed to a man which have some importance , it is a serious question whether he is alwa/ya obliged to contradict , and whe- 180 " totai . DEPKAvmr. " ther lie may not be allowed to employ Lis own discretion in denying some without implying any responsibility for all which he does not choose to deny . Since we have been called before the public , we must be allowed to say , frankly , that it would be utterly impossible for us to look after all the erroneous reports and the inaccurate statements which are continually made in our behalf . Hundreds of reports made for " substance of doctrine " by reporters not versed in religious literature , of sermons reported by letter-writers , and not a few more formal collections of sayings , and descriptions of things done or said , are sent abroad . Is a man obliged to put everything right in all these ? Is he to be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by letter-writers , unless he every week comes before the public with formal disclaimer and reiterated explanation ? K we did so , then , next , the very papers which require it would be the first to blame us for conceit in keeping before the public endless personal explanations ! But there is another side to this question . Have editors , religious and honorable men , a right to aid in the circulation of uncorrected statements , and hastily reported addresses , when they above all men know how seldom rapid speakers are correctly reported , and when , moreover , they have the means of inquiring at head-quarters as to the accuracy of any report ? How long would it take to cut out a paragraph , inclose it to the person represented as uttering it , and say , " Is this correct ? " - " Do you " total depbavitt. " 181 hold yourself responsible for this ? " If it is not worth this trouble , then it is not worth inserting in the paper . But again and again , the most serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editors almost passed my door daily in going to their office . But , while they reconciled it to their honor to give injurious reports a very wide currency , they did not deem it their duty to take the least pains to ascertain the truth of the statements ! But we have become so used to seeing misstatements and misconceptions that we scarcely lift our eyebrows any more at the most astounding things . Indeed we kill them by silence ; having found that they thrive more vigorously by the notice of a denial . There was a story started some years ago that we began a sermon by the startling impropriety of the sentence , " It is damned hot . " We took the pains to give this the most unequivocal contradiction , declaring it to be a lie out of the whole cloth , without the vestige or shadow of foundation of any kind whatsoever . But , since this denial , the story not only goes a good deal better than before , but more and more persons are , every month , reported to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present cmd hea/rd the speech . Of course , such persons do all , without exception , tell a willful falsehood ; but we dare not say so publicly , for fear that they will fall into spasms of affidavits , and convert their guilt into permanent form , past all repentance . Now we beg to have it understood , hereafter , that all reports which represent us as saying wliat we 184 " total dkpravitt. ' ' is totally depraved . Ko man who uses the phrase believes . men to be totally wicked - i. e.j so wicked that tliey can not be more wicked . If they can be more wicked , then they were not totally wicked before . And , just as The Exaravaer does , so do all sensible men . They do not use the term . They regard it as infelicitous . And yet , when any one handles it roughly they are full of anxiety for the truth 1 This word is an interloper . It is not to be found in the Scriptures . We do not believe that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Faith of Protestant or Catholic Christendom . We do not feel called upon to give the mischievous phrase any respect . We do not believe in it , nor in the thing which it obviously signifies . It is an unscriptural , monstrous , and unredeemable lie . 3 . But , on the other hand , we do believe , with continual sorrow of heart and daily overflowing evidence , in the deep sinfulness of universal man . And we believe in the exceeding sinfulness of sin . We do not believe that any man is born who is sinless , or who becomes perfectly sinless until death . We believa that there is not one faculty of the human soul that does not work evil , and so repeatedly , that , the whole human character is sinful before God . We believe man 's sinfulness to be such that every man that ever lived needed God 's forbearance and free forgiveness . We believe that no man lives who does not need to repent of sin , to turn from it ; and we believe that turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so closely the very springs of being , that " total DEPEAvrrr. " 185 no man will ever change except by the help of God . And we believe that such help is the direct a ; nd personal out-reaching of God 's Spirit upon the human soul ; and when , by such divine help , men begin to live a spiritual life , we believe the change to have been so great that it is fitly called a beginning of life over again , a new creation , a new birth . If there is one thing that we believe above all others , upon proof from consciousness and proof from observation and experience , it is the sinfulness of man . Nor do we believe that any man ever doubted our belief who sat for two months under our preaching . Nothing strikes us as so peculiarly absurd as a charge or fear that we do not adequately believe in men 's sinfulness . The steady bearing of our preaching on this subject is such as to plough up soil and subsoil , and to convict and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But our belief of this sad truth is purely practical . We have no sympathy with those theologians who use Time as a grand alley , and roll back their speculations six tliousand years , knocking down and setting up the race , in the various chances of this gigantic theologic game - what is the origin and nature of sin ? Poor Adaml To have lost Paradise was enough . But to be a shadow endlessly pursued through all time by furious and fighting theologies - this is a punishment never threatened . Or , was the flaming sword of the angel a mere type and symbol of theological zeal , standing between men and Paradise for evermore ! We take men as we find them . We do not go back to Adam or the fall to find materials for 186 " total dkprayitt/ ' theories and philosophies . There is the human heart right before my eyes , every day throbbing , throbbing , throbbing ! Sin is not a speculation , but a reality . It is not an idea , a speculative truth , but an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human heart with continual mischiefs . Its nature will neyer be found in the Past . It mi.st be sought in the Present /z/ We now print the entire first part of the article from the NefO ) York Exarm/aer the last part of which it was more convenient to dispose of first : THE * fraternity ' AND MR . BEECHER . " In the congregation administered to by Theodore Parker , at the Music Hall in Boston , known as the * Twenty-eighth Congregational Society , ' there is a literary association styled the * Fraternity . ' Said Fraternity has got up a series of * Fraternity Lectures , ' an avowed object of which , if a newspaper announcement may be credited , was to gire to the ' ideas ' of Mr. Parker a freer scope than the Lyceum platform allows . But whether that was the purpose or not , it is manifest that the effect would be , so far as any impression was made on the public , to give increased popularity to the man and his ' church . ' If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most successful course of the season , ' they will reflect a certain lustre upon the * Twenty-eighth Congregational Society , ' and upon the man whose infidelity is its pervading spirit . Such an effect , we should suppose , would be deprecated - at least , would not be even constructively aided - by a sincere friend of evangelical religion . But the pastor of the Plymouth church in Brooklyn has appeared upon Mr. Parker 's platform , to lend to it his popularity . Mr. Beecher has asserted his right to do in all things what is right in his own eyes , and we are not disposed , even if we were able , to abridge his liberty . But it is utterly incomprehensible by us , how he reconciles with his love for the Gospel such open aid and comfort to its bitterest enemies . To appear with Mr. Parker , contemporaneously or successively , upon a platform which represents neither him nor his * ideas , ' is one thing ; to assist in giving hclaJt to an infidel enterprise is a very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every purchaser of a Fraternity ticket has done . " /z/ // Of course we believe in newspapers , and in editors . Yet , even an editor may be mistaken and a newspaper may fall into misstatements ! And the Examiner has in this instance been misled by a too confiding trust in religious or secular newspapers . It is true that the Fraternity Course was under the supervision of members of the Twenty-eighth Congregational Society of Boston , but it is not true that it was got up for the sake of giving Mr. Parker 's " ideas ' a freer scope than the Lyceum platform allows " - if by ideas the Exammer means Mr. Parker 's cliaractcristic religious views . On the contrary , it is known that Mr. Parker was preparing four historical discourses , on Washington , John Adams , Jefferson , and ( we believe ) Franklin . But such was the ill odor in Boston of Mr. Parker 's religious notions that a studious care had been exercised to keep him from Boston lecture platforms , though history , art , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was good in him should " reflect a lustre " upon that part of him which religious men so much deprecate . But , on the other hand , the attempt to suppress a man , and to silence his speech , on the great topics which are common to men of aU religious views , must produce , not only among his personal frionds , but among honorable men who utterly dift'er from him in religion , a determination that he shall hae a chance to speaks at least ; and then , if people do not wish to hear an " infidel , " on secular topics , of course they can stay at home . In other respects , this Lecture Course was like ordinary courses . It was not /z/ neld in Mr. Parker 's church , nor on his platform - though it would have been no worse if it had been - but in the Tremont Temple - a Baptist worshippingplace , where the Mercantile Library Association and other principal lecture courses are held . The only respect in which it was peculiar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course , upon Washington , John Adams , Jefferson , and Benjamin Franklin . Besides him , the other lecturers , six or eight in number , were those gentlemen whose names dignify and enrich the roP of all principal lecturecourses in the Union . The funds , over and above the expenses , if there should be any , were not designed to support either Mr. Parker or the Twenty-eighth Congregational society , of which he is the minister . They were to be employed in charitable purposes , and for the most part among the poor and unfriended 1 ( And if the young men of the Twenty-eighth Con. gregational Society of Boston judged that we were one who would be glad to cooperate with Theodore Parker , in all honorable ways which did not imply approbation of hij theology , for objects common to all good men ; and if they judged that we should be forward to aid all measures , among all sects , which have for their object the improvement of the young , and the relief of the suffering , they judged rightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men whose opinions , when delivered , we do not believe 1 Did the Examiner think that the young gentlemen of Mr. Parker 's society got up a course of popular lectures for the sake of covertly propagating infidel- // itj , and inyited me , without disclosmg the inward scheme , to garnish the course , and to lend my influence , blindfolded , to such an aim ? Or , did it never enter the head of the Examiner that a man might associate with men from whose theological tenets he utterly dissented , because he sympathized with the special benevolence which they would perform t because he had an ethical sympathy with them in spite of their theology ? because he believed that a good man ought always to seek occasions of working with men , rather than of working away from them ? We should be sorry to suppose ourselves singular in this matter . Are we to take the ground that no orthodox man shall encourage the young to selfimprovement and to works of benevolence , unless they are sound in the faith ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his charge , are we to hold off and refuse to help them when they endeavor to live a great deal better than we should suppose their theology would incline them to ? But this is the very case in hand . The young men in Mr. Parker 's society undertook to do good by a course of general lectures ; we lectured in that course ; good papers are full of grief ; and the Examiner regards it as " utterly incomprehensible . " We must be still more incomprehensible then , when we say , that though we would earnestly desire men to believe aright in religion , yet , if they will not , then we hope tliat their life will be better than their creed .

But the JExaminer thinks that the success of this course of lectures will " reflect a certain lustre upon the Twenty-eighth Congregational Society , and upon the man whose infidelity is its pervading spirit . " Well , what then ? Are we to punish an infidel for his infidelity by refusing him all credit for personal goodness , for active benevolence , for practical humanity ? If anybody does right he ought to be applauded . If Mr. Parker does well he deserves the credit for well-doing . If the young men of his charge do well , they deserve all the " lustre " of it .

If a man would establish and endow a hospital , must I refuse to co-work with him because , being a Unitarian , its success would reflect a certain lustre upon that faith ? When , in the pestilence in New Orleans , the Sisters of Charity did not count their lives dear to them , but night and day , fearless of death and defiant of fatigue , gave their utmost being to the care of the miserable sick , must I , a Protestant , refuse admiration or fellowship for fear a " certain lustre " would shine upon the Eoman Catholic Church ?

We care a good deal . We shall yield them to no man 's dictation . We shall not indorse any man 's theology which differs from them . We have enough of the old disciple nature left to feel very desirous that folks who will cast out devils , should do it in our train , and as we do . TBut if they will not - why , then , we will help them to do it in their way ! No ways can be very bad that succeed in getting rid of the devil . But , if we were to help an Episcopal movement for general benevolence , would any man say that we indorsed liigh-church notions ? If we were affectionately and urgently invited to Princeton , to examine the senior class in theology and give them some tender cautions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing the life of realities , would anybody be so cruel as to say that we believed in high Calvinism , or were indiflferent to all woes of conscience produced by that energetic system ? Bishop Hughes will never invite us to speak in his new cathedral , and we not promptly accept it . But we aflfectionately appeal to the Exammiefr whether , on such an interesting occurrence , he would think it his duty to pierce us with such remarks as are now puncturing our peace from his words ? ) If I had gone to Boston to buy carpets or books ; or if I had gone to Boston to help the Eepublican cause , if I had gone on any of those secular errands , in which all men of every shade of belief are wont to unite without criticism , no question Would have been raised .

We burden her with mail , and underneath it all we draw the girt of conscience to the last hole . Then she goes slowly forth , scarcely able to walk or to breathe I /z/ I have long ago been eonyineed that it was better to love men , than to hate them ; and that One would be more likely to conyince them of wrong belief bj showing a cordial sympathy with their welfare , than by nipping and pinching them with logic .

Oh pray do not think it for any illwill ! It is all kindness 1 We only do it to keep our voice in practice . We have made orthodoxy a study* And , by an attentive examination of the Prefbytericm the Observer the Puritan Recorder and such like unblemished confessors , we have learned that no man is himself truly sound who does not pitch into somebody for being unsound in the faith ; and that a real modem orthodox man , like a nervous watch-dog , must sit on the door-stone of his system , and bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when there is nothing to bark at , either he must growl and gnaw his reserved bones , or bark at the moon , to keep up the sonorousness of his voiee .

Brooklyn has appeared upon Mr. Parker 's platform , to lend it his popularity . " I neither borrowed nor lent . I went before an audience in the Tremont Temple , a Baptist meeting-house , the place for the chief part of public lectures , to give my own ideas , and to exert whatever power I had by my thoughts and by my feelings upon such audience as pleased to come together .

In conceit and arrogance they are hard as granite , while they tremble all over like aspen leaves with perpetual fears and gpprehensions of dismal mischief to come 1 - When Theodore Parker appears in his representative character as a theologian , I am as irreconcilably opposed to him as it is possible to be . Tlie things that are dear to him , are cheerless and unspeakably solitary and mournful to me . The things which are the very centre of my life , the inspiration of my existence , the glory of my thought and the strength of my ministry , are to him but very little . I differ from him in fact , in theory , in statement , in doctrine , in system , in hope and expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theology , we are separate , and irreconcilable . Could Theodore Parker worship my God ? - Christ Jesus is his name . All that there is of God to me is bound up in that name . A dim and shadowy efflu- /z/ ence rises from Christ , and that I am taught to call the Father . A yet more tenuous and invisible film of thought arises , and that is the Holy Spirit But neither are to me aught tangible , restful , acces sible . They are to be revealed to my knowledge hereafter , but now only to my faith . But Christ stands my manifest God . All lliat I know is of him , and in him . I put my soul into his arms , as , when I was bom , my father put me into my mother 's arms . I draw all my life from him . I bear him in my thoughts hourly , as I humbly believe that he also bears me .

And , since my life is spared to me by him , I give to him that life again . Tliis hope of Christ is the staff of my ministry . First , highest , and in measure beyond all other things , I preach Jesus Christ . And all other topics are but arrows , shot out of this Divine bow .

It is Love that the world wants . When Love goes abroad in the full worth of its nature , and endures , and suffers , without reward except the sweetness of suffering borne for another , then men begin to see what is the heart and spirit of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If tears could wash away from Mr. Parker 's eye ? the hindrances , that he might behold Christ as I behold and adore him , I would shed them without reserve . If prayers could bring to him this vision of glory , beyond sight of philosophy , I would for him besiege the audience-chamber of heaven with an endless procession of prayers , until another voice sounding forth from another light brighter than the noon day sun , should cast down another blinded man , to be lifted up an apostle with inspired vision 1 But since I may not hope so to prevail , I at least /z/ will carry him in my heart , I will cordially work with him when I can , and he heartily sorry whenever I can not . While we yet write , word comes that Mr. Parker , broken dsai by overlabor , seeks rest and restoration in a warmer clime . Should these lines reach his eye , let him know that one heart at least remembers his fidelity to man , in great public exigencies when so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better things . God shield him from the ocean , the storm , the pestilence ; and heal him of lurking disease . And there shall be one Christian who will daily speak his name to the heart of God in earnest prayer , that with health of body he may also receive upon his soul the greatest gift of God , - faith in Jesus Christ as the Divine Saviour of the world . /z/ The term , self-examination , is applied , not to the consideration of one 's outward conduct , but to a review and analysis of one 's hidden feelings ; to the motives , and to the moral complexion of one 's emotions . In this matter , as in many others , those who most need it seldom practise it , and those practise it most who could best do without it . Thus if a man have a strong practical cast , a natural sagacity in matters of form and substance , a ready knowledge of men and things , he will tend to cultivate that outward direction of his mind ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the few paroxysmal attempts at the study of himself . Made upon impulse , without skill , or practice , upon too large a scale , with the heat of new zeal , the result is confusion and disgust . He reverts to hi &; pracHcal life , and always speaks of himself as not adapted to metaphysical meditation . Yet , this man especially needs to study himself , because he is by his nature so strongly drawn away toward outward and material life . On the other hand , a reflective , sensitive mindj dwells upon its own states too much , and lives so much in introspection , as to have but a slender sympathy with the outward world . A special form of this last mentioned danger is frequently found in young and conscientious Christians . /z/ They attempt to maintain a habitual watch over theii minds . Tliey check every budding feeling till they know what fruit it will bear . They stop every swelling emotion till they have " examined " it . They treat the religious feelings , as an officer would a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripping off its cloak , and scrutinizing sharply . Tlie mind , thus badgered , is like a steed whom you whip with one hand and hold in with the other ; it becomes restless and chafed . The poor victim does not know " how he does feeL " He wishes he knew his own motives . He will be heard inquiring much after his " evidences . " " How can a man tell whether he has faith or not ? " *'How may I know whether I really love God ? " " How do I know whether all my motives in seeking religion are not selfish ? " Such questions will identify the victims of narrow selfexamination . The moment a feeling becomes an object of attention it ceases to be a feeling . Emotions change to ideas . The real process of what is called , by many , self-examination , is but the transmutation of an emotive state into an intellectual state ; for feeling perislies where analysis begins . They burn the flower that they may analyze its ashes , and then are discontented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root , stem , nor flower . This course is every way unnatural , and inflicts upon the mind a long train of mischiefs . There can be no such thing as a current in the mind , a free sweep , a generous momentum , where every state of feeling is stopped for examination . The mind becomes /z/ restless . It begins nervously to break out in one direction or another , seeking by violent reactions thatnatural liberty which has been denied it . If the causes continue , the results wiU vary according to the peculiar temperament and structure of the mind . Some will retract in disgust from all attempts at religion , except as a scheme of morals . Others will grow despondent , and all their lifetime be subject to bondage . Others still , will come to a degree of morbid sensitiveness , which will only stop shbrt of superstition . They will have a thousand questions starting up ; they will feel pangs of remorse upon the slightest occasion ; they will be thrown off their guard by a text suddenly presented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brood in perpetual disquiet over a chaotic and gloomy experience . In such states , every effort of the sufferer being a stimulus upon a jaded or morbid condition , will aggravate the suffering and put relief yet further off . Such mischiefs are not imaginary . Every year we meet them in repeated instances . Some five within a week , have come to our notice . /z/ A PRAYER-MEETING is a placG for social religions life . It is not for preaching , nor is it for exhortation . It is a place where Christians meet to instruct and strengthen one another by a free and familiar development of their religious experiences and emotions . It is an altar - for whose fire every Christian brings a brand , and where the whole pile is made up of the added fagots of many enkindled hearts . Tliis is the primary idea of a prayer-meeting . It is evident , therefore , that the first step toward a wholesome meeting is truthfulness . Yet it is this important element which is apt to be most often lacking . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume a sense of awful responsibility , to put on an air of profound solemnity , and ta manifest an eminently devout spirit . But these feelings are never proper , except when they are real . They should never be assumed . They should never be put on and worn as a kind of appropriate dress , becoming to the occasion . Men should not lay aside their naturalness before God , any more than before men - and even less , as God can see through the guise when men may not . They should not pretend to be what they are not , any more in a prayer-meeting with their brethren , than alone in their own private closet . Any pretentious mood , or any forced and artificial /z/ feeKng , will always do harm , for it will overlay tke mind as straw and dry leaves overlay the soil , so that nothing is able to spring up . No man should utter a wor.d in a prayer-meeting which is not spoken in sincerity . It is a greac and grievous sin for a man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor enters into , the petiionsl It is a piece of mockery that no man would dnre , much less God . For any creature to bow . before his Creator , and say prayers , whether they be long or short ) printed or unprinted , which do not engage his heart , but which he utters from a mere sense of duty , or from superstitious fear , or from habit , is an inexpressible audacity . Yet it is often done . And it is said , " K you do not feel like praying , pray till you do . " Now there certainly are degrees of interest ; and a man may be blameless for experiencing less fervor at the beginning of a devotional period than at the end of it . But for a man to employ prayer as a mere exercise , or as a mere mode of giving himself a stirring up - to stand before God and assume the tones , the language , the manner of feeling , for the sake of coming by and by into the feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t be asked , " " What then shall a man do ? Shall he neglect prayer until he does feel ? Shall he refuse to take part in a prayer-meeting until the glow is upon him ? " - the answer is that such a man should not neglect prayer , neither in his closet , nor perhaps in the prayer-meeting . But he must prepare himself for prayer . He must watch and study for the disposition . He should refresh his mind with Scriptural /z/ truths , and should consider his own wants and sinful* ness . This he should do apart from noise and excitement , if possible ; and he may be aided in doing it by employing hymns and psalms , which will oftentimes speedily carry his mind out of a dull and dead frame into some beginnings of life . He may thus come into a state in which prayer will not be a stapid act , or a dead form , but the glowing expression of a living feeling . Tliis is a proper preparation for prayer , whether public or private . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might better be omitted , and hymns sung in their place . If but a single sentence is uttered , let it be real ; and let utterance cease when the heart no longer prompts - and the heart will often have ceased its promptings long before a recitation of fifteen minutes is concluded . One moment of real communion with God is prayer , but a whole hour of recited words , without feeling , is not prayer , and is worse than none . The way to kill a prayer-meeting is to make it conventional , and the chief secret of conducting it so that it shall minister to edification , is to force people out of conventional ways ; to ' break up hereditary and stereotyped unwritten forms of prayer ; to keep off those impertinent moths called exhorters , that fly about the flame of rising feeling ; to charm men into forgetfulness of the machinery of the meeting ; and to make them talk artlessly , naturally , and sensibly . But above all , let all pretence , all mock solemnity and devotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to his brethren to be what he is not , /z/ for this IS part of the injunction , " Let every man speak truth with his neighbor . " K this rule be not obseryed , and the frequent tendencies to violate it be not corrected , the prayer-meetings will degenerate , and people will lose first all profit and then all interest in them . For , what if people should go to an evening party , not in their natural character , but , one striving to be brilliant , another to be witty , another to be instructive , another to be profound ? Who could endure the sham ? There is need in prayermeetings of men who are willing to stand simply and only CHI what they are and what they have . The speaking in prayer-meetings should be conversational , and so , natural . The words spoken should flow naturally from the heart 's experience , or else it were better to be silent . Usually , however , when a man has nothing to say , he gets up and exhorts sinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty , informs the church that they are very cold , and live far beneath their privileges . Such prayers or exhortations may be very glib and fluent , but they are as dry of sap or juice as last year 's corn-husks . They are not only profitless but damaging . On the contrary , there are oftentimes prayers , humble , timid , half-inaudible , the utterances of uncultivated lips , that may cut a poor figure as lecture-room literature , that are nevertheless not to be scornfully disdained . If a child may not talk at all till he can speak fluent English , he will never learn . There should be a process , going on , continually , of education , by which all the members of the church should be able to contribute of their experiences and gifts ; and , in such a /z/ course of development , the first hesitating , stombling , nngrammatical prajer of a confused Christian may be worth more to the church than the best prayer of the most eloquent pastor . The prayer may be but little ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has one more man who is beginning to pray than it had before . The conductor of a prayer-meeting should have a distinct conception of what such a meeting is to be and to do ; and as it is a mutual instruction class , a place for religious feeling to take the social element , his chief duty should be to draw out the timid , to check the obtrusive , to encourage simple and true speaking , and to apply religious truths to those wants , and struggles , and expenences which are freely mentioned there . /z/ It is no small thing , as it regards the education of the community , that from their youth up they have been taught to discuss all questions from ascertained and authoritative moral grounds . The rhetoric or argument of ancient civilization was secular , both in its spirit and aims . The intellect and the imagination were trained , not the conscience or the affections . To have the whole , or the greatest part , of the community gather together every week for the religious discussion of life questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other known causes could produce . The family educates the affections . Secular affairs train and sharpen the business faculties . Public affairs give general information ; but where is moral training to cojne from ? The moral element in man has but a sorry chance against his selfish faculties and his passions . A few , in every community , are so endowed as to stand up , men of integrity and of natural religion , without or even against training . They may not be Christians . But they are men of a strong religious nature , and of slender passions , to whom justice and an imperfect spirituality is congenial . Such cases are single and isolated . The mass of men are not just nor religious , unless in a fragmentary way in exceptional instances /z/ Take men as thej rise , and their selfish and animal instincts are more active , more influential than their religious feelings . The habits of life are founded upon current selfishness . The character is shaped by the influeuce of three or four feelings , - the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the love of animal indulgence . Benevolence , as an overruling power ; justice between man and man , as a controlling force ; a love of God and a salutary reverence for him , as an atmosphere in which the soul breathes , these are not common . From the beginning of life , the conscience is apt to be uneducated , or overlaid by selfishness , or drugged and silenced . Men are good-natured , or generous , upon occasions . A few are benevolent . In the most select and best communities not one in a thousand is benevolent . Kot one in a hundred is generous . When their own interests or wishes are not to be sacrificed ; when kindness runs parallel with selfishness ; when good service costs nothing , and is even easier than its opposite , then , one must be either a dyspeptic , or a very bad man , if he be not kind and generous . But in such cases the good feeling is a very narrow valley between very high mountains on either side . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , how many act from such deliberate convictions of conscience , that it may be said of them they are governed by a sense of Kight ? How many are benevolent - not in the sense of being good-natured when they are pleased , or kind when everything is to their mind , or generous when it costs them nothing and is easier than selfishness - but /z/ when to be so requires self-denial and moral principle ? Our own convictions , founded upon observation , are , that very few have such benevolence , either by nature or by grace . Our impression is that religion has hitherto developed reverence toward God , carefulness of one 's own life and conduct , and benevolence when it does not cost too much . We see nothing in the ordinary influences of society which tends to rectify this : nothing in secular institutions ; nothing in the course of business . Schools and seminaries can not frame the man 's habits , nor train the moral nature . It is in this view that we regard the Sabbath and the Pulpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bodily rest , doubtless ; it is a day for social culture ; it is to be advocated for reasons , therefore , of secular expediency . There is a ground higher than all these . It is the day for religious education . There is no substitute for it . The work which above all others man needs to have done , can not be done except through the force and observance of some such institution . /z/ The Pulpit is the popular religious educator . Its object is to stimulate and develop the religious feelings . All subjects upon which men think or act , all relations and duties , all observances , amusements , occupations , and sympathies need to be discussed by every man from the ground of religious principles . Left to themselves , few men will so discuss them . Week by week men should hear their daily life discussed , not from selfish principles , not from a ground of expediency , not from popular points of /z/ view , but from the highest religious grounds . Tc have the whole , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reverential feeling is beneficial doubtless . This should be an element of Sabbath observance . But this veryfeeling will itself deiend upon a previous education and development of the whole religious nature . That development will take place most healthfully and rapidly by such a system of education as shall lead men habitually to look at all things from the religious stand-point . When a whole community are wont to have their social life , their secular business , their public duties , taken out of their low and selfish attitudes and lifted up into the light of God 's countenance , and then measured , judged , repressed or developed , and wholly bathed or inspired by the spirit of conscience*and of love , then they are receiving a moral education , for which there is no other provision except the Sabbath and the Pulpit . And we regard the Day and the Desk to be as needful to the refined and philosophic as to the rude and unlettered , though for different reasons . Great culture is liable to take a selfish and subtle pride , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully as injurious to religious purity as vice and appetite . /z/ My deab Sib : I am glad that we are of one belief as to the reality of that momentous change which is usually called conversion or regeneration . We agree , too , that such a change does not require violence to be done to the mental organization . A man has the same faculties , intellectual , moral , social , and animal , before conversion as after . Neither are the constitutional functions changed ; nor the laws of mind , under which all mental life Exists . The change is analogous to that which happens to a thoroughly and chronically - diseased body , when it becomes decidedly convalescent . All the vital organs , and every minute vessel throughout the system is changed from a morbid to a natural condition . There is neither increase nor diminution of the organs of the body ; there is nothing taken from , and nothing added to the normal functions of the organs . In like manner , the change of mind is not one of faculty but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only from a disordered to a normal and healthful state . Is such a change instantaneous ? You think that it is not . Many devout Christians agree with you . Indeed , taking the world through , I presume that you are with the majority . Nor is it to be denied that you /z/ // have many apparent reasons for such donbt . Yet , it seems to me that both facts and analogies are against yon when the matter is critically searched . Every serious change that befalls the mind may be said to have three stages - the preparatory stage , the stage of actual change , and the after stage . It is of neither the first , nor the last , but of the middle one , that we affirm instantaneousness . TTe say that the act of volition , or of voluntary transition from one purpose or condition of mind to another , is always instantaneous , although the circumstances which led to it , and the results which follow it , may be long-drawn and gradual . A man may determine to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually arise , and grow in force from day to day for months , and even years . But the determination , at last , is a sudden , momentary act . After the decision , months may be required to carry it completely into effect . So that there are in a change of religious feeling two gradual stages and one instantaneous . The mind may become gradually , and , more and more , deeply serious ; the perception of neglected truths may be progressive ; the motives to a decision for or against a religious life may be long accumulating ; but , at length , there is a time of choice ; and whether perceived or not , that decisive choice will be instantaneous . Then comes the after stage - the carrying out of the determination . The eradication of bad habits , the development of right feelings , the reduction of conduct to religious principle ; in short , the formation of religious character , is gradual . /z/ In the popular mind conversion improperly includes all the stages which we have discriminated ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be graduaL But conversion , as a mere act of choice , is instantaneous . We affirm all volition to be instantaneous . While one weight after another goes into the scale you are preparing for the counterpoise ; but when the index passes the centre , it passes at once In like manner , when the mind holds a change in view , it may be long in coming toward a decision ; it may vacillate and Swing first to the one and then to the other side . But when . each faculty but the last one has consented , and at length , long resisting , that faculty coincides with the rest , the decision is instant and decisive . The recognition of this change , by the individual , will depend upon the character of his mind . Those who have strong emotions , all of whose changes follow or are instapitly followed by the intellect , will perceive that a transition has been made . Those who have strong and positive emotions , but are not wont intellectually to inspect them , y ' feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gentle , emotive temperament , will not intellectually recognize the mental transition , but will first be conscious of it from the results that begin to appear . From these statements we should be led to expect that religious changes would be most apparently sud* den among uncultivated minds , which being imcon* trolled , act under emotion , with extremes of flux and reflux ; among men of violent passions ; among those /z/ who have been the most entirely destitute of moral sensibiKty . We should suspect , also , that such changes would be , at the time , perceived by all minds , robust or feeble , positive or gentle , in times of great general excitement , in which the mind is more active and moves more strongly than alone , by reason of sympathy with other minds . Facts corroborate such expectations . The distinction between a real instantaneous change of mind , and the instant recognition of that change , should not be forgotten . As the change of mind may be induced or prevented with great facility by the degree of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerted , by the nature of the means employed , and by the skill with which such means are applied to the mind ; so , the recognition of that change will depend in part upon one 's emotive temperament , and upon the habits of decision which one possesses ; in part , upon the condition of the mind at the time , and in part upon the instructions received , directing the mind 's attention to such phenomena . I imagine that you will say , of all this disquisition , " It may be curious , but is it of practical importance ? Its merit is metaphysical . It will do no good in actual life . " On the contrary , though it is metaphysically true , its chief importance is that it takes hold so earnestly and efficiently on practice . A mind taught to believe in the reality and necessity of an instant choice will act with directness and brevity . The belief in gradual conversion goes hand in hand with procrastination and mere promissory amendment . Neither can the // efforts of Christians nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who trust to a gradual amelioration can not in the nature of things work with that directness , with that sharp activity , and strong hope , which they have who expect an immediate result . To labor for a future , indefinite , gradual change , is like growing acorns ; to labor for an immediate change is like growing wheat . In the latter case , the appointed months are so definite , the harvest so near , and the result so sure , that aQ have hope , and faith , and industry ; while few are found sowing acorn seed for forests , which oth hands , in another generation shall feU and use . /z/ NATUEAL LAWS AND SPECIAL PBOVIDENCEa The human mind tends to pass from one extreme of truth to the other . The mind of communities touches both extremes before it settles down at the intermediate point of truth . There is no great truth which , being pressed far enough in one direction , will not meet another bearing up against it from the opposite . There is , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far enough and it will be met and restrained by the equal truth of man 's dependence . Tlie truth of man 's individuality ; press it to a certain distance , and it will meet another truth , equally certain - man 's associated life . There is the truth of the necessity of helping men , and the other truth , just as important , that if you help them you will destroy them ; - for there is nothing worse than help which impairs the disposition of men to help themselves , and nothing so bad as not to help them when they need help . Tliere is also the doctrine of free agency , and the counter doctrine of dependence upon God . There is no one great line of thought which , being pursued at length , does not meet another coming from the opposite ; and a man 's mind should stand at the centre of the wheel , and all truths should come to it from every side as the spokes of one great wheel . /z/ It is on this account that men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they take in all truth . Before men had learned much of the globe , and of physical laws , they were guided , in assigning causes for the effects which they witnessed , by their veneration and imagination . When the imagination , instead of reason , guides ignorant men , they are almost always wont to ascribe effects , whose causes are not visible , to spiritual influence , infernal or supernal . The progress of observation and investigation drives men from these superstitious notions , and one effect after another is wrested from the supposed agency of spirits , and becomes affixed to its natural cause . This was the case with celestial appearances - the comets , the Aurora Borealis . This was the case also , in a great measure , with diseases . It is not long since pestilences , plagues , and many special forms of disease , such as leprosy , and many varieties of convulsive disease which affected the nervous system , were regarded by the medical faculty , and by the church itself , as the results of spiritual or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing that these notions have been in a measure done away . I remember , in my own day , very long sermons to prove that the cholera did not depend on natural agencies , but that God held it in his hand , and dropped it down upon the world . There is no doubt that there are moral results to be wrought out by all these natural phenomena , but it was held that they were produced by preternatural means . It is not many ages since a man would have /z/ been expelled from aaj sound church , if he did not believe that diseases resulted from the direct exercise of divine power , instead of intermediate causation ; and that healing was to be effected only through some form of spiritual incantation . The same was true of the common events of familiar life . Men saw evidence of the agency of good and of bad spirits around them , at all times , and in eveiy minute event Since the world began this has been common ; and it is no commoner now than ever before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest , some charm being forgotten , lurking mischief should gain advantage of them . The growth of natural science has tended very much to sweep away such views ; first , from philosophical minds ; gradually , as general information increased , from the minds of all well-informed common men : and now , in the immense progress of science and the diffusion of a knowledge of it among the common people , there is a very marked tendency to go to the opposite extreme , and not only to refer each special effect to a corresponding natural cause , but to deny that there are any effects which are the results of divine volition . Some men are ready to say that all things are effects of physical causes , and that there is no immediate divine volition exerted upon natural laws . This is as monstrous in science , as it is absurd in religion . If men take the premise that all effects to be expected in this world are provided for in organized natural laws , and that there are none which result from divine efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They must hold /z/ that huiufln intelligence is our only guide in this world , or , in other words , is the only God of nataral powers ; they must argue that no man will be helped in this world except so far as he helps himself , by finding out the paths of nature and walking in thm - a falsehood which is all the worse because it is half true . For in making an axe , the head is of iron and the edge of steel ; but the head is the larger and heavier part , while the edge is but a narrow strip . So , with such a falsehood ; the greater part of it is true , but this is made only to add weight and power to the cutting edge , which is false . They must declare that the belief in a special and particular providence is a superstition ; that God works by laws , and that he never interferes with or uses them . They must believe that , consequently , prayer is a mere poetic exercise ; good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their feelings , and soothes and calms them . They must suppose that prayers which the heathen write , and which the wind offers up for them by turning a wheel , like a mill , are as effectual on the laws of nature as an humble Christian 's prayer . They must hold that the doctrine of miracles is to be given up , as nothing but a superlative superstition . And , for this matter , such men usually do teach that miracles always happened in dark ages , among ignorant men ; that many of the same results can now be produced by scientific causes ; and that a belief in them , as effects divinely produced , is unworthy of an enlightened philosopher . I need not say how far men have drift ; pd away from the New Testament , who have reached this /z/ ground . Such a man is not onl j not a Ghristaan , but whatever natural religion be may have , if he be consistent , he most reject the New Testament altogether , as an authoritative gnide , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there be one truth more especiallj taught in the Bible than another , it is die fact of God 's activity and influence in human life . If there ever comes a day in which it can be shown by science , that diere is no active interference of the divine creative will in the special affairs of men , science in that day will demolish the New Testament* When it can be scientifically demonstrated that no more effects are wrought in this world by the intentional interposition of divine volition , than those which fall out in the way of ordinary and unhelped natural causation , in that day , I am free to say , the New Testament will be overthrown . It will be regarded as an amiable book , but one whose doctrines have been refuted , and are passed away . This doctrine of the presence and actual interference of God in the world , producing effects which would not have fallen out otherwise , is taught in the Bible as against idolatry , as against naturalism ( in the early claapters of John ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage , of patience , and of liope , and as a special development , among others , of the incarnation of Christ to bring to light the reality of God , who wrought invisibly in life and nature , both before and since . It is to be admitted that this globe and its inhabitants are included in a system of physical laws ; that these are , in their nature , unelianged and unchange- /z/ able ; that they are incapable of increase or decrease ; that they are suflScient for all ordinary purposes of human life ; that the welfare and happiness of men depend largely upon a wise employment of them ; and that the progress of the race is largely to be effected by their wise application of them . Not only would I cast no obstacle in the way of scientific research , but I hail it as the great almoner of God 's bounty . Men should be instructed to become better acquainted with the laws and influences which operate upon both the body and the mind , and upon the natural world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until they know more perfectly how their bodies are put together , and what is in their own minds , and the natural laws of the one and of the other . Science is yet to interpret Scripture , in many respects ; and I am persuaded that all the most characteristic elements of revealed or inspired truth will in the end be corroborated and not harmed , by the progress of natural science . I believe in everything that is true . I am not necessarily to believe in everything that pretends to be true ; but when anything is proved , whatever it overturns , I am bound to it by the allegiance with which I am bound to God 1 He that denies the truth in or out of the Bible , denies God ! The progress of science lays a surer foundation for a belief in God 's active interference in human affairs than has existed without it . When maturer fruits of investigation shall be had , there can be no doubt that science itself will establish our faith in prayer , in miracles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are respects in which natmsl ImwB are bejond the reach of all human interferice and eontroL There are spheres in which liit and heat can not be touched and controlled . There are varioos attractions which perform in their own waj their own work , beyond man 's guidance or reach - such are the great laws which bind tether the stellar uniYerse . Oreat cuvents andpassagesctf natural powers are put entirely beyond man 's hand . But itis justas certain that there are , also , in Grod'sqrstemtf nature , another class of laws which come close to us , and whose office is , or seems to be , to minister to human life . They are either modifications of great laws , or they are separate laws . And in respect to these , I affirm that they are not fructified , and do not perform Aeir function , till they are controlled by human Yolitim .

Electricity , for instance , plays a round of its own . It has its own pastures , and its own great running grounds . It performs a large function unknown - beyond our reach , and without our knowledge . But so far as ordinary purposes of civilized life are concerned , electricity does nothing till we have taught it how to serve us ; then it runs swifter races for human convenience than ever were run before . When the mind takes hold of it , electricity becomes /z/ a patient dmdge ; so that we now work by lightning , which would never have done a single thing for us if it had not been harnessed by the human mind .

Light performs a great amount of work , - whether we are waking or sleeping ; in its vast journeys through the universe - in its sun-flashes and moonreflections ; but man 's mind seizes this law , and does what Phaeton could not , d/rvoes it . We have it in our dwelling . We make it work along our coasts . We divide it , and set it at work in the garden and on the farm . We give it the power of a living pencil , and make it draw artists ' pictures . And yet we are in the midst of a carping set of philosophers who say that we can obey natural laws , but can not control them . We do control them .

Yet , compare it with the sphere in which fire works under the dominion of man - in the forge , in the furnace , over the blow-pipe , serving the domestic range , warming the house , and pouring summer throughout the year within the dwelling ! Look at Nature 's Fruits . There is but a hegmning in natural fruits , and they never , when left to nature alone , reach beyond that point . When a man finds a cnib-apple in the woods , he would not vsdllingly find it more than once ; yet , brought to his own orchard , it becomes a fine fruit . But did natjire make the pippin ? Kature bad been trying her hand for years and years , and had never been able to get beyond the crab-apple .

She never made a jack-knife , a steam-engine , a knife and fork - nothing but bare , cold , dead iron . Now , is this a course of specious metaphysical reasoning ? Is not this truth reasonable ? - Are not these facts alleged conclusive ? And if they be true , what is the result ? Nature has certain crude , general function which natural laws perform of themselves , without any regard to men . But these laws are made to be vitalized and directed to a higher development by the control of the human mind and will . The laws of the globe are to be taken hold of by man 's will , as really as the laws of the body are . The secondary effects of natural laws are just as much a part of their nature as the primary , and are of equal importance . In fact , it is these that constitute the elements of civilization . While natural laws , in a certain way , influence and control men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as much controlled by man , and just as dependent on him . If nature should abandon men , they would die , and it would become poverty-stricken . Let nature forget us , and the heart would cease to beat . The pulsations of endless electrical currents would cease . On the other hand , let man forget nature , and the city would crumble , and go back to a wilderness ; the garden which had grown up from a thistle-ground , would return to its native condition ; cultivated seeds would shrink*back to their original poverty ; and all domestic animals would rebound to their wild state . Nature needs man to keep her at work . It is this view that settles all questions about man 's /z/ Decessitj to obey . Grod has not put us before nature to make us onlj its pupil , but also its master . We are not alone to look up and take , but to look down and control . We are not only to obey , but also to rule . We are to obey for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute and inflexible goyemment of natural law has no foundation except in fools ' brains . It is a divided empire , and man 's part is more than nature 's . When God made man , he made more of nature in him than he did in all the rest of the world besides ! The question now arises - Is there a moral or scientific probability that God ever produces results by natural laws , in this world , which otherwise would not have been produced ? - If we drive natural laws , can not God do it ? I hold , because the Bible teaches it , and now I hold it more because nature and science teach it , that there are millions of results that nevewould have fallen out in the course of nature , that are now continually happening on account of God 's special mercy . The doctrine of a special providence is this . God administers natural laws - of the mind , the body , and the outward world - so as to produce effects which they never would have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not God ? By a wise use of natural laws man can make the difference between comfort and discomforf-. lie can till the farm , and make the seasons serve him . He can take natural laws , and gird himself about with them , so that they shall make him rich , and wise , and strong . Men can do it for themselves - why can not God do it for them ? Men can do it for their children - for SPECIAL FSOTIDSirOES. 229 their neighbors ' children - for scores and hundreds c persons . A farmer that administers his estate wisely , will have enough , not only for himself , but for others . His children will be fed , the neighborhood supplied , and the veins of commerce swollen by the overplus of his sagacity . A man can say to the light , to the water , to the seasons , " I will , by you , make a special providioe for this whole town , " and he can do it ; for if he falls back , there will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . That is not all . A man may be put at a point where - as Napoleon was , or Wellington in Spain , or Sir John Moore in the north of Portugal , or Olive in India - he can make a special providence for a nation , for a race , for an age , for one land or for the globe I Now God can do a great deal more than man , and a great deal better . Is there any objection to such a doctrine ? In regard to the doctrine of prayer , many men say , " Do you suppose that God will make any difference , whether you pray or not ? " The reply is , that God can , if he chooses . But whether he will , or not , depends very much on how I pray , and what I pray for . I can give my boy a book or a bow every day in the year , but whether I will , or not , is another thing . God will not do for men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for them at present , what they , after a proper course of development , will by and by be able to do for themselves . But a man has a right to go up along the path of his weakness , and say , " I have done what I could ; now hear my prayer , and do for me what I can not do for myself . " And if it is a thing that is needed , God /z/ will answer the prayer . For he lores to gire needed things better than earthly parents love to give good gifts to their children . Suppose yon have been travelling in the cars , with yonr child , and it becomes restless with fatigne . Its rest has been broken by night-travelling , and it is hungry and asks for food . But a bank of snow lies across the track , and the train can not go on . It waits .

Bnt by and by , with double and treble elements of iron , the track is opened , the way is cleared , and we are hurried on to the next station . The first bolt I make is into the hotel ; for I am hungry , not for myself , but for the child ; and I break through the crowd back an into the car , with bread in my hands for the child . Ah , do you suppose the bread is half so sweet to his mouth as to my eyes that watch his eager eating ? But this is God 's figure and not mine . He declares til at he is more willing to give good gifts to them that ask him , than parents are to give to their children . Have you ever prayed on this principle and found your jjrayer unanswered ? Not prayer for amusement ; for some men pray , who begin with Adam , and come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , " and then wind up with the " power and glory , forever and ever . Amen . " That is not prayer ; or at least it is not such praying as will be answered . But did you ever , under the pressure of a real want , go to God and say , " Thou , Father , /z/ c&ast; help me ; give me tliiiie aid , " and not have your prayer answered ? Glorious old Martin Luther knew how to pray . He used to take one of God 's promises , and laying it down , would say , " Now , Lord , here is thy word ! K thou dost not keep it , I will never believe thee again . " This may be called audacious , but it was not audacity in such a Christian as Luther . What is needed is , that we should take a larger and broader faith , and we shall then have no difficulty with special providences , or miracles , or prayer ; but all their problems will be solved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Christian art is ignorant of the multitudes of pictures and carvings of the Dead Christ Every name c eminence has attempted the subject ; and the great masters have again and again repeated their conceptions . One of the most affecting that ever came under our eye , is that in the National Gtillery of London , by Francia , we believe . The Saviour is extended across his mother 's lap , an angel sustains his head , and another his feet . We gazed long at the sublime face , now motionless and cold , pale and silent . All the majesty of his life , the scenes of his wonderful sorrow , came back to us ; and , whether it was our imagination or the real expression of the picture , we certainly felt that we beheld the sorrow that slew the Saviour and the love which conquered the sorrow , both together ; so that it seemed to us tliathis thomed head was overspread with sadness , only that upon it victorious love might stand forth more evidently triumphant . It was not a boisterous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the calm , serene , silent victory of patience and unutterable affection . We are not fond of this class of subjects . But this one seemed to be redeemed from the weakness of death , and to suggest no thought of the crushing of power , the dishonoring of life , but only of a strug- /z/ gle in which Death was the opening of a gate for a spirit to march forth to victory I In art , and merely as art , the Dead Christ is but barely tolerable . In religion , and as a part of religion , it is altogether to be disallowed . And yet , in the preaching of Christ , how many preach a Living Christ ? It is a suffering Christ , a tempted Christ , a dying CSirist , a buried Christ . Some mysterious benefit is hoped from a devout contemplation of such a moving theme . But is the mere natural relation of such scenes to the human sympathies , to be compared with tiie presentation of Christ - arisen , glorified , laiumphantly reigning ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the succor , the teaching , and the perfectionof his earthly chUdren ? Our Saviour does not live behind eighteen hundred years ago . We are not to be pUgrims along the misty track of Time , waiting for him in Jerusalem , and lingering in the garden . That he might not be local , a being of one age and nation , he arose to that blazing centre which knows no periods , no epoch , no time , but is the eternal Now . He is to every age a Present Saviour - to every soid a Living Saviour I To our mind he is clothed with attributes then exhibited , when he wore his earthly form ; but , having gained a clear conception of what Christ was , that he is and that we are to transfer in our thoughts to the invisible One , pei petually hovering near us . The hope and the joy of Christians are not in the past , but in the present . It is believed that Christ knows them , that he knows them as individuals , by name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living and efficient /z/ sympathy for them which their daily necessities require ; that his heart yearns , that his eye follows them , that his pity enfolds them . Christians are glad of a Saviour snfiering and slain , because through this experience they are able to form a conception of what nature is in Him now . And their great and pecuKar need is a CShrist who knows all their weaknesses of disposition without feeling disgust ; who knows aU their sins without bitterness ; who knows their faults and foibles without contempt ; who knows their daily practical difficulties , their cares , their family troubles , their business perplexities , and who knows just how all these things , acting on the peculiar temperament which each possesses , hinders his piety , mars his joy , fills him with doubts , and afflicts him with burdens . It requires no great stretch of faith to believe that Christ has opened up a way to save those who come to him already converted out of their sins . But to come blushing from the commission of some sinful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inasmuch as , a hundred times before , you have promised to renounce evil , and have broken the promise ; - when in the quick and stinging confusion of shame and grief and discouragement , you can raise up the vision of a merciful Christ , looking intently upon you , and saying , " Son , now above all other times , come to me , for I am the only one that hath the patience and the power to bring thee out of all these passes and temptations ; " this it is , indeed , to have a Living Christ ! Do we enough preach a Living Christ ? Do we not stumble , just as the Roman Catholic /z/ often does , by laying hold of the earthly form of Christ , the life and symbols of his love ; and by endeavoring to extract from the past , that which the grave shall never give , nor the dark past , but which shall come , if at all , right down from the Living Heart of the Companionable Saviour , who though glorified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his people ? The faults of preaching , when such faults exist , are magnified in Christian experience . Few persons look up . Many look back , and W ( 3nder that seeing the place where Jesus lay , they see no angels there , and hear no voice . Their Christ is the Dead Christ . Some persons long for a tender heart , for impassioned experience , for more earnest love . They wander in Gethsemane . Theylinger onthe mount beneath the olive trees . They shudder upon Calvary . They search the garden for the grave . But Gethsemane that once heard the groans , now hears them no more . The olives yield their fruit , but no Saviour sits beneath their covering shadows . The hill , if one might hear its silent voice , would cry out " Here He was , but is no longer . " The grave would murmur , " Come see where He lay - He is not here . He is arisen . " And all the scenes of the past have now but one office , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Living and a Present Saviour . /z/ " Whereby are giyen unto us exceeding great and precious promises : that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature , having escaped the cormption that is in the world through IiibL And besides this , giving all diligence , add to your faith virtue ; and to virtue , knowledge ; and to knowledge , temperance ; and to temperance , patience ; and to patience , godliness ; and to godliness , brotherly kindness ; and to brotherly kindness , charity .

It sets forth the virtues which cost us most , but which we are most easily tempted to dispense with ; and shows that these very quaKties have a special relation to our future wealth and glory . The line of thought is this - as if the Christian graces presented themselves to the apostle 's mind as so many golden links in a chain or necklace , which can never have too many , which is rich and valuable not alone by the quality of each link but by the number of them ' - he urges us to add one to the other in consecutive order . To faith , add the golden link of virtue ; to virtue , knowledge ; to knowledge , temperance ; to temper- /z/ AH BXPOBrnoK. 237 ance , patience ; to patience , godliness ; to godliness , brotherly kindness ; and to brotherly kindness , love . These qualities shall make the life blessed ; that is , truthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a barren and unfruitful desert , but like men that walk in orchards and gardens , with abun dance on every hand . But besides the present blessing , the apostle enunciates the blessed truth that these virtues , by their number and richness , will have a determining influence upon our reception into heaven , and our condition there . The force of this statement is lost in our common version , because there are no latent meanings and associations attached to the English words such as belong to the original . Among the ancient customs of Greece , none is more eminent than the expressing good will to society by providing public entertainments . These are to be distinguished from feasts . They were entertainments or spectacles , exhibitions in theatres and circuses , magnificent processions , public adornments , arches , wreaths , and the fall wealth of music .

Ivich men , who desired to win popnlarity , were permitted to bear the expenses of them . And this was a kind of inferior philanthropy . Among ns men build hospitals , found libraries , endow colleges , establish funds for various charities . But such things were not known then . And these popular exhibitions stood in their place , as the way in which rich men expressed generosity , munificence and philanr tbropy . And as these entertainments were in their nature expensive , so they grew more and more so , by the desire of men to rival each other , each one endeavoring qwq It in not a little remarkable that the apostle should have selected this word . It is one of those flint qwq When he would encourage Christians to endure hardships , and to persevere in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make them here ; and then glancing forward , and beginning to speak of the effect which it would have hereafter , there rose up in his view a great city , like Athens in the days of her integrity ; a city that glowed with marbles as the north glows with crystal mountains ; whose temples glittered on every street ; and from whose grand portals , as when Alcibiades or Pericles returned from victory , the whole population poured out , with chaplets of flowers on their heads , with wreaths in their hands , with costly sacrifices led by white-robed priests ; with chanting choirs in some part singing peans ; and vast bands of instrumental music interluding , or carrying forward the patriotic anthem alone . And , with this vision before him , Peter cries out , K ye do these things ye shall not be barren even here ; and hereafter a universal choral outbreak from the city of God shall meet you . And you shall be received by the whole glorified throng , amid every demonstration of gladness , triumph , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the word emxofyfjyedakTcu . There is one other element that may be noted , and that is , that as the care and conduct of these ancient public receptions were allowed , as an honor , to stand upon the wealth and generosity of some public benefactor , so the apostle , carrying out the figure , means to say , that when we are arriving at our home in heaven , when we are drawing nigh to the open gates , // and are about to enter , it is through the riches of the goodness of God that we shall not go in unnoticed or alone , but shall be met and greeted by a great and innumerable company whom He shall bid to come out , clad in the white robes " which the saints do wear , " with harps in their hands , and with songs and salutations of joy upon their lips , to conduct us in triumphal procession into His Throne , that so " an ' abundant entrance may be ministered unto us . " This is the meaning of the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . The true meaning is . For so a choral and processional greeting and entrance shall be given to you , by the goodness , or wealth , or abundance of Jesus Christ . In other words , the magnificence and costliness of the reception shall be according to the wealth of Christ 's heart . And what a thought 1 That the virtuous lives , the heroic deeds which men perform on earth , are not unheeded , though they may be performed in obscurity , and buried in the conousness of the heart of the actor ; that human life lies open to the inspection of heaven ; that a cloud of witnesses behold our strife , our defeat , or our victory ; that though , to all intents , we may be far off from heaven , since we are distant by the number of years that lie between - by the separation of time rather than space - that yet heaven is near to us ; that it broods us , watches us , sympathizes with us ; that though the holy and just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggling company on earth ; that they look down upon us here , beholding our journey thither , and /z/ await our arrival that they may greet tlb with the surprise of triumphal entrance 1 This is the grand idea that rose before the mind of the apostle , which is so dimly conyeyed in onr imperfect translation . /z/ The Chv/rchman of thifi city has a kind notice of some remarks made by ns in the Independent . We are anxious that onr parishioners and readers should reap what benefit they can from reading it , and we spread it before them : ** Among the miscellaneous matter of the present number Feb. 14th will be found part of an article on " Churches and Pulfttts , " communicated to the Independtwt by the Bev . Henry Ward Beecher . It contains much that is sound on the subject of the place where the preacher is located , and the description of box in which he is ordinarily confined . It is good as far as it goes . But the truth is , that in the early Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally delivered from the steps of the altar . Bingham , in his * Antiquities of the Christian Church , ' tells us that the ordinary place of preaching was the altar . While quoting from ICr . Beecher , it may , perhaps , not be uninteresting to our readers to know what a * High Puritan ' thinks of the Choral Service of the Church . " The Chv/rchmom then extracts a portion of a letter from Stratford-on-Avon , published in the Star Papers , and proceeds : " It is gratifying to read an extract so entirely commendable as this . We trust it may have its influence on Mr. Beecher 's congregation . It would certainly be a perfectly orthodox proceeding for Mr. B. , when he gets into his new church , not only to have an altar , from the steps of which to speak to the people , but to have a choir of boys , properly surpliced , to make the responses and the Amens in the service , which , of course , would be that of the Episcopal Church , /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother is said to have been an exemplary member . Ckngregational churches in England do this ; why should not Mr. Beecher ? We have before us the last number of the Musical JUview and Gazeite published in this city , which contains the following extract from the private correspondence of an American lady ( the daughter of a New England clergyman ) now absent in Europe . * A few Sabbaths ago we attended service at Surrey chapel , the place formerly occupied by Rowland Hill . Rev. Newman Hall is now the pastor , an interesting preacher , though in nothing remarks ble . Though a Congregational church , the service of the Church of England is still used , and is chanted by the whole congregation with 60 much - tast , fervor , and devotion , that it is really heavenly . If the service would always be performed in such a manner , I should never wish for any other . I only wish you could hear it . I find congregational singing is everywhere the custom , and I think I shall soOn become so fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does seem much more hearty and much more devotional . ' If the service of the Church of England is deemed sound in a Congregational church in England , why would not the service of the Episcopal Church of this country be equally acceptable and ' sound ' in Mr. Beecher 's church in Brooklyn ? " 1 . We have never had a doubt as to the excellence of the Episcopal service in public worship . " We do doubt whether the constant repetition of it as the sole method of worship , is the best for all . But we are quite willing to leave that to the judgment and experience of each person for himself . And if , on trial , this service is found sufficient for their religious wants , not only would we not dissuade men from its use , but we would do all in our power to make it more useful to them . And this we say without respect to persons . Should our own children find their religious wants better met in the service of the Episcopal Church than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand and lead /z/ them to its altars , and commit them to Gkd'B grace , through the ministration of the Episcopal communion , with unhesitating conviction that if they did not profit there , it would be their own fault 1 Whether the Episcopal Church is one that builds np men in holiness is not an open question . There are too many saints rejoicing in heaven , and too many of the noblest Christians yet laboring on earth , who have derived their religious life through the teachings and offices of that Church , to leave any impartial mind in any doubt . " We have not a word of controversy with Christian men who accept the service of that Church as the best means of enriching their faith . ISoT are we unmindful of the debt of gratitude which we , and the whole Christian world , owe to the scholars , the teachers , the divines , and the bishops of that Church . Whatever historic faults may be raked up against it , we firmly believe that few bodies of Christian men , in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble Christian teachers , or so much fruit of Christian living I And no man can excite in us any unpleasant feeling by a just eulogy of the Episcopal Christian brotherhood . Their merited praise brings unalloyed pleasure to us : and when , in prayer , we ask God 's blessing on his Church on earth , we mean that Church as much as our own . We mean every brotherhood of Christian men who are , according to their best light , worshiping God and loving men . 2 . But , now , will our Christian brethren of the Churchma/n accord to us , as Christians in Congrega- /z/ donal clmrcli-fellowship , the same charity and liberty which we accord to them ? We claim that , for ourselves and for the most of those who consort with us , our method of Christian worship is more useful , more edifying and therefore better than any other . Not better for everybody , but better for us . While we say frankly and heartily to child , friend , or parishioner - " If Christ is revealed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , do not hesitate or fail to accept it , " - will the Chv/rchmam , say the same to its friends , in respect to the Christian service and worship of the Congregational brotherhood ? We take this broad around , that every man is at Uberty to employ whatever form of reUgious worship is best adapted to develop and maintain in him the true Christian life . And we hold that each man must determine this for himself ; and that when it has been determined , every Christian is bound conscientiously to respect another 's conscience ! Let every man be fully convinced in his own mind . 3 . As to the altar , we agree with the Chv/rchman that it would be entirely orthodox to have an " altar " in the new church . To those who wish them , and who can make them serviceable , there is no reason in our day why they should be denied . So might the ark of the covenant , and tables of shew-bread , and the high priest 's breast-plate , and many other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a duty to have an altar ? Can we not offer service , without these symbols , acceptably to God ? K an education makes them a hindrance and not a help , /z/ are we to have them intraded up ( m us as neeeesaiy parte of worship ! TTe believe in Christ as a saerifioe , once offered up for all and forever . We need no visible altar npou which to lay onr invisible sacrifice . Faith is to ns better than sight by means of symbols . As to snrpliced boys " - we have them aheady . The whole congregation is a choir , and onr boys , bright and happy , nnite and respond with their eklers . The snrplice which they wear is just that thing which their dear mothers threw over them when they left home . And angels ' hands could do no more than mothers ' hands do for darling children I And now , in respect to this whole matter , we accord to our Episcopal brethren eveiything that they can ask , except the right of making their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service and method are better adapted to ns than our own , and more certain to promote piety , we shall nnhcsitatingly adopt them ; but so long as we believe , under the circumstances , that our method of worship is better for us than any other , which shall we follow - the judgment of other men in our behalf , or our own judgment ? /z/ Thb discussion of the question of Liturgies in Oongregational dmrches is sufficiently novel to attract general attention . It ought not to be supposed , however , that this is a discussion which has arisen upon foregone facts . It has been begun for the sake of producing facts . If any church , or churches , had gone forward in the exercise of their own rights , to frame a liturgy and to employ it ; if it had been said that such church or churches had no right to do so ; and if this discussion were in the nature of an examination of such churches on the one hand , and a defence of them on the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every true church has the right to determine the method of conducting its own public worship . If they are satisfied with their own services , no one has a right to call them to account . But , in such cases , no one is bound to feel an interest in them , in spite of his own taste . K one church loves a liturgy , the neighboring church is not bound to love it , nor to relish the use of it , nor maintain that fellowship which can stand only in common sympathies . The use of a liturgy , then , ought not to work **28;0;TOOLONG . But , on the other hand , there is no cause of complaint if it does morally and socially alienate brethren of coordinate churches from sympathy and cooperation in worship . /z/ // But the cafle , at present , is far less serious than this . All that has been done , so far as the public know , is this : Some Christian brethren suspect that a great advantage would often accrue to Congregational churches if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole body of worshippers were made to take a more active part in the public services ; and they believe that certain fixed f &ms; of worship , to be used by the whole congregation in common , or responsively , would do much toward enlisting a more active participation of the whole people in public worship . We certainly think that much needs to be done to inspire the services of our churches with more interest ; and that , in some way , the whole congregar tion should become cooperative in public worship . But we are clearly of opinion that a liturgy in whole or in part , will be of very little service . The trouble in our churches is the want of vital Christian feeling . A liturgy will not produce that . We do not think it needful to discuss the merits of liturgies . They are , under some circumstances , useful . But they belong to a system of helps which the whole history and spirit of Congregationalism disowns . And it is not to be supposed that the Congregational churches will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages which may be supposed to linger within fixed and prescribed forms of worship . For our own part , if we were ready for a full liturgy , we should prefer the Episcopal , which has the extrinsic merits of age and long usage , and various historic associations . But it is not proposed /z/ to adopt a full liturgy . It is not , we believe , proposed to advocate a common and general form . A mixed service , in part liturgical and in part extemporaneous , it is thought , would be serviceable in some single churches . We have no objection to the trial by any church that chooses to do it . But we are sure that the experiment will fail . The free element will overrun the fixed forms and choke them ; or else , if the forms are clung to , they will expel the extemporaneous elements , and end in drawing the church over to a full liturgical service . But both of these elements , the movable and the fixed , the voluntary and the prescribed , the extemporaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will kill the other . The experiment is not new . Several denominations have already tried it , the Moravians and the Methodists being of the number . But of what degree of benefit in the Methodist Episcopal service , is the partial liturgy which is in the Book ? Not half of their people know that there is such a thing . It is not compulsory . It is interpolated by extemporaneous offices of devotion ; and the result has been that the forms stand empty and soulless , while the life and power of the Methodist worship lies in the extemporaneous fervor of minister and people . We think that this would be the case still more among Congregational churches . And one or two things would , in time , happen . Either the liturgy would wither and hang upon the service like a last year 's dried blossom dangling upon the vine , or those churches which retained liturgies with benefit , would /z/ // shrink away wholly from extemporaneons Bervices . In this last case , a gradual division would take place , and some Congregational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two effectutd policies of worship would soon strike division through the brotherhood of churches . There need not , however , be the least excitement about this matter . " No one need to fear that the old Congregational churches are in danger of flying off like a flock of birds into new trees . The old Congregational churches are not in danger of accepting an innovation against which they have educated instincts and hereditary historic prejudices as high as the walls of Jerusalem . Here , then , we stand . A great want exists in our worship . BWf liturgies will never remedy that want , and whole liturgies are just as bad . But , good or bad , the churches will never accept them . It seems to us , then , a waste of time to attempt feeble and imcongenial expedients . The stately simplicity of Congregational worship resents all patches and incongruous interpolations . We must abandon the whole method , and go over in a body to real , earnest , thorough liturgical services ; or we must accept the Congregational idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy for lifelessness in a more hearty use and proof of our own system . Any cross between Congregational worship and liturgy will be mongrel , and can neither live with health nor propagate itself at all . If then , it is said , that our public services are barren , we reply , they are . But not for want of common /z/ formB of devotion ; for , churches which employ these forms , with every conceivable means of making them effectual , are just as meagre as ours . Indeed , if the Methodist , the Baptist , the Presbyterian and the Congregational churches be taken together , as having practically an extemporaneous service , and the Episcopal Church be regarded as liturgical , we are not unwilling to have a comparison made between the two methods of worship , in the very respect of producing a common feeling of devotion in the whole congregation . K any single church - having tried the simplicity of Congregational worship and failed , or , not having failed - yet , if from some peculiarity of the congregation - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church beheves that it can do better by half liturgical worship than by our usual methods - then we would not put a straw in their way . We would say , o on ; make your experiment . And when enough time has elapsed to form a ripe judgment of the result , we will accept the trial for what it shall have proved itself worth . But it does not seem to us well to urge such a course upon the Congregational churches before any trial has been made . We do not think it needful to ask hundreds of churches to embark in an enterprise which must be regarded , even by its warmest advocates , as but an experiment . Some who plead for an addition to the old Puritan customs of public worship , do so because they believe the present methods to be very fruitless and meagre . It is said that the services of the Sabbath- // day , in the clmrch , are barren , and espedallj deficient in this , that the congregation , as finch , bear no suflBlcient part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ; but they themselves have nothing to do . They are Kterally an audience ; they are hearers . They are not participants but recipients . It is thought that forms of prayer , recitations of Scripture , and responsive utterances , would go Eur toward producing in the whole congregation a common interest in the religious worship , by making the whole to bear a part . So earnest are we that the whole people should unite in public worship , that , if there were no better way , we should certainly advocate a Kturgy . But we do not think that we have to go a step out of our own system to find means for arousing and thoroughly developing the religious feelings of the whole congregation in public worship . The fundamental idea of Koman Caliiolic worship is , that the priest and the ordinances are depositories of Divine gi*ace - that the people are simply recipients . Protestant Christianity makes Christ the soul-fountain , and each individual Christian is his own priest . A Catholic church has its public service administered by its priests ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - which are the /z/ The social religious element is the distinctive peculiarity of Protestant Christianity . Our churches will never fulfill their own social idea of public worship , until it becomes the joint act of the whole congrega- /z/ tion . Not the separate wosBhip of individuals sitting together , but the mingling and harmonizing of the individual devotion of the whole congregation . The preaching meetings of our churches on the Sabbath day , do not represent our whole idea of the worship of Protestant churches . The prayer-meetings , the conference-meetings , the Bible-classes and Sabbath-schools - these , together with the Sabbath services , are to be regarded as composing the worship . We are to look for the full expression of our peculiar ideas , not in that part which the Sabbath day and the public assembly affords but in all that the church does in its minor meetings . And it will be found that any well-instructed and rightly-trained church is a body whose power resides in its whole membership ; that its worship is ministered to it by its own members ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolve a social religious ministering powfir in the congregation . We may noW suggest some reasolis why our churches do not to a greater degree fulfill their design : 1 . One of the most obvious reasons is , 4 ; h'at ministers of the Gospel have not a clear and proper idea of their functions . They know generally that they are to preach to the community , and that they are to edify the church . But to be a preacher of sermons , a mere teacher in the pulpit , is not half a minister 's work . He is set to drill a body of Christian men , so that they shall individually and collectively be a witnessing and ministering body . The voice of the whole church , and not the voice of its ministry , is /z/ that which God appointed for the preaching of the Gospel . If now a minister only preaches - and so preaches that his brethren wish to hear no one speak but himself - if , instead of inspiring life-power in them , which he then guides and trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fashions a public sentiment so rigid and exacting that no man in the church dare utter his feelings , his thoughts , or his experiences , unless he can do it for edification , ji. e.j do it in rhetorical fluency , with logical precision , and with a certain finish of literary good-breeding ) , he defeats the very end of his ministry , and practically disowns the Congregational idea of a minister . Thus we see that mauy churches are nothing but listeners to a preacher . The society has an organic life and function ; but the church , in such cases , is but little better than a roll of names of persons baptized , initiated , permitted to partake of the Lord 's Supper , and expected to enjoy a good sermon* But to have a real life and function of their own , to have a social , loving atmosphere into whih each one develops the blossoms of his religious life , to be a body competent to edify itself , to build itself up , and to stand , by its own vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an idea is scarcely thought of . And hence it is that ministers come to be mere instructors . Tliey do not educule . Tlicy do not train . They are not seeking to develop the gifts of the individual members of the cliurcli - to drill them in the suitable exercise of those gifts . Tliey seek to do good to their flock as individual Christian men . But they do not group COKGBBaATIONAL LTTUBaT. 255 these indiyidual Christian men into a eommunitj in such a way that they give utterance as a church , by their own voices , to the truth of Christ , or to their experience of God 's guidance and goodness . So that the church is not an epitome of God 's multitudinous teihings ; it is not the harmony of all the voices with which Christ speaks to the souls of his children . It ii a mere class , coming together to hear what a teacher shall say to them , and then going away and profiting as best they may . Now a minister of the Gospel should be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is theology ) ; he should be a teacher of duties , i. e. , he should apply principles to the experiences of life - he should strengthen , comfort , inspire , and warn his people ; but all these things should be but a part of a system of drill , by which the whole church shall become in like manner a teaching body . He is to see that his members are taught to pray - to pray with each other ; to speak - to speak to edification . He is to develop the gifts of each in such a way as that the whole church shall have the benefit . One man is fitly a thinker ; another man is a man of observation and experience . One has zeal and native power ; another has richness of heart and blessed simplicity . One has courage , another has the power of consolation ; one is powerful in prayer , another in conversation . It is the duty of the minister to bring forth these gifts and make them the property of the whole church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one of its members and the minister is set to disclose and develop them . He is not to lean upon the strong ; to avail himself of the // service of those already developed . It is his office to take hold of every individual man , and to educate him , so that he may bring forth the one , or five , or ten talents which are committed to him , for the use and profit of all his brethren . A man of books , a man of ideas , a mian of sermons , is not Christ 's idea of a minister . Follow me , and I will make yon fisJiers of men , A minister is 9 man of men . He is an inspirer and driller of men . Is it a marvel that churches take little part in public exercises ? They are not expected to do it . The minister does not expect it . It is not for that that he preaches . He is a sermon-preacher , not a church-trainer . The people understand it so ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is to preach to them ; he is to visit the sick , bury the dead , marry the affianced , baptize the children , live in a social relationship to a roimd of families , preach twice on the Sabbath , keep the church free from speculative heresies . But the power that lies in so many hearts dormant , the united power of such a body of witnesses as the church would be if it had a real voice , if it rose up and spoke , week by week , to the people - that is scarcely dreamed of . Now , the church ought to be a hundred times stronger than the minister . The pews ought to have more power than the pulpit . No minister has done his duty who is himself the central power in a congregation . He is to be a power-producer ; he is to see the success of his ministry in the church which lie builds up . And as the architect stands dwarfed and trembling in the presence of the cathedral which /z/ he has himself builded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all its arches are completed and all its pinnacles and spires lift up their heads to God everlastingly - so a pastor should stand in a vast disproportion of strength before the fullness of the power of his own church . For , can any one heart , either by original gift or by study , ever equal all the gifts which God bestows upon a hundred men Is not all the work of Christ in a hundred souls more rich and wonderful than ever can be a single individual 's experience ? Is there one flower created equal to a whole prairie or garden , sheeted with the light and perfumed with the fragrance of a hundred flowers growing in profusion God 's work in the human soul , day by day , is the most illustrious of all the events which history chronicles . Other events are more obvious , and more impressive to our vulgar senses , that love the flash and sound of physical deeds . But the watchings , the fears translated to victory , the faith and glow of love , the aspirations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God descending thence - there are no other things of such dignity as these , nor , when simply uttered , of such power . Indeed , the supremest power of Divine truth is not when it is uttered in idea-form , or as apprehended by intellect , but when eidiibited in heart-forms , or as it is evolved in actual life-experiences . And there is something sublime in the conception of a great assembly of men - holding forth some one truth , first by the voice of its teacher , and then reflecting upon it from a hundred hearts that light by which God taught it pecu /z/ Barij to them ; to tfiat 1 kngdi eadb riioiild bdiold the glowing truth , not m die narroir line of his own erperience , bat in the chattered foDneflB of die expenence of moltitndes . Such jveadbing bj the Toioe of the whole church woold hare a power with the commnnitr c which now we hare no idea except finom analogies . Let a hundred merchantB and gminfint mechanics - known and trosted men - gadier in smne rast hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some new method of gaining wealth . Let them , ( mebjcme ; , declare the reality of the riches , exhibit his own winnings , declare the facilitj with which thousands more could acqnire , and that joint testinumj of a hundred honest men would strike a ferer through a ci in a daj , and the veins and arteries of every occopation would throb with impatient desire . Snch is the power given to a truth when many men , corroborating it , give it a blessed panic-power . A truth borne forth upon the power of a single heart is great ; but what when it is sent forth upon the blasts of a thongand hearts ? We have made proof of truth-power only in narrow lines . There is to be a development , of which we suspect little , of the power of truth swept along the tide of enthusiasm which sympathetic multitudes give . Conversions , then , will be like lightning strokes . For it is not enough for a man to have an idea of truth - he needs to have a moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and give to the truth instantaneous and overwhelming power . Tliis cntljuBiasm comes from God . Like other gifts , it comes instrumentally . The simultaneous preach- /z/ ing of the Gospel by eommimities wiU be an infitrument of such results . The first step , then , toward a larger participation on the part of the congregation in public worship is to begin in the minister 's own heart and design . And so superficial a thing as a common form of prayer , or a joint confession , or a psalmic response , will not train a church . There must be a common life in the church . It must be a minister 's conception of his office and function , not merely to impart ideas ; but by an impartation of ideas , and feeling , and personal social influence , to impart a real , common religious life to the church . When that exists , there will be no more trouble about unity and interest in a congregation . They will be like a rich soil full of roots and seeds , that shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and species , yet growing in perfect harmony . But a dead church with a liturgy on the top of it is like a sand desert covered with artificial bouquets . It is bright for the moment . But it is fictitious and fruitless . There are no roots to the flowers . There is no soil for roots . The utmost that a liturgy can do upon the chilly bosom of an xmdeveloped , untrained church is , to cover its nakedness with a faint shadow of what they fain would have , but can not get . /z/ When a churcli is to be bnilt , the question usually is from the outside to the inside , and not from inside to out . It is not said , Here are a thousand people ; in our system of worship the effects to be produced require such and such conditions for the congregation , and the church building must go up around these uses and be but an instrument of them . " It is much more often the case that the question takes this form : " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be built ? Who shall be the architect ? How high shall the steeple be , and how fine can we afford to make the interior ? " Then , when these questions are settled , it is also , incidentally , a matter of consideration how to seat the people , and whether the building can be made available for hearing . As to the pulpit , but one thing is usually considered necessary , and that is , that it should be put as far as possible from all sympathetic contact with the people to be influenced by it ; that it should be so constructed as to take away from the speaker , as far as it can be done , every chance of exerting any influence upon tliose whom he addi'csses . Therefore the pulpit is ribbed up on the sides , set back against the wall , where it looks like a barn-swallow 's nest plastered on some beam . In this way the minister is as much as possible kept out of the way of the people , and all /z/ that IB left is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance or retreat , and that most effective of all gestures , the full form of an earnest man , from head to foot , right before the people ; in short , the whole advantage which the body gives when thrown into argument or persuasion , are lost without any equivalent gain . In this sacred mahogany tub or rectan.gular box , the man learns every kind of hidden awkwardness . He stands on one leg and crooks the other , like a slumbering horse at a hitching-post ; he leans now on one side of the cushion , or lolls on the other side . And when a man , thoroughly trained by one of these dungeon pulpits to regard his legs and feet as superfluous , except in some awkward and uncouth way to crutch him up ito the level of his cushion and paper , is brought out upon an open platform , it is amusing to watch the inconvenience to him of having legs at all , and his various experiments and blushing considerations of what he shall do with them I Is it any wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a great church , with a small congregation , so scattered that no two persons touch each other , the bust of a man , peering above a bulwark , reads a stale manuscript to people the nearest of whom is not less than twenty-five feet from him ? The wonder is that anything is ever accomplished . Daniel Webster is reported to have said , that no lawyer would risk his reputation before a jury if he had to speak from a pulpit , and that he considered the survival of Christianity in spite of pulpits as one of the evidences of its divinity . /z/ We do not vouch for the trath of this as an anecdote , but we indorse it as a truth in philosophy . Kext comes the question , shall we have an organ I What do they want an organ for We suspect that it would be difficult for the most part of the congregation to say , unless it were that other fashionable churches had organs ; or , that it formed a cheerful and pleasant interlude to the tediousness of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an Organ ! And the question is not , how large a one is needed ; but , how large a sum can be raised to buy it . K an organ of ten stops is good , it is innocently reasoned , an organ of twenty would be twice as good . As soon as it is known that an organ is to be built , down come the agents of various organ establishments , each one proving all the rest to be mere pretenders , and their work trash . Then comes bidding and underbidding . The builder that will give the most for the money is to have the job . One will , for the said immber of dollars , give fifteen stops , another twenty , another twenty-five , and so he gets the organ . Now , a stop , in the understanding of a church committee , is a small piece of wood sticking out of the organ by the side of the manuals , with a piece of ivory on the end of it , with some name cut and blacked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Choir , " " Op . Diapason , " " St. Diapason , " etc . Of course a skillful builder can easily multiply stops fast enough , if the church committee are only ignorant enough . To cut a stop in two , and give two registers to it , makes two out of one in a manner very inexpensive to the /z/ builder , and quite Batisfactoiy to most church committees . Or , to let a stop run only half way through the organ , speaking only either in the upper or the lower half ; or better yet , to let stops run in separate pipes through half the organ and then flow together into one series of pipes for the bass , so that , like a river , many small streams meet and go out to sea in one channel - these and many other methods enable a skillful organ-builder to gratify the vanity of a church and the solidity of his own pocket at the same time . But , when the organ is bought , put up , paid for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ good for , at any rate ? To what end is it put into the church ? Can any one tell lis ? Or , must we come back to the subject , and give our own notions ? /z/ Is any other place , fellow-citizeiiB , I Bhonld have claiined for myself to-day personal liberty and exemption from public service , but from my own city I can claim no sncli exemption , since I believe that every man ought to hold his services subject to the will and control of his fellow-citizens upon such an occasion as thi , in every way that shall conduce to virtue , to pubUc spirit and to patriotism . We have returned from the laying of the comer stone of a City Armory - a circumstance not of so much interest in itself as in the historic incidents connected with it . For , that structure is to stand upon the site of the old Free Library , the comerstone of which was laid some thirty-three years ago with imposing ceremonies . Officiating upon that occasion , and dignifying it by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lafayette , one of the few men whom we can afford heartily to praise - not his head at the expense of his heart , not his heart at the expense of his head , but head and heart and hand - the whole man together . His life will bear searching in youth , in middle age , in old age , and after his departure from life . You need hide nothing in the grave . /z/ PATRIOnSM AND LIBERTY . 265 We should speak well of Lafayette . He was one of those few men in whom the most romantic sentiment for liberty in youth , ripened , in manhood , into a moral principle enduring as life ! He was a man without guile , without selfishness ; a man whose very bread it was to love his fellow men . In his own land , and , in this , his second home - as much his own as France , and more - he demoted himself freely to the Tjrelfare of the people . He never retracted what he had said or done , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While thousands like him declared for liberty , when liberty was still in a state of fermentation , he , almost alone , among thousands of prominent men in Europe , remained its firm votary , sacrificing for liberty aldiost everything dear to manhood . That name is fitly associated with the name of Washington in the annals of our American liberty , and I count it a good omen - since so large a portion of our citizens are immigrants , and for years must continue to be - I count it a good omen that in looking back to our Kevolutionary heroes , there is scarcely a nation on earth that can not point to some distinguished officer , and say , " That man , who bled with your fathers for liberty , was of our blood . " It may seem , fellow-citizens , that the laying of the corner-stone of an armory is scarcely a tit occasion for me to dwell upon , or the day of the national independence a proper time to call out the enthusiasm of a man of my profession . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever any man should feel , I feel . Whatever any man should say , I ought to /z/ speak ; I am a citizen , a Christian citizen . Is anything higher than that ? I feel , therefore , that it is just as fitting that I should speak some words congenial to such an occasion as that any other man in the citizenship of this city should speak them . If it shall seem a bad auspice that a free library should give place to an armory , you will remember that the library found itself too strait , and so removed otherwhere , and the building had been appropriated to civil purposes , and finally had been abandoned even for these . Nothing , therefore , is sacrificed . " We may well take this occasion of the founding an armory , to consider the great difiference between our modem free cities and those of former days . They were beleagured with walls ; our walls are the bodies of free citizens ! movable walls , pedestrian walls . Wherever there is an enemy there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in other lands , we have no forts and citadels , if we except the household forts commanded by fathers and mothers , and garrisoned by them and their children . There never were more peaceful places than our citizen armories , where our citizen soldiers assemble to carry on the picturesque part of war , without risk or peril . Build , then , these peaceful Castles of Indolence for our citizen soldiery , and let them have a home among us . The very differences between our armories and those abroad are the differences between free cities in free America and the cities of the old and oppressed nations . /z/ But let me take occasion , upon the erection of this building , to speak of the better armories which have been long building among us , for I liold that our best armories are the houses which stand along our streets . Wherever you shall find a father and mother , and a houseful of children , there is the best commander , the best drill-sergeant , the best soldiers . The free and well-conducted families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intelligent laboring population - a population who labor , not drudge ; whose labor is not compulsory , enforced , stolid , but whose heads work first , and then animate their hands with brains to work more skillfully afterwards - cheerful , unrepining labor - these are our industrial armories . And at every point where you can congregate a band of these laborers , men who sing while they work , and come from town wiping the sundown sweat from their brows , to be cheered with the comforts of home , and wife , and children - these are our armories . Again , we have our schools , to which all our children have access . No matter how poor a man may be in money , if he is rich in children , those family jewels , his children shall have the benefit of our schools . They teach all alike , the children of all religious faiths , nationalities , ranks and conditions ; they teach them all the common ideas and duties of American citizens . These are our truest armories , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on to point to our churches , whence , as from a fount , we draw our truest notions of personal manhood , of personal liberty , of municipal privileges and municipal rights . These are some of the institu /z/ tions which supervise our domestic armories and make them efficient . The occasion of laying the comer-stone of the Free Library by the patriotic Frenchman , Lafayette , called together by diligent drunmiing and large counting eight thousand people . Tliis was the population of Brooklyn thirty-three years ago I Who then had the prescience by which he could have suspected such a day as this ? And if one had dared to say then that in tliirty-three years two hundred thousand inhabitants would have lived upon this side of the river , he would have bid fair for a berth in a lunatic asylum . Yet how has our population augmented beyond all anticipation ! Instead of that little cozy neighborhood village , we have become the third city in the Union . The third not alone arithmetically - for though a city requires men and women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By their heads , and hands , and hearts , their institutions , their homes , their industry , the men and women of Brooklyn have constituted a city of which men may be proud and boast . I think the sun does not upon earth shine upon a more fair and beautiful city . You may say that this is the adulation of a fond son , and that I think it meet to praise the place of my residence . Nevertheless , if I am deceived I am deceived , for I verily believe there is not upon this continent a site so beautiful , and so well adapted for forming a large permanent city . It can not be many years ( for we may look forward as well as look back ) - I think it can not be mav /z/ years before there will be half as many people living in Brooklyn as there were in the whole country when our war of Independence began . I think it not extravagant to say that if we go on prospering as we have for a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years we shall become the city second , perhaps , to but one on this continent . I do not know that I should make even that exception , for Brooklyn seems to be nearer to New York than New York is to herself . These cities , twelve miles long , on long , narrow islands , are not the cities to grow like your circular cities , which have room to spread in every direction , and we may yet swell our population beyond that of New Yorkl " We are destined to be an immense city , and it becomes us to lay well the foundations of these institutions which are to make our memory precious in time to come , and hand down to our childi-en a legacy better than that our fathers handed down to us . We have begun well in our schools and churches , already renowned , but there is still in our institutions a work for you and for me . " We shall not be true and faithful to our city and to the time in which we live if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the elements of civilization and progress than we received them . Standing here upon the day set apart to commemorate the achievements of our fathers , we ought not to forget that we are citizens , not only of this city , but also of this great republic . We remember and praise the suflFerings and achievements of our fathers , but they suffered and struggled willingly . For some years past , it would seem that the celebration of this 270 PATBuonsic and libekit. daj has been growiDg into disrepnte , and it is well to revive the cnstom . Some man snielv can alwars be fonud to speak worthily , wiselv , and well , on the great sabject of human rights and human liberty , to wliich the dav is sacred . What is the Fourth of July ? Is it only a day for explosion of powder , a day for outside show and celebration ? Is it not the day that stands for the establishment of liberty and for the rights of man ? Hie soundest and truest doctrine ever promulgated Was that sustained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that which mak ns what we are ; which makes this day the Sabbath of Liberty . Let me say a few words respecting our country , than which a fairer and nobler God never made . Methinks he hid it for ages behind the heap of ocean waters , that he might here at last build up a mighty Christian civilization , that should realize Hie fondest hopes and expectations of prophets and seers . So broad a land , so diversified in its treasures , so fertile in its soil , partaking the boon which every climate has to confer , stretching through so many lines of Iqngitudo in the West , so many of latitude in the North and so many in the South - so fair , so large and so rich a land , methinks the sun nowhere else beholds in his daily journey . God has poured a mixed people upon this land . Kaces mingled together make abettor population than consanguineous stocks . God has poured in hither lavishly from every nation . Some men leave their country , it is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tliey that are too restless and enterprising to remain at home fly to the /z/ New World . They whose young blood can not walk the old paces and take the old stale customs ; they are the men who fly their country for their own good , and pour upon these shores for ours . We take them as a tribute from every nation tinder the sun - the young , the earnest , the best blood , the motive power of . the nation . Such blood mingled with ours , if educated and Christianized , will give stamina , variety , genius , and all the elements of national power and progress such as were never before brought together . This is our population now . The Atlantic greets us on the East , we wash our feet in the Pacific , we dip our hands in the Gulf , we bathe our brow in the northern lakes ; on every side God gives no other boundaries than mighty oceans . Enclosed in this vast area , this nation is to make a mark in history which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate and diversity of interests is one great cause of danger ; - as ships built too long and not strong enough , are in danger of breaking in the middle , so we , with conflicting interests upon one side and upon the other , our citizens so separated by distance as to lack personal sympathy and frequeiit intercourse , are in like danger of parting somewhere . Besides this , there are men who would sacrifice their country for their own advancement , and there is nothing that can save this nation from the perils that siiri'ound it but a spirit of true religion and of that patriotism which true religion inspires , a sj ) irit that loves country not for self but for the country 's sake . 272 rATEionsM axd libeett . I am most happy , here at least , to claim for the Union , as most heartily I do , our undivided allegiance . For there is no sacrifice too great to pay for the union of these States , unless we sacrifice that for which the Union was first made - Liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union - we will give up many sectional points of pride , but when we are asked to give up the spirit which animated the men of the Kevolution - the spirit of Liberty - that we can never give up . We declare that any true- patriotism must be a patriotism which shall include in itself the knowledge and love of those principles well embodied in the Declaration of our Independence - the rights of man - the declaration that all men are bom free and equal . Patriotism without that is not patriotism in America . It may be patriotism in Austria , but not in America . The patriotism that does not include within itself the doctrine that every man has inalienable rights to life , liberty and property - the patriotism that leaves that out , is like a man without a heart or a head - a hollow corpse . We have had patriotism of all shapes and forms . Sometimes it goes up and down the country preaching Union and patriotism , but with everything of liberty left out . Our fathers embraced in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferings and struggles they maintained their declaration . Our patriotism must be a patriotism that takes in Maine , and New Hampshire , and Vermont , and Massachusetts , and Khode Island , and Connecticut , and New Jersey , and Ohio , and Penn- /z/ Bylvauia , and Virginia , and Delaware , and Maryland , and North Carolina and even South Carolina . Yes , and Georgia , Alabama , Louisiana , Mississippi and Arkansas , Tennessee and Kentucky , Ohio and dear old Indiana , and ' Illinois , and Missouri , bound for freedom , and Minnesota and " Wisconsin , and I know not how many besides . A voice , ' ' Kanas . " Yes , Kansas and California , and all the States , named and unnamed , that are and are yet to come . A patriotism it must be that shall take in every State that stands within the confederacy - a patriotism not for party broils , party spoils , squabbles , contention , wranglings and base ambitions ; but a patriotism that shall give to every one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty , liberty , nothing else than liberty I What are our Fourth-of-Julys from which these great truths are left out ? What is that patriotism which ignores , or daintily touches and passes by this greatest thought , this most noble heritage of civilization - liberty for every man ? This is a patriotism which will save our great country . I am not an ill-omened prophet : I do not believe we shall go to wreck ; I believe God built his temple on these shores . Although , like temples in other times , it may have been occasionally delayed and marred , in some parts at least , yet the temple is reared to Christ and to Liberty . I believe it will be perfected and God will preserve this nation by the instrumentality of your hearts , your hands , your heads , and by your fidelity to our original Eevolutionary principles . But , amid broils and high conflicts , be sure that it is safe /z/ to stand firmly upon the old truths . It is never safe to abandon our profession of faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation upon the shifting sands of expediency ! And whatever storms arise , whatever fierce winds blow , there is not other anchor for us but that goodly anchor of Liberty ! Never be ashamed of it . Speak it out , openly , boldly , sincerely , and let your life corroborate your words . Kemember that discussion should ever be free . Let us remember the duty of toleration of men that differ in the extremest points from us . Let us accord to them that right which we assert for ourselves - the right to believe what we will - the right to defend what we think - the right to express what we believe . Their rights and ours are the same , and if upon that common freedom Liberty can not stand , let her go to the ground . I am not afraid to venture . Give us freedom of speech and action , and this land will shake the dust of oppression from her garments and stand forth the virgin daughter of God , free , blessed and blessing ! I have been asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the ladies of America , who are now engaged in the work of purchasing the grounds and tomb of Washington , at Mount Yernon ; and with this I shall fitly close . Is it fit that women should rise up in the perturbed state of the Union , and should everywhere , as they do , beg . for peace and honorable conciliation . Yon will remember that when Christ had slept three days , and many thought the world was empty of him , that it was the women who went to the sepulchre. , asking as PATBIOnSM AND LEBEBTY. 275 they went , who shall roll away the stone , and that , when they reached the tomb , the stone was rolled away , and an angel sat upon it . Now the women of America go to the tomb of Washington , and who will roll away the stone ?
