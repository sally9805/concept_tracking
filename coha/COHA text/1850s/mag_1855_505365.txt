txt WHAT WE DRINK . TERRIBLE were the punishments suffered by the guilty dwellers in Tartarus ; but th' greatest of all seemed , even to the ancients , the anguish endured by a monarch whom the gods had once loved as companion , and now in their fury exposed to incredible torture . lie had eaten their bread and drank of their nectarwhat wonder that earthly food pleased his fastidious palate no longer ? The red wine of Phrygia , his own kingdom , could no long r make merry his heart , and his soul longed for the precious drink of the gods on Olympus . In an evil hour he forgot himself and carried some with him to his earthly home . The indignant masters of heaven and earth condemned him for such grievous misdeed to suffer everlasting thirst in the dark regions where Pluto reigned supreme , and the souls of the wicked met their reward . There the unfortunate king stood , day after day , in the midst of sweet swelling waters , that ever rose playfully , temptingly up to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the very instant when relief seemed at hand , and torturing thirst about to be quenched . Could human ingenuity devise a more fearful infliction of ceaseless pain , adding to all the horrors of fiercest bodily suffering the soul 's unutterable , ever-new anguish ? And yet men daily endure like sufferings now on the earth . The weary wanderer through the desert , and the bold mariner in the seas of the Arctic , the becalmed sailor in the Tropics , and the lost emigrant crossing the vast dry plains of the Far West-all succumb to the same dread enemy , Thirst , or , if they escape by the mercy of God , remember ever after the days of their torture with shuddering horror . For " even the youths shall be faint and weary , " and painful beyond words is that feeling when the " heart sinks , " and the soul longeth to part from the earth-born body . A fierce tyrant is Hunger , and grimly it gnaws at our strength , until even the strong are " burnt with hnnger and devoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants , that try the soul of man as in a furnace , is Thirst . It breaks the tower of man 's fortitude , it loosens even the silver cords of the strongest of earthly affections , the love of a mother : " And the water was spent in the bottle , and Hagar cast the child under one of the shrubs ; and she went and set her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bowshot , for she said , Let me not see the death of the child . And she sat over against him , and lifted up her voice and wept . " As man drinks sooner in life than he eats , so thirst ever remains a harder master than hunger . It calls more frequently for satisfaction ; it punishes neglect much sooner , and with more fearful sufferings . Among animals , the temperature of the blood seems largely to influence the demands of thirst ; cold-blooded reptiles , for instance , are supposed to be able to live for years without moisture . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to endure thirst for several days in succession , Nature having endowed it with an interior cistern , where water is long preserved without change , and gradually only absorbed through the body . Men can rarely exist for more than a few days without moisture ; but a small quantity , imbibed by the means of solid food , is sufficient , and , in diseases , the admission of water // in baths , through the pores of the skin , will supcart life for a time . Thirst , like hunger , is one of those sensations by which our good mother , Nature , reminds us daily and hourly that we are born of the dust of the earth , and must , therefore , ever be carePal to supply our bodily frame with the elements needed for its existence . The silent monitor makes itself most felt in the palate and throat ; a slight trial , however , convinces us soon that the sensation extends through the whole of the body . To moisten the mouth , or even to hold a cooling piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a deception , bo*ever , only of our senses ; while even the parched wanderer , who has at last reached the welcome fountain and drank to his heart 's coutent , feels true relief only after a time , when the grateful liquid has passed from vein to vein and filled the whole structure with its magic miniature waves . Immense quantities , therefore , are ever required to supply the unceasing demand . Man consists , for nearly two-thirds of his whole substance , not of solids but of liquid water , and much as we imbibe , in the process of breathing , from the water contained in the atmosphere , much still remains to be furnished by actual drinking . The demand is increased by the rapid passage of the fickle element through our body , and its restless desire to leave us again . Countless pearly drops press through every pore of the skin-in winter , invisible to the naked eye ; in summer , of tangible size . When Captain Ross , in one of his North Pole expeditions , devised an ingenious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it filled every week large copper pans , with two or three bushels of solid ice ! Various , therefore , are the means hy which man tries to satisfy the cravings of this sternest of taskmasters . Nature herself provides for the helpless infant , as for the young of all mammaha , their own first beverage , which is to them both food and drink . But even for riper years the milk of animals serves the same purpose , whether we drink it fresh as it foams into the milking-pail , or let it form rich and nutritious butter . Eastern nations prefer it sour and curdled ; in the icy North the fat is removed for other ends , and the whey alone used as a beverage . Millions of cows and goats , of sheep even and mares , are kept for the milk they afford to their owners , mostly nomadic tribes . The Tartar , and the Calmuck of the Steppes in the East , and many a tribe near the great Afr.ican desert , know not our domestic cattle , and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mares , their favorite lebea . The Lapp , on the contrary , and some of his northern brethren , depend for their existence upon the reindeer , the only resource and support of almost all polar tribes . Countless herds of this beautiful animal roam over the vast plains that slope down toward the eternal ice of the Arctic seas ; frugal like no other being on earth , they live upon the stunted growth of dwarfish trees , a few rare herries that the short summer may ripen , and the humble moss , bid under the sheltering cover of deep , close snow . But , of an evening , when the faint light of the sinking sun casts a brownish-red sheen on the gray desolate mountains , while the valleys are filled with cheerless , chilly mists , and dark night broods on the silent waters , a strange , spectral noise is heard from afar , as of the dry bones shaking , bone to bone , in the open valley of the prophet . It approaches , and soon the low barking of dogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , is heard to mingle with the increasing clamor . At last , as if on the wings of the tempest , a forest of bare branches is seen suddenly to pierce the gray sky on every bill and every mountain . Thousands and thousands of light , graceful antlers , looking for all the world like dry , leafless trees in a wintry forest , are clearly defined on the bright background . They are the reindeer that the poor Lapps have driven up from their distant pasture ; patiently these humble but useful friends of man come to his camp , for the sake of a few handfuls of leaves , or even more miserable food . They know , season after season , no roof but the heavens above them , no litter but the cold snow that covers the earth . Their scanty food and consequent small supply of milk makes three or five hundred necessary for a single family ; so thousands have to he driven into immense pens for the sake of the few females among them . The Lapp calls them one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name also that was given them at their birth ; ties each to a pole , and then most painfully milks them . Fortunately for the poor sons of the North , their milk is perhaps the very richest we know , and as nutritious as it is palatable . Little of it , however , is actually drunk ; the Lapp especially much prefers it smoked in the animal 's stomach , or , if too poor to buy costly flour , thickened with the blood of the reindeer . If the milk of other animals is mainly used for medicinal purposes only , there is at least one vegetable also that gives milk of surpassing richness and pleasant taste . This is the so-called cow-tree-one of the wonders of the vegetable kingdom in tropical regions . Besides milk , no other animal matter is used to quench thirst , unless it be for want of ordinary means , and in cases of great misfortune . The Greenlander , it is true , drinks with avidity almost incredible quantities of train oil ; and all over the Arctic regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same purpose . Blood is but rarely drank by man : the Esquimaux , burning with pitiless thirst , and the fierce Indian , exhausted and helpless in the silent plain , seek , perhaps , a moment 's relief in the blood of the captured seal or the slain buffalo ; but the nations of the earth seem still to hear in their hearts the voice of him that said : " Ye shall eat no manner of blood , whether it be of fowl or beast , in any of your dwellings 1 " There is , then , but one beverage common to // qwq of primeval forests is built near the gushing spring ; and even theblood-thirsty savage reveres the sacred fountain . Nor does civilization feel itself more independent ; each gushing brook , each bend of a river , and each bay as the coast soon sees a settlement rise by its side , and man has abandoned the humbler spring only to prefer the fuller stream . But what is the stream , after all , but the effect of united springs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its rivers , life has been first awakened , progress been seen , and power gained . What wonder , then , that the races of antiquity worshiped their mighty rivers : the Hebrew his Jordan ; the Egyptian , in his Lotusmysteries , the life-giving Nile ; and the Indian his Ganga  --  the goddess of purity-in his holy Ganges ? Abraham grazed his herds by the sweet waters that the Lord had given him ; and she that stood by the well of water , and gave to drink to the foreigner and to his camels also , even Rebecca , became the mother of thousands of millions . In holy reverence did Greeks and Romans surround their springs with costly marble , and erected over them temples to nymphs and naiads . The old Germans connect with springs their sweetest songs of elf and of fairy ; and Undine lives now , as of old , in the minds of all who love to dream in forest solitude and by enchanted fountains . And who that has ever traveled , day after day , through the endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning sand beneath him-where the ground glows with intense heat , and the air is still as if out of breath , will ever forget what he felt when , far , far on the horizon , like a dream of the Sahara , a faint shadow greeted his weary eye ? And lo ! amidst the ocean of sand a lofty palm-tree rose  --  a being of a higher world it seemed to himwaving welcome from afar , and bending gracefully over the inexpressibly sweet green island beneath it . How the blood rushed to the anxious heart , how gentle dreams led all his senses captive , when his eye first caught , or thought to catch , the sheen of still waters deep in the dark shadow ! What to Eastern lands and tropical regions was thus a first and indispensable necessity , was long considered a luxury only among Northern races . The Romans alone , grand in all that they once undertook , and the sagacious Arabs , saw the wisdom of an ample supply of water for city and country . The great mistress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aqueducts , besides the magnificent Aqua Appia ; so that Augustus could reply to the discontented Romans , who asked , besides bread , for wine also , that they had already a blessing above all cities on earth , an abundance of pure and salubrious water . The quantity daily distributed was as large as the cost was insignificant , and neither the famous works of Athens nor those of Corinth could vie with the massive structures of Rome . What the Arabs have done to quench the parched palate of the dry and weary lands of Spain , still shows even after these six bundred years . Their system of irrigation , though long in ruins , is still the marvel and admiration of all Europe ; and many a useful , invaluable lesson has been learned , a few years ago , by scholars and farmers , sent there for the purpose by the governments of France , Germany , and England . That our century has at last seen the expediency not only , but the absolute necessity of an almost unlimited supply of clear , pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a progress our age may well boast of , and in which our own country stands foremost among the nations of the earth . Science has lent its aid to determine the nature of water in its best application to the various purposes for which it is used . In nature , we all know , it is never quite pure , but it does not always reveal to the eye its foreign contents . Even the rain-drops from heaven contain much matter that they have found time , in their rapid fall , to absorb from the air . Still , they give the purest water we know , if caught from the heavens directly . The water of springs is purest , and , at the same time , freshest and clearest , when it passes through sandstone or granite , while limestone leaves in it particles which affect both its taste and medicinal effects . But , in fact , all springs give but so-called mineral waters , and the brightest and clearest are by no means the purest , but , when carefully filtered , exhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cautious of watchmen , the tongue , could discover . Wells furnish a supply that differs not in purity , but in the nature only of the foreign bodies with which it is loaded . Near houses in town , all kinds of animal and vegetable matter are mixed with the water before it reaches the surface : in the country the latter prevails almost exclusively . Dew and rain , as well as the thousand invisible rills that are ever silently at work beneath our feet , carry , industriously , atom after atom into the soil , and thus , by degrees , into the wells from which we are supplied with water . What the latter may be in the neighborhood of the grave-yards , which have long disgraced the most populous quarters of European cities , we prefer leaving to the imagination . The soft water of rivers is the impurest of all , except the briny floods of the ocean . They betray , in bright colors , the nature of their impurities to the eye . The glaciers of Iceland and the slopes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the sterile plains at their feet . Streams that pass through boggy lakes or peaty regions emerge as brown as they are bitter , and rocks of red marl will burden their rivers with brilliant oxide of iron . Man has , however , not only become accustomed to these undesired solid additions to his daily beverage , but seems to reward his struggle with a special delight in the taste of muddy waters . The dusky fluid of the Nile is sweet to the palate , and the children of Egypt long and yearn for its water as the Swiss does for his sweet home in the mountains . The sacred Ganges // WHAT WE DRINK . rewards the faithful , who carry its waters to the most distant provinces , with abstract blessings and with a sensual enjoyment . Our own Mississippi water , so repugnant to the traveler at first sight , is a favorite with the dweller in the South , who prefers even its natural color and foreign contents . Generally , however , the water of riters is clarified : that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel in which it is kept ; that of the Nile by a similar use of bitter almonds . Thus we are taught in Johnston 's admirable books , the bitter waters of Marnh were made sweet by the use of a tree that the Lord showed Moses . Besides the means offered by Nature 's bountiful band to quench our thirst , we drink vast quantities of water in the solid food we eat to allay our hunger . Fruits , especially , consist largely of water , some to the amount of ninety per cent. , as gourds , melons , and cucumbers . Directly , only few vegetables afford us a liquid . Such are the nepenthes of Ceylon and the Moluccas , and a number of similar plants , provided by our kind mother Earth with ample stores of water for the weary traveler and the exhausted cattle . On this continent , also , they are not wanting , wherever their extraordinary aid is most needed . The melo-cacti of South America have even earned the well-deserved name of " springs of the desert . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more than an inch of soil , they live modestly on the vapors of the air , keep their rich treasure of water in safe vessels guarded by formidable spikes and thorns , and surrender it only when " the poor and needy seek for water , and there is none , and the tongue faileth for thirst . " Their charity , taught them from on high , has instilled the same feeling even in the breast of the savage . Wherever they thrive , the touching custom prevails , that every traveler , as he passes one of the number , draws the never-missing knife , and lops off branches and thorns , that the poor parched horses of the wilderness , who " pant as the hart panteth after the waterbrook , " may safely approach and enjoy the refreshing liquid that restores them to life . Man is , strangely enough , but rarely content to enjoy the rich gifts of nature in their first simple garb . He adapts it to climate and occupation ; he fashions it after his taste , and makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , when first discovered by Russian sailors , were probably the only nation on earth that had no other beverage but water , enjoyed it after a manner not found in civilized countries . They commenced to drink it even before eating , taking nearly two quarts before their first meal ; so they continned during the day , and , when night came , their last labor was to place a huge vessel of water by their bedside , and to fill it brimful with snow and ice . Next morning the bucket was empty ! The Lapp and the Greenlanders , on the other hand , prefer it warm . Both nations keep a large copper kettle , or , where such luxuries are still unknown , a ponderous vessel of wood , adorned with bone knobs and hoops , constantly boiling . A large , well-carved spoon is ever ready , and from morn till night the thirsty natives are drinking the nauseous liquid . Even civilized nations , however , have made the use of water much a matter of fashion . At certain times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at the beginning of this century it was thought a dangerous habit to take it unmixed , but within a few years it has risen to the dignity of a most useful medicine , if not of a panacea of unfailing virtue . Its healing powers , however , have always been gratefully acknowledged . Naaman was told by the prophet to bathe in the waters of Jordan , and Patroclus washed the wounds of his friend Euripides , received at the siege of Tiny , simply with water . The hydropathists of our day but repeat experiments known to the ancients , by drenching us inside and outside in ice-cold water . On the other hand , we find that the ingenuity of even the lowest races , has long since invented means to improve the simple and natural taste of water by an admixture of other substances . These are mostly vegetables , fruits , leaves , or roots , over which water is poured , fermented , or distilled . The simplest of these are probably poisonous mushrooms , used by the natives of Siberia , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though quite natural manner , from drinker to drinker . The South American loves his kawa , a mixture requiring much care and labor . The men cut down a parrigudo tree , frequently found in Brazilian forests , and form of it a natural vessel of goodly size . Then come the women , and crouchingaround it , go lustily to work chewing maize , batates , and maniot , and deposit the produce from their mouths directly into the tree . The mixture stands thus : mixed with water and the rising sap of the tree , for sixteen hours and ferments ; thence it is drawn on festivals and great occasions , and is highly intoxicating . The most savage races on earth have all their favorite mixture of this kind : the South Sea Islanders their kawa , made from a pepper plant , and the negroes of Africa their walo . Our North American Indians are said to be the only race lacking such beverage . In Europe water is used unmixed only in the north and the extreme south ; while the regions where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Orient , however , it constantly appears artificially cooled by means of snow or ice , and mingled with coloring or aromatic substances , which generally give it the name of sorbet . Where the water is bad , as in Petersburg and in Paris , the latter custom is almost universal , to commend the impure beverage to the eye as well as to the palate . Mohammedans , living in hot countries , and by their faith prevented from seeking refreshment in wine , possess a thousand forms of cooling sorhets , to which they add , besides the usual vegetable jucies , also musk , ambergris , aloes , and other // aromas . Every household of a certain size has a special servant for the preparation of sorbets , and in the seraglio of the Sultan this important duty forms a separate department under a high officer . The Turks set great store by the rich vessels of crystal and the costly , well-carved spoons which serve in the enjoyment of the luxurious drinks . The French are , in a similar manner , famous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of refreshing heverages , which they call , from the fruits that are used , orgeade , orangeade , etc . The East of Europe has , for the same purpose , its favorite quass , a thin infusion of harley in water , mixed with fragrant herhs and plants , sourish to the taste , and far from being aromatic  --  the disgust of the foreigner , and the delight of the native . All over Russia the streets are filled with venders of this popular liquid in barrels or bottles , and in most houses of humbler pretension an ever-filled bowl may be found , with a large wooden spoon swimming in it , to which all are welcome . Next to water , wine is probably the most popular beverage among men . It is certainly a strange psychological fact , not yet satisfactorily explained , that from time immemorial , nearly every nation on earth has sought some means for raising its condition of mental activity by artificial stimulants . The desire seems to be instinctive ; its gratification , enjoyed with moderation , is probably useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , necessarily fatal . Such is the variety of means employed for the purpose , that theymay he divided fairly into three distinct classes : cold drinks , consisting mostly of the fermented juices of fruits or other parts of vegetables ; warm drinks , procured by an infusion of hot water on plants ; and narcotics , which are , even in smallest quantities , poison , and , if repeated , cause a quick destruction of man 's physique . The latter can , therefore , not properly be classed among the common beverages of man , and will here be mentioned no further . The simplest wine known is the juice of the palm-tree , the best adapted for that purpose , both on account of its surprising copiousness and its vinous sweetness . The sap of all trees has more or less similar qualities : the birch provides the native of the icy North with a sweet juice ; the maple furnishes ample sugar ; the palm , however , is the richest of all . From the gentle Hindoo in the Far East of India to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our West to the fierce savage of Oceania , all know these secret treasures of nature and use them , each in his way . The thirsty negro of tropical regions climbs , cat-like , to the towering height of a palm-tree ; a few inches below its beauteous crown he bores a small hole , inserts a leaf rolled in the shape of a tube , and fastens to its end a light calabash . The datepalm gives a quart every month ; fresh , the wine resembles whey in appearance , tastes pleasantly , and is cool and refreshing . After some hours it fermcuts and becomes genuine wine , with considerable intoxicating power . The cocoa-palm also furnishes wine from a simple incision into the fully-developed bud ; in a few hours it produces large quantities of an extremely wholesome and palatable drink , which subsequently changes into wine , and even becomes slightly effervescent . The richest of all is the oil-palm on the gold coast of Africa : for five weeks a tree of only seven years ' growth give daily more than a quart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nature is the chicha , a wine made of the American agave , and now known among us also under the Mexican name of pulque . The ancient Mexicans already knew the attractive qualities of the luscious drink , and we are told that their successors remained in no way behind them ; in the year 1774 not less than two millions of arobes were drunk in the capital of their country alone ! The remarkable plant that serves to produce it flowers not until the eighth or tenth year ; then , it is well-known , a gigantic chandelier , with massive , countless branches , rises to a towering height , and presents one of the grandest sights in the vegetable kingdom . At the time when the flowering stem is about to be developed , an extraordinary quantity of sap flows toward the bud . Then the heart-leaves are cut out , and a hollow thus formed in the plant itself , in which the sweet juice soon collects . Three times a day the liquid is drawn off for several months , and one well-grown agave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the space of a single month . Large fields are covered with the useful plant all over lofty tablelands of Mexico , and the extent of its cultivation may be judged from the fact that a slight tax produced in three States only the immense sum of a million of dollars . The beverage itself is the fermented juice , generally enriched by fragrant herbs and spices ; foreigners like not its decayed , disagreeable odor , but few can , after a while , resist the attraction of the acidulous , very slightly-intoxicating drink . The wine of the grape dates back to farthest antiquity , and the oldest nations knew both its use and its abuse . " Noah planted a vineyard , and he drank of the wine and he was drunken . " The whole Word of God abounds with references to the grape and its precious fruit . The promised land produced it in unheard of luxury ; the gigantic cluster brought back by the spies is familiar to all ; and afterward it was said : " He washed his garments in wine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often praised . When the vine was asked to become king over all plants , it is made to reply : " Should I leave my wine , which cheereth God and man ? " and the Psalmist tells us that God causes it to grow to produce " wine that maketh glad the heart of man , " and even counsels us " to give wine to those that are of heavy hearts . " Nor are its dangers less clearly exhibited . Its use was forbidden to Nazarites forever , and to priests while engaged in the tabernacle ; and the fearful warning // is added , " Weep and howl all ye drinkers of wine 1 " That it was , however , not exactly considered the root of all evil , may be judged from the frequency with which even the Savionr compares himself to the vine , from the first of all recorded miracles , and the doubtlessly well-weighed words of the inspired Apostle : " Let no man judge you for eating or drinking . " The grape is likewise a constant symbol on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press for the making of wine hy its side , in the very shape which is still nsed all over the Orient . The home of the generous plant is said to be between the Ararat and the Caucasus , where it has ever grown wild on rocky mountain sides , and where from the earliest times the natives have known how to obtain wine from the carefully-gathered berries . It seems soon to have become the favorite plant of the Greeks , who ascribed its introduction from India to their great god Dionysius , and carried it with them to colonies and distant countries . They honored the drapes , with corn and the olive-tree , as direct gifts from heaven , and celebrated the precious present with annual feasts and sacrifices . The mysteries of Bacchus were the most brilliant of ancient Hellas , and long survived all the others . The works of Hesiod and the hymns of Homer are full of the praise of the grape , but their very evidence shows that it was honored even long before that period in Asia Minor and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grape gathering ; and the vines in the garden of Alcinous are said to have yielded rich vine in abundance . The very oldest tombs found in Greece , vases and even sarcophagni , are covered with pictures of all the gay scenes of Southern life connected with the harvest of grapes . The state itself protected the culture of this precious gift of Nature , and Aristotle even treated it as a matter of science . His pupil Theophrastus went still farther ; he wrote a most valuable work on the vine , and carried the plant itself to the island of Lesbos , where its luscious fruit very soon became famous . Rome learned to appreciate the generous beverage later and much more slowly . The grape seems to have been rare in the earliest days of the rising empire , for Romulus sacrificed to the gods milk and not wine , and Numa Pompilius , with a wise regard for economy , even forbade the offering of wine at the burning of the dead , universal as that custom seems otherwise to have been in antiquity . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant but vines from distant lands , from Greece , Syria , and all Asia , were largely cultivated throughout Italy , and authors sang their praises , from Cato and Yarro in their sober though eloquent treatises , to the pains-taking Pliny and the enthusiastic encomiums of the excellent connoisseur Horace . Still the ancient Romans seem to have been most temperate in the use of wine . .2Elian tells us that a youth of noble parentage 501 was , by the laws of Rome , not allowed to drink wine before his thirty-fifth year , and women never . A wife forfeited her dowry if she ever drank more than her thirst required , and a Roman citizen was acquitted in court , who had killed his wife when he found her drinking wine by herself ! Pompeii , on the other hand , abounds with pictures of grapes and wine in connection with the worship of Bacchus ; and soon there was no portion of the continent to which the victorious legions of Rome had not carried the fruit of the vine . Diocletian had given it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . The vineyards of the Rhine and Moselle , so famous in our day , owe their existence to Emperor Probus ; but the most favored regions seem then to have been the rich slopes of the Alps toward the Danube , for already under Augustus Rhatian grapes were imported in Rome . Nor were other and more distant countries without the desired plant . Herodotus speaks of grape culture in Egypt ; and the ancient and venerable Edda tells us of wine being a favorite beverage even of the dwellers in snow-covered Iceland . The great codes of law , gradually establishing their beneficent authority in the newly-formed kingdoms of Europe , keep us , step by step , informed of the gradual increase of this remarkable branch of agriculture ; the Salic Law and the codes of Burgundians and Visigoths abound with rules and regulations . The main impulse , however , given to the culture of the grape in Europe seems to be due to Christianity . Its connection with the miracles of our Lord , his frequent allusions and comparisons in parable and exhortation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own precious blood , shed for sinful man , made it dear to the heart of all Christians , and gave it a sacred prestige . The Church itself favored its cultivation ; convents and churches loved to surround themselves with extensive vineyards , and the Benedictines especially scattered them all over Europe , seeking ever , with innate taste and marvelous tact , the fairest positions and finest views on God 's beautiful earth . The princes and masters of the land followed the lofty example , and even Charlemagne thought it important to give special laws in his Capitularies for the protection of grapes and vines . Now the noble plant may be found all over Europe except England and Scandinavia , where a rigorous climate forbids the planting of vineyards . Those of the Rhine , though producing most generous wines , present but a stunted growth of little more than a foot 's height , and bound up to dry , unbecoming sticks ; in France and Spain the vine is allowed a wider range , and assumes a richer foliage , but in Italy alone it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uncontrolled , freely from tree to tree , loaded with luscious grapes , and swinging in graceful garlands across field and meadow . Nor has it become a stranger , even under Mohammedan rule , in its own native country . // The " Faithful " love wine and drink it not less than the " infidel " Christians , in spite of the prohibition of the Koran ; and the Arahs know it by more than one hundred and thirty names , though they never call it by that used in their Holy Book , when they drink it . In the Caucasus , and on the shores of the Black Sea , the vine still grows wild , and is largely cultivated . Persia produces forty kinds of wine ; the best in Shiraz and Ispahan , the latter of which is justly considered as of surpassing flavor and power . here , however , as almost all over the Orient , the Mohammedan plants not and presses nothe only drinks . Armenians and Guebers are generally the husbaudmen , Jews the traders . In Armenia , Miagrelia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nevertheless , their pride and particular boast , which they are fond of exhibiting to strangers . Large subterranean rooms , lighted up by magnificent windows on high , and covered with costly carpets , are lined on all sides with gigantic hogsheads . These are quitQ ornamental , and different from ours ; they are made of burnt clay and lined with the fat of the enormous tails of the sheep of those countries . Guests are seated on rich divans near a brilliant fountain in the centre , around which stand countless bottles in grand array ; niches , also , in the walls are filled with red and white vessels , ever ready to disgorge their fragrant contents . Unfortunately , the Mahommedan has no notion of any enjoyment of wine , apart from the exhilarating inebriety it produces , and hence the melancholy excess to which they are almost invariably led by indulgence . " They rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink , " and " they tarry long at the wine , even unto evening . " To drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who obey the Koran , and the very consciousness of the unlawful act they commit leads , no doubt , to an instinctive desire to drown conscience and scruples in intoxication . Africa* also , has its grapes at both extremes  --  the North and the farthest South-where the Cape produces its famous Constantia , by the initiated considered the very prince of wines . Peru and Mexico have occasional vineyards , and our own great Republic might , with greater care , and some protection from Congress , soon produce an abundance of indigenous wine , equally attractive by its purity and its cheapness . Wine seems to have been drunk pure by some nations , and mixed by others . Job testified to its abundance as a beverage , when he is told , " Thou hast not given wine to the weary to drink ; " and Isaiah has been quoted as an adocate of pure wino in the reproachful words , " Thy silver has become dross , and thy wine mixed with water . " In general , however , both Greeks and Romans considered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mark of intemperance to drink wine unmixed  --  a custom , they said , fit for Scythians and other barbarians , but unbecoming civilized nations . The Germans , however , seem to have enjoyed a like abundance , and yet to have used their very light and acid wines unmixed with water . During the whole of the Middle Ages , wine was the universal drink in the lands watered by the Rhone , the Rhine , and the Danube ; and the beggar received , as a matter of course , with his crust of bread also a goblet of wine . Even now , if *vines are mixed , it is not from choice , but from necessity ; as with the famous wine of Silesia , which is so very sour and astringent that its enemies say it serves the poor to mend their limbs . Vinegar appears as a beverage only in a few countries , and then for special purposes . Roman soldiers received it as a refreshing drink on their marches ; and even in the times of Constantine their rations included vinegar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , however , probably not the liquid known as such to us , hut like that offered to our Saviour , made of small wine . In our days , vinegar is much used in the East and in our own Southern States , as a cooling drink for those who labor hard in the heat of the sun . Mixed with water , Roman reapers already used it , as Theocritus tells us in his tenth idyl ; and long before that , Ruth was directed to " dip her morsel in the vinegar " when she gleaned the field of Boaz . Inferior by far , and yet hardly less universal as a beverage , is the modern rival of wine , beer . Even in antiquity it can vie with the fruit of the grapes ; for the old Egyptians already knew it , and the natives of Pelusium revered it as a gift of their great god Osiris . Made originally of barley , the degenerate sons of the Pharnobs , the Fellabs , now brew it of oats  --  a drink as expressive of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar legend : Archilochus and most of the great tragic poets speak of " barleywine ; " and from Diodorus and Pliny we learn that they knew not only a zythus , or small-beer , but also a dizythus  --  the double X of the English . From Isidor of Sevilla we learn that the Romans , to whom beer was probably even more familiar than to us , called it Cerevisia , as a precious gift of Ceres , and esteemed it most highly as a pleasant , and especially wholesome beverage . The old Germans knew it also , when Tacitus first saw their country , and used it instead of wine ; brewing it from barley , they called it ( from bere ) beer ; while the Scandinavians gave it the name of oil the Enalish ale . Other and distant nations are equally familiar with the refreshing drink . That of the Chinese resembles our own exactly ; the natives of Africa prepare it of millet and sesamum , the Mexcans make it of maize . Beer , like wine , owed its gradual improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first brewed with healthgiving hops , and in larger quantities ; thus it became a truly wholesome beverage , and fit for keeping . In England and l*orthern France it soon superseded the fruit of the grape , and thus drove the limit of that plant further south , good beer b*in0 naturally preferred to bad wine . // WHAT WE DRINK . Thus vineyards disappeared and made way for the beautiful hop plantations of England . Dnring the last thirty years a variety , called lager bier , has much prevailed in Germany and even in the United States . Neither the water from which it is made , nor a peculiar mode of brewing , are the cause of its pleasant taste that has made it so universally popular . The secret is , simply , that it is kept in an even temperature of fifty degrees . For this purpose vast cellars are built , or even , as in Munich , its first home , large mountains artificially raised . In this country , deep excavations or cellars hewn out of the live rock are used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plead that it favors the cause of true temperance by superseding , with a light , wholesome , and innocent drink , the dangerous combination of wine and brandy . If wine may thus be considered the favorite and characteristic beverage of the South , and beer that of the German race , mend appears as the only drink peculiar to Northern nations . Though we know not what may have been the nectar and ambrosia of the gods on Olympus , we are fully let into the secrets of the simpler table of the gods in Waihalla . Here mead alone was drunk by all ; and such were its mysterious virtues that the great Odin required no solid food , but lived exclusively upon the heavenly liquor . It has , of course , lost such supernatural powers , since a heretic world believes no longer in the ancient gods ; but it still re* mains a favorite drink in all countries that produce its main element , honey . To Scandinavia and Northern Russia , we must therefore add Poland and Russia , together with most Slavic lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition of berries and spices , and even exported . On the whole , however , it is gradually disappearing before its formidable rival , the beer of the Germans . A similar fate threatens the fermented juice of various kinds of fruits , known among us as cider . A cheap and common beverage , it was long used extensively on board ship , probably from an instinctive sense of its power to counteract scurvy . In Europe it has unfortunately given way before the increasing ravages of that dread enemy of man , alcohol . There is an opinion prevailing , that we owe this great curse to the East , and it . is certain that some such beverage has been familiar to all Asiatic nations from time immemorial . The Chinese , whose sad privilege it seems to be to have had every thing before every body else , and yet to have nothing , have ever made brandy from their grapes , which they use not for wine . It is a nauseous drink , taken in small cups , and highly intoxicating . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milky juice of cocoa-nuts which has been distilled . Much of this is made in Batavia and Gon , and thus finds its way through Holland into Europe ; the greater quantity , however , goes to Arabia . The Arabs themselves claim , strangely enough , to be the inventors of brandy , and sustain their claim by a large production and a still larger consumption of the tempting poison . The Persians have their kohemaar , which they distill from the kernals of certain fruits , and sell in particular houses ; though highly intoxicating in itself , they add to its injurious strength by small quantities of hemp-seed . Throughout nearly the whole of Asia , among the Kalmucs and all Eastern Mougol nations , a kind of powerful brandy is made from the milk of mares . They allow the fresh-drawn milk to stand a day or two in open , dirty vessels , where it turns sour , and is stirred from time to time . The butter is next removed , and then the women establish a rude apparatus for distilling , making their vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone does not answer , lamb 's meat with sour milk is added , and the quaint mixture , so oddly treated , produces a very powerful and highly-intoxicating drink . From the Mongols the custom soon spread to Russia , where brandy became such a favorite , that even the great Peter was constantly not only royally but imperially drunk . lie allowed , however , not all of his subjects to enjoy themselves to the same extent , and his favorite Strelitz , who alone were permitted to drink it , had to live in a separate quarter of the town , " not to give too bad an example . " How universal the habit was , and how fearful the effect , may be judged from the fact , that the Cossacks , who , after the fall of Napoleon , found their way through Germany into France , rushed first into the drug shops of captured cities to enjoy huge draughts of aqua fortis . Brandy found its may next to Finland and Scandinavia , where , as in Germany , it was long sold as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still imported from abroad . In the mean time , however , merchants who had learned to know it from the Arabs , had brought it to Italy and France , where chemists and apothecaries mainly distilled it and sold it under the name of aqua vitce , as an elixir against all diseases . Now it is , of all artificial beverages , probably the most universally drunk , having found it way long since to the West India islands , on which vast quantities of rum are produced from the sugarcane , and to this continent , where it has obtained a new and sad notoriety as the fatal gift of the white man to the Indian . It reigns , however , most absolutely , where neither wine nor beer have prevailed , among the Slavic and Finnic races , and must be considered as their own peculiar favorite . Even this most violent of intoxicating drinks did not at first prove so dangerous as it has since appeared . Excess seems , at least , to have ever been confined to men only . Animals , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strangers to voluntary intoxication ; even among the lowest races women make the drink , but men indulge in it and pay the penalty . Drunkenness was unknown to Rome until the days of her general decline , and Tiberius is probably the first eta- // peror known to have so far forgotten himself . The Germans , however , were early noted for excess , and Tacitus gives a sad picture of their proneness , even in solemn national council , to drink day and night , and after feasting invariably followed fighting . Charlemagne was probably the first Maine reformer . Already in 803 he ordered that no count should hold court unless he was sober , and that no man should give evidence or obtain justice while he was drunk . A soldier who yielded to the temptation was driven from the ranks and kept upon water , until he confessed his wrong ; and all older clergymen were , in 810 , admonished to set a good example by avoiding intoxication , " that hearth and nurse of all vice . " How much this admonition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord 's holy communion led , where priests and people were found drunk at the foot of the altar ! In the Middle Ages the drunkard was despised , and poets and prose writers speak of him with contempt ; his vice was barely forgiven in a serf or a villain . But soon the increasing wealth of cities all over Europe brought with it luxuries of every kind , and with them extravagant indulgence . As early as the sixteenth century drunkenness was quoted as the national vice of Germany , and in 1524 fifteen princes formed there the first Temperance League . how the same vice prevailed until lately in England and in her dependencies , and what modern lawgivers and men like the venerable Father Matthew have done for reform , is too familiar to be here repeated . Warm beverages seem ever to have been at least equally popular with all nations on earth ; tureens with contrivances for keeping the contents warm , found in the ruins of Pompeii , prove their use among the ancient Romans , and the same universal taste prevails now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common of all is tea-so common . as to present the impressive fact , that all Europe and our continent pay an immense annual tribute to barbarous China . But there is closely connected with it the not less extraordinary thought , that Eastern Asia becomes , by this very trade with the Occident , so entirely dependent upon it , that it is compelled to associate with the rest of the world in spite of deep-rooted prejudices and ancient customs . This influence is , moreover , daily extending ; it has lately opened the sister empire of Japan , and a little plant will thus , under Providence , become the civilizer of uncounted millions . And has not the same insignificant shrub bee ; within the memory of men , the cause of protracted war and of the foundation of a republic , greater in its hopes even than in its present already unparalleled greatness ? Tea has from the oldest times been used extensively in China and Eastern Asia , partly because of its inherent attractions and virtues , and partly because of the prejudice , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwholesome . The oldest Chinese works recommend the distilling of all water to be used as a beverage , and the old Chinese used to follow the advice . The introduction of tea is ascribed to divine interference , which we find alike *eferred to in all countries and all ages , as an explanation of the great blessings of civilization . Darma , a Buddha priest , who actually lived in the sixth century , came as a missionary to China , and in his holy zeal is said to have vowed that he would pray or preach by day and by night without intermission . His body refused to support him , and he fell asleep . In his indignation he cut off his eyelids and threw them from him ; but ho ! a miracle caused them to take root and to flourish ! Such was the origin of the tea plant  --  a myth , clearly expressive of the peculiar effect which tea has on our nerves . Its use was in the eighth century already so general in China , that it produced large sums in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It soon held all over Asia the same place that wine had among Europeans . Arabian travelers are said to have been the first Western men who became personally acquainted with the peculiar beverage , though in the early part of the fifteenth century a Persian embassy also had been treated with tea at the frontiers . Asia is still its own special home . There it is , as yet , almost exclusively raised , and there it is most universally consumed . Not less than four hundred millions , citizens of the Flowery Kingdom , Japan , Siam , and all the larger kingdoms of the East , together with the nomades of Northern Asia , drink tea as their daily and principal beverage . In China Proper each small blue cup with its gayly painted inside , is filled with the leaves and their exclusive infusion ; neither sugar nor cream must be added , lest they diminish the highly - valued aroma . In very cold weather only a small piece of ginger is taken with it . The poor use the same leaves over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best kinds are reserved for the Emperor ; the lesser are carefully prepared for Western markets to suit the taste of outside barbarians . Withered and spoiled leaves are glued together with the blood of sheep or oxen , fashioned in the shape of bricks , and sent off to the Mongols , to whom they serve , boiled as soup , at once as food and drink . Other teas are rolled into bales and sewed up in untauned skins , in which shape they are eagerly bought in Burmah and CochinChina . At home its consumption is , of course , immense ; tea-houses abound in city and country ; teachers in large schools show how to offer it courteously , how to accept , and how to drink ascribed to a saint , its praises are annually sung by countless poets , its use is enforced by law , and its consumption heavily taxed ! In vain have , as yet , the goveruments of Europe endeavored to raise it in their colonies , so as to avoid the heavy duty it // pays in China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant it on the southern slopes of the Himalaya , where Great Britain threatens to become a formidable competitor with the Central empire . All other efforts , made in Europe , Africa , and Brazil , have failed , even when Chinese laborers were specially imported for the purpose : the plant thrives and prospers , but the leaves have not the same aroma . Tea reached Holland first through Dutch merchants , who had exchanged it in China for dried sage leaves  --  a warm infusion of which had until then been the favorite drink even in England . In the Life of Whitfield we still read that , during one of his fasting humors at Oxford , " he ate nothing but sage tea without sugar and coarse bread . " A traveler , called Mandelslob , first called it Tea , and recommended it to his countrymen on the Continent as a highly medicinal herb ; physicians endorsed him , and some went so far as to promise a hundred years ' life from the use of the great arcanum ! In 1660 it was still so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were presented to the King as a handsome and acceptable present ; and the year after we read in Pepys 's delightful Diary , that " he sent for a cup of tea , a Chinese beverage , of which he had never drunk before . " Three years later a hundred pounds of the best tea were imported from Bantam for the use of druggists , and thus began a branch of commerce which now has few rivals . Nearly at the same time Russian merchants had , very reluctantly , taken the ill-looking leaves that , " when dried , wrinkled up like worms , " in cxchnnge for costly furs , and brought them back to their country . Here they became soon very popular , because they were believed to counteract and prevent intoxication ! The so-called Caravan-tea , carried all the way by land , is by many considered as much superior to that imported by sea . Now , the whole North of Europe , from the Ural to the coast of Normandy , use the fragrant drink , at the rate of 1* pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to amount only to one pound a person . Its charms have never been denied ; but it has often been accused as injurious to health . The Chinese themselves say that " tea-drinkers become early lame , " and their women use it sparingly , because " it makes them soon old . " Southern nations in Europe believe it to affect the nerves . As late as the well-known inquiry into the conduct of Lord Clive , Sir George Snvile denounced tea as deleterious , and hated the very name of India , because the East India Company were carrying on a destructive trade , and " ruining , by tea , the health of the country . " It is , however , now well established that tea favors the digestion , and is a good substitute for the large quantities of meat required by the climate of Northern and Oceanic regions . Besides , it aids mental activity , and has thus become the great favorite of scholars and artists . Dr. Johnson 's sixteen cups , and his indignation at being asked if he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known to all readers of Boswell . The danger of excess lies mainly in the effect of tea upon the nervous activity , which it heightens , however , very unequally in different persons . Ludicrous enough are the results of recent inquiries into the real nature of some teas sold in the market . The Chinese already have their " Lie-tea , " mttde from the dust of te* - boxes , and other dust , mixed . with gum so as to resemble gunpowder . The English imitator is not quite so sincere as to call his merchandise " Lie-tea ; " but he goes still farther in adulteration , and has been detected in using even the secretion of silk-worms to represent tea ! In the year 1843 there were not less than eight factories in London , where used tea-leaves , purchased from waiters and servants , were " faced " with black lead , colored with indigo or Prussian blue , to produce green or black tea at will , and then *riade fragrant with native spices ! Much commoner still is the use of simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the plum-tree . Thousands drink the odd compound , like it , and thrive ; what strange virtue , then , is there in such an infusion ? Really important , however , is the substitution of coffee - leaves - a plan discovered by Professor Blume of Leyden , and patented by Dr. Gardner in London since the Great Exhibition . It has been discovered that they had been used for ages in Java and Sumatra , as the sole beverage of a large and healthy population . Its great cheapness and high nutritive qualities recommended it to the attention of men of science , who soon discovered that the leaves of the coffee - tree* contained the same peculiar chemical property , known as Theme . So universal is the taste for some such infusion , that scarcely a nation can be found without its own peculiar tea . Even the fierce Abyssinian has his " sleep-dispelling " warm beverage , and the North American the Labrador tea , an exhilarating warm drink , made from a marsh plant , that grows along the swamps and heath-covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there from an Alpine rose , some tea is drank from the wilderness of New Holinud to the inhospitable lands near the Pole . The most largely used of these is probably the mat , drank by the whole population of South America . This is an infusion upon the leaves of a Brazilian holly , growing wild there , and from time immemorial known as yerba - " the herb " par excellence . Boupland , the companion of Humboldt , long a prisoner of the dictator , Dr. Francia , and now a farmer on the banks of the Uruguay , describes , not without betraying a certain fondness , the peculiar mode of enjoying the favorite beverage . A curiously-carved vessel , filled with the smoking liquid , is handed round , like the pipe of peace among our Indians , and each guest takes in his hand the same long tube with a // perforated ball at the end , through which it is slowly and leisurely imbibed . It is said to calm the restless , and to rouse the torpid ; but used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another native-American beverage , chocolate , is almost the exclusive property of Spanish races . It is a preparatiou of the beau of the cacao-tree , which the old Mexicans called chocollatl . A great favorite iu Spain from the first , it reached Paris only under Louis XIV. , through his queen , Maria Theresa of Austria . But although their physicians were so charmed with the new beverage that they wrote books in order to establish its exclusive claims to he considered the food of the gods , its difficult preparation and great costliness have prevented its general use . Far more universal is the drinking of coffee , another valuable gift which we owe to the Orient . A native of Abyssinia , the plant grows there , and all over Africa to the Equator , wild , to a height of thirty or forty feet . How it made its way from that mysterious country to Arabia is unknown ; but it has there found a second home . Not , however , in its northern parts , where an ever cloudless sky sends burning rays ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rare oases , with a grateful well and a few slender palm-trees , under which the Bedouiu raises his black hair tent , and watches the caravans as they pass on their way to holy Mecca . A different scene presents the southern part of the land of Mohammed . Here the fragrant balm and the grateful myrrh grow in profusion ; here whole forests of palms gird noble mountains , at whose feet large durrub-fields wave gently in the breeze . Here also are found the famous coffee-plantations , their dark green leaves shining brilliantly in the bright sun , while the light lower side turns fitfully up and glistens and glitters like the foamy crest on the ocean waves . Coffee also is said by the children of the East to have been a gift from on high ; and the legend resembles in more than one point the tradition referring to tea . Some call the Archangel Michael the first inventor , and others their own great prophet . The general opinion , however , is that the superior of a Mohammedan convent near Aden , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the antics and gambols of a herd of goats , that had browsed upon the leaves of some trees in the garden . He found the berries both palatable and useful , and soon introduced the pleasant drink to keep himself and his dervises awake during their nightly vigils . It was prepared in large brown pots , and drank in every mosque and every convent ; even now it is thus kept in all mosques , and gratuitously offered in tiny cups to the worshiping faithful . Still , even coffee had its enemies , and its battles to fight , ere it became , what it now is , the universal and favorite drink of the Orient . Following the banner of the Prophct wherever it was carried , it raised , first in Mecca , and then in Cairo and Constantinople , more than one fierce and not nubloody rebellion . Doctors proclaimed it little better than poison , and theologians threatened that the faces of coffee-drinkers would appear as black as the roasted berry on the day of Resurrection . Women alone were allowed to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the Koran declared inadmissible in heaven . All difficulties , however , were soon overcome ; and now coffee is to the son of the East such a daily necessity that a Turkish law gave a wife a legal ground for separation , if she was refused coffee by her miserly or cruel husband . Venice was probably the first port in Europe to which the new beverage was brought from the East , although Prosper Alpin , a botanist of Padna , already spoke of it , on his return to Italy , as a favorite dish in Egypt . Merchants brought , in the year 1663 , the first beans from the Levant , and with them the necessary utensils for preparing the coffee ; they were exhibited merely as a curiosity , but soon led to the establishment of the first coffee-house in Marseilles . The embassador of Sultan Mohammed IV . used , at the same time , to regale his guests in Paris with the fragrant decoction , and thus made coffee there kno and fashionable . England also owed her knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had even brought a Greek girl with them to prepare the coffee . She married a London coachman , and opened , on Coruhill , the first house for its sale , now known as the Virginia Coffee-house . But here , as in France , coffee had much opposition to endure ; in the South , physicians and divines arose to condemn it , and its feeble advocates were compelled to plead such wretched arguments as-that coffee was called boa in Turkey , and came from Arabia Felix ! In England , Charles II . tried to prohibit its use , but the obstinate king , who could defy his parliament , was powerless against the favorite beverage . From Europe it spread rapidly over the colonies . A Dutchman raised a few plants in a green-house in Amsterdam , and sent them to Sumatra , and other islands , where they soon prospered , and now produce an abundance . Louis XIV . also wished coffee to be planted on his West India islands , and sent a few plants , in care of a midshipman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult and tedious ; the ship lay long becalmed , and the young officer had to sacrifice part of his own scanty ration of water to keep at least one precious plant from destruction . In this he succeeded ; and thus , it is said , all the millions of trees now raised in the West Indies and in Brazil are descended from this single parent . If this be true , by far the greater part of the immense quantity of coffee now consumed , amounting at least to six hundred millions of pounds , is derived from a little plant raised carefully in a botanical garden at Paris ! In the Orient , coffee is drunk in solemn si // WHY OUR MINISTER DID N'T MARRY . lence , and coffee-houses are therefore called Schools of Wisdom ; in the Occident it is mixed with sugar , and often with cream , and used mainly to favor digestion and to increase the activity of brain . In German and Belgian armies it has successfully taken the place of brandy ; and was , during the last wars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request of the soldiers themselves . Scandinavia consumes it most largely-at the rate of three pounds a head ; next follows the German Custom-league , where it pays a high duty , and still amounts to two pounds for each person . Substitutes , also , are not wanting . England allows chicory to be mixed with coffee ; and in Germany barley , acorns , and rye are largely used in its stead . The viler compounds , not unknown to the United States , contain mainly sawdust , ferruginous earths , and burnt sugar . Similar beverages may he found among less civilized nations , but they are unknown beyond their own limits , and do not affect , like tea and coffee , in their culture and preparation , the interests of millions of men . They are , however , additional evidences of the profuse liberality with which our great mother Earth treats all of her children , and of the wise beneficence with which Providence thus kindly turns hunger and thirst into a source of enjoyment , and changes curses into blessings .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
