ART . VI. - CIIPJST 'S I3ODILY PRESENCE , AND TIlE WORLD 'S CON VERSJON. * ALL theories of the premillennial coming of Christ , rest upon and grow out of the assumption that this coming would bring an immeasurable accession of moral strength to the Gospel ; that it would tend more powerfully than all things else to secure the conversion of the world . Is this principle correct ? IVoald the bodily presence of Christ on earth hasten , or tend to hasten , the world*8 conversion ? If so , it must be either because of its effect on the Church , making it more efficient in preaching the Gospel ; or because of its effect on the world itself , making it more ready to receive the Gospel . No third method of reaching the result is conceivable . Let us then examine these two methods in their order . How would the visible presence of Christ act on the Church - on those who are to carry the Gospel through the world ? In the first place , it would tend to repress that distributive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would create too strong local attachments . Christians would wish to be with their Master . In proportion as they better understood who and what he is , their hearts would cling closer and closer to his very person . If Christ were visible on earth , it is inevitable that this principle would draw his people to him with an overmastering power . They would be perpetually seeking his company , as little children do that of their parents ; and like them they would become restless and uneasy the moment it was taken from them . Wherever Christ abode , there his people would feel they must abide : whithersoever he removed , thither they would feel that they must follow . The city of his residence would become the metropolis of the world . Every other place would // lose its attractions , every other presence its interest , every other intercourse its charm . The supernatural would prove too strong for the natural , and every other tie would unloose itself in obedience to that dissolving force with which a recognized Messiah , a God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself . Were one of the planets to approach within a few miles of our earth , the earth itself would be at once thrown from its orbit , and every movable obj ect on the face of it would forsake its place . The seas would leave their beds and rush over the tallest mountains to greet the approaching stranger , and the winds , joined in inconceivable hurricane , would unite with the rushing waters to sweep everything forward towards the side on which he was advancing . Somewhat like this would be the effect , were Christ now to appear visibly on the earth . The whole Christian world would be at once unsphered . The mighty force of this new attraction would throw every spiritual thing out of its normal relations . The very center of gravitation for the Christian world would be changed . The tides of that world 's life would rush towards him with a momentum , and heap themselves around him with a power , which no existing laws of its nature could either control or resist . The result would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power would prevail over the expansive , the centripetal over the centrifugal . Christianity would be crystallized out of the world , not diffused and held in solution through it . It is obvious that this preponderant tendency to centralization would be fatal to the missionary spirit , and must be removed before the Church could be in a fit condition to receive and carry out the great mission ary command : " Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature . " The only way to secure this result without changing the very laws of our nature ; is to withdraw the person of Christ to heaven . No spot on earth must be allowed to possess such an overpowering force of attraction as the bodily presence of Christ would give it . Removed to heaven , he becomes equally near to every part of the earth alike . The confining chain which bound his disciples to Jerusalem and Judea , is broken ; for now to the eye of faith his // spiritual footsteps cover alike all the lands of the world . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving him behind . Instead of going from him , they are going to him ; for to them his peculiar presence is henceforth in that one place , whatever it is , where his voice is summoning them to labor . lie does not send them now so much as he calls them . Instead of standing upon Olivet , waving them away with his hand , saying , " Go preach my gospel to the nations that are afar off , while I , your Lord and Master , remain behind , " he takes his stand in the very heart of Africa and the islands of the sea , and says , " Come , here for you is my abode , and while you labor for me and with me here , I will with the tokens of my presence make this benighted spot more precious to you than Tabor or Gethsemane . " The departure of Christ was necessary , therefore , to secure the very first condition of the world 's conversion , i. e. , the distribution through it of Christian preachers and laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overmastering attraction which his bodily presence would give to the place it consecrated , before the diffusive element of Christianity could gain unembarrassed development , and they could be ready to " go everywhere preaching the word . " But , secondly , suppose this difficulty overcome , and the disciples of Christ actually goneforth to deliver their message . The bodily presence of their master on earth would still prove a hinderance to their work , because it would necessarily exert a most unfavorable influence upon the whole direction and manner of their preaching . We can easily see that it would tend most powerfully to change their very idea of the kingdom of Christ , making it almost wholly secular and unspiritual. us presence would keep continually alive and full of force the expectation that this kingdom was to take a material form ; that it was to be a kind of second Roman Empire ; that the kings of the earth were to bring their glory into it ; that allegiance to it was to be enforced by supernatural power , and rewarded with supernatural increase of temporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom upon whose embassies they were sent , their views of the object to be aimed at in their // preaching would become little more than a mere system of political propagandism , carried on against all the surrounding nations in the name of the King of kings . The idea of spiritual regeneration as the condition of membership in that kingdom would become wholly lost , or if nominally retained , it would be at the expense of its entire inward power . Conversion , repentance , faith in Christ , would receive wholly secular meanings and designate changes merely in outward relations . The great object of the embassadors of Christ would be , as in the case of the propagators of iRomanism and iMiohammedanism , not to save souls but to make proselytes . The themes of their preaching would be the duty and advantage of a formal submission to this new kingdom . Their motives to enforce it would be as nuspiritual as the object , and would appeal merely or mainly to the ambition , the cupidity , or the gross material fears of men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperious and overbearing . Conscious that they were embassadors of an omnipotent earthly sovereign , they would command and not entreat ; and believing themselves in effect to hold the destiny of men at their disposal , they would march through the lands like the fiery envoys of the Arabian Prophet , summoning the inhabitants to instant surrender , and threatening all delay or refusal with the exterminating judgments of heaven . But even supposing the disciples of Christ not thus to mistake or lose sight of the true object of their mission-supposing them to fix their eye as they ought upon the spiritual conversion of men , and to endeavor to shape all their teaching with reference to this result  --  the form and pressure of their preaching must still be inevitably different from what it would be were Christ 's presence withdrawn to heaven . For the fact itself of Christ 's continued residence on earth would necessarily form one of the themes of their preaching , and could not but be often referred to , and largely dwelt upon in the way of appeal and enforcement ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not but be felt underlying every discourse , affecting the shape of every doctrine , sending its secret influence into every exhortation. *o man could preach any doctrine of // the Christian system , any point of Christian duty , any element of the Christian life , or any condition of human salvation , with that supposed fact as he would without it . It is useless to say that the preachers of the Gospel might keep this truth in its proper place of subordination . Human nature is such that a truth like this could not be made to stay in its proper place of subordination . It would upturn the whole practical theology of the Church . It would inevitably assume and assert for itself such a prominence , and it would so cast down before itself into relative depression those truths in which reside the really spiritual for6es of the Gospel , that the system would become a wholly different thing from what it is now , from what it ever has been , from what it was originally intended and qualified and appointed to be as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as this truth would inevitably affect the matter , so it would no less inevitably affect the manner of preachiug ,  --  even though the obj ect aimed at were what it ought to be , the spiritual conversion of men . Though less imperious in its tone than if it were a mere system of secular propagandism , it would still be too much so to express the exact spirit and secure the best effect of the Gospel . There would be a speciality about the very commission to preach the Gospel , which would make the preacher to imagine himself much more nearly than at prescut a literal embassador of Christ . In a very different sense from what he does now , he would hold his commission from Christ in person , and would come to claim for himself , even if it was not yielded to him by others , an authority and respect like that which is accorded to the minister of a foreign court . Instead of bearing down upon his hearers with the power of the truth , he would be tempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sacredness of his office . If he were not wholly imperious , he would still be too imperative . There would be too much pressure and too little pathos ; too much peremptoriness and too little persuasion . Instead of saying , " Now then we are ambassadors for Christ : as though God did beseech you by us ; we pray you in Christ 's stead be ye reconciled to God , " the spirit of his speech would be likely to be , " Now then we are // embassadors for Christ : take heed therefore that ye despise not our words , lest your names be reported at Jerusalem , and the hands of the Master strike you from afar with sudden and strange retribution . " Thus the Gospel would lose in its presentation that tenderness and unction , that melting eariiest* ness , not passionate but impassioned , which is at once the finest grace of the preacher 's lips , and the sharpest of the two edges of the sword of the Spirit . But , thirdly , the continued residence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passive reliance upon him , and so would prevent the proper putting forth of their own powers in the work of the world 's conversion . The very fact of his remaining permanently on earth , after having completed his atoning work , would show to all his followers that his object in doing so was to engage personally in the propagation of his kingdom . This being so , they would regard their own agency in this enterprise as almost wholly formal and superfluous . If Christ were visibly keeping his personal presence on the earth in order to see this work accomplished , it would be impossible to persuade them that he was not intending to carry it out with the high hand of his omnipotence . However long this hope might be deferred by his delay to interfere , it could not be made to die until their faith in him , as anything more than an impostor , had utterly perished . They would feel no pressure of responsibility in this work , for they would assure themselves that the performance of it was in no true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that it rested wholly upon the question of his interference . That such interference was intended to take place at some time , they would say was obvious ; for what else could be the object of his visible continuance on the earth , after every other possible design of his coming had been answered ? It could not be merely to direct labors ; for he could do that as well by returning to heaven as by remaining here . It must be merely because he saw that this work could be accomplished only by the visible manifestation of his miraculous power . To him , therefore , this enterprise must be committed . His presence is a guaranty that it will be safely accomplished . To work before him would be useless ; to work after him or // with him would be superfluous . Omnipotence can not be forestalled and needs not to be succored or supplemented . Thus their own agency would necessarily wear to them the appearance of being merely nominal and ostensible , and so the great spring to their endeavor would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their labors , they would become fitful and impatient in their work . They would naturally expect and demand the instant and constant forth-putting of Christ 's visiblQ omnipotence ; and if it was not granted , they would be incessantly falling back in the spirit of complaint and fault-finding . But why , it may be asked , should this be the case any more with the bodily presence of Christ on earth than without it ? Because that presence could not but be interpreted as giving them a special right to expect such interference . In this day miracles have ceased . The door through which the great worker of miracles entered , is shut behind his departure . Things have everywhere resumed their natural course ; and as there is no longer any expectation of such supernatural interference , there is no disappointment because it does not come . But in the other case , the state of things is precisely the reverse . The door of miracles is kept conspicuously open . The great worker of miracles , who came through it , has taken up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , therefore , can not but be fixed upon that door in expectation that other miracles will pass through it . If the Master has come , they can not but look that his servants should follow . If they are permitted to see the Son of man , they will certainly look to see the angels of God ascending and descending upon him . The very person and presence of Christ is by itself a perpetual miracle , and is by the very necessities of the case a perpetual promise of other miracles . For his presence here must be in order to a work here ; and if the preparation for the work is miraculous , how much more must the work itself be miraculous ? Human nature is such that it would not be possible for Christ to come and dwell on earth , recognized in his divine Messiahship and power , without exciting to the very highest degree the expectation that he would assume at once , in his own power , the work of extending // his kingdom . That expectation would be so strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any permanent and persevering labor of their own . They would feel that their own agency was shriveled into insignificance . Under the overshadowing of his omnipotence , which was every moment expected to break forth in amazing manifestation and worldwide flashes of achievement , their own energies would be completely paralyzed , and they would think themselves called only to stand still and see the salvation of God . If those manifestations were delayed , and they were summoned as Christians are now , to apply all their powers to the work , how could they be expected to feel the force of the summons , , and devote themselves to the most incessant , self-denying , and self consuming toil , when the very being who was thus summoning them was dwelling visibly among them day by day in all his acknowleged omnipotence , and they knew that he himself could accomplish that same work in a moment of time , by one word of his tongue or one motion of his hands ,  --  and knew , too , that the single and sole reason of his 6eing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without these manifestations of omnipotence . Were their labors to be the channel through which his omnipotence should move to its results , there would then be the highest possible encouragement for those labors . With Christ working in them , and through them , they themselves would become omnipotent . But this , they would see , was not intended to be the method of his operation . For if it were , what would be the need or the propriety of his bodily presence ? If his work was to be in or throuo*h them that could be done better-nay , could be done b only by his spiritual presence . To retain his bodily presence among them , therefore , would be the most direct way of assuring them that his work was to be done , not in or through them , but over and Iwyond , and ivithout them ; i. e. it would be the most direct way possible of fixing upon them the impression that their persons and their instrumentality stood in no direct and vital connection whatsoever with his work in behalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received by them , it would make all genuine , earnest , hearty Christian // labor an impossibility . It would cut every sinew of the body of Christ in a moment . Finally , the visible presence of Christ on earth would throw from its place the doctrine of the Spirit and the agency of prayer . There was a literal meaning in the words of Christ , when he said , " If I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you . " It is not probable that the doctrine of the holy Spirit 's peculiar personality and work could ever have become practically appreciated , had Christ 's visible residence among men been permuanently continued . The fleshly and the visible must depart before the spiritual and the invisible could come . Time outward senses must be unloosed from the enchantmuent that had absorbed them , before the inward sense could draw into itself enough of the power of attention and meditation to secure its own development . Had Christ reniained among men with his visible dispensation of miracles , their ideas of his power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual might of God , they would scarcely have had a conception . They would have thought only of his mere material omnipotence ; and would have expected the conversion of the world to be accomplished by the same kind of power as that which they had seen heal the sick , raise the dead , and still the tempest ; a power as much below that spiritual energy which works through the truth upon the hearts of men , as the body is below the soul that inhabits it . It is this doctrine of the Holy Spirit , of his work on the soul , of his connection with the truth , of the vitality and force which he , and he only , gives to the truth , that lays the foundation of that great economy of prayer through which one-half at least , of the Church 's energy is to be put forth , and through which the whole of God 's spiritual omnipotence is to be drawn down upon the Church and upon the world . The bodily presence of Christ then would not tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would it promote the readiness of the world to receive the Gospel ? Would it tend to lead men to repentance ? Repentance is a result effected by the Holy Spirit acting through religious truth . If , therefore , the bodily presence of // Christ has any tendency to secure this result , it must be bpcause it would secure either a larger measure of the Spirit , or a more efficient presentation of religious truth . That it would not secure the first , is the very declaration of our Saviour himself : " If I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I depart I will send him unto you . " In another place it is said : " The Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified . " Be the reason of the fact what it may , the fact itself is unquestionable , that it was the departure of Christ , and not his presence , which was the condition of the Spirit 's coming . Would it then secure the second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this question seems distinctly intimated in those words of our Savioiir , a part of which have already been quoted . " It is expedient for you that I go away ; for if I go not away the Comforter will not conk unto you ; but if I depart I will send him unto you . And when he is come he will reprove the world of sin , of righteousness , and of judgment . " There are here two remarkable assertions . First , that this departure would be an advantage to his disciples on account of the effect which it would have , not upon themselves , but upon the world . Secondly , that this effect was to be produced on the world by convincing them of the truth , i. e. by setting it before the world in greater clearness and power . And what truth was it which was thus , in consequence of Christ 's departure , to be brought home to the minds of men with so much more clearness and pungency than it could have been if he had remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other , mcii need to know in order to be brought to repentance ; and which , when known , have a stronger tendency than any other to bring them to repentance . " He shall reprove them of sin , of righteousness , and of judgment . " That men are sinners ; that they must be saved , if at all , through the righteousness of Christ ; and that they are to stand before him in judgment-these are precisely the truths by which the minds of men ever lma*ve been , and ever must be , most mightily moved when the Gospel has taken effect upon them . They are precisely the three truths in which the Gospel // garners up all its power , and through which it makes its full onset upon the soul . " It is expedient for you , " therefore , says Christ , " that I go away , " i. e. , it is expedient for you in reference to that very work of extending my Kingdom , in which you are to be henceforth engaged , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to promote the success of that very work , because it will be the means of bringing out into their highest possible clearness and power the three great truths which are to accomplish that work . My departure having removed the circumstances which would otherwise have prevented the clear perception of these truths , and having furnished to them that which will ever constitute the most effective and convincing evidence that they are true , the ILIoly Spirit will then take them up and apply them in a manner which would before have been impossible , and with a success which shall ultimately fill the whole earth . It is the clear implication of these words that the departure of Christ leaves the minds of men in the most favorable condition for being convinced , as well as furnishes the strongest means of convincing them of those truths which are to lead them to repentance . The departure of Christ would be the means of convincing the world of sin- " of sin because they believe not on me . " The rejection of Christ is both the greatest sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin . What constitutes it so ? The fact that Jesus Christ is the Son of God , and that he has come to give up his life for the world 's salvation . In order , therefore , that men may see their sin in rejecting Christ , they must see that he really is the Son of God . Now the departure of Christ into heaven is the crowning proof that he was the Son of God . It both completed the evidence of that truth , and left men in a more favorable condition for feeling the force of all the other evidence of it . It completed the evidence . For it put the last and highest possible seal both upon his profession and upon his character . lie assumed to be the Son of God , and wrought all his works , and delivered all his teachings upon the basis of that assumption . Had his profession been false , it is impossible to suppose that the gates of heaven // would have been visibly opened to him , and that thus in the sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been borne back in triumph from his earthly mission into the very court and presence of God . The sublime circumstances of his recall and retnrn to the heavenly court , form the crowning proof of the character and commission with which he came forth from it . So also his departure into heaven left all the other proofs of his divine character in a more favorable condition for producing their proper effect . It is just what men would naturally have expected on the supposition that he was the Son of God . Heaven was the proper place of his permanent abode . It was easier to think of him as divine while there , than it would have been if he had remained permanently on earth . The presence of that earthly human form , with all the glory of Deity quenched and concealed within it , rather than revealed by it , would have been a perpetual embarrassment to men 's faith in his real divinity . The contrast would have been so powerful between what appeared to their eyes , and what was in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question would be continually rising in their thoughts whether after all he could be anything more than a man supereminently endowed and favored of God ; whether it was possible that he could be , in his own person , very God manifest in the flesh . Besides it was not by looking at his visible person that men could gain any proof of his divinity , for the proof lay in his words and deeds , and not in his bodily form . Nor did it lie in even these in such a way that it would necessarily grow in strength , as these were merely accumulated or multiplied . An argument may be weakened rather than strengthened by too great a multiplicity of proofs . If the evidence of Christ 's divinity was to be effective , it must be contained in a portable shape , and within practicable limits . What was needed was not that more material of proof should be furnished , but that what already existed should be properly pondered and mastered . The departure of Christ tended to secure this result . It cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It finished the volume before it had become too large . It threw men back // upon that which contained the real evidence of his divinity , upon the deeds and words themselves , and left men to study these , separated from that bodily presence , which , by withdrawing attention from them to itself , would have weakened rather than strengthened their real force of impression . It was only as withdrawn from his earthly history , and shining down upon it from the height of his heavenly abode , that the light which was within him would strike the facts of that history at the proper angle and fill them with the proper illumination . A landscape opening to the west shows but dimly under the setting sun , because the objects to be seen and the light by which they are to be seen , both lie in the same direction . It is only when the sun is at its furthest height in the opposite quarter of the heavens , behind and above the spectator , that it can deliver itself with full force upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye with the utmost distinctness and splendor . " When ye have lifted up the Son of Man , " says Christ , " then shall ye know that I am he . " " And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me . There seems to have been an inherent necessity that there should be a departure , a lifting up of Christ from the earth to his own heavenly exaltation , before men could be prepared re*lly to understand and appreciate him . It was only after he was thus lifted up that men did appreciate him . It was the preaching not only of a crucified , but of a risen and a8cended Lord , that opened the eyes and pierced the hearts of the three thousand on the day of Pentecost . It was the ascension of Christ which Peter made use of to convince them that they had crucified the Lord of Glory . " This Jesus whom ye slew hath God raised up , whereof we all are witnesses ; therefore , being by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this wonderful manifestation which ye now see and hear . Therefore , let all the house of Israel know assuredly , that God hath made that same Jesus , whom ye have crucified , both Lord and Christ . " " And when they heard this , they were pricked in their hearts , and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles , Men and brethren , what shall we do ? " Then in a moment the // light flashed upon the whole extent of their crime , and they saw that they had crucified the Son of God . Precisely so it was with the second sermon of Peter a few days after . The point of the sermon was contained in this declaration : " The God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of David , the God of our fathers , hath glorified his Son Jesus whom ye delivered up . " It was the startling fact that that same Jesus , whom they had crucified , had been taken up to the right hand of God in heaven , that showed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible an act of guilt they had perpetrated against him ; and the effect was , that five thousand men were struck down at once by the power of that single declaration . So with the sermon of Stephen ; the piercing power of it was brought out when he said : " Behold I see the heavens opened , and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God . " Precisely the same fact was it that brought sudden and overwhelming conviction to Saul of Tarsus , when he was smitten to the ground by the very same vision that had comforted the dying Stephen , and saw , by his place in the heavens , that the Jesus whom he was persecuting was none other than the Lord of Glory . And when he saw that , it was no wonder that there was no more strength in him , that he was three days without sight , neither did he eat nor drink , and that he was led by the hand as a little child into the city . And so ever since and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had preached to them an a8cended , as well as crucified Redeemer , that they have so naturally believed him divine , and in that belief have had fastened upon them the consciousness that by their impenitent neglect of Christ they have been guilty of that greatest of all sins , the sin of treading under their feet the very Son of God . In the same way the departure of Christ tends to convince men of the second great truth connected with their repentance , viz : that there is no way in which they can be saved except through the atonement of Christ . Men never come to Christ to be saved , until they are made to see that salvation by their own righteousness is impossible . And when the Spirit is come " he shall reprove the world of righteousness " - " of // righteousness because I o'o to the Father and ye see me no b more . " His going to the Father and sitting down at his right hand in glory would be a divine vindication of his righteousness , i. e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not what men charged him with being , a blasphemer and an impostor ; that he was , on the contrary , precisely what he professed to be , the appointed , and therefore the only possible Saviour of the world ; that his Gospel was what lie had declared it to be , God 's appointed way , and therefore man 's only possible way of salvation ; that no man could come to the Father but by him , and no man could be saved except by being washed by his blood and by believing in his name . It is essential to the proper force of the Gospel that it present Christ to men as their Saviour , and as accomplishing that salvation by his atoning sacrifice and blood . Anything which should withdraw the attention of men from these two facts , anything which should weaken their hold upon them , either theoretically or practically , would thereby neutralize the most central and peculiar power of the Gospel . Tow it is inevitable that the bodily presence of Christ on earth would have had this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacy which it now holds in the picture of his life . His sacrifice upon the Cross would have come to be a thing of ancient history , and as generation after generation passed away and men still beheld him among them , they would have gradually come to believe that it was not after all so much his death that saved them as his life ; for if it were , they would say , why should his earthly life be so miraculously prolonged after the great essential work for which he came was accomplished . And even if they did not lose his death out of their theoretical belief , they would lose their practical hold upon it . It would have been so overlaid by the wonderful works and events of his subseqnent life , that the great power of its appeal would have been broken , and men would have rested their thoughts , their interest , their salvation , upon something nearer to them in his history than the cross of Calvary . And as their views df the way of salvation became outward and superficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Ifis continued presence in the world could not but suggest that it was some temporal and secular good , some worldly culture or advantage , some outward safety or benefit , to be secured to them in a merely mechanical way by a merely formal connection with his person or kingdom . The departure of Christ has removed all these tendencies . Taking place so soon as it did after his death , it left that death to stand for all time in the very center and forefront of the Gospel , with no subsequent work or history of Christ coIning between it and the eyes of men to divide their attention from it . Christ had nothing to say to the world after his resurrection . He appeared only to his disciples , and remained among them only long enough to give them , and the world through them , the most infallible proofs that he was indeed risen ; and then he led them out to Bethany and was received up into heaven in their sight . This was just what was to have been expected on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very center and life-point of the Gospel . If that was the great work for which he came , it was to be expected that he should depart when it was accomplished . If that were not his great work , then his departure was precisely the reverse of what was to have been expected . If the great purpose of his coming was to be an example to men , his example was as much needed , and would certainly have been as effective , after his death and resurrection as before it . If he came to be a teacher , why did he leave the world at the very instant when he was prepared to teach with tenfold more effect than ever before , because he had now received by his resurrection from the dead a tenfold greater proof than all which had occurred before , that he was indeed a teacher sent from God ? If he came to prove and illustrate to the world in his own person the doctrine of the resurrection , why did he not show himself to the world openly after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such significant care by the sacred writers , that he appeared only to his disciples ? Why did he not remain on earth a visible and indubitable memorial of that truth to all generations ? Not one of all the theories which make the essential work of Christ to have consisted in anything else than // his atoning death , can possibly explain the fact of his early departure . There is not one of them all which does not absolutely require that he should have continued on earth for years , at least , after his resurrection , if not for the whole remaining term of time . Whereas , if his atoning death is the great thing that is to save the world , and men must build their faith and hang their hopes on that or perish , then we see at once why his history , properly speaking , should terminate with his death , and Calvary be left standing out forevermore as the grand final tableau of the Gospel , to which , without anything intervening between it and them to mar the iinpression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following time . It is as lifted upon the cross , and as looking down from the cross , that Jesus Christ is to draw all men unto him . And therefore , if it tended , as it certainly would , to withdraw their attention from that great scene of Calvary , even the presence of Christ itself would be a spiritual disadvantage to men , for it would thereby hinder and not promote the extension of his kingdom ; it would thereby delay , and not hasten the conversion of the world . low would the departure of Christ into heaven convince men of a future judgment ? - of " judgment becanse the Prince of this world is judged ? " Christ 's reception into heaven would be the bringing of him back in triumph from that whole mission and work in behalf of man 's salvation , in which Satan had sought to foil him , first by his temptation in the wilderness , then by stirring up the Jews to persecute him , and finally by setting the doors of the grave upon him and the bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prisoner in his own domain . Thus was Satan judged . Thus was fulfilled the promise of Eden , " The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent 's head . " Thus was fulfilled the vision of Christ before his death : " I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven . " Thus was fulfilled his own declaration , " Now is the judgment of this world ; now is the Prince of this world judged . " His resurrection was the victory over death and over him that had the power of death ; and his glorious triumphant return to heaven showed to the eyes of the whole world that all the // designs of his enemies against him had failed ; that he had gone up to his appointed throne ; and that , as he had told them on earth , all nations should stand before him in judgment . For if the prince of this world had been judged , what could his followers expectbut also to be judged ? If the mighty arch-potentate of evil , and all the leagued principalities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work or intercept his return to heaven , but had been hurled down like lightning by him in his victorious ascent , how could the feeble human subjects of that defeated prince hope to prevent what he himself had foretold them , that he should come with clouds , and every eye should see him , and they also that pierced him should look upon him , and all the kindreds of the earth should wail because of him ? And what is it now , and what has it ever been that has impressed men most powerfully with the assurance and the expectation of a future judgment ? It is the fact that Jesus Christ having declared to the world that there should be a judgment in heaven , and that he should preside over it , has left the world , and himself gone forward into heaven . If he had remaimied on earth , men might indeed have believed in a coming judgment ; but they would have believed it less naturally and easily . Seeing Christ permanently with them , they would have had their thoughts drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the final dispensation , and that there was to be no other judgment than that which was going on every day under the presence and administration of Christ . And had they actually looked forward to a future judgment over which Christ should preside , his presence among them would tend to lower , both in quality and degree , the the force of impression which this expectation would produce upon them , even if it did not wholly destroy that expectation . Looking day by day upon his human person , they would have found it exceedingly difficult to believe that that familiar form and countenance could ever be so changed as to strike a divine terror into a beholding world . The ideal grandeur with which the imagination invests that scene of the judgment , and which is absolutely indispensable to its true moral effect , would have // been continually drawn down to the measure of what was visible and human before them . It would have required a stronger mental effort to keep up the idea of the judgment to its true moral height and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ , than it does now to bring down that ideal scene and make it present and real to the soul . It is the departure of Christ into heaven , and not his continued presence on the earth , that gives a future judgment its most convincing reality and its most commanding power . It is because he has been taken up from them into heaven , that they expect this same Jesus so to come in like manner as they have seen him go into heaven . It is because he has so suddenly broken away from the earth , at the very beginning of the history of his kingdom , that they feel assured that this history is only at its beginning , and that its completion , its consummation and its coronation can only be before the great white throne . Were Christ with men , his very presence might put to sleep their solicitude concerning any more dreadfiml coming . But now their solicitude feeds itself with the thought that he is not here , that he is somewhere else ; that He who while on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has passed in majesty through the doors of the sky , where he must be awaiting and preparing the inevitable hour . In short , they remember who he was , whence he came , what he suffered , how he departed , whither he went , and where he now *sin that very place where men have now located the residence of Justice , and to which their guilty fears do irresistibly turn when they think of judgment and retribution . But , says the objector , all this reasoning concerning the natural effect of Christ 's bodily presence proceeds on the supposition that Christ would retain the merely human aspect and humble condition which belonged to him before his death . Whereas , is it not probable that if lie had remained on earth , or if he should now return to remain , it would be in a transfigured form that would speak at once of heaven , in a celestial splendor and majesty that would at once strike conviction and awe into all beholders ; and with such a profusion of grandeur // and miraculous achievement as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole world to his feet ? And if Christ 's coming should be attended with such a visible lighting down of his hand upon the thrones and kingdoms of the earth , punishing some with instant destruction , would not this hasten the conversion of the world ? - would it not compel men to yield their unbelief , their indifference , and to submit themselves at once to Christ ? The question supposes that there is something in the mere supernatural exhibition of power , majesty , or terror , which has a strong tendency to bring men to repentance . If so , why is not effect produced upon the lost spirits in perdition ? They not only behold , but feel in their own persons an immeasurably higher manifestation of Christ 's supernatural power , maj esty and terror , than have ever been beheld , or than ever in the nature of the case could be beheld in this world ; yet these things do not bring them to repentance , nor will any continuance or multiplication of these things ever bring one of those souls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not attract ; they crush and destroy , not melt and subdue . Instead , therefore , of leading the sufferers to repentance , they drive them further from it . Instead of being cords of love to draw them to Christ , they are chains of darkness that bind them more hopelessly to death . And the same tendency , if not the same strength of tendency , would belong to such an exhibition of Christ 's person and power as is mentioned in the objector 's supposition . The effect would indeed be to startle men from their indifference , and to fill them with the most overwhelming alarm and terror . But for that very reason it would tend to prevent their repentance . The mind which is wholly possessed by terror is virtually disabled from moral action . Fear has indeed a proper place among the agencies of conversion . But it is wholly a preliminary and subordinate place . Its proper office is to rouse men from their carelessness and to bring them where the true motives of repentance can reach them . These motives are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sense of God 's mercy in Christ . But the moment the principle of fear passes into // that of terror , this effect ceases . Instead of holding the mind to these motives , it drives it wholly beyond their reach . It turns it away from all effective thought upon its own sin and God 's mercy , to be wholly occupied and paralyzed by the mere sense of danger . The soul in such a state may . see its own sin and recognize it as the very source and occasion of the dreadful evil which is impending over it ; but the sight tends to produce only the agony of remorse , not the genial sorrow of repentance . Now the appearance of Christ among men , in the circumstances above supposed , would have precisely this effect . It would work one of the three agencies of conversion with overwhelming power ; but it would be that one which by itself never can lead men to repentance , and which , when overdriven , throws the other two more indispensable ones wholly off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was invoked to accomplish . And this is precisely in accordance with what we see in actual life . The times when men are converted are not times of great terror or distress . Revivals of religion have almost never been known to take place under the immediate pressure of any great and overwhelming calamity . The ravages of a pestilence shake whole communities with terror , but they do not lead them to repentance . The deck of a sinking ship is a place of terror , but it is not a place of repentance . An earthquake , a hurricane , a volcanic eruption flooding whole cities with fire ; these are agencies of terror , but they are not found to be , in their immediate action , agencies of repentance . If they ever do act to produce this effect , it is as anticipated beforehand or remembered afterward . From the beginning of the world until now , the reign of terror has never been the reign of God 's Spirit . And essentially what is true of the terrible in this respect , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very relation of these two things to the conversion of men , who are looking to the personal coming of Christ as the means of converting the world . The supernatural does not produce its best moral effect while it is directly before the eyes . It may have then its strongest tendency to startle and alarm , but not // to spiritually convince and subdue . In order to produce the best moral effect , it requires to be set at a proper distance from the soul , so that its influence may conic to us , not so swiftly and forcibly as to outrun the moral elements of the truth and preoccupy the mind before they can arrive , but so slowly and so far that its influence may have time completely to intermingle and lose itself in theirs , and to be felt only as giving them a higher tone and a quicker power of impulse . It is in this way that the supernatural comes to us in the Bible ; suffused through it , not crystallized out of it : drawing the moral and spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it strike the soul together in one united and duly proportioned stroke , causing it to yield in its whole mass , and not to break asunder and become useless as it would if the smiting force came upon it in divided order and with the supernatural elements projecting far forward of the others . It is sometimes said that miracles were intended only for the age in which they occurred . But this is a very superficial view of their nature and office . The miracles of the Bible were intended for all subsequent time . They have entered into and become an inseparable part of the very force and life of that Christianity whose way they prepare , whose history they inaugurate , and whose triumph they shall hasten . Men are as truly feeling the force of those miracles now , as did the original beholders of them . The miracles are not losing one particle of their moral importance , or of their moral power , as the ages pass away further and further from them . Nor will they do so even to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real an influence now as at first ; they are exerting a better influence : i. e. , their present influence includes in it and carries with it more of the moral and spiritual element ; gives a wider scope , a higher prominence and a stronger force to that element ; and so is every way more mature , more normal , more nearly accordant in the whole quality and mode of its operation , to the original intent and idea of a mirade . Our faith needs miracles to rest upon as truly as that of any earlier and ruder age ; and the miracles which these earlier and ruder ages saw , they saw as truly for us as for themselves ; more truly for us than for themselves . // " All these things happened unto them for ensamples , and they are written for our instruction upon whom the ends of the world have come : " written by prophets and evangelists , who indeed looked upon them , but " unto whom it was revealed that not so much unto themselves as unto us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you by them that have preached the gospel among you . " Miracles are like wine ; it is only after they have felt the ripening force of time that they can bring out their best powers , their true spiritual qualities . " Blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed . " The best effect of miracles is not upon the age that sees them , but upon the following ages which believe in them through the word of those that did behold them . If we want miracles , let ns not ask for new ones , but go back to the old . If we want signs and wonders , let us not ask for a second coming of Christ to furnish them , but turn ourselves to those that were furnished by the first . If miracles are needed to convert the world , it has them already : it has them in just the right place and at just the right distance to produce their best effect upon the conversion of the world . Whatever in this behalf can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded in the Bible-can be done better by them than by any new ones , however strange and wonderful , that could now be brought into their place . If men believed not the old , neither would they believe the new . " If they heard not Moses and the Prophets , neither would they be persuaded , though one rose from the dead . " The second coming of Christ itself , with all its majesty and overwhelming might , would not persuade those that fail to be persuaded by the greater miracle of his first coming . The greatest , the most amazing and in a moral sense the mightiest miracle which the world ever has seen , or which the world or the universe ever can see , is the miracle of the incarnation and death of the Son of God ,  --  when his omnipotence was made human weakness-when his omnipresence was compressed within the puny outlines of a man-when the burning brightness of his inapproachable glory was veiled and quenched beneath a countenance of unradiant clay-when the King of kings and Lord of lords descended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deepest woe ,  - -  when he whose word supports the world , and fills the universe with life , bowed his bleeding head and said , " I thirst , " - when God the mighty Maker died , For man the creature 's sin . The first coming of the Son of God was the true and most stupendous miracle : for it was his divine nature putting its glory under supernatural constraint and confinement : whereas his second coming , under however inconceivable conditions of majesty and splendor , will only be the unloosing of that glory from its unnatural imprisonment , and the returning of it to its natural and ordinary course of manifestation . What ea*n* the second coming of Christ do , therefore , to persuade those that have not been persuaded by the first ? The moral and melting omnipotence of Christ , everything in him which has power to 8ubdue the sinner 's heart , was manifested in his first appearing . The only thing left to be manifested by his second , is his material and judicial omnipotence : it is the lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall make men cry to the rocks and the mountains to fall upon them and hide them from Him that sitteth upon the throne . Would such an appearing of Christ on earth tend to promote the conversion of the world ? It would by the very necessity of things bring the whole process of the world 's conversion to an instant end . It would make the supernatural and the terrible to become instantly one ; and their onset upon the mind of the sinner in momentary expectation of destruction , would be such as to make him incapable of attending to those moral motives in view of which , if at all , the real act of repentance must be performed . It would virtually unseat and overthrow that whole constitution and course of things on which the very idea of repentance is founded , and without which probati9n itself is in effect impossible . It would be virtually to all whom it found impenitent , the recalling of the offers of mercy , and the shutting of the gates of life ; for how could the still small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow // gate of life be found , when every faculty of the soul was paralyzed with amazement , and every other sentiment and thought was swallowed np in the one overmastering passion of terror . No : when Christ comes the second time in power and glory it must be to judgment . That coming would in effect be itse*f the judgment . It would be so in almost the same sense in which death is the beginning of judgment to the disembodied soul . It would arrest all the processes that look toward conversion . It would fix all men unchangeably upon the same side of the great line of division on which it found them . It would say to the world as emphatically as the final doom itself : " He that is unjust let him be unjust still ; and he that is filthy let him be filthy still ; and he that is righteous let him be righteous still ; and he that is holy let him be holy still . " But , says the objector , it is to be supposed that Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple fiat of his omnipotence . All natural tendencies to the contrary would be removed or overborne by an exercise of sovereign power . What occasion , then , for that overawing majesty and splendor which the objector maintains to be of such peculiar force in subduing the nations ? A fiat of omnipotence is as effective and as easily effective without such impressive circumstance , as with it . Nay , what occasion is there that Christ should come in person at all ? If his mere omnipotence is to do the work , he can do it as well while remaining in heaven as though he were on earth . The objector 's two principles destroy each other . The moment he asserts that the conversion of the world is to take place by the mere fiat of Christ 's omnipotence , he takes away the ground on which he has based the necessity of Christ 's coming . The moment he returns to assert the necessity of Christ 's coming in order to the world 's conversion , he takes away the possibility of referring that event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objection to qualify it , as is sometimes done , by saying that the omnipotence by which the result is to be effected , is that of the Holy Spirit . In either case the principle is the same . // The mere flat of omnipotence works as well with one means as with another , and without either as with both . The corning of Christ in person , then , would have no natural tendency to hasten the conversion of the world . In each one of the three modes in which only it could act upon that result at all , it would act upon it unfavorably . Instead of enlarging the effusions of the Holy Spirit , it would tend to diminish them . Instead of making the Church more efficient in its labors for the world , it would make it more inefficient . Instead of putting the world itself in a more favorable condition for being savingly affected by Christian labor and Christian truth , it would put it everyway in a far less favorable conditioni Whether we look at the spiritual quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the facts of the Church 's history , or at the constitution and laws of the human soul , we must conclude that such an event as the second coming of Christ would inevitably and immeasurably multiply the obstacles in the way of the world 's conversion . To expect such an event to hasten the mere outward subjugation of the world , would be to calculate in accordance with known principles : to expect it to promote the inward subduing of the race would be to forget the very laws of conversion , and the very structure of the human mind . It is not only nuphilosophical , it is unchristian . It is not only to forget the laws of the mind : it is to forget the very words of the Lord Jesus . " It is expedient for you that I go away . " Christ put no such value upon his bodily presence as to deem it indispensable for the highest good of his people or for the most effectual extension of his kingdom . On the contrary , he saw in it a quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore he took it out of the way . IDid he therefore leave behind him a Christless Church , to undertake by its own resources , and with half a Gospel , the conversion of the world ? " And Jesus came and spake unto them , saying , all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth ; - go ye therefore and teach all nations ; and lo , I am with you alway , even unto the end of the world . " Christ bids and expects his Church to disciple the nations , // not on the strength of some new and peculiar presence of his which shall come to them just before the end of the world ; but on the strength of the very same presence which is to be with them all the way onward from the beginning . Christ is not absent from his people and yet to come to them before they can fulfill successfully his last command . He is witl&amp; the7m alrecsdy ; always has been , always will be : - with them more fully , more intimately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the world 's conversion , than he could be were he to stand upon the Mount of Olives in a visible form , and girded with more than apocalyptic splendors . For then he would be a Christ before them : now he is a Christ within them : and it is the Christ within , and not the Christ without , that is to be the hope of victory , as well as the hope of glory .
