Fields , James Thomas , 1817-1881 : THE YOUNG BRIDE . from Poems , in Gems for you ( 1850 ) She stood like an angel just wandered from heaven , A pilgrim benighted away from the skies , And little we deemed that to mortals were given Such visions of beauty as came from her eyes . She looked up and smiled on the many glad faces , The friends of her childhood , who stood by her side , But she shone o'er them all , like a queen of the Graces , When , blushing , she whispered the oath of a bride . We sang an old song , as with garlands we crowned her , And each left a kiss on her beautiful brow , And we prayed that a blessing might ever surround her , And the future of life be unclouded as now . Fields , James Thomas , 1817-1881 : THE NEW HAMPSHIRE GIRLS . from Poems , in Gems for you ( 1850 ) See how yon smiling sisters stand To greet the sons who roam ; Each daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ! " See how they form , with lips and eyes , Hope 's radiant band of pearls ; Match if you can , beneath the skies , Our dear New Hampshire girls ! What though the autumn rain-drops freeze Where those we love were born ? They win their beauty from the breeze , Their vigor from the morn ! The tempests round their dwellings shout , And howls November 's storm ; For us their fires are never out , Whose hearts are always warm . Go forth , poor exiled youth , away , Where other maidens dwell ; Come back , when all your locks are gray , To those you loved so well . Come back , though time has left you poor , And all your sands have run  --  There stands your mother at the door , To clasp her darling son . God bless the troop whose nightly prayers Rise up for those who roam , God bless them , ' mid their daily cares  --  Those guardian saints of home ! Forget not , then , to mingle here With wit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's full cheer For our New Hampshire girls !
