ART . YI. - BROWN , ON THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER . Expositary Discourses on the First Epistle of the Apostle Peter . By JOHN Bnowx , D.D. , Senior Minister of the United Presbyterian Congregation , Broughton Place , Edinburgh , and Professor of Exegetical Theology to the United Presbyterian Church . New York : Robert Carter &amp; Brothers , 285 Broadway . 8vo. pp. 800 . THE first epistle of Peter is one of the choicest books of the New Testament . It is not characteristically discursive as are the epistles of Paul , nor meditative as are those of John , nor ethical as is the epistle of James , but it is instructive , devotional and practical all in one . It presents the great facts of the Christian faith , in statements singularly compact , forcible and full of meaning . It kindles the feelings by the very force and interest of the truths which it utters , accomplishing by a word or a hint what might be expanded and repeated , in a variety of forms . It draws from these truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusive inferences without the formality of deduction . The manner of the writer , so far as it is peculiar , arises preeminently from his felicity in condensing into striking statements , truths which furnish their own evidence from the manner and form in which they are uttered . There is no single book of the New Testament which within the same extent contains more , perhaps none which contains so much , of the Christian system of doctrine and of duty , as this epistle of five chapters . For the reasons which we have given , it has always been a favorite book for public exposition and private reading . No book is more frequently opened for familiar remarks in the lecture-room ; none is more fruitful of meditation in the closet . Of all the commentaries upon this favorite epistle , that which stands highest in the estimation of the church , is the commentary of Archbishop Leighton. - " Next to the inspired Scripture , " says Coleridge , " yea , and as the vibration of that once struck hour remaining on the air , stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Doddrige , his editor , calls Leighton " this great adept in true Christianity , " and speaks with enthusiasm of " the delight and edification which he had found in the writings of this wonderful man . " Dr. Henry Miles , a correspondent of IDoddridge , says with truth : " There is a spirit in Archbishop Leighton I never met with in any human writings ; nor can I read many lines in them without being moved . " // 244 Brown , on the First Epistle of Peter . Leighton is always just in thought , generally correct and even felicitous in his exposition of the meaning of the apostle , but always felicitous in the exposition of practical Christianity . His style is uncommonly pure and correct for its time . It often rises into passages of exquisite beauty , and is studded with images which are strikingly appropriate , and satisfy the mind with serene and delightful associations . The occasional formality of expression suits well with the authority of one speaking with the positiveness suited to a long experience of the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freshness to that sweetness and melody , which otherwise might cloy and tire . The mystic vein to which the author was inclined by his natural temperament and a long life of sorrow , differs as widely from the forced and second-hand imitations which obtrude themselves upon the public in these days , as the fragrance that loads the atmosphere of a breezy day in June differs from the stifling and sickening odor that is emitted from a conservatory of plucked and fading flowers . It may naturally be asked , If Leighton is so good , what occasion , or room even , is there for another exposition ? Surely all attempts to rival Leighton must be vain . This is true . Leighton can not be rivaled or equaled upon his own ground . But he has not occupied the whole ground . We have now ample means by which to elicit the exact meaning of the sacred text . The truths of Christianity must now be brought to face the antagonist opinions that are peculiar to our times . The duties that the gospel enjoins , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features , need to be illustrated with reference to new conditions of society , and to be enforced against mighty systems of error , that , in the name of Christian reform , overturn the foundations of Christian ethics , and abjure the very spirit of Christ . Besides , Leighton is not sufficiently close and specific in unfolding the truths and duties of his text to meet the wants of those in every generation who look to an exposition , not only for principles but for their particular applications . The exposition before us is evidently the work of a superior man and an industrious scholar . The author had at his command the most important appliances which the Latin , English , and French commentaries could furnish , and the aid of a translation from the German work of Steiger . It is obvious that he has made diligent use of these helps , and what is of more consequence , that he has sagacity and good sense in seizing upon the meaning of his author , and the power of stating that meaning in condensed and felicitous language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To understand an author , even to the incer // shades of meaning , and the delicate turns of expression , is one thing ; to translate that meaning into brief , striking expressions , doing entire justice to the author , and meeting the wants of the reader , is an art of more difficult attainment . The translation of the epistle which is prefixed to the exposition , is a decisive proof , that Dr. Brown has no common skill in this important requisite to the successful expounder of the Scriptures . Such translations often obscure , or weaken , or degrade the sense . This translation makes the meaning more clear , and though we miss , as we always must , the familiar words that have been consecrated in our minds by their inherent strength , and by long association , yet we are not repelled by the want of force or dignity in the words which are used in their place . The commentary was originally delivered in the form of expository discourses to the author 's congregation . It has been recast however , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was originally applied . The text is broken into passages of a few verses each , such as would naturally be selected for the theme of a single discourse . IMlinuter points of criticism are disposed of in separate notes at the end of each discourse , while topics of graver difficulty are the subjects of a more extended discussion . The exposition as a whole we regard as successful , and the book though very large is very readable . We do not mean by this that it is readable because it contains matter on every page which is good yet commonplace , nor that it is true yet trivial* nor do we intend that it is warm-hearted yet weak , nor that it is ingenious yet rambling , nor that it is imaginative yet running wild into a tangle of conceits ; but that it is the product of a man of strong sense and superior scholarship , who has applied himself with earnestness to the work of finding out the meaning of his text and of communicating that meaning by extended and forcible illustrations . We mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his discussions , unity , freshness and point , qualities in which preachers , and especially expository preachers , are so often deficient . We think it a very great objection to the work , that it is so large . It would be far more useful , were it much shorter , and it might have been shorter , had the author sought to make it so . There are more pages than there ought to be , in which the author indulges in remarks which by the force of reiteration become meaningless commonplaces . There are others , in which passages from the Scriptures are quoted , rather for their remote pertinency than for their close-fitting application . The style is now and then dragging , or sohieppend as the Germans phrase it , which term is more expressive than its // English rendering , we suppose , because the Germans have themselves furnished such numerous and wearisome illustrations of its import . Notwithstanding these defects , the work stands out from the mass of works of the kind , with marks of decided superiority . The matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a moderate but decided Calvinist , who is by no means confined to the set phrases , certain of which he freely uses , betraying a Scottish rather than an American origin . But he does not sink the interpreter in the divine . He has the honesty to give the meaning of the text , as he understands it , and not as the Westminster divines have referred to it . He does not care to prove election by a textwhich does not prove it , merely because the catechism has referred to this as one of its proofs . He scorns the dishonesty of causing his battery of proof texts to appear the more formidable by making it bristle with the muzzles of sundry spiked cannon . The interpreter is , however , not wholly independent of the divine , and we notice several instances , in which the exposition of the text and the doctrine which it contains , suffers not a little from the attempt to find in the text , all the meaning which has been put there , by an artificial system of theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate in these failings ; yet we wish they were not present . In the enforcement of practical duties , Dr. Brown is very successful . In discoursing of the duties of husbands and wives , of masters and servants , &amp;c. , his principles are sound , and the application of them is faithful and useful in the highest degree . These discussions are very extended , and they recommend this volume as a valuable book for the use of Christian families . In respect to ecclesiastical polity he is decidedly Presbyterian , though he does not so much discuss the scriptural authority of " the eldership " as enlarge upon the duties which the office involves . The wise suggestions which are made in this connection can be readily transferred to church officers of another name , and the duties of the flock which are enlarged upon , will be felt to be due to pastors as well as to the session . While , for the reasons suggested , we recommend this book as valuable for the use of lay and clerical readers , it may be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty of " expository preaching . " It was principally for the sake of offering a few suggestions on this subject that we placed this volume at the head of this paper . We do not know the work , which is on the whole a better example of what this kind of preaching ought to be , and of what it may be made to be by needful effort . Though by no means a perfect or even a // safe model , it demonstrates the fact , that this kind of preaching can be as interesting as any other . It proves , also , that in several particulars it is far superior . We are well aware that the very phrase " expository preaching , " will , with many of our readers , awaken feelings of displeasure and disgust . Our clerical brethren will be reminded of sundry abortive efforts at expounding the Scriptures , which were attempted as make-shifts in cases of extreme necessity , or at best of irregular and rambling remarks , which have consumed the half hour at a weekly lecture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tedious statistical enumerations , or uninteresting historical particulars , or loose-jointed discoursings , which have strangely contrasted with the compact argument , the eloquent description , the impassioned appeal , the earnest expostulation , and above all the finished oration , which they are accustomed to call " a fine sermon . " This method of preacbing has , so far as we know , rarely been practiced in the pulpits of New England , nor in those in which New England sympathies and the New England theology have predominated . A strong and determined dislike to it prevails among most of the churches of New England and those planted by the New England stock . The other churches of this country are more or less accustomed to this kind of preaching . The Presbyterian churches of Scotland expect the morning lecture , as regularly as they do the evening sermon , and the habit of following the exposition with the open Bible , strikes an American as a pleasant peculiarity . The Dissenting churches of England tolerate it also , and a course of expository sermons from the pulpit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to this subject , the prejudices of some of the New Englanders are beginning to relax , and that fashion shows signs of change . It is with the hope of speeding the change onward and making it safe and salutary , that we venture the following suggestions in regard to the requisites and the advantages of successful exposition . An expository discourse must possess unity of subject and unity of method . One of the most fatal objections to this kind of disconrse from the pulpit is , that an extended passage presents more than one topic , and embodies a great number of thoughts , each one of which is equally prominent with every other , and all in the preacher 's view must necessarily receive equal attention . The preacher selects his passage , and beginning at the first phrase , takes each regularly in its turn , and marches on with even step till he comes to the last , treating each proposition , allusion and appeal as of equal importance ; and , regardless of the fact that they are all related to a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should be referred , he strikes them all apart , and treats them as independent items of an account book . It is no wonder that the hearer is distracted and confused , and that the preacher is disappointed at efforts so disjoined as these . But the expounder labors under no such necessity as this . By far the greater portion of the passages which are appropriate for his purpose , are pervaded by a real and striking unity of theme . This theme gives character and meaning to the several parts of the selection , as they serve to prove , to illustrate , and to enforce the leading thought . The writers of the sacred volume did not write without method , nor did they usually drop single and disconnected sentences , like separate pearls , but they bound their thoughts together by the ordinary relations . We see not why the arguments which they use may not be treated by the preacher as arguments in their relation to the truths which they prove , as well as the arguments which he himself selects from his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken as the theme of a sacred essay or oration . If these arguments need to be expanded or confirmed , let this be done freely and at length . If other parts of the passage do not consist of thoughts for confirmation , but rather of those which illustrate , enliven , or enforce its drift , let them be treated as less important , one being disposed of by a single remark , and another receiving more ample illustration ; but all these passing notices should be held in subservience to the leading thought , and the attention of preacher and hearer should be continually brought back to the fact or truth on which the several parts are strung . It may happen , indeed , that two or more truths of equal value may occur within the passage chosen , and that the passage can not be broken in twain ; but in such a case , the preacher is under no stern law of necessity , obliging him to give an equal notice to each . The one may be selected as the theme for the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , just sufficient to explain its place in the passage , and to do justice to the mind of the writer . Unity of theme is absolutely essential , and the theme must be distinctly stated at the outset , and brought home repeatedly to the attention of the hearer . This being done , it is not essential that the formal division and the symmetrical arrangement of an ordinary sermon should be strictly observed ; on the other hand , the beauty and grace of an exposition arises from the fact , that the preacher in a measure yields himself to the thoughts of the sacred writer , and seeks by every means in his power to reproduce the workings of his mind in their original freshness and force . Hence , his laws of method , though real , are less rigid ; his notions of unity , though severely // strict , are realized by a different arrangement . In sustaining this unity of theme , we acknowledge great skill is required , and some experience . Above all , a truly philosophical training , and habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources of a liberal culture , and extended reading , and wide experience , will be placed under requisition , to bring out and render striking the course of thought . But this unity must be secured at any cost of labor and illustration . If this is sacrificed , everything is lost , and all the common objections against this mode of preaching hold good . To secure this unity may involve much labor , especially to an unpracticed hand . From this new and peculiar labor many preachers shrink . They have not sufficient resolution to encounter the new demand , or they fail in courage to bring themselves before their hearers in a new kind of effort , and so they prefer the old and beaten way of regular sermonizing . Expository preaching should be eminently historical . By historical preaching , we do not mean preaching that is drily and minutely accurate in respect to names and dates  --  to dimensions and distances  --  to geography and chronology . Accuracy in respect to all these points is indeed essential to the preacher , and often valuable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pulpit or the occupation of time with them , is always ill-advised . The historical exposition of the Scriptures recognizes the fact , that the several parts of the Scriptures were written at different times , and by different men . It aims to attain true and vivid conceptions of the times in which the books were written , and of the men to whom they were addressed , that it may have just conceptions of what was intended by the writers , under the circumstances in which they wrote . After gaining these conceptions , truly and vividly for himself , the preacher must seek actually to impart them to others . This is oftc*n a difficult task . For the knowledge offered is often that in which the hearers have little interest , until it is forced upon them , and it sometimes shocks their prejudices and disturbs their superstitious idolatry for the false and exaggerated associations which have clustered about the word . To the attainment of this knowledge , the preacher is bound to summon all his energies . He is bound to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he interpret the word at all , as an enlightened Christian teacher ought to do ? What can be said of the intelligence , what even of the honesty of that man who is set to be the guiding light of other minds , who does not earnestly strive to comprehend the Scriptures as they were understood by those for whom and to whom they were given at first ? He is bound to do this for the sake of his hearers , who may be trained to look at the Scriptures not // merely as containing a system of consistent truths and a series of startling facts , but who may regard these truths with somewhat of the same interest with which they were clothed , when they first broke upon the mind of man , and may understand the facts as real and actual occurrences , just as those regarded them before whose startled senses Lazarus was raised , or the dumb man spoke , or the voice thundered from the cloud . To make our meaning apparent , an example or two will suflice . Let us take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who , according to his abundant mercies , hath begotten us again into a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead . " The systematic divine , in his eager hunt after proof texts , finds here a decisive and unequivocal statement of the doctrine of regeneration by the Spirit , one of " the fruits " of which , as laid down in the catechism , is " hope . " The resurrection of Christ he dimly recognizes as an event which was connected with the promise of the Spirit . The dry and formal exegete gives greater prominence to the resurrection , and huddles together the parallel texts that recognize this event as most important , inasmuch as by it the risen Jesus was declared to be the Son of God with power , and was prepared to reign as mediatorial King . But the impressions which he gives are vague and technical , and the interpretation has more to do with the dry and thorny subtleties of scholastic divinity , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theater of the world 's real history , which flashed a new brightness from the world that lies beyond the tomb , and " brought life and immortality to light . " The historical expositor of this passage conceives distinctly , and strikingly sets forth , the thoughts and feelings of the world , before Christ lived and died , in respect to the life beyond . He takes his hearers backward because he himself has been there , to a group of devout Jews as they sit in mourning about the corpse of a deceased friend , or as they hide it forever behind the door of the tomb . He does justice to the reality of their hope concerning the continued existence of the spirit , that still lived with God . He does justice also to their dark and dim groping into the invisible , and their earnest longings after some tidings from behind the dismal curtain . He makes his hearers feel that these were the real thoughts and feelings , the actual expectations and misgivings of the wisest and best of the praying men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He then introduces Jesus upon the scene . He paints the most wonderful being that ever lived among men , his life , his teachings , his words , his deeds . He describes his death , and how the hearts of his dis // 1851 . Brown , on the First Epistle of Peter . ciples died when he was taken down from the cross and laid in the sepulcher . He paints the rising , not in its material accompaniments , nor in the shock which it occasioned to the astonished Roman and the bitterly hating Jew , but in " the lively hope " which it awakened in the breasts of believing disciples who had seen all this , and in the hearts of the multitudes who heard the story from those who with their own eyes had seen Jesns " dead , " and had afterwards seen him " risen . " After all this " historic " exposition has been given , the teacher is prepared to show how the exultant Peter could break ont into the exclamation , " Blessed be the God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him the jnbilant disciples could unite in the same trinmphant song . He can show how they were literally " begotten again , " by means of a hope that was indeed life-giving  --  a hope literally enlivened by the wonderful fact , that had occnrred in their own times , and of which not a few living men could tell . We dwell for a moment on another passage : " Whom having not seen ye love , and in whom though now ye see him not , yet believing , ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory . " What an immense advantage is gained by the interpreter who can do historic justice to this truth , by a reference to the times when it was nttered , and the meaning which it had in those times ! The drily doctrinal preacher takes occasion from it for a very unlovely disqnisition on the reason why Christ is lovely to the believing . The dull commentator qnotes passages to which his reference bible directs him , or which his concordance furnishes to his hand , or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing " or " full of glory , " according to the a8mts loquendi in the Hebrew or the Greek . But the real , that is , the historic interpreter , pictures to his hearers the aged yet ardent apostle urging the duty of steadfastness upon a company of disciples who were every day tempted to apostasy. lie shows them how it may well be supposed , that the reply would come to their very lips , " if we had seen him as yon have done , we too could believe and love . " He dwells upon the advantage which " the eyewitnesses of his glory " were supposed to possess above all others , how they were envied by the believers of another generation , how eager were the inquiries of these last , in respect to the minute particulars concerning the words and the appearance of the living Jesus . He shows that it was to such persons that the words were first addressed , and that the truth of these was doubtless often enforced by the blessing which Peter remeinbered to have heard his master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not seen but yet have believed . " // In this way and in this way alone , can the historic sense of the words be developed . We anticipate here the objection as possible , that the logical passages of the New Testament neither require nor admit of this historic interest , which is appropriate to the narrative and hortatory , portions . An argument , it is said , is the same for all generations . It is addressed to the intellect , which in all ages and under all circumstances is convinced by the same principles . To understand and feel the force of the Pauline discussions , it is not at all necessary that we know the circumstances under which they were written and the men whom they were designed to convince . We reply that the fact is precisely the opposite . To measure the force of an argument , to understand its meaning and to feel its appropriateness , it is absolutely necessary that we know the modes of thought , the objections , the prejudices , the knowledge or the ignorance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasoning , simply as reasoning , may be stated in a form which shall be the same for every age , yet it is often true that we can not conceive what the reasoning is , without knowing the position which the author designs to carry in the minds of his audience . Besides what is called an argument does not consist of one or many syllogisms . It embodies allusions which have no force except to the original audiences , arguments to those men which would be arguments to no other men , arguments from their concessions which the concessions of none others would permit to be drawn ; in short , an assemblage of considerations which are arranged and combined for the one original purpose , and which the reasoner framed with an eye to a single set of men . To know the first audience to whom these arguments were addressed is of indispensable importance , that we may do justice to these arguments . To be able to acquaint our hearers with them is of equal consequence . Especially is this necessary , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modes of reasoning that would pass current only with Jews . For lack of interpreting these arguments by the light of history , the reasonings of Paul , the acute dialectician of inspiration , have seemed confused and inconclusive , and have even been pronounced weak and unworthy . The Epistles to the IRomans and to the Hebrews can neither be understood nor explained , without vivid historical conceptions , faithful historical research , and successful historical painting . Expository preaching should also be practical . This observation may seem to be obvious and commonplace , and yet there is especial need that it should be made in this connection . As doctrinal preaching easily runs into a shadow-fight of abstraction , // so expository preaching may readily pass into a picturing of the past in which the drapery shall withdraw the attention from the object represented . There is need therefore of special painstaking , that the interest of the preacher be not exhausted upon the mere scenery of the transactions which he depicts , and that his energy be not expended upon ingenious attempts to conceive and set forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these transactions . He must have a sound theology and a Christian heart , to recognize in these events analogies to those of his own times , and to apply the workings of the minds of men in other times to the condition of his own hearers . He must not be so careful to separate " the transient " from " the permanent " in Christianity , as he is concerned to impress " the permanent " upon those for whose souls he watches , as one who must give account . In all the workings of his earnest desire to master and set forth the contents of the sacred volume , there must be seen to beat the strong and over-mastering purpose to bring home the earnest truth to the feelings and actions of his flock . It is a good rule , therefore , to let no discourse consist of a simple exposition of the word . Such an exposition , however ingenious and delightful , can never satisfy the judgment nor the conscience of the faithful and earnest preacher . Nor will he be content with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing remarks . For the purposes of unity and of usefulness , he will draw out these lessons into distinct and strongly uttered truths , one or more of which shall be the remembered lesson of the hour , and shall recur to the hearer as often as he shall read the passage in question . If the lessons are numerous , the attention will be distracted , and the impression from each will be faint . If they are not enforced as the main subject to which the exposition has been all the while directed , and in which it ter* inmates , the discourse will fail of a well defined , practical impression . Snch an impression all the uses of preaching require . To fall in this , is to fail in everything ; and the preacher who contents himself with anything short of powerful and distinct lessons of duty , abuses his trust . We believe that the strongest objections to this kind of preaching on the part of preachers and their hearers are founded in the secret persuasion , that it does not admit of ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . As it is too generally practiced , it is open to this objection . And nothing but a demonstration of the contrary , by actual examples of an earnest enforcement of duty , can remove such objections , and vindicate its high capacities for usefulness . The advantages of this kind of preaching are various . It is attended with this preeminent and peculiar use to the hearer , that // if successfully conducted , it invests the Scriptures with interest and dignity . Ko impression is more common than the real but unacknowledged conviction , that the Scriptnres are a dry and unattractive volume . Intelligent and well educated hearers , by thousands , who respect the Bible as divine , and revere its counsels and warnings , conceive of it only as the mysterious revelation of God , or the wise counselor of duty with which they ought indeed to have a moral and religious sympathy , but in which they do not imagine it possible , that they can have a high intellectual interest . In vain do they strive to penetrate the stiff incrustations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from years of childish familiarity , and years of later indifference or aversion . The mind is applied with new and repeated efforts to the work of reading it a other books are read , and of understanding it as other books are understood , but in vain . Early associations , strong dislike , and often a mistaken reverence unite to disappoint such efforts , and even to baffle endeavors that are in a measure earnest and persevering . It is not quite fair to solve all these difficulties , by ascribing them to a deficiency in moral sympathy , or to the want of spiritual discernment . Let it be granted that much is to be ascribed to this cause , still it remains true that the Bible , so far as it is fitted to interest the intellect , may be understood far better than it is . Especially may those portions of it be understood , which intermingle with the courses of human history , which touch human sympathies , and which unfold the workings of the strongest and most commanding springs of action . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be addressed to the human intellect . They record and explain the most wonderful and sudden changes in human opinion and in human character , which the world has ever witnessed . They show the causes of these changes in striking events claimed and believed to be supernatural , in bold and fervent declarations of those who professed to have beheld these events , in their meek attestation of this belief by the martyrdom of blood and fire ; and in the more wonderful attestation of a new style of character , a new phase of human nature of love given in return for hatred-of blessing returned for cursing  --  and of malignant and unprovoked wrong freely forgiven . All these events and these exhibitions of character , though spiritual in their causes , are human in their results , and as such are interesting to any intellect that is not passionately wicked , or stupidly debased . This human side of the Bible and especially of all that is history in the Bible  --  and in our view , the whole of the New Testament is nothing but historymay be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active // intellect . Nor is genius required for this work . The simple desire to comprehend the facts of the Bible for one 's own satisfaction , with the appliances that are within the reach of every student , will do much to awaken the human interest in the Scriptures , which we deem so important . If this kind of interest can be excited in the minds of intelligent hearers , it will secure their respect for the Scriptures . The Scriptures can not be despised , if they are shown to record events and opinions of so wonderful a character . The intellectual excitement and profit that is given by a true exposition of their contents , will secure them forever from contempt , their themes as intellectual themes from associations of weakness , and the preacher from the condemnation of narrow-mindedness . If the intellect is excited , the heart will be likely to be reached . If the contents of the Scriptures detain and arouse the attention , from their relations of interest to the intellect , the conscience will find it difficult to slumber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the man will be forced to think , and feel , and obey . Another advantage is found in the fact , that the instructions received are attached to the book that is oftenest in the hands of the hearer . An argument on a point of doctrine , however clear and conclusive , though it may satisfy the mind and put every doubt to flight , is rarely retained distinctly in the memory . A splendid sermon passes from the mind as quickly as the gaudy and fantastic groupings of the kaleidoscope , leaving often no trace of its presence except the most vague and unintelligent sentiment of admiration . But a successful exposition is forever after attached to the passage which it explained or enlivened , and whenever that passage meets the eye or the ear , it will recall the exposition . Nay , it will be invested with an interest which no other part of the Scriptures can possibly possess . Permanent impressions are those for which the preacher longs most ardently . He desires that what he says should be remembered , and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chagrined when he learns that a sermon is not heeded , or if attended to for the moment , can not be recalled even in the order or outline of thought , on which he labored so earnestly . What a personal satisfaction and an encouragement lie in the fact , that the book which his Christian hearers oftenest read , may , by his exposition of its contents , be made the very book which shall remind them the most frequently of his instructions ; that , as they turn over its pages , each page shall reveal some passage that is brightened by the light which he has cast upon it , and be loaded with the new meaning with which he enriched it ; so that even the book which brings // up the thought of God to the hearer , shall also call up the thoughts of their spiritual guide . Aspirations of this sort are not selfish nor sinfal ; they stimulate the pastor to secure to himself the purest of earthly joys , and the brightest of earthly crowns , the affectionate remembrance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , the preacher desires that he himself or his instructions should be remembered , he can not do it more effectually than by connecting his instructions with the word which every day meets the eye . Expository preaching is valuable to the preacher himself , as it requires and secures a generous and various culture of his powers . To understand and successfully to explain the Scriptures , as the aids of modern exegesis and the light of modem science enable us to understand them , tasks all the powers of the best trained and most richly furnished mind . The preacher must interpret poetry , eloquence , argument , and appeal . Not only must he be able to draw a correct meaning from this variety of language , but he must also be able to comprehend the men of another generation , to enter into their thoughts and feelings , and to understand the meaning of their words . Not only must he understand all this for hiinselS but he must justify and enforce it for others who are not learned and philosophic men , but who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning and philosophy . The lessons of duty and devotion of the sacred record must be urged upon the conscience and heart by earnest appeal , and in a united and single impression . The making of sermons , though it may involve a liberal range of thought , too often limits and narrows the mind . The system of doctrine once received and the style of appeal and illustration once adopted , the preacher too often makes one sermon very like another . He reexpresses the language of his texts in formuhe of stereotyped phraseology . He develops his subject after the same method , and he concludes the whole with the same style of application . The exercise of writing sermons is so laborious , and the demand for sermons is so frequent and steady , that the mind being forced by an unnatural pressure , and fagged by a constant exhaustion , lays hold of the thoughts nearest at hand , and falls into trains of argument and illustration that are familiar . Little time is taken for generous study , because generous study is not absolutely necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find little to startle or interest them in the recurrence of thoughts and words and methods that are familiar , find little to offend them . If the preacher takes a liberty of manner or speech that is unusual , he shrinks from the look of wonder , or the rustle // that indicates dislike , and so falls back into the dull round of listless monotony . Against these tendencies to a narrow range of study , the preacher is bound to secure himself by every possible precaution . The most effectual security is that which grows out of the way in which one 's profession itself is prosecnted . Preparation for the pulpit should itself be made to involve the widest circle of stndies , and the most liberal education of the faculties . That such a course of study and training may make itself felt in expository preaching , nay , that it is required by it , is obvious from the considerations already noticed . Another way in which exposition favors this result , is seen in the fact , that a course of exposition upon almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of subjects than are handled in ordinary preaching . The preacher is brought to consider them by the progress of his exposition . He can not evade them , and he is forced to treat them thoroughly . Many a preacher who has committed himself to the task of expounding a single book , has been surprised at the novel subjects which he has been forced to discuss , the new efforts of thought to which he has been summoned , the special researches which have been required , and the conscious advantages which have been the consequence . We speak the experience of many , we are confident , when we assert that such exercises have been more profitable to themselves than any of their other efforts for the pulpit . The greater freedom of handling which is admissible in the treatment of expository themes , the greater liberty of discourse and of illustration , the more familiar tone which is not only allowed but required , are all favorable to personal improvement . The liability to fail is greater , we admit , but this itself is a stimulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat them . The preacher finds that preaching admits of greater variety than he has allowed himself , and that the wider his reach of thought and the more familiar his dealing with his subject and with his hearers , the greater is the satisfaction which he gives if he retains his respect for his hearers , his theme , the sacredness of the pulpit , and for himself . From the experience of these advantages he gains a higher estimate of the resources of his profession . His weekly preparations are pursued with a new interest , and he carries through life a wakeful mind that is rather liberalized than narrowed by his professional studies . We hardly need advert to the fact , that the preaching which most instructs and improves the intellect of the preacher , will be likely to improve the intellect of his hearers . A sermon is not or ought not to be , a mere moral or religions homily . It ought // to be also an instructive lecture , imparting new information , reviewing that which is already known , starting new trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ? reaching , to be useful , on the largest scale and with a permanent influence , must excite and satisfy the intellect , not after a vulgar and fashionable sort , by setting the crowd agape , by affectations and caprice , but by stirring the mind with earnest argument , and enrichino ' it with new principles and new applications of principles . *iATe have shown how the Scriptures are fitted to be the food of the intellect , and what means of interest they present to the preacher who will draw them out for the use of his hearers . He then who will bring out their various wealth and accompany this wealth by the earnest and quickening action of his own excited intellect , can not but benefit his hearers . His preaching will be a constant and generous education of their minds as well as a discipline of their hearts . His preaching will be regarded with a constantly increasing interest , and the effect will be seen in a people eager for information and enlightened in respect to all those great questions , concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching is demanded by the errors peculiar to onr times . These errors are summed up in a prevailing disesteem for the value and the authority of the Scriptures . By a large and increasing class of men of eager and active minds , the reality of a supernatural revelation is rejected . Industrious and insidious efforts are made to extend these opinions . They are boldly avowed , as if the whole contest was to be carried by the very force of audacity . They are insinuated by the most subtle and fascinating devices of ingenious craft . They are diffused through attractive books and more attractive lectures . Not only is the supernatural authority of the Scriptures rejected or thrust aside , but those who profess to receive it treat this authority with little practical deference ; on the one hand , breaking down the Scriptures by loads of meaning which they will not bear , or on the other , weakening them to utter inanition , by taking from them all positive import , and even the possibility of possessing any import at all . Objections against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is taken for granted that their truths , if they declare any , are at war with the intellect and science of the day , and that the cultivated intellect of the times has far outrun their teachings , in respect both to the sciences of nature , and the science of morals , so that the Scriptures are now in a fair way to be voted down at scientific conventions and in political cabals . There is no use in disguising this state of things . Every preacher who will conde // scend to acquaint himself with the actual judgments of many in the community in which , he lives , and even of many in his own flock , will find that this indefinite or completed infidelity in respect to the authority or the import of the Bible , prevails more widely than he has been aware . There is but one way to stem this current of evil . The Scriptures must be vindicated from the pulpit and in the pulpit , by using them freely and expounding them intelligently , with reference too , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctrinal preaching will not meet this difficulty , for what hold can the most convincing array of proof texts have upon that person who rejects , or half believes the authority of the book from whence they are drawn . Fine preaching , as it is called , gratifies the taste , amuses the fancy , and confirms the unbeliever in the conviction that the preacher regards the Bible with as little respect as he does himself For , he reasons shortly but surely , if he reverenced the book , he would preach it more , and himself less , frequently . The mystic vein is respected for its good intentions , its amicable spirit and its cultivation of the religious nature , but it can not command the respect , nor control the conscience , that needs to be warned and overawed by the awful facts which it can not deny , and by the stern realism of an angry God who has spoken to sinning man . Nothing will so effectually vindicate the Bible , as the intelligent use of the Bible by the preacher , who shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import to the history of the past , as well as to the doubts of the present time . We shall not be understood to say , that questions of learned interpretation , or questions of scientific exegesis , are to be brought into the pulpit , that the mythic theory and the various schemes of inspiration are to be learnedly discussed . We intend no such thing . Rather should the truth of the Scriptures as history , science and revelation be so justified that error should be excluded as impossible , and the arguments of error should be powerless to the well instructed mind . Rather should a respect for the Scriptures be so deeply inwrought by their manifested truthfulness and worth , that neither open denial , nor insidious unbelief should be able to gain a hearing with the mind . But the most important service , which the practice of expository preaching would render both to preachers and their hearers , would be to change the prevalent style of preaching , so far as it is at fault , and to correct the popular taste . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain of preaching or of preachers . Sometimes it is done from no good motives and in no good temper . We believe , however , if the opinion of very many discerning and candid men , both of the clergy and laity , could be distinctly ut // 260 Brown , on the First Epistle of Peter . tered , they would earnestly condemn certain prevailing tendencies in preaching , as degrading to the clerical profession , and likely to vitiate both the taste and . the piety of the churches . We care not to discuss the question who is most at fault in this matter , nor how and wheiice these tendencies originated . We are most concerned to know , how they may be arrested . The ambitious and affected cast of discussion in the pulpit which seems designed to startle and surprise , rather than to instruct , to invigorate and to warm , is no harmless nor trivial evil . Whether it be the ambition of style or the ambition of thought , whether the affectation be that of paradox or of oddity , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to make the people stare and to constitute the preacher a marked man , it is hostile both to the dignity and the sacredness of the clerical profession and to the true growth and steadfastness of the churches . The most effectual way to be rid of these evils is to displace them by that which is better . There is no way of doing this more effectually than by a resort to the Scriptures and the intelligent and glowing exposition of the stores of thought and feeling , of discussion and of appeal , which the Scriptures embody , and will give up under the hand of the workman . There is a manifest superiority in the manner in which truth is handled in the Bible , which will shame away all the trickery of a forced and fantastic eloquence . There is a severe simplicity of expression , which will correct an unhealthy taste . Above all , there is an earnest sternness and a fiery directness , that can not tolerate nor even endure anything that is not business-like , manly and zealous . Let expository preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anew the style of preaching , and the popular taste , not by a sudden and marked revolution , but by a slow but certain transformation . The charge of the late Dr. John , IMI . Mason to his people , from his farewell sermon , is altogether pertinent to our purpose , and adds to our argument the authority of an eminent example and model of pulpit eloquence : - " Do not choose a man who always preaches upon isolated texts . I care not how powerful or eloquent he may be in handling them . The effect of his power and eloquence will be , to banish a taste for the word of God and to substitute the preacher in its place . You have been accustomed to hear that word preached to you in its connection . Never permit that practice to drop . Foreign churches call it lectp5ring ; and when done with discretion , II can assure you , that , while it is of all exercises the most difficult for the preacher , it is , in the same proportion , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in going through a book of Scripture , // it spreads out before you all sorts of character , and all forms of opinion ; and gives the preacher an opportunity of striking every kind of evil and of error without subjecting him to the invidious suspicion of aiming his discourses at individuals . " We are not insensible to the difficulties that the enterprise proposed would encounter . We know that labor and ingenuity must be severely tasked , that the preacher must give himself to the earnest search for truth and for illustrations , more perhaps than to the study of startling groupings of thought and of galvanic spasms of expression . We know that many prejudices must be encountered , that old and inveterate habits must be abandoned , and that patience and hope must whisper the promise of the satisfaction that is long deferred . But we believe that to him who will labor as he may , and will labor as patiently and as long as he must , the reward will come , in abundant and blessed satisfaction to himself and his hearers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
