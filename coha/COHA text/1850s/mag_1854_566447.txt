txt ART . 11. - CHICAGO AND THE WEST . THE FOUNDATIONS OF MANY GENERATIONS . History of Chicago , by the Democratic Press . Report of the Committees respecting a Theological Seminary in the Northwest . THE first of the documents named above appeared in January of the present year ; it contains much valuable information , which , though local in its subject-matter , is adapted to interest every truly American heart . The book is mainly a record of statistics and events connected with the history of Chicago and of the early settlements of Illinois . From this pamphletsketch we learn that the mellifluous name of this fertile and beautiful State was derived from the Illeni or Illinois Indians , who were the aboriginal monarchs of the soil . The poor red man himself has been pressed to leave the home of his fathers , but civilization has richly embalmed his name in the permanent records of history . The first white men who ever visited this State were Marquett and Joliet , two Jesuit missionaries , who explored this portion of the Mississippi Valley in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years later . Subsequently this tract of country was claimed by the State of Virginia , who ceded it to the United States , surrendering all her claims to the whole territory northwest of the Ohio river . From 1800 to 1809 , Illinois was attached to Indiana ; in February of the latter year , it was duly organized into a territory , and held its first legislative session in November , 1812 . The Upper Ilouse of that body , consisting of five members , and the Lower TTouse of seven , without a lawyer or attorney among their number , did up their legislative work for the territory , like sensible and honest men , who " had a mind to work , " in ten or twelve days , and went to their homes , thus saving the Goverm7nent cost , and avoiding the temptations incident to a protracted and tedious session . In the year 1818 , this territory was formed into a State , and now contains more than a million of inhabitants . TWO years since Illinois had only one railroad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , according to exact estimates , more than two thousand miles completed , and before the first of January next , will have four thousand miles ; while // the number of roads already in process of construction , with their branches , amount to nearly eight thousand miles . There are already passing over these roads , to and from the city of Chicago , ninety trains daily . These roads branch into every portion of the State , bringing the backwoodsman and the lone dweller on the most distant prairie within convenient distance of a ready market , and thus making his acres correspondingly more productive . Chicago , though of mushroom growth , is rapidly organizing and maturing into a great commercial centre for an extended portion of our country , with its numerous veins and arteries running everywhere to convey intelligence and refinement , to excite enterprise and create wealth for the citizens . As late as eighteen hundred and twenty-nine , this place contained only six families of white inhabitants . The town of Chicago was incorporated probably in 1833 . The first Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thirteen persons voted on the question of incorporation ; and now what has human enterprise , under the guidance of Providence , wrought ! None but those who see the ninety or a hundred trains daily passing to and from the city , quickening commercial life , stimulating enterprise , not only through Illinois but throughout both the East and West-none but those who can personally compare the seventy thousand inhabitants of Chicago with the six families of eighteen hundred and twenty-nine , can have any adequate idea of its rapid growth and the extension of its commerce . A citizen , who entered this port , which is now cut by a thousand keels , in a log canoe , towed by the wild savage , and organized the first Sabbath-school , is still numbered in the ranks of Sabbath-school teachers , and yet is but in the meridian of life . The first church was organized in 1833 , and the number of churches is now more than forty . During the six days appointed to labor , there goes up from every quarter the music of toil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of persevering industry , renders every department an exhibition of thrilling interest . Whoever will take notice how , as months revolve , the prairie recedes from block to block before the advancing city , will know that a civilization of no ordinary enterprise and progress is here . Unless one stop his ears against the many combined voices of trade , where the very wilderness of nature is dissolving by the touch of labor and art , he will have impressive evidence that here are laying the foundations of many generations . That this is to be a great commercial mart - one of the greatest-needs not a prophet 's eye to foresee , nor a prophet 's tongue to foretell . From this inland port the hardy // Sons of trade are to go forth , to cross seas , to traverse deserts , to explore the arcana of nature , and gather up the riches of continents ; so that in this magnificent emporium , it is believed , all manner of trades will be represented , and all kinds of merchandise exposed for sale , except " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless , like Nineveh , and Babylon , and old Tyre , its wickedness shall antedate its doom , and call down the scourge of God to execute it , we confidently anticipate that this garden city will sit as queen of these inland seas . But every rational hope of a destiny so glorious must rest upon a firm basis , else the strongest anticipations will fade into a splendid delusion  --  the fairest fabric which the imagination can rear will prove only as a vision that is not from God . We make specific reference to this city , which is , perhaps , without a parallel in the history of cities , ancient or modern , for the rapidity of its growth and the elasticity of its enterprise , because it is a very correct index of the whole Western country . It is the foreshadowing of a growth already commenced , on a grander scale than has heretofore existed . The prosperity of this garden city is a condensed representation of those resources on which it is dependent for its thrift . Secular enterprise is laying down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even , is sweating , and covered with dust , to develop the hidden resources which God will have brought out for the promotion of his cause ; and these vigorous movements by the children of this world , constitute a definite call upon the church , to gird herself for more strenuous and self-denying efforts . They should lose no time in entering to possess the land which is so freely laid open by secular enterprise . Jehovah is emphatically assigning to this day and this generation , the toil of laying foundations for generations to come . The benevolent forces under the Captain of Salvation , the teachers of truth , and all true philanthropists , are pressingly invited into the open and opening fields of the West . The " children of this world " have volunteered to excavate the harbors , pile up the stone and mortar , and lay down the extended rail tracks ; and because this rough work is all needful in casting up a highway for the Redeemer 's kingdom , God gratifies the laborers by giving them success . ile sees how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust of the spade to advance his cause ; howbeit , they who often direct these efforts mean not so , neither do their hearts think so . It belongs to the church instrumentally to infuse the spirit of the Gospel into these openings made by secular enterprise . The disciples // of Christ must breathe the soul of piety into this body which men of business are getting in readiness . There are foundations of far greater importance to be laid , than these visible outward structures ; - foundations underlying all that is physical , and giving to all permanence and value . This widely extended country must have truth , justice , temperance , and a reverential fear of God , as the basis of its institutions , and as pervading elements of society . Without soniething of these , even the granite pillar and the marble column must ultimately fail to support the proudest works of art , and the richest monuments of industry . Man , whose body was originally taken from the earth , is now stationed upon its surface , and as a medium between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conduct has also been the medium through which the earth has received her blessings and her curses from God . Cursed is the ground for thy sake , and so it has ever been . Human character ad conduct have given to countries of renown , the elements of their fame . It is these also which have consigned many cities of the old world to infamy . Man constitutes the chief importance of every city ; and the foundations of all things else pertaining to it , will and must be laid , according to the permanent character of its inhabitants . This cardinal truth speaks as with trumpet tongue to all who are interested in what the future West shall be . iRome is not iRome forever , simply because built on seven beautiful hills , and under mild and tranquil skies , but , because it is the city of the C*sars , and the senate , with her orators and statesmen , whose burning eloquence and sage counsels , though not vitalized by the soul of the Gospel , will yet live , so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem is not the praise of the whole earth , because Mount Zion had peculiar geological features . But the temple of Jehovah was there , as the costly type of a better dispensation , to be ushered in with better promises . It was the temple with its nation of worshipers , at her altars , in fulfillment of a divinely appointed economy , whose closing scenes were the advent of the gospel kingdom . So , too , this Garden city , with all other cities of the West now in embryo , will exist in future generations , according to the character which her living citizens will stamp upon her ; and those will have the largest share in any good results , who now directly or indirectly , do the most at the foundations , and do it well . The first generation of a town or city has ordinarily done more to give it tone and direction , than many succeeding . These small beginnings contain the future expansion ; the nudeveloped // character of many thousands , is , as it were , condensed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stage , every movement is pregnant with momentous issues . Hence , the builder at the foundations of society should especially labor to e8tal3li8h correct princple8 . We know that the multitude who think to build at this stage , do often take agitation and action as the first requisites of success ; and truly , without some measure of these in the unformed state of society , there could be but little progress . And yet , the tongue of history and the voice of inspiration everywhere affirm , that calm reflection and patient investigation , in search of sound principles and their proper application , is the only safe course ; because , as men and communities think in their hearts , so are they in their lives . Principles make men , everywhere ; and their formative influence upon society , so far as exerted , will tend to make all outward things accord to this inward pattern . When God himself is about to effect a radical change in the conduct of men , he uniformly commences by a change in their principles and motives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue so , the subsequent growth of character will not widely vary . That excentric backwoodsman of Tennessee , who once said on the floor of Congress , " Be sure you are right , and then go ahead , " though rude in speech , yet possessed some of the elements essential to make the wilderness bud and blossom as the rose . He advanced a fundamental idea , without which no man and no body of men can be safely trusted to lay the foundations of society . We must plant sound principles first ; upon this we may manfully build what neither time nor revolution can bear away . Indeed , that untutored orator of the western wilds did but echo another voice , which is higher than human , and has said , that the wise man dug deep and laid his foundation on a rock ; whose counterpart is the man , that , without foundation , built his house upon the sand . It is easier to commence upon the sand , and the builder can make more show with smaller effort ; but confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Verily , it will fall when the storm beats upon it . The basis of a great city or state must have justice , truth , temperance , and a reverential fear of God , or the top stones can never be laid with any hope of fitness or permanence . The facts of history , both past and in progress , are abundant in proof of this position . Kingdoms and tlmrones have often crumbled , not so much because they were baseless , as , because the foundation was not of the right material . Constantine was a zealous builder in Christendom . He converted cities and countries not a few ; // until beneath his sway the nominal professors of the faith were many . But these nominal forms soon disappeared and left the professors as those whom the blight of God hath scathed , because the converted multitude had yielded to the fear of the sword , and not to the life-giving power of the gospel . The present Constantinople , strong as she may now be , though she may this time escape , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all nations , and she must fall ; not because she lacks religious devotion ; not because her martial spirit is ebbing in the national body politic . She must fall , because the Moslem , professedly as God 's vicegerent , yet in the genuiue spirit of Antichrist , cut his way from his desert home through human sinews , He crossed the Hellespont , sword in hand , and planted his foot on the Western World , professing to honor God , yet serving diverse lusts and passions . As sure as prophecy is true , he shall retire less proudly than he came , and history shall record of his capitol ,  --  " It was , but is not , and never shalt be more under his control . " Paris , as the concentration of France , has fleets and armies , and science and arts in the greatest perfection , but she has rejected Jehovah and adopted the goddess of pleasure ; she has ordained the Sabbath a holiday , she has converted the church into a theatre , and substituted the stage for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , show that her foundation standeth not sure . Her fundametal principles are false , and , unless she reform her practice , will work her ruin . And these sister States of the American Republic , affiliated by one tie and linked to the same destiny , though the last and noblest*born of freedom , have yet the plague-spot of oppression on their corner-stones . It has not been wiped away , and now it is widening and deepening . Let the favored sons of freedom vaunt themselves in our halls of legislation ; let them abuse and prostitute a generous sufferage , by hurling defiance at Jehovah and sneering at his ministers , while they go on proudly to extend the domain of slavery . Will offended Omnipotence keep anger forever ? Well may we trenible for our country , when we remember that God is just . Another element which is to lie at the foundation of many generations , is a comprehensive practical taste , which is developed in the free exercise of a strong common sense , directing in the proper adjustment and right use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not good , especially when its excess excludes other things equally good and iiiore useful in their proper proportion.We notice some workmen at the foundation of society , who do not wisely proportion their materials . // They employ , too exclusively , one or two elements , which , indeed , are admirable in composition with others of equal importance , yet when alone , are unadhesive and weak . If a few of the virtues are cultivated to the almost entire neglect of others equally important , though not as prominent , the foundation will not be fitly framed together ; it will be loosejointed and destitute of the cementing elements , and liable to fall apart easily . We notice some foundations in process of construction that appear admirably fitted to rear lone shafts and columns , or for carrying up a single corner , which would be splendid if accompanied with other proportionate parts of an entire edifice ; but taken alone , they have a deformed and even threatening aspect . Such is emphatically the result when temperance , or the cultivation of the social element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dwelt upon and inculcated as substantially containing the whole law of God , and embracing the whole duty of man . No one of those isolated ideas can constitute the broad and symmetrical foundation for many generations . As well might we place one or two stones under one corner of an edifice , and then endeavor to build upon it in fair proportions and many stories high . Even one generation built upon such a foundation will topple and reel under the instability of its own position . Such a base is too narrow for even one generation , much less can it be the foun-. dation of many generations . Again , good habits are excellent material at the foundation of society . Cities and communities have habits as well as individuals . Indeed they will and must have them . Habit ordinarily results from the repeated use of a principle ; but the best intentions may be neutralized by an imperfect practice , until wrong habit is confirmed , even where right intentions exist ; and when this is done , bad habit reacts upon a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes in the Divine commandment , may carelessly observe the Sabbath-day , with gradually increased violations , until a confirmed habit of desecration will obliterate the principle . Thus they who commence by slighting a duty , end in denying a truth . The principles of the temperance man may inhere so loosely , that his waning practice may , at length , confirm him in a habit of indulgence , and consign him to hopeless inebriation . In a forming state of society , there is ever a strong tendency to depart from general principles , for the sake of a present convenience ; but frequent departures of this kind are the little foxes which destroy the choice vines of habit , and prevent // the promised fruit of ripe excellence . The good habits of a community are its body-guard ; and are no less important to corporate bodies than to individuals . They are strong defenses against the inroads of tern p tation , and also against the outbursts of passion and impulse . he often , as it were , constitute the balance-wheels of character , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainspring of principle alone would be hardly sufficient . As good Richard Cecil has quaintly suggested , it is not enough that men and communities make up their minds to do right , they must also make up their bodies to carry into practice the right convictions of the understand ing ; and all builders at the foundations , whether in the family , the Church , or the State , must untiringly strive for the formation of good habits , as only second to the possession of correct principle . Confirmed habit in right doing , constitutes a kind of omnipresent , inspiring genius , and secures . a perpetuity to correct moral action ; while a community without established habits of virtue , is worse than " a city that is beaten down and without walls ; " because it is fully open to the attacks of outward temptation , and does not exert the moral ability which is reqnisite to create a defense . Just here is a grand , and often ruinous failure , when corporate bodies and mass meetings pass strong resolutions , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wodd is , indeed , full of paper morality ; and yet the currency is of little value , because the corporations which issue it , so seldom redeem it with real coin . These three things , sound principle properly adjusted in practice by a strong and comprehensive common sense , and permanently incorporated byftxed hali*its , constitute the substantial basis for a healthful tone of morals , and an elastic vigor in a community . When destitute of these , in their suitable proportions and requisite strength , the social body , as it grows up , will , to carry out the figure , be feeble , sickly , and deformed , or wild , erratic , and monstrous . Where sound principles , good common sense , and correct habits exist , there only needs the higher life of true religion breathed into the soul , and that community has foundations that will sustain a superstructure of generations , not only compact together , but adorned with goodly stones , many of which shall be polished after the similitude of a palace . The elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid in the family . They should enter into the very germs of being . They must be patiently inculcated in the nursery , shaping the tender twig , so as to give a right direction to the 57 // future tree . They must be impressed in the school with line upon line and effort succeeded by effort , in toilsome though certain progress , till they shall have shaped the growing pur* pose , till they shall have modified the forming temper , and directed the will of developing manhood . These fundamental requisites should mature and ripen in the Church , so that this divine institution , baptized with the Holy Ghost , shall rear up its strong men for action , its stable men for firmness , its wise men for counsel ; real men , God 's noblemen , to do right manfully the work of the Church and the State . From such beginnings , perseveringly carried on , will arise Christian merchants , who will possess all the elasticity and ardor which are essential to successful enterprise , connected with the safety of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diligent in business than others , and yet not bow down to the God of this world . There will arise Christian mechanics and artists , who will exhibit a deeper skill and show a better taste than others , for virtue and piety invigorate the human powers , by relieving them from their enfeebling influences . At the same time these will be themselves the firm pillars of society ; the substantial support of all good institutions . From such beginnings there will arise Christian statesmen , to whom all will not be fair in politics , and with whom a party will not be more . precious than a principle . These men , while they act in the fear of God , and for the good of their fellows , will not barter liberty for fame , nor blaspheme God to secure a reputation among men ; but will write holiness to the Lord upon the common pursuits of life , and use themselves as faithful stewards of the ability which God has given them . This building at the foundation is re8yon8ible work ; because every future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less affected by it . Generations yet unborn will arise to bless or curse the present generation of founders , according as they shall do their work well or badly . He who toils at these efforts is at work for all time on the grandest scale . Thus situated , everything present is related to the future . Every decision of the will , every expression of sentiment , and every civil *act , is a live seed cast into the quickning soil , whose forthcoming fruit a multitude must taste , and find health to body and soul , or poison and death . Work at the foundation is difficult for many reasons ; and no progress can be made in it , without self-denying effort , and persevering toil . Building up is often not the first work to be done . When God commissioned the prophet to this very kind of labor , the first part of this commuission was , to root out and // to pull down , to destroy and to throw down ; a truly concise presentation of the preparatory work of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cleared away ; how many opposing entrenchments to dislodge , before the workmen can take the first step at planting and building ! There is a vast amount of effort and expenditure , that never shows above ground ; to the superficial observer it is all out of sight . The multitude will not look upon it with any appreciation . Hence in the social fabric , this fundamental labor must ever be done by a few ; and if these few , while at their work , escape the taunting criticism of the many , it is all they can anticipate , until , as it were , they get above grourbd , where their work will show to advantage , and be appreciated by all . The many can only be allured and enlisted , by that which appeals to the senses , and promises an immediate remuneration . Nothing is more void of interest , nothing appears more unprofitable , than a foundation when considered apart from its relations to a superstructure , as yet future ; and no marvel , if those who have not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they commence . If there were to be nothing beyond , who would not refuse to enter the list of builders at this stage ? From its very nature the work is one which will be neglected by the mass of the people . Hence it is a work*which will never be remunerated , according to its intrinsic importance . The majority will only work freely upon that which will bring an immediate and satisfactory return , either in pleasure or profit . But he who toils in carefully laying the cornerstones of society , must look to the future for his pay-day . Ordinarily , he must be willing to have his fellow-laborers few in number , while he looks to a higher sphere than human for remuneration . The generations to come will rise up and call him blessed ; but not often will any praise , till he has passed from the scene of toil . When he is weary , and thinks of rest , he must often 109k to the heavenly mansions in his Father 's house , as the nearest place where he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Well done , good and faithful servant , enter thou into the joy of thy Lord . " It is true that the eye of faith can see things yet invisible , as realities , and live by them . Hence the founder who goes to his work understandingly will not be discoura*ed , under the prospect of waiting . That future hope will be his blessing now ; and he will persevere with fortitude and cheerfulness , often faint , yet ever pursuing . Well may the fellow-laborers of such a work , though few and toilworn , animated by the same ennobling prospects , sing and shout to each other . While the good work goes on // under the direction of the Great Master-builder , the good they will do will be a true luxury ; and they will be superior to the circumstances which surround them . They will halve their sorrows by mutual relief : , and double their joys by sharing each other 's . Thus , the ambassadors of Christ , if they would do the most good , must be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how loudly the high pressure reformers vociferate that the West needs only practical preaching , since no preaching ever can be practical which has not a substantial foundation . Duties grow from living doctrines , as directly and naturally as the trunk and branches , and leaves and fruit , grow from the root which bears them . No duty will be long performed in a community , or live in a church , after its doctrinal basis is overthrown . Ministers who would make places , must especially care for the stranger who is far from the sanctuary of his fathers and is ready to appreciate a friend who will sincerely care for him , and bind up his bleeding heart in seasons of trial , while the multitude pass by on the other side . The class of men requisite for this work need some fitness corresponding to the kind of employment given them . linpulsive temperaments can not be safely trusted here . The result of their spasmodic toil will exhibit too many showy beginnings with evanescent endings . Men who think more of promotion than of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better enlist where there is fairer prospect of immediate pay in their own coin . All who are mainly encouraged or depressed in proportion to the show they can make with hasty efforts , must work on other departments than at the foundation , since there , they must toil incessantly and often long , and have little to exhibit as the fruit of their effort . All , however , who are willing to rely on the Great Master-builder , and be satisfied with the encouragement he shall give , all who are guided by sound principle , rather than by caprice , and derive more satisfaction in the faithful discharge of duty , than in the reception of fimlsome applause , may confidently anticipate some good measure of success . Men should remember that faith must work before it can realize . Those will best succeed who are not looking for a place , but designing to make one ; who intend to persevere till they have secured for it such a degree of completeness , that the people will appreciate the workmanship under which they have been moulded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hope of doing something to rear some such men on the field where the work is to be performed , has stimulated the movers of a Theological Seminary in the Northwest . // It is anxiously asked who will go for us , and whom shall we send into this great field ? and echo answers , whom ? The West can not rely upon the East for men who will come a thousand miles when they can hear of a good place vacant , and yet , who if the place is filled before they reach it , will speedily retrace their steps , believing there is nothing for them to do whither they went . There must be in the Western ministry a greater resemblance to apostolic simplicity and earnestness and selfdenial ; else as it would seem , nothing but a miracle can do the work which is rapidly accumulating there . Some spiritual die would seem to be needed , which , under the pressure of the iloly Spirit 's influence , will furnish men more nearly of the right stamp ; such living and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be not only epistles read and known , but effective agents who are willing to suffer the loss of all the luxuries and elegances , and many of the comforts of life , that they may win Christ , and secure for him a peculiar people , where now he is scarcely known . Churches , as workshops for the Great Master-builder , well supplied with workmen who need not be ashamed , are absolutely essential to the progress of the foundations for many generations . These facilities to the spread of vital godliness in this vast land , are its chief promise even for the life that now is . They are needed to impart value even to temporal substance . True piety gives value to real estate . By nature men are religious beings ; and their practice will ever develop some kind of religion . Atheism was never a native product of the human mind . An atheist was never born ; and yet , no religion except true godliness is permanently profitable . No other is fitted fully to develop and harmonize the susceptibilities of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working happiness for society . All other religions introduce derangement , and perpetuate discord . Infidelity is usually embraced as a hopeful refuge from the discomforts which a spurious religion works on the heart . True piety , therefore , enriches everything which is used under its influence ; and , as there is much land yet to be possessed through these vast States and territories , the Christian family , the common school and the evangelical church , are greatly needed to stamp the ore with the image of Christ and the superscription of a pure Christianity . Tenements , house lots , and farms , are worth vastly more in portions of a city or country , which are pervaded by a healthful religions influence . Every rational parent knows that his dependent children have a higher nature to feed and nourish , than merely the animal ; and if any do not know // this , they are truly in need of an influence which will impress them with the fact , so that when they buy a home for their dear ones , they may duly consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pure morality of a place allures a better class of citizens , and in this way reacts to increase still more the value of property . This better class of citizens improves still the state of society , and hence the upward progress is continually accelerated . When this view is taken of territory , as the grand arena of probation , with reference to the life to come , piety appears in its highest value as enriching it . When vital godliness enters directly into the foundation which is laid for the time to come , and duly exerts its formative influence on general character , it does in no small degree convert men of industry and secular enterprise into valuable auxiliaries for securing permanent treasure , where moth and rust doth not corrupt . It is when the responsible agent honors the Lord with his substance , and devotes the fruits of his increase to the spread of the gospel , that wealth appears on its grandest scale of profit . When by its consecrated use , it seems to join this life directly with the life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continuous one , it is no longer " filthy lucre , " but the precious gift of God , used to magnify the goodness of the giver . Territory under the prevailing influence of impiety , bears no comparison in value , with territory hallowed with piety and maturing the peaceable fruits of righteousness ; for the revenue of each to the grand Proprietor must determine their relative value . The piety of a community , while it works and imparts the richest value to all things temporay , at the same time builds across the river of death and secures a treasure-house on high , while the impious man can carry nothing over but sin , and the influence of this he would gladly leave behind . When the godly man leaves the world , he is going directly to his chief possessions , never more to be separated from what he holds most dear ; while the impious man leaves behind all that he has labored for , and all that he loves ; and no power in the universe will ever again put him in possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piety will never be destroyed . The material forms and conventional fabrics will be dissolved and pass away . But these are only temporary , leading to that more substantial goodness and excellence , which , - when once established , rest on the power of God himself ; and defy all change . No finite ability constitutes the value of acres and states peopled with human beings who are animated by such a spirit . With this view , let any one contemplate the // almost boundless territory , now little better than a moral wilderness , which is yet to be enriched or impoverished by the moral character and influence of those who shall possess them , and the heart gushes with unutterable desire , that this raw material for future republics may speedily be secured to the kingdom of Christ . Surely all those whom Providence has appointed to lay the foundations of many generations , can not but expend their utmost energies to take possession of the land and consecrate it to Christ and the church . With such a work in prospect , any hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering the field and promising an increased number of laborers , is cherished with an intensity which no other could impart . Over all these vast plains where population is spreading almost with the rapidity of the morning light , there need be speedily erected churches as moral light-houses to concentrate and then diffuse the influence of the Sabbath day , and to shed on the people the sweet and transforming power of the gospel . These , on the wastes of habitable space must be set up before the character of the people is formed into a fixed provincial infidelity , else our most sanguine hopes must perish in disappointment , is no enough that we have in our cities and large towns , many strong holds and fortified places for Zion . The value of these , indeed , can scarcely be overrated ; and the best doctor of divinity in the best of them , is none too good to occupy the most inconsiderable of these high places . But while the church ought to do these things , there are other things of far greater importance which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its spirit and object , is diffusive ; and its professors should be eminently such in their efforts to do the will of their Master . The high priest at Jerusalem said , " Uome up all ye tribes round about , and worship on this Zion . But Christ , taking the same platform in his last command , said , " Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature . " Both were adapted to their respective disp ensations . The last command , however , is the one which reaches to our day , and the mission is not fulfilled in a City or State until the gospel is spread through all the ramifications of society . The tendency to centralization in civil affairs , is justly regarded as one of the dangerous elements of the State . But centralization in matters of religion is still more dangerous . History is filled with the monuments of its folly , and tbe dearth it has ever brought upon the spirit of piety is too deep to be forgotten . Where a central organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremities must remain lean and im // poverished ; and this is a morbid state of any system . Again , when we consider the cardinal fact , that the rich and the poor , and , to a great extent , the city and the country , extensively change places every second or third generation , the children of the wealthy degenerating , because not obliged to develop themselves by personal effort , and the children of the poorer classes rising in the opposite scale , because necessity is the natural parent of enterprise ; how important that all should be born under gospel influences and grow up under its power so that when the revolutions of Providence shall bring the obscnre up into notice and give them the reins of influence , they may have the spirit of the gospel p ervadirig their hearts and regulating their conduct . I%der a govermnent like ours , where the rulers and chief men come from every department of society , there is no safety but in educating and evangelizing all the people . The maturity of such a work must arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-denial on the part of the laborers must enter largely into the enterprise .

Such delay amounts to waiting for destitution to supply abundance . Feebleness is the law of natural birth , and the spiritual follows this natural order , with hardly any exceptions . Hence , the initial work of a good minister at the West , is , emphatically , not to find a good place , but to make one ; and unless the field can be supplied in some good measure , with laborers who will be content to lay foundations with scanty materials , and not seek to build upon the broad foundations which other men have laid , large portions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school of the prophets , " therefore , which will qualify men in larger numbers to enter such a field , and labor to supply its existing wants , will be recognized as a bright star of hope , worthy the announcement of heralds from the skies : for it would be the harbinger of glad tidings of great joy to many people .
