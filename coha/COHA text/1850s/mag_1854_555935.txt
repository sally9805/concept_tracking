txt ART . IX . - The Positive Philosophy of AUGUSTE COMTE , freely translated and condensed by HARRIET MARTINEAU . London : John Chapman . 1853. 2 vols. l2mo . WE are sorry , but not surprised , that Miss Martineau should have adopted the opinions which are avowed in the recent publication of her correspondence with Mr. Atkinson , and in this attempt to translate Comte 's Philosophy and to render it popular in England . Her former writings showed considerable ability , but it was the ability of an ill-regulated mind , of a mind working out of its proper sphere , and scorning all those limitations and restraints which indirectly help us in the search after truth , because they narrow the field of inquiry , and act as preservatives against the most hurtfnl errors . In her ambition to leave the common track , she has wandered wildly over the whole field of knowledge , and come to the most barren conclusion at last , - to a belief if it can be called such , that there is no divine superintendence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world to come . The leading vice of her character has always been intellectual arrogance . She has never had any deference for man , and now has ceased to entertain any faith in her Creator ; the only being whom she has never learned to distrust is herself . The very outset of her career as an author was an unfortunate one for the // growth and discipline of her mental character , however flattering it was to her vanity . Under the special patronage of Lord Brougham , then flushed with exaggerated hopes of the results to be accomplished by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge , and proud of the abilities of his " little deaf girl , " she undertook to teach the people of Great Britain the abstruse doctrines of Political Economy , mincing up this strong meat into popular tales , so that it might be fitted for the nutriment of babes . Considered simply as stories , her " Illustrations " were very successful ; people were amused by them , and paid no heed to the grave lessons which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat them like children , they took their revenge by acting like children ; they ate the sugar and threw the medicine away . Luckily for them , it was easy to separate the two ingredients , as nearly all the science was condensed into a page or two at the end of the book , and the little that was fairly incorporated into the story did them no harm . What was considered as the most pleasing of her stories , when taken simply as an ingenious fiction in prose , was meant to illustrate and enforce the revolting doctrine of Malthus about population . We hold that it is an impertinence to write fiction for any avowedly didactic purpose , beyond that of inculcating some simple moral , such as the events of real life often teach . In Miss Martineau ' s attempt , impertinence and pedantry were combined . Her subsequent publications are characterized by the same spirit of arrogant self-conceit , and the same disposition to meddle with subjects which are out of her sphere , and which she is entirely incompetent to discuss . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her weakness in this respect . " That degree of * she observes , " which is commonly called conceit , grows in favor with me perpetually . " Perhaps so ; but as her first publication betrayed an almost incredible amount of this amiable feeling , we hardly see how it could " grow perpetually , " without overshadowing by this time her whole mind and character . Her " View of Society in America " is equally a view of our government , our literature , our ecclesiastical institutions , the course of our legislation , and the character of our people . On // all these themes , she favors us with sweeping opinions , delivered in as dogmatic and magisterial a manner , as if the whole Western continent had been summoned before her for a hearing . " The Senate " of the United States , she remarks , " is an anomaly , and an anomalous institution can not be very longlived . " She will not admit that what appears to her as faulty in theory can possibly succeed in practice . Vainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The well-working , " she replies , is only a temporary affair , - an accident . " Its radical change becomes a question of time merely . " The successful experience of sixty-five years , during which time the institution has certainly increased in favor with the people , while the people themselves have more than quadrupled in number , evidently weighs nothing against Miss Martineau 's judgment of what is fitting and proper . The Senate is still doomed , and the judiciary are little better off . " The appointment of the judges for life , " she remarks in the next paragraph , " is another departure from the absolute republican principle . " So it is ; and for this very reason , those who do not like absolutism in matters of government , whether in the form of absolute monarchy , absolute democracy , or absolute anarchy , are strongly attached to the independence of the judiciary . Considering the ease and freedom with which Miss Martineau propounds her opinions upon these very grave subjects , it is much to be regretted that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution of Massachusetts . She would have been quite at home in that body ; and nothing in her speeches would have reminded her auditors of her sex . Certainly there is nothing feminine in her books ; never was sex more completely discharged from style . She writes like a political economist , like a veteran statesman , like a philosopher , - like anything but a woman . Not an allusion , not an idiom , not a trace of delicacy or faint-heartedness , not even a gleam of fancy or affectionateness , betrays the counterfeit . She borrows Rosalind 's language , but acts out her part far better than Rosalind did . Were it not better That I did suit me all points like a man A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh , // A boar-spear in my hand ; and ( in my heart Lie there what hidden woman 's fear there will ) We Ii have a swashing and a martial outside . " We have no quarrel with Miss Martineau , and no disposition to be very severe upon her errors and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment . But now that she has assumed to dogmatize upon subjects of the dearest interest to mankind , now that she has begun the career of an avowed free-thinker , and undertaken to teach the world philosophy and infidelity , it becomes a matter of some moment to ascertain what her opinions on these and other subjects are worth , and under what influence she has formed them . Argument can have no effect upon a mind like hers , for she has never been accustomed to reason , but only to pronounce judgment . Her opinion as to the truth of the Christian religion rests on about as much evidence , even in her own mind , as the assertion coolly made by her , seventeen years ago , after she had had an opportunity to become acquainted with perhaps one American clergyman out of a thousand , and to converse familiarly with probably half a dozen of them , that " the American clergy are the most backward and timid class in the society in which they live , the least informed with true knowledge , the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in her own opinion inspired , how was she enabled to speak thus confidently of the characters , and the results of the labors , of a very numerous class of men , scattered all over the United States , of whose very names , with perhaps a dozen exceptions , she was entirely ignorant ? We are tempted to retract what we have just said about her success in suppressing all moral and intellectual tokens of her sex . She does betray a slight feminine weakness ,  --  one that would be expected , however , only from women of inferior cultivation , - in using very strong language without any apparent consciousness of its strength of meaning , and in an unhesitating expression of very hasty judgments . Miss Martineau ' s correspondence with Mr. Atkinson is chiefly curious as an illustration of the old remark , thatthe provinces of infidelity and excessive credulity are separated only by a thin partition . " Unbelievers , " says Pascal , " are // the most credulous persons in the world ; they believe the miracles of Vespasian , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his fair correspondent go one step farther ; they accept the marvellous reports of mesmerism and clairvoyance as a reason for discrediting both the life and the doctrines of our Saviour . Such persons are properly incompetent to enter a jury-box ; for they are incapable of weighing the force of testimony . Their estimate of what is marvellous and incredible is not objective , but subjective ; what is new to themthat is , what has been recently reported , though it may not be very marvellous in itself- excites their wonder to a far greater degree than that which is intrinsically much more mysterious , but which they have so often heard of and talked about that it has ceased to surprise or interest them . The best illustration of this state of mind is the story told of the good old lady , who , when her sailor son was reporting to her the marvels he had seen , flatly refused to believe his story about the flyingfish , but saw nothing incredible in his statement that , when his ship was in the Red Sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had drawn up also one of Pharaoh 's chariot-wheels . This worthy matron , indeed , not having a turn for philosophizing , followed the natural principle of belief , by regarding what seemed to her most wonderful as least deserving of credit . But Miss Martineau , wise as an owl , inverts the laws of credibility ; it is precisely because the silly fables of mesmerism appear to her more strange and unaccountable than the miracles recorded in Scripture , that she is bent upon believing the former and rejecting the latter . Properly speaking , then , she is the credulous person , while the sailor 's mother was comparatively slow of belief . The relative weight of testimony in the two cases - the only ground of rational judgment - is just what neither of the two women was capable of estimating . The blunders of pedantry are often more amusingly absurd than those of simple ignorance . The Preface to this translation of Comte 's Philosophy is written in the defiant and contemptuous tone which appears so often and repulsively in the author 's former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work will be painful and shocking to many who are incapable of estimating // its scientific merits . But she has no milder terms with which to characterize their feelings than " hate , " " intolerance , " " theological selfishness or metaphysical pride . " One of the parties in the case certainly manifests intolerance , but Miss Martineau is perfectly unconscious that it might be charged upon herself , though she knows that the principles of Comte may be accused of " irreverence , lack of aspiration , hardness , deficiency of grace and beauty , and so on . " No matter for such charges , or for the feelings of the persons who make them ; " they are no judges of the case . " None are judges but " those who have passed through theology and metaphysics , and , finding what they are now worth , have risen above them , " - in which happy class Miss Martineau places herself . She could not have defined more clearly the requisites for becoming a disciple of the " Positive Philosophy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is capable of appreciating its claims . This is what the writer of the Preface has accomplished ; she has got beyond all religious faith by first divesting herself of all womanly feeling . It is precisely because she is an " unsexed thing , " that she has learned how to " scorn her God . " But we gladly pass from the translator to a very brief consideration of the claims of the work which she has translated . The general scope of the " Positive Philosophy " is clearly enough indicated in the remark which Sir William Hamilton recently quoted from its author , M. Comte . " To those unfamiliar with a study of the celestial bodies , astronomy has still the character of being a science preeminently religious ; as if the famous text , The heavens declare the glory of God , ' retained its old significance . But to minds familiar with true philosophical astronomy , the heavens declare no other glory than that of Hipparchus , Kepler , Newton , - in a word , of all those who have aided in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculations , and habituated to disregard all those aspects and phenomena of nature which do not admit of being reduced to numerical expressions and algebraic formulas , this remark may seem plausible . If nothing is real but what can be counted , or measured by a foot-rule , - and nothing else can be a subject of mathematical // investigation , - then there is nothing more marvellous in the revolutions of the heavenly bodies than in the regular movements of the hands over the dial-plate of a clock . Nay , the heavens themselves are but a gigantic clock , the only use of which is to tell the mariner his longitude , or the astronomer the exact time of day . But as a rational curiosity is not satisfied with merely learning the hour from a time-piece , or with the ability to predict , though with unerring precision and nicety , the exact position of the hour , minute , and second hands , after any interval of time , - as man insists upon knowing also how the hands are made to move , and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere calculation can teach appears unprofitable and insufficient . Even the child is not satisfied with seeing that his little mechanical toy works well and regularly , - that it nods , or cries , or lifts its arms or its feet just as he draws the cord or presses the spring ; he insists on pulling it to pieces , that he may find out how it moves , or why pressure causes it to sound . So , also , to the enlightened and comprehensive mind , the heavens still appear enveloped with wonder and mystery ; and mere mathematical calculators , like Lalande and Laplace , have not succeeded in raising even a corner of the veil . " The infinite spirit , " says Fries , " does not limit itself under proportion and number . The play with number is an easy play ; its joy is only the joy of the imprisoned spirit at the clank of its fetters . " In this brief illustration , we catch a glimpse of the whole scope and tendency of the " Positive Philosophy , " and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavored to extend the principles and the limitations of mere physical science over the whole field of human knowledge , and thus to pluck up metaphysics and theology by the roots . Starting from the acknowledged fact , that , in the material universe , we are never able to detect the nexus of cause and effect , but are properly confined to the observation and generalization of phenomena , he attempts to get rid of the doctrine of efficient and final causes altogether , and thus to reduce mind to matter , life to organization , freedom to necessity , and to construct a soulless and godless universe . Strictly speaking , then , the system is not a " philosophy " of any sort , but // an attempt to destroy and eradicate philosophy altogether . It is not new even to the British public , as Miss Martineau seems to imagine . About ten years ago , one of the ablest thinkers of the day , Mr. John Stuart Mill , took it up and expounded it with great clearness and precision , in his System of Logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scheme of Inductive Logic , and an application of such logic to social science , or to an investigation of the laws which determine the condition and the progress of society . In this form , indeed , it did not atfract extensive notice , because it constituted but one department of Mr. Mill 's great work , and the ability with which the other portions were executed , together with their unexceptionable character , caused most persons to overlook this needless and offensive adjunct . As thus expounded , however , it was rendered far less repulsive and objectionable in appearance than when first promulgated . Mr. Mill respected the feelings or the prejudices , - call them what you will , - which he felt constrained to wound . He did not follow out the system to its remotest logical consequences , and while endeavoring to palliate or cover up some of the conclusions from it which would shock the public , he probably succeeded in concealing them even from himself . M. Comte and his present translator are far from sharing either his scruples or his delicacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral character , as well as from coincidence of opinion , that Miss Martineau felt attracted towards the author of the Positive Philosophy , and impelled to become the expositor of his doctrines to the English public . For dogmatism and conceit , M. Comte is unrivalled by any philosophical writer we have ever read , with perhaps the single exception of Hobbes . We extract a few sentences from Miss Martineau ' s translation , to justify this remark : - " If a comparison were fairly established between the first and last terms of the scale of sciences , I will venture to say , that sociological science , though only established by this book , already rivals mathematical science itself , not in precision and fecundity , but in positivity and rationality . " - Vol . II . p. 516 . " This last effort alone , therefore , is thoroughly effectual in destroying the absolute philosophy ; and if it were possible that I could be mistaken // as to the true law of human development , the only inference would be that we must find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted the only method that could lead to positive knowledge of the human mind , regarded henceforth in the whole of its necessary conditions . " - p. 518 . " By the review of the former social states of mankind , and the sketch of the future organization of society which I have now completed , I trust I have fully redeemed my promises , as offered both at the beginning of this work , and at the outset of the sociological portion . At a time when moral and political convictions are fluctuating for want of a sufficient intellectual basis , I have laid the logical foundation of firm convictions , able to withstand discordant passions , public and private . At a time when practical considerations are excessively preponderant , I have restored the dignity of philosophy , and established the social reality of sound theoretical speculations , by instituting a systematic subordination of the one to the other , such as is essential to social stability and greatness . At a time when human reason is liable to be frittered away under an empirical system of dispersive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reign of the spirit of generality , under which alone a universal sentiment of duty can prevail . These three objects have been attained by the institution of a new science , the last and most important of all , which is as positive and logical as any of the other sciences I have treated of , and without which the system of true philosophy can have neither unity nor substance . The future progress of sociology can never offer so many difficulties as this original formation of it ; for it furnishes both the method by which the details of the past may serve as indications of the future , and the general conclusions which afford universal guidance in special researches . This scientific foundation completes the elementary system of natural philosophy prepared by Aristotle , announced by the scholastics of the Middle Ages , and directly proposed , in regard to its general spirit , by Bacon and Descartes. " - pp. 495 , 496 . One is naturally curious to know something of the life and character of the man who has contrived to rid himself so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he calls a " personal preface , " prefixed to the sixth and last volume of the original work , and occupied chiefly with some very bitter remarks upon the conduct of MM . Arago , Poisson , and other eminent French savans , whom he accuses of jealousy and of intrigue to obstruct his professional advancement , // M. Comte gives some curious details concerning himself . Born in 1798 , in the South of France , of a family strongly attached to Romanist and monarchical opinions , he was educated at one of those lyceums established by Napoleon , for the vain purpose , as Comte affirms , of attempting , at great expense , to restore the old preponderance of the metaphysico-theological system . Before he had attained his fourteenth year , he had passed through what he terms the necessary cycle of opinions , having first embraced religious dogmas , then abandoned theology for metaphysics , and finally found a resting-place from metaphysical speculations in positive science . This course of necessary preparation for his future career was hastened by the revolutionary fever which then prevailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was enabled to perceive the necessity of a total renovation of political and philosophical systems , or , in other words , of creating a new and universal philosophy for himself and for mankind . As his education was completed at the Polytechnic School , where an early taste for mathematical studies was fully gratified , he found in mathematical science itself at once the starting-point and the leading feature of his new system , - perfectly clear ideas and positive convictions . For a while , the natural development of his own opinions was impeded by his falling under the influence of the celebrated Saint-Simon , whom he characterizes as a very ingenious but superficial writer , of a temperament which was rather active than speculative , and of immense personal ambition . Bnt he soon quitted SaintSimonianism , and quarrelled with its founder , whom he accuses of making envious insinuations against the originality of his own early efforts in political philosophy . He magnanimously undertakes , however , to relieve the memory of this philosopher from some accusations that have been brought against him at the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only been able to observe in him , after the weakness caused by a fatal attack of disease , that vulgar bias towards a vague religious sentiment ( religiosit6 ) , which is so often derived in our day from a secret feeling of the impotence of philosophy , in minds which undertake the regeneration of society without being properly prepared for the task by their own mental renovation. " 18* // The development of Comte 's system , after the outlines of it had been completed in his own mind , was delayed , in 1826 , by an attack of mental disease , from which , if it had been left to take its own course , he thinks he should have speedily recovered . But he was unhappily placed in a private institution for the insane under the charge of the celebrated Esquirol , where the treatment soon reduced him to a state of complete mental alienation . After his case had been pronounced incurable , however , the native vigor of his constitution , aided by affectionate domestic care , got the better both of the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the commencement of the attack , he made good use , as he boasts , of the sad experience he had obtained , by applying it , in a public journal , to a criticism of the celebrated work of Broussais on " irritation and insanity . " With his usual illtemper , he goes on to attribute to the malice of his enemies in the mathemafical circle of savans the report which had been circulated that his disease had never entirely left him ; - and to say the truth , the extraordinary tone of this " personal preface , " not to speak of other portions of the work , lends some plausibility to this rumor . To imagine that the whole scientific world are jealous of the success of a work which with difficulty found a publisher , and which , though the first volume appeared in 1830 , has not yet , we believe , reached the honors of a second edition , and to suppose further , that all the theologians and metaphysicians are leagued with the savans in persecuting its author , is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mental haliucination . We shall not enter into any detail with respect to M. Comte 's personal grievances . He early obtained a very subordinate situation as instructor in the Polytechnic School , and the income of the post not being sufficient even for his modest wants , he was obliged to eke it out by giving private instruction in mathematics , so that very little leisure remained to him for the elaboration of his great philosophical work . The sole burden of his complaints is , that he has failed to obtain promotion , notwithstanding his eminence as a mathematician and a philosopher . In 1836 , he became a competitor for the office of first Professor of Mathematics in the School ; but the // chair was given , through the influence of Arago , to M. Sturm . When Guizot first entered the French ministry , Comte so licited him to establish , for his benefit , a new professorship in the College of France , to teach the history of the positive sciences ; and when the request was not granted , Comte attributed the refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the stoical minister passed over without notice . In spite of all his efforts , therefore , M. Comte remained , down to 1842 , a mere tutor ( r6p6titeur ) and examiner in the Polytechnic School , the higher honors and rewards of science being beyond his grasp . He had probably earned promotion by the mere extent of his mathematical attainments ; for it would be idle to deny that his work contains marked evidence of ability in this respect . But it is not strange that those who had the control of the School should hesitate about giving a principal office in it to one who had manifested so arrogant and quarrelsome a disposition , and whose perfect sanity was still questioned . It is with the tastes and the acquired habits of a mathematician , then , that M. Comte comes to a review of the history , the logic , and the processes of the positive sciences . The bias under which he thus labors might have been detected from internal evidence in the work itself , without any previous knowledge of his circumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind , and the special errors in speculation , which , according to Hamilton and many other high authorities , an exclusive devotion to mathematical pursuits is apt to engender . The mathematician deals solely with a kind of reasoning which does not admit of doubt or degrees , which is infallible , and therefore inapplicable to any of the ordinary concerns of life . Resting solely upon demonstrative evidence , perceiving that his conclusions are absolutely certain , though they may depend upon a chain of reasoning which none but a thorough-bred mathematician is able to foliow , he regards with impatience and contempt the hesitation or total disbelief which may still cling to the minds of the vulgar . Thus he is prone to overweening presumption or incurable arrogance . Carrying his own peculiar logic along with him whenever he qults the territory of the exact sciences , // he commits the enormous blunder of requiring the evidence of intuition or demonstration where only probable testimony can be had , and is thus often led to reject truths which are familiar to common sense and level to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mathematics much , and no other science , " says Lord Monboddo , " are apt to grow so fond of them as to believe that there is no certainty in any other science , and no other axioms than those of Euclid . " They even come to trust the results of mathematical analysis in preference or in opposition to the primitive dictates of their own common sense , or the universal principles of all belief ; and thus humble their own reason before the special instrument or tool which their reason works with . " This is contrary to all experience , " says Euler , " and yet it is true . " They are especially prone to reduce all things to mechanism , because only mechanical results are mathematically calculable . Whatever is contingent or problematical must be eliminated by hypothesis from the premises , before the conclusion can be mathematically deduced . Thus , taking the two branches of an alternative , the algebraist can determine with absolute certainty the results of either , when regarded separately or without reference to the other ; and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deciding between them , unless he will allow the evidence of perception , experience , common sense , or some other non-mathematical criterion of truth , to decide as to the relative value of these results . Busied exclusively with the phenomena of matter and the idea of necessary connection , he banishes mind and free-agency out of the creation , and constructs a mechanical and soulless universe . The very title of Laplace 's great work , the lik*canique C6leste , suggests the reason of his infidelity ; he thought he had reduced the solar system to a vast machine , which is self-perpetuated , and therefore , if no extraneous cause intervened , would run on for ever . We do not mean that these unhappy results of mathematical studies are inevitable , or that minds of a higher order , like Pascal , Nexvton , and Leibnitz , can not rise above them . Unquestionably , the philosophical faculty , or the power of grasping at once both necessary and contingent truth , and of ap // plying to each its appropriate organa of investigation and tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in mathematical calculation . But it can not reasonably be doubted that the general tendency of such pursuits is what we have pointed out , and that mere mathematicians , like Halley , Laplace , and Comte , are incapable of resisting that tendency . No better evidence of the truth of this assertion can be found , than in the principles , the reasoning , and the conclusions of this very work on " Positive Philosophy . " In constructing what he calls " the hierarchy of the scien. * ces , " to take the place of the classifications proposed by Bacon and iD'Alembert , which are founded on the faculties of the mind that are respectively called into play by these sciences , M. Comte gives the first place to mathematics , and makes it " the point of departure of all education , whether general or special . " He regards mathematics " less as a constituent part of natural philosophy , than as having been , since the time of Descartes and Newton , the true basis of the whole of natural philosophy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of knowledge , and what can be measured and calculated is all that man can know . Teach the youthful mind first to measure and calculate , and you have put it upon the way to obtain all attainable truth . This is the doctrine of the " Positive Philosophy " in a nutshell . Next in the hierarchy of the sciences comes astronomy , as the most simple and abstract , and therefore the most general of all , so that it affords the clearest field for the application of mathematical analysis . Physics deals with more complex phenomena , and the laws which govern them are of inferior generality ; these laws are subject to the great law of gravitation , but do not extend to the motions of the heavenly bodies , which are solely under the dominion of the most general law that is known to man . One step lower in the scale is chemistry , which deals with still more complex phenomena and more circumscribed laws , - laws affecting the subjects of all the sciences inferior to itself , but not extending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , physics , and // chemistry , in the order in which they are enumerated , are the three fundamental sciences of the inorganic world . Organized bodies are the subjects of two other sciences , biology and sociology , or the science of life and the science of society . Here the phenomena are exfremely complicated , and the laws which govern th*em are of the lowest degree of generality , - those of sociology , for instance , which is at the bottom of the scale , not being applicable in either of the four antecedent sciences , while the successful study of them must depend upon a knowledge of all the laws established in the four superior branches . Here we have , then , not only a natural order of the sciences , but the order in which they must be successively investigated . " Physical philosophers can not understand physics without at least a general knowledge of asfronomy ; nor chemists , without physics and astronomy ; nor physiologists , without chemistry , physics , and astronomy ; nor , above ali , the students of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anterior sciences . " This classification also points out the relative perfection of the different sciences ; for , as already remarked , mathematical analysis becomes less and less applicable , as we descend in the scale . These five , with mathematics , which stands at their head , are the only possible branches of human knowledge . Metaphysics , or the science of mind , is a delusion ; politics and ethics , except so far as they are deductions from sociology , are mere blunders ; and theology is a dream . All the positive sciences have passed , or are passing , through three successive stages , which also constitute three distinct epochs , both in the history of every individual mind and in that of humanity . In the first , or theological stage , man endeavors to pry into the real essence of things , or to know both their efficient and their final causes ; in other words , he tries to ascertain how they came into being , and why , or for what purpose , they exist . Absolute knowledge is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of supernatural beings . In the second , or metaphysical period , events are referred , not to beings , but to metaphysical entities or abstractions , and what is called an explanation of the phenomena is only a reference of each to its proper head , Thus , // certain appearances are attributed to gravitation , certain others to electricity , and still a third class to chemical affinity ,  - -  under the delusive belief that these names respectively denote distinct , real forces or powers , each of them having its appropriate effects . The most general attribution of this sort is that of substituting one great abstraction , Nature , for the multitude of entities at first supposed . In the third , or positive stage , these names are recognized as denoting nothing more than abstractions , or fictions , as the phenomena which have been attributed to each of them are classed together only on account of their similarity to each other in certain respects , and not because anything is known about the cause from which they all proceed . According to this view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of investigation . When two phenomena are attributed to gravitation , - as for instance the falling of a stone and the revolution of a planet , - it is not because any thing has been ascertained respecting the cause of either of them , but because their motions are found to be similar , or each of them is an instance of the general fact , that any two bodies tend to fall towards each other with a force which is directly as their masses and inversely as the squares of their distances . Generalization of facts , not the ascertainment of causes , is the sole business of science . The regular succession of these three epochs , as has been said , is a point in the history of each science , of each individual mind , and of the whole human race . When man first comes to the study of nature , ignorant of everything and surprised at everything , he refers every change that he witnesses to the agency of some personal cause , - of some being exterior to nature . Gradually enlightened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to the classification of facts , he contrives a system of what may be called secondary causes , or forces in nature , and in the contemplation of these gradually loses sight of the ultimate and primal causes which he had originally imagined . Advancing still farther , he learns that even these causes are fictions , arising from the substitution of a cause where only an effect had been actually perceived . He thus receives a necessary lesson of humility , - to confine his researches // henceforth to the actual phenomena before him , seeking only to observe and classify these according to their most intimate and natural relations , and giving up the vain attempt to inves .. tigate their origin and their purpose . And here , at last , he enters the domain of positive science . A like series*of opinions and events may be seen in the history of the race , - more slowly evolved , indeed , but yet distinctly traceable by the light of the principles now advanced . Society has a life and a principle of growth and development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , all of whom pass away with the generation to which they belong ; the leaves decay and fall at the close of each season , but the parent trunk , with its branches , rises and expands with a continuous growth for many years . We may observe the laws of development in both cases , - in the shortlived leaf and in the time-honored trunk . In the earlier ages of society , religious ideas predominate , as , indeed , men could not be kept in order and subjection without them . Under the doctrine of a superintending Providence , all vicissitudes in the progress and well-being of a particular society are attributed directly to the favor or anger of the gods . But as knowledge advances , not only do men become impatient of this species of tutelage , which is , in truth , an arbitrary rule , a government of mere will or caprice , but they learn to attribute the prosperity or adversity of states to causes within their own control , and thus to strive after progress and self-government . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideas developed in it and those which are peculiar to the theological epoch creates the political and intellectual anarchy which now exists in civilized Europe , and which must continue till sociology is developed into a complete science , and men learn to regulate their conduct simply by observance of the natural laws to which the movements of society , as a whole , are subject . The system of Positive Philosophy , as here explained , is developed and applied by M. Comte , in the six thick octavos of the original work ( here condensed by Miss Martineau into two ) , in a review of the history and characteristics of the sciences , and of the history of the human race , - this last being // the foundation of the new science of Sociology . This review is an able , and , in many points , an instructive one . All those portions of it which are peculiar to M. Comte 's own theory might be entirely omitted , without even injuring the connection of what is left ; and the remainder would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sciences to each other , of the peculiar logic of those sciences , and of the opinions and methods , the prevalence of which , at different times , has retarded or hastened their growth . Leave out all " the Positive Philosophy** so far as it is original with M. Comte , and the work will be a very good one . The leading and fatal error in it , so far as it is a novel scheme , we have already pointed out ; it consists in an attempt to survey the whole field of human knowledge from a mathematical point of view , to determine the relative value and perfectibility of the different sciences by the various degrees in which they admit of mathematical analysis , and to exclude all subjects of investigation which we can not count or measure . The work thus illustrates the broad admission of D'Alembert , himself an 6minent geometer and analyst , that a mathematician is essentially unqualified for metaphysical speculation . M. Comte comes out with a petty measuring-tape , wherewith to ascertain the boundaries of the universe and the limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single standard , or can not be circumscribed by these means , is rejected as no proper object for farther study . Every shallow that can not be sounded by a ten-foot pole is unfathomable ; every problem that can not be reduced to an equation is insoluble . M. Comte even commits the egregious error of estimating the value of a science merely by the precision and certainty of its results , however narrow the range or limited the application of these results . No matter how shallow the brook may be ; so long as he can see clearly through its waters , so as to number and measure every pebble in its bed , it is to him a far more fitting subject of contemplation and study than the broad and deep river , which winds its way majestically through a thousand leagues of country , and opens at last into a boundless sea . Its source may be as undiscoverable as that of the Nile ; its volume of waters defies computation ; and its vast // breadth can not be spanned by any bridge . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " with dignified humility , " and goes to fishing for minnows in a duck-pond . This is satire , and it may appear like extravagant satire ; but we can not otherwise express the magnitude of our author 's blunder . Take his view of astronomy , for instance , which is to him a perfect science , and which he places next to mathematics in the hierarchy of the sciences . " The general laws of astronomical phenomena , " he remarks , " are the basis of all our real knowledge . " The perfection of a science depends on its success in reducing all the phenomena with which it is concerned to a single law ; " and , according to this test , astronomy distances all other sciences . " Not less important is its influence on our intelligence ; for " we have seen how this science must operate in liberating the human intellect for ever from all theological and metaphysical thraldom , by showing that the most general phenomena are subjected to invariable relations , and that the order of the heavens is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glories of his favorite science , M. Comte seems to have entirely overlooked one fact , which might have convinced him of the hollowness of his pretensions . Astronomy is a very finished science only because it is very limited in its objects . It contemplates nothing but forms , motions , and positions . Of the physical constitution of the celestial bodies , even when our view is confined to those in our own solar system , we are profoundly ignorant ; we form a few faint guesses about the nature of the irregularities on the surface of the moon , and there we stop . Of the external and internal economy of the heavenly orbs , of the forms which organized matter there assumes , the modes in which active energy develops itself , and the living races , if any , which tenant them , we are so far from knowing anything that we do not even pretend to study them . Our idea of the mechanism of the heavens falls almost immeasurably short of the truth of things . The astronomer knows so accurately only because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision of his knowledge is only relative . Angular distances and variations may indeed be pre-calculated , and , // through the exquisite nicety of our instruments , may be actually observed , to the fraction of a second ; but owing to the great absolute distance of the bodies calculated or observed , this fraction of a second may correspond to thousands , or even to millions , of miles . Absolute astronomical measurements make no pretensions to great accuracy ; the most important distance of all , that of the earth from the sun , is not certainly known within one or two millions of miles . Notwithstanding the boasted triumphs of science in this department , therefore , the truly philosophical observer , seeing how vastly the subject still transcends the human intellect , instead of imitating the vanity of Laplace and Comte , will say rather , with the Psalmist of old , " When I consider thy heavens , the work of thy fingers ; the moon and the stars , which thou hast ordained ; what is man , that thou art mindful of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? " Contract the sphere of any other science to as narrow limits as those which inclose the objects of astronomy , take only the easiest problems in it , even those which , on account of their obviousness , are usually put aside as unworthy of study , - and physics , chemistry , or even physiology , may be made to rival in precision and certainty our knowledge of the solar system . Comte does not perceive that he is enabled to see clearly only on account of the shallowness of the waters . He recognizes the fact , indeed , that they are shallow ; for he says , " The analysis of the simplest terrestrial phenomena , not only chemical , but even purely mechanical , presents a greater complication than the most compound astronomical phenomenon ; the most difficult astronomical question involves less intricacy than the simple movement of even a solid body , when the determining circumstances are to be computed . " Nature helps us to calculate by simplifying the phenomenon . Friction and a resisting medium are eliminated by the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to consider- the gravitating effect of different bodies on each other - is practically reduced to the problem of only three bodies , - the sun , the nearest planet or satellite , and the body the disturbed motion of which furnishes the problem . Comte recognizes the simplicity , but does not seem // to perceive that this simplicity is the sole cause of the boasted accuracy , or that the conclusion is really as narrow and meagre as the premises are simple . And here , too , we have a striking illustration of the weakness and narrowness of range of M. Comte 's favorite organon of investigation and test of truth , - mathematical analysis . Astronomical science has an eminently mathematical character ; " there is perhaps no analytical process , " says our author , " no geometrical or mechanical doctrine , which is not employed in astronomical researches , and many of them have as yet no other aim . " It is precisely because there is so little to be done , and even so little to be attempted , that mathematical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's measuring-tape answers admirably when he has only very petty and very simple forms to take the dimensions of . Contract the field of inquiry in the other sciences to a span , - leave out all that is complicated and difficult in them , - and lie will be able in them also to measure and calculate to his heart 's content , and with marvellous precision . Our readers must not suspect us of the folly of running a tilt against mathematics , or attempting to disparage the claims of astronomical science . Within their proper sphere , their triumphs are striking and indisputable . Few achievements of the human intellect affect the imagination so strongly as those of Euclid and Hipparchus , of Newton and Leibnitz . It is only when the votaries of these sciences attempt to use them as the groundwork of a shallow and infidel philosophy , that the hollowness of their pretensions for such a purpose may be fairly exposed . When it is asserted that the heavens do not declare the glory of God , but of the mathematicians and astronomers , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of astronomical science , after all , depends far more on the sublimity and perfectness of the objects of study , than on the ability and success with which they have been studied . The xvonder is not so much that man should be able to foresee the return of an eclipse , even to a second of time , as that the arrangement of the vast system of worlds should be so perfect , and their mutual action and dependence so accurately balanced , that the cycle should be perfectly preserved , the two // bodies returning from their vast journeys through the immeasurable depths of space at the precise moment , and to the previously defined point in the heavens . " Through all starry changes , " says Comte , " the translations of our planets present the almost rigorous invariableness of the great axes of their elliptical orbits , and of the duration of their sidereal revolutions ; and their rotation shows a regularity even more perfect , in its duration , in its poles , and even , though in a somewhat smaller degree , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know , for instance , that , from the times of Hipparchus , the length of the day has not varied the hundredth part of a second . Amid all this general regularity , we perceive a special and most marked stability with regard to the elements which are concerned in the continued existence of living beings . " - Vol . I. p. 205 . And what is the reflection with which our philosopher concludes this summary view of the marvels of the planetary universe ? If he will not give God the glory for them , surely he will spend some words in admiration of the sublime effects thus produced , though by an unknown and inscrutable cause . But no ; he can admire nothing except the ability of man to perceive and record the marvel which is thus placed before him . " Such , " he continues , " are the sublime theorems of natural philosophy , for which humanity is indebted to whom , in Heaven 's name ? to the sum of the great works executed in the last century by the successors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds for denying that a Deity governs the universe , or has ever revealed himself to man , is the prevalence of what is called the laws of nature . " Theological philosophy , " he says , " supposes everything to be governed by will ; and that phenomena are therefore eminently variable and irregular , - at least virtually . The Positive Philosophy , on the contrary , conceives of them as subjected to invariable laws , which permit us to predict with absolute precision . The radical incompatibility of these two views is nowhere more marked than in regard to the phenomena of the heavens ; since , in that direction , our prevision is proved to be perfect . The punctual arrival of comets and eclipses , with all their train of minute incidents , exactly foretold , long before , by the aid of ascertained laws , must lead the common mind to feel that such // events must be free from the control of any will , which could not be will , if it was thus subordinated to our astronomical decisions . " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scepticism are found among the students of physical science at the present day - and it must be confessed that they are numerous and alarming - are probably atfributable to the reasoning here stated . Naturalists , physicists , and chemists , as well as asfronomers , have a vague notion that moral government is incompatible with the prevalence of fixed and permanent natural laws . We call the notion a vague one , because most of those who are conscious of the difficulty can not point out precisely what constitutes it , or even give a definite and fixed significance to that much abused phrase , " the laws of nature , " on the precise meaning of which the whole point of the reasoning depends . A law of nature properly means the regular - even the invariable - recurrence of phenomena of a certain class ; it has nothing whatever to do with the true cause of those phenomena . But when one of these laws is ascertained , - and it is the sole business of physical science to discover and determine or exactly define them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the phenomenon is caused by that law , or produced by it , or necessarily happened on account of the law . Neither of these expressions is strictly correct , and each of them is apt to lead to a false inference . What is called the law is only a general fact , ascertained by induction ; and the phenomenon is only a particular instance , or example , of that general fact . To attribute a particular event to a law of nature is only to classify it with certain other events , so similar to it in character that they may all be simply and conveniently comprehended under one general statement . The event is then properly subsumed , or ranked under the law , and not caused by it . And because the event is so classified , it is not properly accounted for , or explained ; for the other phenomena thus classed along with it may be equally and totally inexplicable . Neither did the event necessarily happen on account of the law . There is no necessity in the case . The law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily true in all cases . We have only assumed that it always will hold true , because , // in all the instances hitherto observed , it always has held true . The law , then , does not govern or control any of the cases subsumed under it . In the case of any particular phenomenon , moreover , we are not sure that it is rightly subsumed under the law ; similarity with the other phenomena ranked under this head is the only ground of such subsumption , and we can never be sure that the similarity is perfect in the very circumstances that are required . So far , then , we agree with M. Comte ; indeed , the doctrine which we have now attempted to explain is the very foundation stone of the " Positive Philosophy . " But when he comes to argue against the doctrines of theology , - or rather to cast a slur on them , for on this subject he seldom argues , - then he forgets his own principles . Then , he maintains , events can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed by natural laws . Then , events can not be contingent , can not depend on mere will , because they take place necessarily , or in conformity with the fixed and permanent laws of nature . Never was inconsistency more glaring ; never did a philosopher more directly contradict his own principles . But as M. Comte 's blunders can only serve to convict M. Comte himself , let us look more particularly at this supposed difficulty , which is specially experienced by the students of physical science , of reconciling moral government with the prevalence of natural law . In the statement of the difficulty , as in the passage which we have just quoted , it is assumed , first , that " everything , " all the phenomena in the universe , are subjected to invariable laws , and that , because they*are thus perfectly uniform in their recurrence , they can be predicted with unerring precision , when the laws of their uniformity are once ascertained ; secondly , that the phenomena which are dependent on the will of any being are necessarily contingent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be foreseen ; and therefore , thirdly , that the phenomena of the universe can not be dependent on the will of a God . It would be easy to reduce this reasoning to the strict syllogistic form ; but it is unnecessary , as the point of the argument is sufficiently obvious . We deny both the premises , and therefore reject the conclusion . // It is not true that all the phenomena in the universe are subjected to invariable laws , so that they are perpetually recurrent after the same fashion . The variety of detail in God 's creation is even more obvious , more striking , than the general uniformity of plan . The former is patent to the observation of a child ; the latter can generally be detected only by the researches of science . It is because the savans find their sole employment in seeking out these uniformities , because they spend a lifetime in detecting and contemplating them , that they strangely come to forget the infinite variety of surface under which these uniformities were concealed . After all the boasted triumphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still vastly exceeds what has been reduced to uniformity and law . We do not now refer to those cases in which the classification is acknowledged to be still imperfect , the work of science not being yet completed . Take those instances in which it is most nearly completed . Extend the classification through genera , sub-genera , species , varieties , sub-varieties , if any such be recognized ; still we must come down to individuals at last , and then no two can be found that are precisely alike . Strictly speaking , Nature never repeats herself . The botanist has exhausted all the artsof comparison and classification ; and yet he may safely be challenged to produce two plants , two blossoms , two leaves even , that are perfectly similar . The difference between any two is usually obvious enough , even to the naked eye ; but will be surely apparent under the microscope . We must change Pope 's oft-quoted line ; not " Order , " but Variety " is Heaven 's first law . " The unity of principle is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery does not lessen , even by one , the number of cases of difference . The imperfection of our knowledge does not always lead us to suppose diversity where none really exists ; it often induces us to imagine uniformity where there is nothing but variety . We must come near to detect differences in forms , sounds , or colors . It is because the planetary and stellar universe is so far off , and therefore our knowledge of it is so general and imperfect , that the dominion of law there seems to be more entire and exclusive than in the terrestrial world . We need // not multiply instances of this unbounded diversity of Nature 's operations ; every one 's memory will supply enough of them for the purposes of this argument . Speaking generally , we may say , no two objects are ever created on precisely the same pattern , and no two events ever happened , all the circumstances of which were exactly alike . When M. Comte boasts of the power of science " to predict with absolute precision , " let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next twenty children who are born in Paris will be red-haired , and how many of them will have blue eyes , aquiline noses , and thin lips . Secondly , we deny that the phenomena which are dependent on the will of any being are therefore variable and uncertain , so that they can never be foreseen . Indeed , by asserting that they are so , M. Comte again flatly contradicts himself , and takes away the corner-stone of his own favorite science of sociology . As society is composed only of individuals , the movements and aspects of society could not be predicted , if the actions of the individual members were not , at least in certain respects , subject to law . The reality and the possibility of such sciences as politics and political economy , to say nothing of sociology , depend on the known facts that the action of men is influenced by motives , that there are certain leading motives , such as the desire of life , health , freedom , and property , which are common to all men , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to a limited extent , can be anticipated with full confidence that the prediction will be justified by the result . Were it not so , no general maxims could be established in political or social science , and no lessons could be derived from history . The conduct of men offers the same combination of uniformity with variety , of unity of principle underlying innumerable differences of detail , which is seen in the works of God in the external universe . According as the observer stands nearer or farther off , according as his object is to arrange and classify for the purposes of science , or to particularize for the sake of description , so will he be more struck with the evidences of order and uniformity , or with those of diversity and fluctuation . Look at great masses of men only from a distance , at which minute peculiarities are lost in the general effects , ( just as the sounds // from a distant city are blended in one hollow murmur , ) and they appear like machines , or rather the multitude itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an individual for two successive hours , and it appears a mass of inconsistencies , motiveless alterations , and oddities that baffle all computation and foresight . We know nothing directly of M. Comte 's own habits ; but it is safe to affirm , that , for many years , he walked each morning from his residence to the Polytechnic School , appeared in the class-room at a fixed hour , and performed a certain unvarying round of duties . And we may be equally sure , that , in passing over the ground , on no morning did he step precisely in the foottracks which he had made the day before . Will alone , it is true , would be changeful and irregular ; but will enlightened by human reason is comparatively steady and uniform in its operations ; and will enlightened by infinite wisdom , we may presume , knows no change of purpose or shifting of means , but reconciles perfect order with endless variety . And such is the character both of the material and moral universe . When M. Comte assumes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that whatever takes place in conformity to law also takes place necessarily , he is again inconsistent with himself . The principles of his philosophy rigidly exclude all idea of causation ; and where there is no causation , there is no necessary connection . Invariable concomitance or succession is not causation ; and when the idea of causation is excluded , we have no right to conclude that the succession is invariable . We can only say that the law has held good so far as our experience , or the experience of others , has extended . For aught we know , the law is one of recent introduction ; for aught we know , it will soon cease to operate . The law is made known only by a process of induction , and induction is no ground of demonstration . Inductive evidence can warrant no conclusion that extends into the future . But it will be asserted that this is extravagant scepticism ; as no one , whatever he may affect to deny on theoretical considerations , can practically doubt that the laws of nature are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant that // the scepticism is extravagant upon any correct view of the phenomena of nature , and of the agency which causes them . But M. Comte excludes the idea of cause altogether ; he will allow us to study the laws of nature only as phenomenal successions or coincidences , and thereby he strikes away all ground of confidence in them as unchanging . If we attribute causation to brute matter , or assert that one phenomenon in the outward universe actually causes or produces another , then we can admit that the connection between them is necessary ; and if we deny causation to brute matter , and attribute all changes in the material universe to the immediate agency of the Deity , we can still believe , through our confidence in Him " with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning , ** that the connection will be uniform and permanent . But the Positive Philosophy rejects both of these grounds of belief , and therefore leaves us no better reason for believing that the connection will be unceasing , than we have for thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other for several years , will continue apparently to regulate each other 's motion , and to strike the hour together as if they were parts of one machine . M. Comte endeavors to connect himself with the necessarian or fatalist on the one hand , and with the mere observer of phenomena , who seeks not to pry into the mysteries of efficient causation , on the other . But the attempt can not succeed . The two theories are radically inconsistent with each other , and our author must take his choice between them . In truth , the idea of cause is not only one of those primary elements of belief , which we can not reject without overthrowing the whole structure of human knowledge , but it is a regulative principle of the human mind , the rejection of which is inconsistent with the prosecution of any mental labor and with any fruitful study of the phenomena of the material universe . The attempt to eliminate what enters into nearly every fact of consciousness is , to borrow the language of Sir James Mackintosh , " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by other laws than those to which its nature has subjected its operations . " Mental labor of any sort , which is voluntary , or directed by an action of the will , is ac // companied by a consciousness of effort , or of power in action , which is necessarily causative , or followed by some effect . Power in action , indeed , is a mere synonyme of causation , and is therefore necessarily attended by its effect . The cause and effect , in this case , are indissolubly blended in one act , and the one , therefore , can not be even imagined without the other . This law of mental action is projected , so to speak , out of the mind upon the material universe , so that , whenever we behold a change , a beginning of existence , we necessarily attribute it to the action of some efficient cause . If we deny this principle of causality , we can no longer trust even the axioms upon which all mathematical reasoning is based ; for they all rest upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we admit the principle that every event must have a cause , but deny that the cause is ever cognizable by us , we equally reject the testimony of consciousness , which assures us that the human will is a true cause , - limited indeed , but yet supreme within its own domain . That mere matter - the mere physical phenomenon - is not a real cause , is not a truth of physical science , but of metaphysical ; we learn from consciousness that all truly causative action is restricted to mind , and also acquire from consciousness the tests which disprove its presence in the material universe . M. Comte is obliged to borrow the testimony of a science that he rejects , in order to build up two cardinal principles of his own system ; namely , the , permanency of physical laws , and the fact that our knowledge of external nature can never go beyond the observation of its phenomena , and the consequent prevision of them through their laws of coincidence or succession . We had purposed to examine the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details of their application to the several sciences . But the subject is an abstruse one , and our remarks upon it have already extended to so great length , that we forbear . Enough has been said to prove that so narrow and degrading a conception of the objects of inquiry , and of the principles which are applicable to the investigation of the laws of nature , can lead only to meagre and profitless results in every department of science . It is not a scheme of philosophy which is likely to find many proselytes , // or to enjoy any other than a temporary notoriety . It has been received , as we have seen , with but little favor in France , and Miss Martineau 's efforts are not likely to obtain for it much currency in England . Even the controversy which it has evoked can not much retard its progress to oblivion .
