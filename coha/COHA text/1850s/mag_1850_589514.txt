POLITICAL PORTRAITS WITH PEN AND PENCIL . ALEXANDER W. BUEL , OF MICHIGAN . IN presenting to the readers of the " Democratic Review " the following sketch , the writer is induced to believe ' that there are many circumstances in the life of the subject of the memoir well worthy of perusal , whether he is regarded as the qualified and examined college student of ten years , the successful lawyer of twenty-one , the youthful state legislator , or the still young representative in Congress of an enlightened constituency ; and that the youth of our country , who may aspire to distinction , either as scholars or statesmen , will here find a fit subject for study , and a high example for imitation . Hon. ALEXANDER W. BUEL was born in Poultney , Rutland county , Vermont , in December , 1813 . He is the son of Mr. Ezekiel and Mrs. Sally Bud , the former of whom was a native of Litchfield , Connecticut , whence he early emigrated to Poultney , Vermont , and there united himself in matrimony to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that name , and which settled at an early day in the history of the country , at Goshen , Connecticut , one branch of which subsequently settled at Poultney . In 1814 , the father of ALEXANDER , with his family , removed from Poultney to Castleton , in the same state , which contained one of the oldest and most flourishing academies and medical colleges in the north both of which still exist . To this last removal of his parents , probably , is to be attributed much of his ultimate good fortune , since they were in very ordinary circumstances , and here found greater facilities for the education of their son . It was the more fortunate for him , too , that this change of residence occurred , as , from birth he was subject to a physical deprivation , which plainly pointed the parents to some one of the learned professions for the future occupation of their son , and made his thorough education the constant aim of his parents . From earliest infancy , young BUEL manifested a singular precocity , a desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which in manhood he has been peculiarly characterized . His education was commenced at a very early age , and he exhibited from the first the germ of an expansive mind and a growing genius ; he was blessed with a tenacious memory , and stimulated by a thirst to excel . Young BUEL attended the common , or district school of his village , until about his eighth year . At this age he commenced his academical studies , preparatory for admission to college , under the immediate tuition of Mr. Henry Howe , now residing at Canandaigua , in the state of NewYork ; a highly talented , pious , and estimable man , and who has for more than twenty years been the principal of the Canaudaigua Academy . For two years young BUEL 'S entire existence seemed engrossed in his muchloved studies-his books his companions , his progress his reward , and knowledge his aim . In 1824 , at the age of ten years , our student had passed through all V0I*. xXvii. - *o. vi . 5 // the requisite branches to entitle him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be better understood when the reader is informed , that during the two years of his preparatory course , besides his academical studies , he read largely of ancient history from authors like Rollin , Gibbon , Josephus , and was never absent from his recitations unless from sickness , and was usually first amongst his classmates , although they were always much his superiors in age . In the year last mentioned , being qualified for admission to college , ycung BUEL , accompanied by his academical teacher , Mr. Howe , repaired to Middlebury College , at its annual commencement , and presented himself-much to the astonishment of professors and tutors , for admission . He then passed the usual examination for entrance as a freshman . Although now admitted to college , yet his old teacher and friends , in consideration of his extreme youth , desired him not yet to enter upon his regular collegiate course , and graduate at the early age of fourteen , as he would have done had he continued it . To their opinions he deferred , and the ensuing three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher grade , such as are usually pursued in college . But few , if any of his fellow pupils being so far advanced in the classics as himself he was usually the only member of his class , and often left to pursue his own course , without limitation of lessons , or the competition of classmates . He therefore proceeded at his own rapid rate , and so well versed was he at this time in the classics , and especially in the Latin , that the simpler authors in that language were read by him with nearly the same ease and fluency as his vernacular . It is known that he often made but a single lesson of an entire book in Caisar 's Commentaries , and he seemed to be master of the principles of the English Grammar without having ever pursued it in school as a study for a single day . Up to this period , but one specimen of Mr. BuEL'sjcomposition has been preserved ; that being an oration in Latin , delivered at the close of the academic year , 1827 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been favored with access to Mr. BUEL ' s papers and manuscripts , the writer of this can testify to the truthfulness of his early high attainments . Mr. BUEL was now thirteen years of age . His original design was , to have entered Middlebury College , where he had passed examination three years previously , and where , also , his elder brother Julian G. , now deceased , had graduated in 1823 , with the highest honors of his class . But , being attached to his recent teacher , Mr. Foote , who had just been appointed tutor in the Vermont University , at Burlington , and who desired to take the young student with him , he was persuaded to accompany him to that institution , which-though qualified for a higher class-he entered a sophomore , in 1827 ; it being advised , that he should not gradnate at an earlier age than that of sixteen . This admission was contrary to the University regulation , which prescribed fourteen years as the requisite age of a freshman ; but , in this instance , was waived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of which time he occupied a college-room with , and thus enjoyed the daily society of one of the Professors-Joseph Torrey , then professor of languages , and now professor of moral and intellectual philosophy in the same institution . The sphere of the young student was now changed and enlarged , and this fact but increased his thirst for knowledge . By diligence and perseverance he won the plaudits of all as a scholar , while , by his naturally // amiable and truthful deportment , and regularity of habits , he secured the good-will and friendship of both professors and students . There were but few studies at this time which he could not master , in spite even of his youth . He was successful in mathematics , and particularly so in geometry ; but his fondness for the languages was ever predominant . At the close of the year he left for home , with a strong desire to continue his education in the college of his earlier choice , where , four years previous , he had been admitted freshman . Accordingly , in 1828 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his untiring devotion to study now began to be discovered in a hitherto robust , but now impaired constitution , from which he has ever since been a sufferer . Before he had passed beyond the age of fifteen years , young BUEL availing himself of the usual college winter vacation , to become the teacher of a common school at Clareudon , Vermont ; moved by a laudable desire to aid in supplying the means of his own*education ; and the avails of this effort-his first pecuniary fruits-were entrusted to his father for that purpose . We have now arrived at that point in our sketch , so interesting to the student ,  --  the close of college-life . We have seen the subject of it almost in infancy , and at an age perhaps never before recorded of such a case in this or any other country , successfully examined for admission to college , yet still , from choice , continuing in an advanced course of academical studies ; and at last , at the immature age of sixteen years , in August , 1830 , passing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his class . If it be asked , " by what means was this rapid and precocious advancement made i " We answer  --  to a large share of natural endowment , were added the aids of extraordinary industry and perseverance , love of study , a rigid code of rules for the division and use of time , regularity of hours , and abstemiousness from all excesses . Indeed , for many years after leaving college , Mr. BURL invariably rose at four o'clock in the morning throughout the year-retiring at ten in the evening with the greatest punctuality . The world was now before him . Thenceforth he was to make his way through life unaided ; and his first act was to take upon himself-in September , 1830  --  the superintendence of a classical academy at West Rutland , in his native state . Here he fitted large classes wholly , or in part , for college  --  a rare achievement for a youth of sixteen or seventeen years ! In November , of the following year , he accepted an invitation to become principal of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state of New-York . Here , too , as formerly , he frequently gave instruction to persons far his seniors in years , some of whom have since occupied prominent public stations . At this period be began more fully to develope his varied talents . Possessing classsical qualifications beyond competition , with an extensive fund of general information , and being almost a proficient in the sciences , he not unfrequently appeared before the public with scientific lectures and essays . It was here that he commenced the study of the law ; devoting to Blackstone a few spare hours each day , under the auspices of Jahez Parkhurst , Esq. , a man of high standing in his profession , and great purity of character . Although he was now in active life , resting upon his own responsibility , he did not , in the least , abate his habits of study ; on the contrary , if possible , he wa* still more laborious in his application . His morning hours , as also fot // years subsequently , from four o'clock until breakfast hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were the Spanish , Portuguese , Italian , German and French . His year at Fort Covington expired in December , 183* ; he then returned to his father 's residcnce at Castleton , where he continued his legal studies , and nearly completed them with his elder brother , Julian G. , to whom we have already alluded . At this time Mr. BUEL possessed a wide-spread reputation as a linguist , and , much against his inclination and former purpose , was persuaded to become a teacher of Latin and Greek in the Castleton Academy-taking charge of the advanced classes which were fitting for college . These having certain hours for recitation , created no very serious interference with his legal pursuits . During this period of his residence at Castleton we note an interesting fact of his early life ; which , though seventeen years have elapsed , has never , until within the past year , been known to any person save himself not excepting even his own family , or most intimate friends . In the year 1833 , a prize of $500 was offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New-York , for a series of the best Lectures , or Essays , on the subject of " Application of Science to Art . " At the head of this committee stood the name of the Hon. Benjamin F. Butler . Mr. BUEL , then at the age of nineteen years , was bold enough to enter the lists for the prize , where competitors of known and public reputation were expected to meet . He prepared a series of Essays , covering several hundred foolscap pages , which , over the signature of " UNA MANU , * ' * were forwarded to Mr. Butler , who acknowledged their receipt in highly complimentary terms , by letter of- , 1833 : expressing the opinion that they seemed well adapted to the purpose intended . Years elapsed , but no tidings reached " UNA MANn " as to the fate of his Essays . After their long sleep , they have , during this present year , been restored to their author , and must now be to him a most agreeable reminiscence of youthful study and ambition . Amidst his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academy , and as a student at law , we next find him engaged in a most novel and remarkable philological investigation-having for its object , to illustrate the composition of the English language , and to arrange all its words , and each part of speech , in tables , or classes , according to the language from which they are derived ; thus showing the aggregate number of words , as also , the aggregate of each part of speech derived from each particular language . A little reflection will satisfy any one of the great labor necessarily involved in such an undertaking , although a small table may embrace the result . This table has been preserved , but never given to the public . So novel an investigation as this , is not known to us as having ever before been undertaken ; afid its results could not fail to be of great interest . Mr. BUEL , in some of his public discourses , has made some very remarkable and exact statements concerning the composition of our language , such , indeed , as no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his authority was only known to himself , it being the result of his own research  --  the fruit of his early industry . In the year 1834 , Mr. Bud determined to remove to Detroit , and in October of that year , alone , and with no fortune , save the few dollars of // his juvenile earnings , he started westward , and in the same month arrived at Detroit , the place of his destination . Though a stranger in a strange city , he soon made friends and acquaintances . Being naturally frank , he soon won the confidence of others ; and in less than two months after his arrival he was appointed Deputy Register of the Court of Probate , discharging , however , all the duties of Register . This was his first official trust . Perceiving that a large portion of the native population of the city was French , and that it was rapidly increasing with a German mimigration , he perfected himself further in his knowledge of the French and German languages , so as to speak them readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly addressed his German fellow-citizens . This enabled him early to extend his acquaintance : rendered his counsel often necessary as well as useful , and prepared the way for the lawyer , as well as the politician and statesman . Mr. Bud completed the few remaining months of his legal studies in the office of the Hon. B. F. H. Witherell , and in the spring of 1835 was admitted to practice at the Detroit har . Simultaneously with his admission he was favored with a flattering and compensatory practice . In a few years he attained the choicest practice of his profession . He was soon found in all the courts of the state , in law and chancery , and of the United States ; and was often opposed by , and associated with , the ablest members of the bar , and in cases of the first importance . In the fall of 1835 , Mr. Bud cast his first vote , at the first election held under the constitution of his adopted state . This election was the more important , as it gave birth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carrying with him from Vermont the political opinions of his father , his vote was given for the entire Democratic ticket . Amidst all the excitements and assaults to which his party has , at times , been subject , he has never been known to waver in his political faith . In October , 1836 , Mr. Bud was united in matrimony with Miss Mary Ann Ackley , of West Rutland , Vermont , the parents of whom were both deceased ; a young lady of piety and great personal attractions , and endowed with those qualities which adorn the wife and mother , and give happiness to home . By this union he has had four daughters , who , cdu cated in part , thus far , under the supervision of the father , evince much of his youthful talents , and all of whom now survive . During the year 1836 , Mr. B. was appointed attorney , or legal adviser of the city of Detroit , which office he filled for one year ; and in the fall of 1837 he received the first token @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed . Now but little beyond his majority , without the slightest anticipation on his part , he was , nominated by the democracy to represent the city of Detroit in the legislature of Michigan . The election proved a very close one , each party succeeding in part ; but among the successful candidates was Mr. Buel . The legislature convened in January following , and the 1-louse of Representatives for that year has never since been surpassed in talent and ability ; containing such men as the Hon. Robert M'Clelland , Hon. Kinsley S. Bingham , and lion . Jacob M. Howard , all of whom , by a singular coincidence , have been since honored with seats in Congress ; two having been predecessors of Mr. Buel , and the first three , himself included , having successively held the office of Speaker in the legislature of Michigan . In the commencement of his legislative career Mr. B. occupied a high // position ; he having been chosen Speaker pro tempore , on the organization of the House of Representatives , and afterwards appointed chairman of the Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ablest members of the House , such as Messrs . M'Clelland and Howard , certainly a high compliment to the youngest member of the House . He was afterwards made chairman of two very important select committees - one upon establishing the Geological Survey of the State in Departments ; the other , upon changing the locations of the Northern and Southern Rail-roads of Michigan , which were then under the control of the State . As the head of the Judiciary Committee , Mr. Bud enjoyed the confidence of the House , and acquitted himself with great ability and satisfaction . One of the most important and exciting measures of the session was the Senate bill for the establishment of a mammoth State Bank-which , though properly belonging to the Committee on Banks , was , nevertheless , referred to the Judiciary Committee . This scheme was violently urged by the horde of bank speculators , then to be found in nearly every part of the State , who had caused an amendment to be proposed in the House , authorizing the directors to purchase up the stock and assets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MILLIONS OF DOLLARS . Mr. Buel at once saw that the object of this was the relief of a host of smaller institutions , already substantially bankrupt , nearly all of which failed within a year after ; and of which , numbering in all about 70 , but one now survives . This measure met with great hostility from the democratic masses . He , however , reported the bill to the House , with a variety of amendments , and though strongly opposed by Mr. Howard , the able leader on the Whig side of the House , and by many able democrats , as well as the entire moneyed interest of the State , Mr. Buel firmly placed himself in opposition to the scheme ; and it was finally defeated , after a long and violent struggle . The defeat of this bill hastened the exposure of the true state of things , and one bank explosion followed another , until the people of Michigan , at last , found that purer financial atmosphere , in which they have attained their present prosperity . Mr. Bud 's conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life , speaks high for his democracy , and gilds his first appearance as a legislator more brightly than can any language of ours . After the adjournment of the legislature , he published a series of articles over the signature of " Democritus , " addressed " To the advocates of Paper Money ; " which attracted great attention , and were answered in the leading Whig journal of the city , by " WARREN , " who , it was understood , had been his leading Whig opponent in the House . As chairman of the Committee on the Geological Survey , Mr. Buel made an able and scientific report , setting forth its probable benefits ; and amongst these , the manufacture of salt , in which his predictions and arguments have been verified . A bill was also reported by him from that committee , for establishing and dividing the Geological Survey into its various departments , of mineralogy , geology , &amp;c. , which bill became a law , and one of the distinguishing acts of that Legislature . As chairman of the Select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult and laborious part to perform , and which can only be appreciated by those cognizant of the then existing state of affairs in Michigan , relative to its internal improvements , and the question of permanent4 locating the Northern and Southern Rail-roads . As he resided at // Detroit , he stood indifferent as to the interest between the contending parties , and was , consequently , appropriately called on to lead in this committee . After weeks of daily and nightly labor in the examination of over one hundred witnesses , Mr. B. presented a long and able report , accompanied by a bill . He was opposed by most of the leading talent of the body , including the three distinguished gentlemen before named . Under such circumstances , the bill was lost by a meagre majority . The course and views of Mr. Bud have since been successfully vindieated by the silent progress of events , and fails not to ' impress us with the forecast and sagacity displayed by him upon that question . In 1843 , Mr. Bud was appointed prosecuting attorney for the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This appointment was , in a professional light , one of importance , giving him a prominent legal position before the bar and the public , well calculated to try his talents in a new field , and imposed upon him public responsibilities of a high and oftentimes delicate character . Such was his success as a public prosecutor , that whole terms of a court were known , sometimes , to have passed , with a score of convictions , and without a single acquittal . This was owing chiefly to his cautious discrimination in presenting cases before the grand jury , his great industry in the preparation of them , and his judginent in conducting his trials . his first official term as prosecuting attorney expired in two years , when , in 1845 , he was re-commissioned without opposition , and at the close of his second term , in 1847 , he declined the office for any further period . No court has ever invalidated one of his indictments , although many of his cases found their way to the Supreme Court of the state ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly sought for in important causes , in remote parts of the state . Though , as we have seen , thus actively engaged in his profession , Mr. Bud 's industry and system had given him ample time for literary pursuits of the most elevated character . He had delivered various public discourses upon some of the most profound subjects , discovering rare and varied attainments in literature , displaying a research and learning which have elevated him to the reputation of one of the most accomplished scholars of the country . Amongst his miscellaneous literary enterprises , undertaken during the active period of his professional life , are to be found a translation from the French of one of the oldest works extant , by one of the Jesuit fathers , concerning the early history of the Iroquois tribes , and of New France , ( Canada , ) and also some finished translations from standard Italian and Portuguese poets . These interesting translations yet sleep amongst his manuscripts , and may yet be given to the public . Upon the formation of the " . New England Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chosen its first orator  --  a post which has since been honored by such as General Cass and ex-Senator Woodbridge . His address , delivered December 22d , of that year , has been regarded by those who heard it , or have read it since published , as one of the most chaste finished , and eloquent addresses ever made upon the landing of our Pilgrim Fathers . As an illustration of Mr. Bud 's strong and highly cultivated imagination , we quote a passage from the address . After recurring to the winter // seene of the landing at Plymouth , he thus personifies the spirit of the Reformation , as an aged mother conducting her child to a new home " I behold the spirit-form of the Reformation . An aged and giant mother , bearing aloft the sacred oracles of God , and Nature 's scr&amp;ll of Freedom ; she steps upon the ice-bound coast ; points her mighty child to a new home , then quickly flies to her suffering children of other climes . Away beyond-o'er many a mountain chain , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' rolls-'tis New England in her birth , and New England as she is to be . I see , also , in the view , her dashing streams , her thousand hills and dales , and her beautiful valleys ; whilst her evergreen , but snow-bearing mountains , pierce the heavens , and , looking down upon earth , as if with the hand of Omnipotence , hang out from the clouds their everlasting crags. ** We now come to the celebrated Oregon controversy , in which Mr. B* was brought prominently before the country , by his efforts and new researches in vindicating our right to the whole of that country ; some of which were published , and others deposited in the Department of State at Washington . First he maintained , that , prior to the acquisition of the Louisiana territory by the United States , England had never claimed title beyond the highlands of Hudson 's Bay , and that , beyond this limit , she was estopped in her claim by her former admissions , that the country in dispute had ever belonged to Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by whom , in 1803 , it was ceded to the United States . To this point Mr. B. found , in his own valuable library , an authority not hitherto noticed by any of those who had as yet investigated the subject-it being a large his-* torical work , published at Londonin 1746 , which was first publicly quoted from by Mr. B. , in a discourse before the " Detroit Young Men 's Society , " delivered January 15th , 1846 . By this work he showed , to use its own language , that , " North of New Mexico , the Spaniards , if they please , may call the country theirs as far as the pole ; " that " the eastern side of the Mississippi is the property of the Indians subject to Great Britain , and the western side belongs to the Indians who are under the dominion of the Spaniards ; " and that " it is very well known , that the Spaniards possessed the west side of North America , and the English the east , long before the French had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this contest , the great point to which Mr. Bud more particularly directed his efforts , and for which he is entitled to high credit and distinction , was the new proofs he produced , from the same work , touching the establishment of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude as the boundary between the British and French possessions in North America , by commissioners under the treaty of Utrecht . On one hand , it had been contended by General Cass , in the United States Senate , as also by others , that commissioners , if ever appointed . under that treaty , had never actually established that or any other line of boundary ; that they had never acted ; or at least , that there was not to be found , either in the archives at Paris , or in any work of history , any direct evidence or statement that the commissioners had established the forty-ninth parallel , or any other lihe , as the boundary . On the other hand , Colonel Benton , and others holding his opinions , maintained , that the commissioners did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the evidence thereof seemed to have become chiefly lost , they relying , for such opinion , mainly upon maps of the last century , some of which contained the " on // nous dotted line " of the forty-ninth parallel , with an allusion to it as the boundary ; whilst some contained only the silent line itself ; and others set forth no line along this parallel . Colonel Benton planted himself especially on D'Anville 's map of 1752 , in Postlewait 's Dictionary , as the Qldest authority on the subject that had as yet been produced . But this map was afterwards shown to be a copy , the original of which had been seen by Mr. Greenhow , and contained no dotted line . Meanwhile , Mr. Bud had continued his researches . He found in the work already produced from his own library , a map of North America without the " dotted line , " and of course six years , at least , older than D'Anville 's , so much relied on by Colonel Benton , and probably reaching back , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as the accompanying work had now passed its third edition . Besides , this map was sanctioned tos authority by the name of its author , HERMAN MOLL , a distinguished geographer of the last century , and who is certified in the king 's license to be " the most accurate and correct geographer of the age . " Mr. B. 's investigations concerning the maps were given to the public through the press over his own signature , April 14,1846 . But there was still another question about the evidence . It was contended by some , and yielded by others , that there was no living original history of the fact , that commissioners had ever met and run a boundary line under the treaty of Utrecht . None such had been brought out by Mr. Greenhow , who had investigated this question of the forty-ninth parallel more thoroughly than any other person in the country , nor by the elaborate discussions of the question in Congress . But still Mr. B. , in his investigations , was rewarded by discovering that a boundary had been determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as shown by the following remarkable language , which he quoted from the work alluded to , and had found twice used by the author " And Commissioners did afterwards settle the limits by an imaginary line , drawn from a promontory , situate on the Atlantic Ocean , in fifty-eight degrees , thirty minutes , and running from thence south-west to the lake Miscosink , or Mistazin , and from thence south-west , indefinitely , to the latitude of 49 ; all the countries to the north being assigned to Great Britain , and all on the south between that line and the line of St. Lawrence or Canada , to France . " These latter researches were at once communicated by Mr. Buel to General Cass , while the contest was yet waxing warmly , who , in his speech , delivered in the Senate , June 1st , 1846 , made use of them , as furnished , at the same time acknowledging their author in complimentary terms . Thus , the points proven by Mr. B. were , 1 . That a line was established by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that boundary was ; and 3 . That it extended down ro the 49th parallel , and not indefinitely ALONG that line . These new historical researches , with the proper deductions and arguments , were embodied by Mr. Bud in the form of a document , entitled , " Was a 6oundary line between the British and French Possessions in North America ever established by Commissioners under the Treaty. * of liftrecht  --  and if so , to what extent ? " and forwarded to Hon. James Buchanan , then Secretary of State , on the 24th July , 1846 , accompanied by a letter of Mr. B. of the same date , the receipt of which was acknowledged by the Secretary in honorable terms . This document and letter are now to be found amongst the archives of the State Department . // Thus it was that Mr. Buel brought to light at least one historical authority , setting forth the action of the Commissioners under the treaty of Utrecht , and of a date reaching back nearly to that of the treaty itself . When he made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at the same time a meritorious boldness , deep reflection , and a rising statesmanship , in thus planting himself firmly upon their authority , and grappling with the mightiest intellects of th' country , upon a question at that time so full of mystery , and the decision of which was supposed to involve the alternative of peace or war with Great Britain . It is needless to add , after what has been written , that Mr. Buel stood most firmly by the ground of General Cass , in maintaining the American title to the whole of Oregon . Following the Oregon controversy came the Mexican war . We have space only briefly to notice Mr. Buel 's course and opinions concerning that momentous event of Mr. Polk 's administration . Nowhere in the Union did President Polk possess a more firm , faithful and consistent champion of his administrative policy than Mr. B. At its very outset , over the signature of " AMERICANUS , " he gave to the public , throug*h the press , a series of articles , in which he successfully defended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been justified in declaring war against Mexico prior to the late commencement of hostilities on the Rio Grande . 2 . Mexico commenced the war , and without sufficient cause . " The following paragraph shows the patriotic spirit in which those articles were written , and the severity with which he treated the Whig complaint , that our country was in the wrong : " Let him who does not love his country better than to indulge in such murmurs , flee from the indignation which awaits him ; let him go over to the enemy whom he in fact serves , and in whose bosom he will find a welcome response to all he can say against the cause of his country . This is no time for the settlement of party disputes . We may , and must have , parties amongst ourselves ; but , in the great struggle of nations , ON OUR SIDE , LET THERE BE BTJT ONE PARTY , AND THAT PARTY OURSELvEs . " At the November election in 1847 , Mr. Bud was again elected to the legislature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitol , at Lansing . On the opening in its session , in January* following , he was nominated , almost unanimously , in caucus , for the Speaker 's chair , which , ten years before , he had filled as Speaker pro tempore , and was subsequently selected by the unanimous vote of his party . The close of the session was marked for its extraordinary excitement and personal virulence , originating in the most exciting of all legislative questions-bankcharters , and other acts granting exclusiVe privileges . The bank question was again upon him , as ten years previously . The storm of party and personal feeling raged fiercely , and much of it was directed against the Speaker-as one of his decisions had endangered the passage of every bill of the character alluded to thus throwing upon him a weighty responsibility . Following the decision of nearly all his predecessors , in which , however , they had been overruled , he decided that , under the Constitution , acts of incorporation could not be passed by two-thirds of a quorum ; but only by two-thirds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the point debated with great earnestness . It was scarcely doubted that the chair would be overruled , as it had been // 555 in years past ; but Mr. B. briefly defended the grounds of his decision , when , to the surprise of all , he was sustained by the decisive vote of 42 to 17 . This result threw the bank-supporters into the utmost confusion . A second and third appeal was subsequently taken from like decisions , but the Speaker was sustained upon each , with the same result , showing the great confidence reposed in him as a presiding officer ; and the more so , as a large majority of the House was known to favor warmly the passage of the bills thus endangered by his decisions . It is but just to add , that , during the entire session , not one of Mr. B. 's decisions was reversed , on appeal ; and when the strife was over , he received , by vote , the unanimous approbation of the House , and left the chair with the acknowledged reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1846 , Mr. Buel became a candidate for nomination as a representative to Congress from the 1st district of Michigan . It is not surprising that Mr. B. failed , though by but a few votes opposed , as he was , by the entire influence of both State and National ' patronage , then mostly centred in Detroit , and by the great popularity and influence of his competitor , then in office . Mr. Bud had the satisfaction , however , of having secured , in the convention of his own city and county , an entire delegation to the district convention , in his favor ; and the demonstrations which followed this partial success , fully attested the spirit of the contest , and the enthusiasm with which he was supported where he was best known . On the 6th of September , 1848 , Mr. Buel , by a large *najority , on the first informal ballot , and then unanimously by acclamation , was nominated by the Democracy of his district as a candidate for representative in Congress , to fill the place then occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bud addressed his fellow-citizens at different places , for several weeks , speaking once in each day , and frequently twice . As a popular speaker , Mr. B. 's reputation had preceded him , and men of all parties usuali y assembled in large meetings to hear him . His district was generally democratic by a decisive majority ; but in the general melee of parties in that year no one could calculate results with certainty . His Whig opponent , the Hon. GEORGE C. BATES , of Detroit , stood at the head of his party in the State , as a popular and eloquent orator , and had taken such extreme ground on the slavery question as Mr. Bud could not occupy ; whilst , from another quarter of the district , emerged the free soil , abolition candidate . Thus was Mr. B. thrown into a triangular fight , of the most dangerous character . As to the " Wilmot Proviso , " he held that it was useless and inexpedient , and upon this point he was bitterly opposed by both Whigs and Abolitionists . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upon the doctrine of " non-intervention . " He defended , with all his ability and eloquence , General Cass , the veteran leader , to whom he had been a neighbor and devoted as a personal friend ever since his return from France . Mr. B. might have easily strengthened himself for the moment , by yielding to the anti-slavery prejudice , but his firmness and wisdom did not forsake him , and he magnanimously declared , that if he must be sacri/lcedfor this adhesion to the Presidential candidate , he was ready for such a result . " Much of the general interest and bitterness of opposition which were concentrated upon General Cass , was reflected upon Mr. B. , from his position and supposed political relations . " Mr. BUEL must be // defeated ! " was the cry of the opposition ; but he was triumphantly elected . Mr. BUEL was not to take his seat until the meeting of the 31st Congress in 1849 , and the meantime was spent in arranging his professional business , and making preparations for the larger sphere of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at this time deeply interested , as he had ever been , in the project of the great railroad to the Pacific ; and in reply to an invitation to attend the Railroad Convention held in St. Louis , in October , he thus writes : " The two oceans of this continent are now bound together by the American name , but no one can insure a preservation of the bond , without a union by laws and institutions . Such a union is among the inevitable results of the measure . It is a great work ,  --  the work of half a generation  --  and can not be commenced too soon . At least , let the plan be matured with all practicable despatch . " Mn . BUEL took his seat in Congress on the first day of its session , December 3,1849  --  the first session of which will ever stand out boldly in the legislative history of the country . It can never be forgotten by those who witnessed its excitements , participated in its proceedings , or realized the perils which attended it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the commencement of the session , Mn . BUEL proved himself true to his character as a democrat , by recognizing his allegiance to the usages of his party , and sustaining , to the last , the Hon. Howell Cobb for the Speakership , and all the other caucus nominees of the democracy during the extraordinary and protracted struggles of parties in the organization of the House . In forming the standing committees , Mn . BUEL was placed upon that of Foreign Affairs : one of the most important and honorable committees of the House . This appointment was a high compliment to Mr. B. , as a new , and one of the youngest members . From this position , his attention was naturally directed to those subjects , for the examination of which he was by nature and education best qualified . On the 29th of January following , Mn . BUEL may be said to have made his first appearance in Congress , by submitting the first written report made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , being one of great interest , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neutrals residing in an enemy 's country . Our limits will not allow but a brief statement of the case . Certain British subjects  --  and therefore neutralsmerchants , doing business in Mexico during the Mexican war , despatched the schooner " William " to Monterey , in California , laden with a Mexican cargo . On the arrival of the vessel at that place , it had fallen into the possession of the American arms , and the vessel and cargo were seized by order of Commodore Biddle , and condemned as lawful prize , in the exercise of the belligerent right , and under the doctrine , that the commerce of neutrals residing in an enemy 's country is impressed with the hostile character of that country , and consequently liable to seizure , like the commerce of the enemy . But circumstances were alleged to exist which would justly except the case from a strict application of the principle mentioned , and the owners preferred a claim to Congress for the value of the vessel and cargo , on the ground of an unjust and unlawful confiscation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied the principles of international law with great clearness and force to all the facts , and utterly // demolished all those pretensions which were speciously presented in justification of the voyage . He showed that the principle above mentioned was , from necessity , inflexible , and that no country had enforced it more rigidly than England , even against her own subjects . But the ground chiefly relied on by the claimants , in support of their case , was , that the prize court , which had tried and condemned the " William , " was incompetent , without authority , and that all its proceedings were illegal and void . This seemed , at first , to present many intricate questions . Mr. B. met the objection , not with abstruse inquiry into the questions of jurisdiction , but simply by supposing the ground to be true . From this it would follow , that our government had , and could have at that time , no competent prize court on the Pacific coast . He then applied the principle , that " where the prize can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a right , at his peril , to destroy the same ; " so that , the property in that case must have become lost ta.the owners , unless they , in an action against the captor , and trial upon the merits , could show , that under the law of nations it was not originally liable to capture and confiscation . But the ground assumed by the claimants , as to the illegality of the court , and invalidity of its proceedings , is thus still more effectually disposed of : " If the case can come legitimately before Congress for investigation , it must come upon its merits ; it must come here , as it would before a court of competent jurisdiction  --  to be governed by the principles of international law , and tried by the facts , as they existed at the time of the capture . Congress will not sit as a court of appeal or review , to try the case of the " William " on the proceedings and alleged errors of the court which condemned her , but as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the committee , upon examination , were to come to the conclusion , that the court was without power and jurisdiction , and that all its proceedings were , in the language of the petitioners , a " mere nullity , " the claimants would still not be entitled to relief , unless they could show that their property was not liable to capture . But the committee are clearly of the opinion that it was so liable ; and they do not , therefore , perceive how that liability can be changed or removed , by inquiring into the constitution and proceedings of the court . No errors of judicial proceeding can alter the facts as they exist , or divest the case of the question of liability to seizureIf the ' William " was once liable to capture , she could not be made less so by any irregularities in the mode of her confiscation . That liability being established , the loss follows , and as certainly , as if , for want of a competent prize court , she and her cargo had been destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notice , in this connexion , the deep interest which Mu . BUEL has for many years taken in the political affairs of Europe . He does this , that it may serve as an introduction to his first speech in Congress , and show , that his speech was the result of no sudden reflections , but consistent with his true character , and his settled and oft-expressed opinions . He had watched the ball of revolution with the most earnest attention , and wherever occasion offered , had not hesitated to express his sympathy with the struggling millions . In an address before the Detroit Young Men 's Society , January 15th , 1846 , he seemed to foresee the revolutionary storm of 1848 . He spoke of the " approaching crisis in the affairs of Europe , " and said , " time is urging it onward with unfailing certainty . It is the war of monarchism and republicanism . " And with his eye upon France , he said , " It is not too much to hope or believe , that the republicanism of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // In two years afterward , that hope was nearly realized in the French revolution of February , 1848 , and the French Republic , which immediately lighted up the fires of revolution all over Europe , which burned brightly and successfully , till at last extinguished in the smoking ruins of Hungary . In March , 1846 , MR . BURL addressed the Detroit Irish Repeal Society , and closed with the following words : " We should not be unmindful , that we are bound to Ireland by no common ties of sympathy . Let us not forget , that , in 1783 , England let us go free , that she might the more effectually enslave Ireland . Our gain was , perhaps , her loss . England loved America , but she loved Ireland more ; and that love has been Ireland 's greatest curse 1 " During the same spring , MR . BURL addressed his fellow-citizens both in the German and English , upon the occasion of their assembling to commemorate the French Revolution of February preceding , where he exposed its influence upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and throughout Central Europe . On the 27th of July , of the same year , he addressed his fellowcitizens , who were assembled to express their sympathies upon the occasion of the condemnation of the Irish patriot , John Mitchell , who had just been condemned to imprisonment in one of the old British hulks at Bermuda . He thus eloquently maintains the power of human sympathy : " It has revolutionized more than one tyrannical government ; has caused more than one kingdom to shake , and levelled the throne of more than one despot with the dust . It has more than once arrested the fatal blow ; more than once unbarred the prison door ; more than once broken the bonds of oppression , and set the captive free . " Still cherishing his sympathies for European freedom , on the 29th of February last , MR . BURL made his first oratorical effort in Congress ; being his speech on " Hungarian Independence . " From the scenes of sectional strife and excitement , which had now reached their highest point in the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an altar of patriotism , and offer up to the Goddess of Liberty his prayer for European emancipation . It was a singular coincidence , that , while the American Congress was angrily debating over the dissolution of this great Republic , Mr. B. was pressing its example upon the oppressed nations of Europe , as the happiest and freest government on the face of the globe ; - he was urging the then conquered patriots of Europe to " fight on , " " fight on ; " and declaring that their contest would " yet go on to a victorious end . " The speech displays the greatest familiarity with its subject , and what more peculiarly distinguishes it , are the fervor and enthusiasm that inspire the speaker , as he descants upon the wrongs of " Unfortunate Hungary . " MR . BURL was so fortunate as to lea&amp; the way in the choice of his subject . General Cass in the Senate had spoken of Austrian , whilst he spoke of American wrongs , towards " ill-fated Hungary . " The House being in Committee of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resolution to refer the President 's annual message to the appropriate standing committeesMR . BURL obtained the floor , and offered the following amendment to the first resolution , which refers so much of the President 's message as relates to our foreign affairs to the Committee on Foreign Affairs , viz. : " With instructions to inquire whether , at that period , in the late struggle between Hungary and Austria , when the latter sought the intervention of Russia , // with a powerful army , Hungary had not in fact triumphed over Austria ; and whether the President , by neglecting at that period to recognize the independence of Hungary , did not depart from the settled policy of the country in recognizing de facto governments , disappoint the friends of freedom , and do violence to the sympathies and wishes of the American people . " After finishing his introduction , in which he happily alludes to the duty and destiny of the American Union , expressing the belief " that it is not to be , and can not be dissolved , " he lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triumph of Hungary before the Russian intervention , and here fortifies himself with the following memorable words of Mr. Clay , in the Senate , on the subject of the Austrian Mission- " But for the intervention of Russia , Hungary would have succeeded : Hungary had succeeded ; Hungary had triumphed in the contest with Austria 1 " Mr. B. regarded the occasion which called for the recognition of Hungarian independence , as surpassing in importance all similar occasions in the history of our government ; because Hungary was the " great central hinge upon which all future European revolutions were likely to turn . " He next describes the geographical relations of Hungary to the adjoining countries of Europe , displaying a full knowledge of this branch of his subject , and its importance ; following this with an exposition of the nature of the government of Hungary , and the designs of Austria for its entire overthrow and absorption in the empire . Then comes the war , with all its scenes of blood and carnage-its battles and victories  --  the Austrians are expelled , and Hungary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Emperor saw his last great foothold in Hungary preparing to yield . Presburg was about to fall before his very eyes , and under the walls of his proud capital ; Vienna trembled , and the whole empire of Austria shook with the pent up fires of revolution . The Austrians were now , like the English at Waterloo , crying out for succor , and all depending upon its speedy arrival . They exclaimed with alarm , Why do n't the Russians come P why do n't they come P " Let us now , Mr. Chairman , " said he , " turn from these scenes of triumph to ourselves  --  to the American Executive and cabinet . What were they doing whilst Hungary was sending her money to Venice and preparing to march to the relief of that republic ? What did they or the President 's agent in Europe do , whilst the Sultan , yes , the Sultan , was openly expressing his sympathies for Hungary ? What did they do whilst even the autocrat of Turkey was loudly protesting against the march of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Nothing , nothing . No kind protest or recognition fell from their lips . With tomb-like silence they listened to the burning appeal of Hungary , whilst the grave of Washington spoke louder than his LiVING MODEL . The voice of the dead was heard even above that of the living. ** Mx . BUEL contended that the prayer of Austria for help , and the Russian intervention , with an army of about 200,000 men , both admitted the triumph of Hungary , as well as her ability to maintain her independence ; that the question of independence was solely one between Hungary and Austria , and that now was the time , when the independence of the former should have been recognized ; and that such recognition ought not , according to the message of the President , he held contingent upon the establishment , by Hungary , of a " permanent " government . This view Mr. B. sustained by referring to the South American , Mexican , Greek , Texan and French republics ; fortifying it further , by appealing to our own conduct in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and obtained a // recognition of our independence before we had achieved many victories , and in fact before we had really passed its threshold . He next ridicules the doctrines put forth in the ruanifestoes of the Austrian and Russian Emperors against the revolutionists , and exposes in detail the ambitious purposes and progress of Russia , and the disastrous consequences to the liberty of Europe involved in the conquest of Hungary . Said he : " Wherever Austria is in Europe , there henceforth is Russia , and the influence of the latter must now be felt in Germany , Venice , Lombardy , and the Roman States . One short step over Germany will place her upon the banks of the Rhine ; one , over Sardinia , at the foot of the Alps . This is the result of Russian intervention in the Hungarian struggle , but not the whole result . " Finally , Mr. B. answers most triumphantly the objections , if any , that could have been brought against the recognition of Hungary , at the time of her triumph over Austria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why should we limit the blessings of popular freedom to our own hemisphere ? The republican principle knows no mountain , river , or ocean boundary . It traversed the ocean more than two centuries since , and found a home on the icy coast of New-England . It has worked out here its legitimate effects . It came to us from the Old World ; and now let it return , to work out its legitimate effects there. , ' During the late session , Mr. Buel devoted much time and attention to the commercial interests of the lakes , collecting new and interesting statistics on the subject , and exposing the immense commerce of the great northern valley of the lakes . His views and investigations upon this subject may be found in his speech on " Northwestern Defence , " and his elaborate report of " Views , " on the interesting national question of the free navigation of the St. Lawrence-which was presented to the House in May last . This document has attracted the general notice of the press , and tended much to arouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this report , Mr. B. fully proves our right to the free navigation of the river St. Lawrence , under the laws of nature and of nations , discussing at length the whole subject with great acuteness and ability . He showed himself by this effort , master of the question , displaying a familiarity with the laws of nations bearing upon it , as well as a careful examination of the international treaties of Europe , which , in like cases , provide for the free navigation of its navigable rivers . That this measure will yet be accomplished , there is but little doubt . England desires reciprocal trade between the Canadas , Nova Scotia and New-Brunswick , and the United States* but in the debate which ensued upon the introdtiction of his report , Mr. B. , intent upon the accomplishment of his favorite scheme , at once boldly took the ground , and declared , that the United States , in granting reciprocity of trade with the British colonies , ought to insist upon a simultaneous recognition by England of our right to the free navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition was taken , yet it manifestly received the general favor of the House , as the true ground ; and , if adhered to , it will , sooner or later , give success to the measure of free navigation . A recent number of the London Times takes strong ground in favor of Mr. Buel 's position , in a lengthy and leading editorial upon the subject . It substantially // adopts his views , and concedes to him the argument . The writer has been favore4 with the perusal of private letters from London , showing that the subject will probably be brought before Parliament at its next session by Lord Palmerston , and copies of Mr. Bud 's report have beca sent for , to be placed in the hands of every member of Parliament . The American Minister , Mr. Lawrence , has spoken in high terms of this document ; and , it is understood , is interesting himself in the measure . Thus are Mr. B. 's efforts already producing valuable fruits . On the 14th of June , Mr. Buel also made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French spoliations , committed on American commerce prior to September 30 , 1800  --  a question involving property to the amount of millions , and an intimate knowledge of the early history and treaties of the Government . His argument was , in brief , that the claims for these spoliations were admitted by France ; that she presented counter-claims for violations of our early treaties with her , whereby , to use his own words , " WE HAD PREFERRED OUR OLDEST ENEMY TO OUR OLDEST FRIEND , and that these counter-claims were admitted on the part of the United States ; that by the Convention of 1800 , these , claims and counter-claims were mutually released or set oW and thus the claims of the citizens of the United States were appropriated to pay her debts to France . In this view of the case , Mr. B. was fortified by the opinion of Mr. Madison , when Secretary of State , and also by the opinions of Mr. Webster , Mr. Everett , Mr. Edward Livingston , and many others of like distinction , who had preceded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25th of June , the bill for granting land to the soldiers of our various wars being under discussion , Mr. Bud , in a short speech , most eloquently advocated its passage . Said he : " I know of none who are more justly entitled to share in the mere liberality of the Government , than the soldier , who offers his life in the defence of his country ; who perils health , and all that is dear to him , for the protection of those who , shunning the battle-field , remain quietly and safely at their homes . " In this speech , Mr. B. particularly advocated the adoption of an amendment , whereby the benefits of the bill would extend to those who might have been prevented from serving the minimum period of six months , provided for in the bill , by having been captured as prisoners , and discharged on condition of not serving again during the war . This amendment was intended to apply to the case of many who had served gallantly on the Northwestern frontier , in the war of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to " do equal justice to those who , WHILST ENDURING THE SOLDIER ' S TRIALS , WERE PREVENTED FROM REAPING THE SOLDIER ' S REWARD. ** On the 31st of July , Mr. Bud made the last speech of any considerable length delivered by him during the 1st session of the 31st Congress , which was upon " Northwestern Defence "  --  the Fortification Bill being under . consideration in committee of the whole . The bill contained a small item of appropriation to complete Fort Wayne , near Detroit . A motion had been made to strike this item out of the bill , and , pending the discussion , a very sweeping and denunciatory attack had been made upon it , reflecting in the severest terms upon Detroit-its history , and the character of its people . Being disinclined to engage in a controversy of a personal nature , Mr. B. yet felt it would be unjust to himself , as well // as his constituents , were he to remain silent . This speech was characterized throughout for its manly and elevated bearing towards hIs assailant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill . Mr. B. was peculiarly happy in one of his allusions to the city he represents . Turning to the honorable member whose attack he was repelling , he remarked : " Is he so ignorant as not to know , or so regardless of political ancestry as not to care to know , that Detroit can claim for itself an honor which but few cities can claim-an honor which was claimed by primitive ATHENS , that of being a mother-city , THE MOTHER-cITY or THE NORTHWEST ? Was it not to this point that the earliest emigration of the Northwest was directed ? Was it not at this point , where the waves of civilization first touched the Northwest , as they gradually swept over the continent ? - one entering the St. Lawrence , followed its waters upward to Detroit , bearing upon its bosom such men as Hennepin , Charlevoix , and Lahontan ; whilst another moved on from Plymouth Rock , with such spirits as Winslow , Brewster , Standish , and Carver , who , or whose descendants at a later period , met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined in hand , and heart with heart , they long sent forth their children , as from a fruitful mother , to subdue and populate the wilds of the Northwest . And , sir , let me add , that her distinction is reflected upon the State to which she belongs . Her houor of a mother city gives to Michigan the honor of a MOTHER-STATE IN THE NORTHWEST-I mean in regard to its primitive settlement and civilization . " We have thus alluded to the most prominent occasions when Mr. Bud appeared before the House . He was always , however , attentive to its general business , and especially to measures of local interest to his constituents , and ever ready to speak when , and only when occasion seemed to require it . In the settlement of the great slavery question , he was one of the most active and influential among the newly elected members . He advocated the passage of all the peace measures of that eventful session , and voted for all , save the Utah bill , for which he would have cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without making speeches upon them , he openly avowed his opinions , and they were as well known in advance as those of any other member . At his own election , about 3,000 votes had been given for the candidate of the Abolition party , and about 10,000 votes in his State had been given for the Presidential candidate of the same party ; yet Mr. Bud feared not responsibility , and his was the only vote in the House , from Michigan , recorded in favor of those bills  --  the California Bill excepted . One of the recent public testimonials with which Mr. Buel has been honored , was his recent appointment as orator before the alumni of Middlebury College , upon the occasion of their late semi-centennial celebration . This occurred on the 21st day of August , 1850-just half a century since the founding of that institution , and twenty years from the day of his graduation . The circumstances of the occasion , being of extraordinary interest , called together the alumni of the college from every part of the Union . During their meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their final gathering at the festive board , Mr. Buel presided . His address fully sustained his reputation as a scholar and orator . On the 2d October last , Mr. B. was unanimously renominated for Congress , viva voce , on the first vote-so marked an approval of his course in Congress seemed to render his election a certainty . On the 4th October , Mr. Penniman was nominated by the Whigs , without any expectation of // his election . Five days afterwards , a fugitive slave was arrested at Detroit under the recent law . The negroes , incited by the Abolitionists , armed themselves for resistance , and it was deemed necessary to call out the military , to suppress disturbance and sustain the laws ; all this led to great excitement . The Abolitionists , who had as yet made no nomination , seized upon it , and obtained a written pledge from Mr. Penniman to an absolute repeal of the law , which led , for the first time in the district , to a union between the Whigs and Abolitionists . This eventuated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote as in 1848 , and carried *Detroit , the city of his residence , by the largest majority ever before given for any candidate . Though defeated , Mr. Bud has lost none of the confidence and popularity which have heretofore sustained him . The Democracy of the State seem more attached to him than ever , and his late defeat may yet prove his greatest fortune . A large number of his political friends , just prior to his departure for Washington , tendered him a public dinner , in which many prominent Whigs of Detroit participated , as a token of their approval of his course in sustaining the Union and the Constitution . The dinner was attended by many of the most distinguished men in the State . To the sentiment proposed in honor of the course pursued by Mr. B. in sustaining the compromise and other prominent measures of the session , he responded in a speech of about an hour 's length , and concluded with the following noble sentiment- " THE UNION WA5 BORN BY FRATERNITY , AND IT MUST LIVE BY FRATERNITY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech he was presented by the committee of arrangements with a copy of the Constitution of the United States , neatly printed on parchment , and bearing the following iuscription : - " Presented to HON. ALEXANDER W. BUEL , REPRESENTATIVE in the 3lsT CONGRESS , R5 a testimonial of regard for his consistent support in CONGRESS of the CONSTITUTION of his COUNTRY , at a PUBLIC DINNER given to him by his fellow-citizens at DETROIT , November 19 , 1850 . " In concluding this sketch , we ksire to refer to its subject as he is seen in every day life , by those who best know him . Mr. Bud , in stature , is of medium size , slender form , in his motions quick and easy , and in bearing and language dignified and impressive . In the presence of strangers he is exceedingly reserved and modest , whilst he delights in the society of his friends and acquaintances , and amongst them he is ever frank and conversational . In disposition , cheerfulness is largely developed ; and although his countenance often bears an expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is always lighted by a smile . He enjoys much the pleasures of society ; but his habits of study allow him few* opportunities for such enjoyment . In his deportment he is unassuming ; and in manners , simple , familiar , and gentlemanly . As a companion , he is agreeable ; as a friend , firm and true ; as a man , characterized for his high integrity both in private and public life ; and as a philanthropist , his heart is never closed against the good of his fellow man . His continuous studiousness is constantly enlarging the reservoir of his knowledge , and strengthening his intellect . Few men of his years possess more friends , and none those , who have adhered with greater constancy and devotion . His friends , once gained , have seldom forsaken him . Such has , thus far , been the brilliant course of Mr. Bud , and it plainly points to one still more brilliant in the future .                 @ @ @ @
