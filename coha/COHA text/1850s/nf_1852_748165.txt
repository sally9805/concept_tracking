txt /q/ kinds of industry . 4 . And , lastly , every individual , in each of these departments of human industry , will retain some portion of the product which he has created , but which he is ready to part with for something else . The farmer has grain , which he has raised ; the manufacturer , cloth , which he has fabricated ; the merchant , commodities , which he has imported or bought for sale . These form another item of capital . THIRD . Of the changes which Capital undergoes . From what has been already said , it is evident , that capital derives its value from labor , and that the effect of labor exerted , is to produce some change in it . Hence , capital , in every industrious country , must be always undergoing changes ; and hence , also , it frequently re-appears , in forms very , different from those in which it at first existed . The form , however , is of no /z/ consequence , if a superior value be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks only at an augmentation , either of the amount , or of the degree of value . 1 . The material undergoes changes . The seed and manures of the farmer are changed into vegetables , and these again into the grain of the iiarvest . The cotton and wool of the manufacturer are changed into the fabrics which he produces . The wood and nails of the carpenter are changed into houses . The commodities of the merchant undergo changes . He exports cotton , rice , wheat , or manufactures ; and imports calicoes , silks , wine , hardware , &c.; 2 . The instruments. , or machinery , employed by these several classes of persons , undergo changes . These several instruments , in the course of production , are gradually destroyed , or consumed . The plough and cart , and animals of the farmer , the tools of the mechanic , the machinery of the manufacturer , and the ships and vehicles of the merchant , are worn out and rendered worthless . But if they have been profitably used , they have re-appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the various objects upon which they have been employed . 3 . The various kinds of food , clothing , and shelter , necessary for the existence and comfort of the human being , are also changed . They are consumed , from time to time , and their value re-appears , in that new vigor imparted to his body and mind , which forms a fresh capital , to be employed again in the work of production . 4 . And lastly : The mature product of every laborer is constantly changing . As soon as he has created a product , he is anxious to dispose of it to some one else , that he may invest its increased value in some other material which he may again , with increased advantage , unite with industry . As soon as the farmer has raised grain or fat cattle , he wishes to dispose of them , that he may invest their value again in seed , or manure , or agri- /z/ cultural improvements . As soon as the manufacturer has finished his fabric , he exchanges it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and so of the merchant , and of every other laborer . We see , then , that capital is undergoing perpetual changes , and that the course of these changes is constantly from a state of less , tjo a state of greater value ; that is from a state more remotely adapted to the gratification of human desire , to a state less remotely adapted to it ; and that so soon as it has become precisely adapted to this gratification , its change ceases , and it is consumed in some mode or other . And if it be profitably consumed it again re-appears in some form adapted to create a further increase of the means of enjoyment . And hence we see , that , that country is the most prosperous which is the most rapidly accumulating , by the results of its labor , the greatest amount of these ultimate products , in proportion to the number of its inhabitants . The greater the share of these products which falls to the lot of each individual , the greater are the means of physical happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all these changes which we have considered , it is always to be remarked , that there is , in the very act of change , a destruction of value . He who changes iron into steel , consumes the iron , destroys that particular value and creates another in its place . He who sows wheat , destroys the value of that wheat , for food ; and he who spins cotton , destroys the value of cotton wool as cotton wool . That is , neither of these substances can ever be used again for the purposes to which they were before adapted . If , however , the industry of the laborer have been skilfully directed , the product will have acquired an exchangeable value sufficient to replace the original material in additional quantity , and also to repay him for his labor , and pay the interest of his capital . The amount of difference between the exchangeable value of his original material , together with his labor , and the exchangeable value of his product , is his profit . The annual amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The annual amount of these profits in a nation , is the gross national revenue . It is obvious , that it matters not in what form capital re-appears , if it only re-appear in a form bearing a greater exchangeable value . The smith exchanges gold or silver for coal ; he burns up his coal , and nothing is left but ashes But it has produced an invisible substance , called caloric , by means of which he has be*en able to give such an increased value to iron , as will not only replace his gold and silver , but also the iron itself , and will also pay him for his labor . The farmer exchanges his gold or silver for manure , but this manure will so increase his harvest , that he will be able to replace his gold and silver , and also be abundantly repaid for his labor . The principle is the same , in all cases of change of capital . It matters not into what we change our capital , nor how valuable the substance may be that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater amount of exchangeable value , or that which will procure for us a greater amount of objects of desire . We see , hence , in what manner nations and individuals grow rich . It is by uniting the industry of this year to the capital of last year , and by this process , creating an augmentation of capital . This augmentation will be either greater or less , in proportion as our industry has been successful in giving additional value to that value which previously existed . If we destroy a value , and produce another only equal to it , we lose our labor . If we destroy a value , and re-produce nothing , we lose both labor and capital . It is only as the value created is superior to the value of labor and capital consumed , that we are enriched . Hence we see , that wealth is acquired by small , but oft repeated accumulations . The gross amount of these accumulations will be decided by our skill and industry . But , as from this amount our various expenditures must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our skill and industry , but also on our frugality . Though a man fiarn much , yet , if he spend all , he will grow no richer . Hence , industry and frugality are the great sources of wealth /z/ Nor is this the less true of nations . Hence it is , that wars , unnecessarily expensive governments , or high taxes for whatever purpose , may keep the most enterprising and industrious nation always poor . FIFTH . Of Productive and Unproductive Capital . Productive capital is that , which , being in any manner united with industry , is in the process of augmentation . Unproductive capital is that , which , not being united with industry , remains , at the end of the year , just the same as it was at the beginning . Money at interest , capital undergoing the various transformations effected by industry , tilled land , and manufactories in operation , are productive capital . Money lying in coffers , materials unsaleable , manufactories unoccupied , and land lying waste , are unproductive capital . When capital is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , annually , its ordinary rate of interest ; because it must have been purchased with that which would have yielded that interest . Hence it is , that every sound economist is anxious to have the whole of his capital productively invested . He who acts otherwise , is ignorant of the principles of production , indolent , or slovenly . The farmer who allows a heap of manure to lie in his farm yard for a year , instead of spreading it on his land ; the merchant who allows his ships to He idle , OF his goods to be scattered , unsold , over several warehouses ; or the manufacturer who owns twice as much machinery as he is able to employ , are annually losing all the accumulation which thi capital , properly invested , would produce . And still more , as we have seen that all gains arise from small and successive accumulations , and as almost every product . E liable to waste , it is manifest that habitual negligence of this sort must greatly diminish , if it do not entirely consume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort of every man should be , to unite every fraction of his capital with industry , and to keep it so united , continually . Any gain , even the smallest , is better than no gain at all . From what has been said , it is evident that the pro- /z/ cess of accumulation , in all branches of production , is the same . It will also appear , that where capital is free , that is , where there are no restrictions upon the use of it , there can be no great permanent difference in the rate of accumulation , between the different modes in which it is employed . If the profits of one kinci of business are above the average rate , other capital will flow into that channel . If the profit in any branch of production be below the ordinary rate , capital will be withdrawn from it . If commerce be unusually lucrative , men will leave other pursuits , and devote themselves to commerce , until , by competition , they reduce the profits to the ordinary rate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until , by the reduction of the supply of commercial facilities , the rate of profit is increased . Rates of profit can not be rendered permanently unequal in any other manner , than by oppressive legislation . The differences in profit , in the various departments of industry , are , therefore , more apparent than real . When profit is sure , it is of course less than when it is uncertain . But , how much soever individual cases may differ , it will be found that the average is , for long periods , very nearly equal . SIXTH . Of Fixed and Circulating Capital . The capital from which the owner derives profit only by exchanging its form or place , is circulating capital . Thus , the wares of the merchant , the products of the manufacturer , the harvest of the farmer , are circulating capital . On the other hand , the instruments which each of these producers uses , in performing his various operations , are fixed capital . Such are the ships and warehouses of the one , the machines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the third . Circulating capital is , in general , that which is already prepared for the gratification of human desire , or that which is in a course of preparation for this state . Fixed capital , in general , consists of the instruments , or fixtures , which , in some form or other , assist us in accomplishing this result . Tools , machinery , houses , ships , /z/ roads , canals , and improvements on farms , &c.,; are fixed capital . Circulating capital is in general rapidly consumed . It is commonly an annual product , and subject to an annual consumption . Fixed capital is not an annual product , and may last for a year , a lifetime , or indefinitely . It is , however , still liable to gradual decay , which decay must be replaced , or else the possessor would find himself growing poorer , inasmuch as these tools and machinery are the means by which his labor is rendered productive . The amount of fixed capital employed in some branches of industry , is much greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed capital than a cheap set of tools . Others , as large manufacturing establishments , require a large fixed investment . In proportion to the amount which must be thus employed , will be the amount of accumulated property necessary to be possessed by him who wishes to employ himself in that particular department of industry . Sometimes , by far the greater part of the investment is fixed capital , and it is also very great in amount . In this case , it is frequently apportioned among individuals , who each subscribe and pay a part of the cost . Such is the case with railroads , canals , and works of public improvement generally . There is an obvious tendency in the nature of things , to convert circulating , into fixed capital . As circulating capital is annually consumed , it must be annually replaced , or mankind , after the first year , would all perish It is replaced by the annual productions of the earth , either vegetable , animal , or mineral . But , if the industry of man has been successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only to supply the ordinary wants of the producers , and to repair the waste and wear of fixed capital , but also to leave a surplus unappropriated . Now , as this kind of capital is annual , and as it is also perishable , if it be not used in some way , this surplus must be a total loss . If it be appropriated to the multiplication of annual capital , it will only increase that surplus , which is already too /z/ great . Hence , it can be usefully employed only in the creation of fixed capital . To accomplish this result , it is offered in the form of wages , to mechanics , artisans , and those persons who employ themselves in the manufacture of those articles , in which fixed capital consists . Hence , the wages of this class of persons will rise , and a portion of them will be drawn from the production of circulating capital . This might at first be supposed to diminish the amount of circulating capital . Such would be the result , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fixed capital , is to enable us to create circulating capital , with a less amount of labor . A society , in which a part of the members are demoted to the making of useful machines , will create a greater amount of annual products , than one in which all are devoted exclusively to the creation of annual products . Thus , in a short time , the annual surplus is greater than before , and a greater number of persons is employed in creating fixed capital , and that kind of fixed capital , which involves , in its creation , a greater amount of expense . ' It is thus that a society , age after age , grows rich , and each successive race of men leaves the world better provided with the means of production , than it found it . This may all be illustrated , by a few very familiar instances . A savage , who obtains peltry by his bow and arrows , having provided for the food and clothing of his family , will , if he be industrious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would naturally exchange his surplus for a rifle ; a kind of fixed capital , by nqeans of which , his circulating capital would be greatly increased . This increase of capital would enable him , besides procuring better clothes and more numerous conveniences , to add to his fixed capital by purchasing a horse , or a plough , or by erecting a house . These , in their turn , would augment his circulating capital ; and thus , with every year , his fixed and circulating capital would steadily increase . Hence , very soon , there would arise a demand for the services of men who employed themselves in creating fixed , instead of circulating capital . That is , mechanical arts would be prac- /z/ tised ; and the artisans would be , as we find that in such a state of society they always are , exorbitantly paid for their labor . Again : Suppose a farmer to enter upon new and untilled land . His first care is to produce the necessities of life , for himself and his family . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor to the creation of fixed , instead of annual capital : that is , he erects fences , purchases with his produce carts and animal , builds barns and outhouses , and thus renders his farm a much more productive instrument than before . With his increasing surplus he purchases additional land , if he needs it , and brings it all into such a state of cultivation as he thinks desirable . By all these means , his annual surplus is rendered greater , and he is enabled to extend the amount of his fixed capital , by building a better house , purchasing better ploughs , harrows , carts , and various machines by which his future labor will be rendered more productive . But we see that this could not be done by the farmers of a neighborhood , unless some portion of them abandoned farming , and devoted themselves to the creation of fixed capital . There would , therefore , arise a great demand for mechanical labor . And as there would hence arise the necessity for a great number of exchanges , some portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , must become merchants . In this manner , circulating capital first gives rise to fixed capital , and fixed capital increases again the amount of circulating capital ; and thus they go on , year after year , mutually augmenting each other . Thus also the merchant , whose business it is to augment the exchangeable value of a given amount of circulating capital by transportation and exchange , produces , by his operations , an annual surplus . This he adds to his former capital , for a while , but soon purchases fixed capital , such as ships , &c.,; to facilitate his operations . When he has enough of these , and as large an amount of circulating capital as he wishes to employ , he then begins to invest his surplus either in some per- /z/ manent works of public improvement , as bridges , roads , canals , or in something , which , besides facilitating the productiveness of the society , will also yield him a revenue , or else he employs it in manufactures , according to the condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has been remarked above , we may easily see the natural course which a nation takes , in the progressive accumulation of wealth . Its first productions are , circulating , or annual capital ; the products of the field , of the forest , or of the ocean . Next follow improvement m permanent conveniences , and the construction of instruments for agricultural production ; then the exchange of its own products for other circulating capital , or for the annual necessaries of life ; and then the exchange for fixed capital of the most necessary kind . Thus , the Dutch , on their first settlement in this country , used to import their bricks from Holland . Commerce being thus commenced with an older country , the colonists soon engage in it themselves , and invest a large portion of their annual surplus in ships . Before manufactures had commenced in this country , previously to the Revolution , the commerce of the colonies had become already extensive . All these changes prepare the way for the investment of capital in manufactures , which , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when that time arrives , they will be established , without the aid of legislative enactment , and according to the very laws by which accumulation is governed . From what has been remarked , we also see that the advantages which we enjoy over savage nations result , principally , from the possession of a greater amount of fixed capital ; or , in other words , the permanent results of pre-exerted industry . That advantage consists in this , that this capital , besides affording to its owners the ordinary rate of profit , enables men to produce at a much cheaper rate ; that is , at a less expense of labor . Thus , a cotton factory , besides affording a fair profit to the owner , enables him to do , by one hour 's labor , what would otherwise require the labor of days or of weeks /z/ By all this difference , therefore , we have the advantage over savages , or over those who went before us . Hence , a nation , which does not possess the results , of preexerted industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to avail itself of those of other countries. * Hence , we also see the reason why the traffic between savage and civilized nations is so greatly in favor of the latter . The latter are enabled to offer in barter that which is of inestimable value to the savage , but which the civilized man can produce with a very small portion of labor . An axe would cost a savage the labor of weeks or of months , while a smith in New England would make it in a few hours . Hence , it is not wonderful that the one should be willing to give for it vastly more than it costs the other . And , on the other hand , the commodities of the savage are of very little value to him , but of high value to the mechanic or artisan . Hence , the gain to him also is great . An Indian who exchanges peltry , which is worth in New York fifty or one hundred dollars , for a rifle , powder , and bullets , has improved his condition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunsmith , who has made so exorbitant a profit . SEVENTH . Of Money . It will be observed that , thus far , I have not mentioned money as an item of capital . Although this is not the place in which to treat of the functions of money , yet it may be proper here to add a single remark concerning it . Money forms but a very small part of the capital of any country . Every one may easily judge of this , from his own observation . How very small a portion of any one 's possessions is in money . And if this be true of every individual separately , it must be true of all the individuals collectively . * Or , in other words , as it is well expressed by Mr. Carey , in his late work on this subject ; the quality as well as the quantity of labor , enters into the account , whenever we speak of the exchangeable value of the products which it has created . The quality of lbor is always in proportion to the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sole use of money , is to facilitate exchanges . It is an instrument for the saving of labor , and for the performing of labor with greater accuracy . Of this , any one may convince himself in a moment , if he will imagine two cases , in the one of which he was obliged to make several exchanges without money , and the other in which he could make them with it . Money gains nothing by exchange , but rather loses in value y like every other machinery which is worn out while it accomplishes its object . Hence , it belongs to the class of fixed capital . It is subject to slow wear , which must be replaced out of the circulating capital of the country . And , hence , as any country may have a greater amount of any particular kind of fixed capital than it needs , as , for instance , of any particular kind of machinery ; and as , when this is the case , it sends it abroad , or in other words , makes it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so is it with money . If a country has more money than is sufficient to accomplish its exchanges , it sends it abroad , and receives back something that it needs more . Such is , permanently , the case in mining countries ; and such is , at times , the condition of almost every commercial nation . /z/ HAVING , in the previous chapter , explained the nature and changes of Capital , we now proceed to treat of Industry . In doing this , we shall consider : 1st . The different objects of Human Industry ; 2d . The forms of Human Industry ; and , 3d . The modes by which the productive power of Human Industry may be increased . /z/ It has been seen , in the previous chapter , that the increase of capital ; that is , the means of physical happiness to man , can be effected only by producing change , of some kind , in capital . But it is evident that this change can not be produced without labor , since no valuable change is spontaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to produce some valuable change in capital . Now , the changes , which may be produced in the substances of nature , may all be reduced to three ; change in the elementary form , change in the aggregate form , and change in place . To effect one or the other of these , all valuable human labor is directed . 1 . Man may change the elementary form of matter . The farmer , by means of seed , manure , and cultivation , /z/ aided by the agencies of the sun and the earth , of rain , and the atmosphere , transforms the elementary forms of carbon , gases , and water , into wheat . The chemist changes the elementary forms of acids and alkalies into salts . The dyer changes the elementary forms of iron and tannin into coloring matter ; and the case is the same with the various other forms of human occupation . 2 . Man may change the aggregate form of matter . The cabinet-maker changes the form of a board into that of a desk or a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse-shoe or a nail ; the mason changes a pile of bricks and mortar into a wall ; the cotton spinner , a bale of cotton into thread ; the weaver , this thread into cloth . And , in general , the labor of mechanics and manufacturers is employed in effecting changes in the . aggregate forms of matter . 3 . Man may change the place of matter . Thus , the shipmaster transports a cargo of cotton from New York to Liverpool , and brings back a cargo of cotton goods , of crockery , or of hardware . The teamster receives a wagon load of merchandise in one town , and transports it to another . The owner of a canal boat receives manufactured goods in Albany , transports them to Buffalo , and brings back to Albany , in return , a freight of agricultural produce . The agent of a railroad receives a hundred boxes of merchandise in Manchester , and transports them to Liverpool . And thus , also , a large number of the inhabitants of every populous town derive their subsistence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchandise from one part of the town to another . These divisions , in general , correspond with the agricultural , mechanical , and commercial departments of human industry . I have adopted a different terminology , because it seems to me to form a more generic and better limited division , and one more conformable to the facts in the case . 1 . Concerning these divisions , it is proper to remark , that , though these are the various objects of human in- /z/ industry , yet it frequently happens that , he who labors in one , is also obliged to labor in one or both of the others Thus , the farmer who raises a crop , is obliged to transport the seed to the field , and frequently to transport his harvest to market . The cabinet-maker who manufactures a table , may transport his materials from the lumber yard . The engineer , on the railroad , is obliged to change the elementary form of wood , in order to produce the caloric , necessary to move his locomotive . We designate the class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate object which he has in view , in exercising his profession . 2 . Each one of these forms of industry is equally important in conferring intrinsic value upon substances ; that is , in giving them capacity to gratify human desire . Thus we see that the ore in the mine has no power to gratify desire , until it is made into iron or steel . The steel is valueless for the purpose of cutting , until it is transformed into a knife , an axe , or some cutting instrument ; and , if I want to make a pen in New York , a knife is utterly valueless to me for this purpose , while it remains in Sheffield or Liverpool . Unless these several values are all conferred upon it , it would be of no service to me . Hence , in purchasing a knife , I pay for them all , and as willingly for one as the other . 3 . Hence we see how incorrect is the notion sometimes advanced , that all wealth is the production of one or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . All these changes must be effected in almost every article which we consume , and if either of them were to be suspended , our desires would not be gratified , and the other two must also be discontinued . He who transports flour , performs an act of as essential importance to the sustentation of the human race , as he who raises wheat . He who brings a knife from Liverpool to me , performs a labor as important to me , as he who manufactures the knife ; for , if it were three thousand miles off , it might , for all the purposes for which I want it , as well not be in existence . And yet more , if one of these forms of labor should cease , the others must soon cease /z/ with it . Of what value would wheat or wool be to the farmer , if they could not be transported from his farm ? And again : what gain could be derived from either , if there were no means of grinding the one , or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of industry mutually support , and are supported by , each other ; and hence , also , we see that any jealousy between different classes of producers , or any desire on the one part , to obtain special Advantages over the other , are unwise , and , in the end , self-destructive . The fact is , that if left to themselves , they all flourish , and they all suffer together . Nor can either one be depressed , for any considerable period , without injuriously affecting both the others . These various forms of human industry enter , in different degrees , into the value of different articles of use . For instance , butchers ' meat and green vegetables derive almost their whole value from the first kind of labor , as they require very little modification , and will bear but short transportation . On the contrary , salted provisions may derive a large portion of their value from change of place . Clothing , cutlery , and what are commonly denominated manufactures , derive the greater portion of their value from change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , but a small part of their price , and , not being of great bulk , their transportation is not very expensive . The steel that would make a pair of razors , and the cost of transporting them from Sheffield or Paris to New York , would form but a very small portion of their price . On the contrary , bulky articles , such as coal and iron , derive a very large portion of their cost from transportation . Coal , that has scarcely any exchangeable value in the coal mines of Pennsylvania , is sold for " eight or ten dollars a ton in Providence . And all the labor employed upon it , is that which is necessary for breaking it in pieces , and removing it from its bed to the house of the consumer . As , however , the human race is scattered over the face of the globe , and as their wants in all latitudes are /z/ so nearly the same , while no country affords facilities for supplying more than a very small number of these wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of place must , in civilized countries , be most universal , and must enter essentially into the greatest number of commodities . Of this every one will be convinced , who will take any article of dress , of furniture or of food , and consider the amount of transportation that has entered into its production ; and , specially , if he take into account the transportation which has entered into the formation of the instruments , by which it had been produced . The same truth is also illustrated by the fact , that whole nations , with very small natural advantages , as Holland and Venice , have , in a short period , become immensely rich , merely by conferring change of place on the merchandise and productions used by other nations . Water communication , in the early stages of society , greatly diminishes the cost of transportation , and , of course , increases the facilities of exchange . It is on this account , that the first settlements of nations are always either on the shores of the ocean , , or along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of remark , that , thus far , in the progress of society , the ingenuity of man has been more successful in devising means for increasing the productiveness of labor in the second and third , than in the first kind of human industry . Improved agricultural utensils , a better knowledge of the nature of soils , and of the different kinds of grain and edible vegetables , and of manures have added considerably to the quantity of product . that can be raised by a given amount of labor . But this increase bears no sort of proportion to that effected by the use of the machinery in the case of the cotton manufacturer , and by the use of the locomotive and many other forces . It is , doubtless , wisely ordered that it should be so . Agricultural labor is the most healthy employment , and is attended by the fewest temptations . It has , therefore , seemed to be the will of the Creator that a large portion of the human race should always be thus employed , and that , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men required for tilling the earth should never be essentially diminished . It is also to be remarked , that division of labor , which so greatly increases the productiveness of human industry in the other modes of production , can be applied but in a small degree to agriculture . No man- can devote himself exclusively to ploughing , sowing , or reaping ; because only a small part of the year can be employed in either of these occupations . The farmer must , therefore , practise them all , at different times ; and , of course , every farmer must be able to perform not one , but all the several operations required in his trade . This forms another reason why the increase of productiveness of human industry , in this department of labor , has not kept pace with that which has been witnessed in manufactures and commerce . /z/ Industry is any form of human exertion employed in the creation of value . This , of course , includes exertion , both of body and of mind . The object of industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort ; since change is necessary , either to the creation or to the increase of intrinsic value , and is always necessary to the existence of exchangeable value . We have also seen that all the changes which human industry can effect in matter , may be reduced to three , namely : Change in elementary form ; change in aggregate form ; and change in place . But when man puts forth exertion to effect change , it is not any change at random , but some specific change which he has directly in view . Were it otherwise , his labor would be worse than useless , and , like the effort THk FORMS OF HUMAN INDUSTRY . 49 of a maniac or an idiot , would , in nine times out of ten , destroy , instead of creating value . It is also evident , that the changes which can be effected in matter , are not produced at random , but in obedience to certain laws . If we wish to kindle a fire , it is not any kind of effort that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of combustion . If we wish to raise wheat , it is not every kind of labor that will do it , , but labor exerted in obedience to the laws of vegetation . And so , in general , if we wish to effect either of the three kinds of change mentioned above , we must act in obedience to those laws of the Creafor , to which this kind of change has been subjected . Again : Supposing the laws of nature , in respect to a particular change to be known , it is also necessary to know , the manner in which they may most successfully be applied to the accomplishment of a particular result . The laws of combustion and of gravitation may be known , and yet a very important effort of human ingenuity may be required , before we ascertain the best method of so applying them as to be able to construct a good fireplace . The expansive power of steam was known long before a steam engine was invented ; and still longer before any application of it was devised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . And still further , a man may understand the general laws of physiology , and yet be unable to apply them to the cure of diseases . A man may understand the general principles of jurisprudence , and yet not know how to avail himself of them , in such a manner as to procure either defence from injury , or redress of grievance . But suppose this also to be known : it still remains for us to put those means into operation , by which , in obedience to the laws of nature , a given result may be accomplished . He who understands the laws of combustion and gravitation , and the mode of their application , may now set himself to work , according to these laws , and build a chimney . He who understands the laws of hydrostatics , and the mode of their application , may now set himself to work to build a boat . It is , howev-/z/ er , true that there would still be required a certain degree of skill and dexterity , before he could perform either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , in some way or other . This skill can be acquired only by practice ; and the power of acquiring i is , in general , veryuniversally bestowed upon men . From what has been said , it is evident that the industry of which man is capable , may assume three different forms , namely : Industry of discovery or investi gallon ; Industry of application or invention ; and Industry of operation . 1 . Industry , of Discovery or Investigation . Under this class of laborers , are to be comprehended those who discover the laws of nature , and those who make them known to mankind , after they have been discovered . Newton labored in this department , when he discovered the laws of gravitation , optics , and of the motions of the heavenly bodies ; Franklin , when he discovered the laws of electricity ; and Sir Humphrey Davy , when he discovered the alkaline bases , and the laws of their combination . The labor of each of these men was also of the same kind , when they made known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are called philosophers , belongs to this class . 2 . Industry of Invention or Application . It is very rarely that a simple law can be of any use , without some adjustment by which we may avail ourselves of its advantages . Hence , a very important department of human industry is that which teaches us how to make the application of the principle , so as to accomplish a particular purpose . Newton performed this labor when he invented the telescope ; Hadley , when , by means of the quadrant , he applied the laws of light to the measurement of angles ; Franklin , when he invented the conductor , or lightning rod ; Sir Humphrey Davy , when he invented the safety lamp ; and Fulton , when he invented thai modification of the steam engine , by which vessels may be propelled through the water . Under this class , I think , may also be comprehended professional labor , generally . The business of the cler- /z/ gyman is to teach us in what manner we may avail ourselves of the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avail ourselves of the laws of that civil society ' , of which we are the members . The physician teaches us how to obey the physiological laws under which we are created , so that we may be relieved from sickness , or preserved in health . 3 . To the third class of human industry belong all those w r ho put forth the physical effort necessary , in order to create the values desired . They are the laborers who produce those changes , either in elementary form , in aggregate form , or in place , of which we have already spoken , and they compose by far the most numer* ous class of society . It may here be remarked , that two of these forms of labor are frequently performed by the same person . For instance , he who discovers a law sometimes also teaches us how to apply it . Thus , as we have already shown , Sir Isaac Newton , Franklin , and Sir Humphrey Davy , were both discoverers and inventors ; that is , they performed both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second and the third are also frequently united ; that is , the individual who labors at a particular operation , also invents some machine by which a particular process in that operation is improved . Thus , Sir Richard Arkwright , a mechanic , invented the spinning machinery now in common use ; and , in general , many of our most important inventions have been made by operative laborers . And there can be no doubt that , if a knowledge of the laws of nature were more generally diffused throughout this class of society , the progress of invention would be inconceivably more rapid . I know of nothing which would tend so directly to the general improvement of the useful arts , as a wide* diffusion of the knowledge of principles among those whose business it is to employ those principles in their daily avocations . Although I have arranged the several forms of human industry in the above order , I by no means assert that this is the order in which they actually arise among men . The reverse is , on the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating , at first , the simplest forms of value , and those absolutely necessary to their actual existence . Still , in order to create these values , with certainty and with regularity , they must very soon have discovered , by exp*eriment , some rules by which the process must be conducted. , Men would very soon discover that stones would not ignite , and that a fire could not be kindled in a pool of water . As they advanced , by successive experiments , they invented tools , by which , without knowing why , they found themselves able to accomplish their purposes with less labor and with greater success . Thus , a man would construct a raft to transport himself and his property over a river , before he knew any thing of the laws of hydrostatics ; and he would employ a wedge , before he understood the doctrine of forces . The last labor required , is to ascertain the laws by which these changes are governed . As soon as this is done , a great improvement is at once effected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which otherwise would never have been suggested . Thus , a knowledge of the laws of combustion has greatly improved the construction of instruments for warming our houses . A knowledge of the laws of hydrostatics has greatly improved the construction of ships . And a knowledge of the laws of steam has given birth to all the machinery connected with the steam engine . And , it seems not too much to hope for , that the knowledge of the laws of nature will be yet so universally diffused , that invention shall almost cease to be the work of accident ; but , that , when an instrument is wanted , men will proceed to discover the law , and invent tho application , just as Sir Humphrey Davy proceeded , when he was requested to invent the safety lamp . /z/ 1 . The product of operative industry , is a change of form or of place in matter , by which its intrinsic and exchangeable value is increased . As the exertion of /z/ this labor confers its value , it gives to the laborer a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the matter on which it is exerted . This right is easily ascertained and enforced ; for the laborer may enforce it , by seizing either on the matter itself , or on such part of il as may be sufficient to satisfy his demand . 2 . The change , which is thus produced , could not be effected by a less amount of labor , than that which the laborer has exerted- If a man make a table with suitable skill , such a tabfe could not be made by any one else with a less degree of skill and a smaller amount of labor ; and hence , the cost of tables must , in the same place , and at the same time , be very much the same . Besides this , there is no power in tables to multiply themselves . Hence , the laborers in this or any other department , have a sort of monopoly of this kind of production , inasmuch as no one can produce it cheaper , and none but themselves can produce it as cheap . But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two kinds of labor . For , 1 . The product which the discoverer or inventor creates is immaterial . It is knowledge , or a change effected on mind , the immaterial part of man . By creating this change , a man does not acquire a right to the whole , or to any part of the substance , in which the value resides . The substance can not be appropriated , nor can it be divided ; and , were this possible , the laborer could make no use of it . Nor is the change one which is cognizable by the senses of others , but only by the consciousness of the person in whom it is wrought . Hence , this marks a broad distinction between this and the other forms of labor . 2 . Although the discovery of the laws by which the changes in matter are governed , may require the exercise of the most unusual talent , and may demand both protracted and most expensive labor ; yet these laws may be promulgated , after they are discovered , by men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law and reveal it to his neighbor , that is , create this change in his mind , his neighbor may create the same product /z/ in an hour , in the minds of a thousand persons , and each one of these in the minds of a thousand more . And specially , by means of the press , this power is multiplied indefinitely . There is therefore no ratio between the labor or skill necessary to create it , and that necessary to promulgate it after it has been discovered . Hence , he who first creates knowledge , has no means of monopolizing it ; nor can the exchangeable value be sustained , by the consideration that no one could create it , afterwards , with less labor . Hence , as the supply of the product can at any moment be inimitably increased , it very soon ceases to have any exchangeable value . From these reasons it will be seen , that the ordinary rules of supply and demand , and cost and labor , do not enter into view , when we speak of intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed rule . Nevertheless as immaterial products are of the greatest importance to the prosperity of a country , the Political Economist may point out the circumstances most favorable to their production , and the rule by which those who produce them should be remunerated . The above considerations are suggested , in order to explain , why Political Economy , so commonly , treats almost exclusively of material products . It may , however , be remarked , that civil society observing that immaterial products are necessary to the well being of a community , and that those who create them , are liable to remain altogether unpaid ; has frequently devised means by which some remuneration may be reaped from the exercise of this kind of industry . Such are the laws of copy , and of patent right . By the first of these , an author is allowed , for a limited time , the exclusive control over the publication of his work ; and by the other , the inventor is entitled to the exclusive control over the use of his invention . In this manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derive some portion of benefit from their productions . Were it otherwise , all their reward would consist in whatever of consideration they might obtain in the community , and in the gratification of benevolence from the /z/ consciousness of having improved the condition of their fellows . But , inasmuch as every other man , who is usefully employed , obtains these rewards also , and receives pecuniary advantage in addition , there is no rea son why the intellectual laborer should receive only the first , and be excluded altogether from the second . From what has been said , another difference between these two forms of product may be seen . The product of operative labor , being united with matter , and being limited in quantity and fixed in cost , may be exported to another country , and will command a correspondent amount of exchangeable value in the products of that country . Hence- , a nation may grow rich , either by agriculture , manufactures , or commerce . But this is not the case with immaterial products . We can not send abroad a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of material products . The smallest amount of knowledge , is capable of such indefinite multiplication , that the demand may be instantly supplied . Hence , a society composed solely of philosophers , or inventors , or professional men , would never grow rich , but must , if it performed no other labor , of necessity starve . Laborers of this class add greatly to the value of other labor , though their product , if no other were created , would be valueless in exchange . They may be compared to the steam in an engine , which , when it is combined with proper machinery , produces the most surprising results , but which , when left to itself , is dissipated into air . On the other hand , the separate parts of the machinery , though they might be of some use as raw material , yet , if the steam were withdrawn , would , immediately , become a mere mass of cumbersome and valueless lumber . Thus , we see that all the classes of laborers are mutually necessary to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should all be savages . Without the skill and labor of the mechanic , there would neither exist the opportunity of acquiring knowledge , nor would our knowledge , if acquired , be of any practical value . Nothing can , therefore , be more unreasona- /z/ ole than the prejudices which sometimes exist between these different classes of laborers , and nothing can be more beautiful , than their harmonious co-operation in every effort to increase production , and thus add to the conveniences and happiness of man . /z/ It is obvious , that if the capital and number of laborers be at any one period the same , the annual amount of product created will be as the amount of industry exerted . Were the laborers all sickly , so that they could work only for four hours a day , there would be but half as large a product created , as if they all labored for eight hours a day . If , by a palsy , they were all deprived of the use of one of their arms , a correspondent decrease of production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of their support remained the same , their ordinary power of labor could be doubled , there would be twice the usual amount of value created . And hence , in general , we see that , other things being equal , just in proportion as more labor is bestowed , the desires of every one are more fully gratified , that is , he grows richer ; and , on the contrary , as labor is diminished , the laborer suffers , or grows poorer . This result every one witnesses every day . Sick , aged , and idle people suffer , because they either do not , or can not , bestow the labor upon capital necessary to create an amount of product sufficient for their subsistence . But the physical power of man is extremely limited . There is an average amount of fatigue which a human being can undergo , which can rarely , and but for very short periods , be exceeded . If he be worked too hard , /z/ he sickens and dies ; and dies probably from being overworked more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , the whole physical power of man is employed upon the capital which he possesses , this may be considered the natural limit of human productiveness. 1 . But it is evident , that if by any means we could increase this power ten-fold , there would be a ten-fold increase of production . If we could , by any means , enable a man , with one day 's labor , to execute as much change in capital as he could before execute with ten days ' labor , there would be just ten times as many changes effected ; that is , ten times as much value created , and ten times as much product to be either enjoyed by himself , or to be exchanged for equivalent means of happiness . And , if the power of effecting changes be increased in other men in the same ratio , the product of the whole society will be increased in the same proportion . This is one of the effects produced by the use of natural agents ; and hence it is , that , ' just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is annually and rapidly improved . 2 . But this is not all . There are many values which are necessary to the happiness and even to the existence of man , which he could not create by his unassisted powers . Thus , he needs shelter , cooked food , and clothing . But he could not , with his teeth and nails , cut down a tree and fashion it into a cabin . He can not , by his hands , either cook his food , or manufacture a fabric suitable for clothing . All Jthese can , however , be done by other agents which he can command and control . Thus , iron can be made to cut down and fashion a tree , fire to cook his food , and a spinning wheel and loom can be made to furnish him with clothing . Thus we discover the second use of natural agents . They enable him to create values necessary to his existence , which ) without their aid , could never be produced . In this manner , an additional ' power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 . But this is not all . It is found that a man , by de- /z/ voting himself to one particular pursuit , is able to create a vastly greater amount of product in a given time , than he could create if he devoted himself to several pursuits . Hence , if there are ten products to be created , by ten men , they will in a given time create a vastly greater amount , if each man labors entirely upon one , than if each man labors upon them all . The product of the whole ten , therefore , by such a division of labor , will be greatly augmented . This is the third method by which the productiveness of human industry may be increased . We see , then , the modes in which the productive power of man may be exerted . 1 . Man may , unassisted , labor to the extent of his physical ability . 2 . He may multiply his power , by availing himself of the agents of nature , either to facilitate the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create himself ; or , 3d . He may economize his labor , by such arrangements as will enable him , in a given time and with a given amount of fatigue , to accomplish a greater amount of production . It is , by adopting these means , that the human race advances from the savage to the civilized state . With nothing but his hands and feet , man could not subsist , except in the most temperate climates . His food would be wild fruits , and the animals which he could run down in the chase . This is the lowest point of human wretchedness . It is a laborious and incessant struggle to obtain the bare means of prolonging existence . He invents a bow and arrow ; this is a natural agent , or a tool by which he avails himself of the elasticity of wood . By this simple tool , his condition is materially improved . Still , he is destitute of most of the comforts , and frequently , at times , of the necessaries of life . Hence , in cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and famine . He next becomes a shepherd . Here he avails himself of the use of natural agents . The flocks furnish him with wool , and the herds with milk . He now begins to taste the blessings of a regular and sufficient supply of food and clothing . He next becomes an agriculturist . Here , in addition /z/ to the agents formerly employed , he makes use of the earth , manures , and implements , and begins rapidly to accumulate capital . His wants increase , and a division of labor is necessary to supply them . He now advances with rapid progress , and at every step employs either new agents , or else old agents more successfully , divides his labor more skilfully , and at length arrives at all the blessings of mature civilization . If it be asked , how far may this increased productiveness of human industry be carried , we answer , it is impossible to tell , unless we can ascertain how great are the blessings which God has in reserve for man . Who can estimate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam , or by the printing press ? And what reason have we to suppose that the gifts of God are exhausted , or that there are not other and more excellent natural agents yet to be discovered , or other modes of using those which we are already acquainted with , that shall produce even more surprising results than any which we have yet witnessed ? Before the discovery of the agents now in use , the most vivid imagination could never have conceived of the benefits which they have already conferred upon society . There is no reason to suppose , that we are now more capable of fathoming the goodness of God , than our ancestors were three or four hundred years ago . And hence we learn the inconceivable importance to a nation , of science , and of the labors of those who are devoted to the discovery of the laws of nature , and to the invention of new modes of applying these laws to the service of man . What would be the condition of the world at the present moment , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chemistry were abolished ? Undiscovered knowledge is just as rich in the means of human happiness , as discovered knowledge . And hence , that nation which is most assiduously cherishing the means for availing itself of the benefit of all the laws of the Creator , will most rapidly provide itself with the comforts and conveniences and luxuries of life , in the greatest abundance and at the least possible /z/ cost . Who can tell the benefit which will result to this country , when Geology has revealed to us the riches which at present remain hidden from our view beneath the surface of the soil ? /z/ We shall now proceed to consider the several means by which the productive power of industry may be increased . This section will treat of the use of natural agents . Jl natural agent , is any quality or relation of things ' which can be used for the purpose of assisting us in production . Thus , the light and heat of the sun are natural agents , without the aid of which we could not create vegetable products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent , without which we could neither cook our food , prolong our lives in cold climates , give any valuable quality to metals , nor create steam for the purpose of machinery . Magnetism is a natural agent , by which we are enabled , in any part of the earth , to know in what direction we are moving . The various powers and instincts of animals are natural agents , by which we accomplish purposes which could not be accomplished without them . Thus , the farmer avails himself of the muscular power and docility of the ox and the horse ; Yhe huntsman , of the fleetness apd scent of the hound , &c.; Wind , the gravitating power of water , and steam , are natural agents , by means of which we create the momentum necessary to various operations in the arts . A tool , or a machine , is any combination of matter , by means of which we are enabled to avail ourselves of the qualities or relations of a natural agent . Thus , /z/ a lens , or burning glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate , for useful purposes , the rays of the sun . A stove , or a fire place , is an instrument , or tool , by which we avail ourselves of the calorific properties of fuel . Ji mariner 's compass is a tool , by which we avail ourselves of the peculiar quality of the magnetic needle . Ji water wheel is a tool , by means of which we avail ourselves of the gravitating power of water . Jl steam engine is a tool , by means of which we avaJl ourselves of the expansive power of steam . The only difference between a tool and a machine is , that the one is more complicated than the other . A common hammer is a tool , by means of which we avail ourselves of the gravity and density of iron , and of the power of the lever . A trip-hammer , by which large masses of iron are fashioned and wrought , is called a machine , but the principles employed are , in both cases , the same , only the trip-hammer is moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the common hammer is moved by the hand . From what has already been said , it will be easily perceived , that the qualities and relations of natural agents are the gift of God , and , being His gift , they cost us nothing . Thus , in order to avail ourselves of the momentum produced by a water-fall , we have only to construct the water-wheel and its necessary appendages , and place them in a proper position . We then have the use of the falling water , without further expense . As , therefore , our only outlay is the cost of the instrument by which the natural agent is rendered available , this is the only expenditure which demands the attention of the political economist . If we reflect upon the various natural agents employed by man , we shall see that some of them can be used without any tools whatever . Such is the case in agricultural labor , with air , and the light of the sun . Others require only so simple instruments , that their effect upon price is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would last for twenty years , and assist /z/ n the transportation of half as many millions ' value of merchandise , would cost but a few dollars . Others are used by few persons , and for particular and unusual purposes , as the lens , or the microscope . It is only those agents which require for their employment , machinery of which the cost is appreciable , and which are of so general necessity , that their use enters into consideration in estimating the expenses of production , that require to be specially noticed in Political Economy . The means most universally required for creating change , is momentum , or , as it is commonly called , power . Without this , in agriculture , no change in elementary form , and , in mechanics , no change in aggregate form , and in transportation , no change in place , can be effected . The instruments necessary to avail ourselves of the natural agents which create momentum , or which enable us to use it in particular methods , are very numerous and very costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man . The natural agents which man uses for this purpose are , therefore , those which particularly claim our attention ; and to these , the remainder of this section will be devoted . The natural agents connected with the use of momentum , may be divided into two classes : 1 . Those which create momentum . 2 . Those which enable us to use it . 1 . Of those which create momentum . , This class of agents may be subdivided into two kinds : 1st . Animate ; and , 2d . Inanimate . 1 . Animate . These are , beasts of draft and burden , generally . The most common of these are , the ox , the horse , and the mule ; - others in use in particular districts , are the camel , the elephant , the dog , and the reindeer . The subjection of animals to the human will marks an era in the progress of civilization ; and teaches us that the first important step has been taken in the improvement of the condition of man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the horse /z/ have much greater physical power than man . They may also be sustained at a much less expense . Their food is the spontaneous production of the earth , which , for a large part of the year , they gather for themselves , and which requires no labor of preparation . They need no clothing in any latitude , and in the warmer parts of the temperate zone , need no shelter . But , in consequence of his superiority in intellectual endowment , man can direct and govern the physical power of several of these animals , and , by attaching them to agricultural machines , can command that power at his will . If , then , by the use of animals , one man can wield a physical force equal to that of ten men , he will be able to produce , by the labor of a day , ten times as much as he could before the introduction of animate agents . He will , therefore , by the same amount of labor , produce ten times as large an amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human happiness . He will have a larger surplus to employ in fixed capital for the next year , and this surplus will be annually increasing , and increasing at the rate of compound interest . He will have a larger portion to exchange ; hence , he will be able , also , to enjoy a larger amount of his neighbor 's products . He will be able to exchange with a greater number of producers ; hence , he will have a larger number of his desires gratified . And when once this first step has been taken , capital , unless destroyed by man 's perverse moral dispositions , must increase so rapidly , that the mechanical arts soon commence , and permanent improvements and intellectual cultivation will follow in rapid succession . In the earliest stages of society , animate power must be used for the production of momentum , in all the three departments of human industry . In the labors of agriculture , it is still employed , and must probably be thus employed forever . Nothing has yet superseded it , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In this respect , therefore , so far as the means for the creation of momentum are concerned , the early and the later periods of society remain on a /z/ level . The improvements that have been made by the introduction of other creative forces , have generally been connected with the other modes of operative industry . 2 . Of Inanimate Natural Agents . The inanimate agents , most commonly in use , are : The explosive force of Gunpowder ; Wind ; The gravitating power of Water ; and The expansive power of Steam . 1 . Gunpowder is used in the blasting of rocks , in hunting , and in war . Its value , in the blasting of rocks , is very considerable . By drilling a small hole , which may be done by one man in a day , and by the use of a few ounces of gunpowder , a force may be exerted , in an instant , producing an effect which , twenty men , for several days , could not otherwise have exerted . Hence , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where rocks must be removed , in order to admit the passage of railroads and canals . In fact , it is doubtful whether many of the most important of these works could ever have been executed , but for this agent . Others , if the execution of them were possible , must have been accomplished at so great an expense , that the investment of capital in them would not have been profitable , and , of course , it would not have been made . Gunpowder is also used extensively in war . If war be beneficial , or even necessary , gunpowder is an agent of the utmost importance ; for , by no other means yet discovered , is it possible to destroy so many men , with so little physical suffering , and with so little personal labor . It has also a moral advantage over other methods of slaughter , inasmuch as the destruction of human life , in this manner , excites less sensibly the ferocity of the human heart . On this account , wars , since its introduction , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also been a valuable auxiliary to the progress of civilization , since it has conferred on civilized , an undisputed mastery over uncivilized nations . There has not been , for centuries , any danger , o Christendom from barbarian invasion . Besides , the /z/ more energetic are the means of destruction in war , the less is the loss of life in battle . Hence , of a given number of combatants in an engagement , a much smaller proportion is now slain than formerly . This might almost give rise to the seemingly paradoxical hope , that some means of destruction might yet be invented , so overwhelming in its effects , as to put the smallest number of men on a level with the greatest , and hence to put an end to wars altogether . 2 . Another agent used for the creation of momentum , is Wind . Wind , as a stationary agent , is an important mechanical power , in countries destitute of water power , or of the fuel necessary for the production of steam , or of the capital which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more expensive agents . Its principal advantage is its cheapness . It costs nothing to create it , and the machinery , by which it is applied , is simple , and easily constructed . The disadvantages of wind , are its uncertainty , both in quantity and in time , and the difficulty with which it is regulated . In consequence of the irregularity of its /orce , it is impossible to employ it in labor requiring delicacy of operation : and , in consequence of its uncertainty in time , it could not be employed where the labor of many persons was dependent on its assistance . As a locomotive power , on water , wind is almost universally used in navigation . Though the direction , m which it acts , is variable ; yet , nautical skill enables us to use it when blowing from almost any point whatever . Its variation , in the quantity offeree , is here also a mat ter of less consequence , since this circumstance can affect the operation to be performed , only in respect to time . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great degree yielded to science and enterprise . It is astonishing to observe with what precision and certainty voyages are now made between New York and Liverpool . Hence , this agent has , until lately , been universally used in the navigation of the ocean . With the inventions of Fulton a new era commenced . Steam very soon was employed in the place of wind in the naviga- /z/ tion of rivers and along the sea-board . It was not , however , until the year 1837 that the experiment was successfully made , of establishing a regular communication between Europe and America by means of steam . In the May of that year , the steamers Sirius and Great Western , the former from Liverpool , the latter from Bristol , arrived in New York . Since that time passages have continued to be made between the above ports with great regularity , and thus far without disaster or accident . It is demonstrated that the navigation of the Atlantic , by steam , is as perfectly within the power of man , as the navigation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present plying regularly from France and Great Britain to every part of the Mediterranean . Steamers now leave Boston and Liverpool twice every month , and very rarely have they failed to arrive within twelve hours of their appointed time at any season of the year . 3 . Another agent , used for the creation of momentum is the gravitating power of Water . This is used only as a stationary agent . Its advantages are , that it is cheap , tolerably constant , and frequently , is capable of exerting great mechanical force . Its disadvantages are , that it is stationary ; that is , that it can be used only in situations where it has been created by nature . Hence , it is frequently at a considerable distance from the seaports whence the manufacturer derives his supplies , and whence he exports his products . In such cases , the cost of transportation must be deducted from the profits of the establishment , and is of course , to this amount , a diminution of their value . Water can not always be commanded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liability to suffer from the want of water . This is a great inconvenience , inasmuch as , in seasons of drought , a large number of the laborers must be unemployed , and a large portion of the expenses of the establishment must be incurred , without yielding any remuneration to the proprietor . Another disadvantage of water power is , that it is lia- /z/ ble to danger from inundation . Though this may be guarded against , in many cases ; yet , it frequently can be done only at an expense which greatly reduces the cheapness of the agent . Notwithstanding these disadvantages , water power will probably *be always used , where great mechanical force is required ; where tlje machinery to be employed is simple , and where the operation does not require the greatest possible nicety of execution . 4 . The power , however , most commonly in use at present , is Steam . Its advantages are , that it can be used to create any required degree of mechanical force ; that it is perfectly under human control ; that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained ; that it can be used at will , either as a stationary , or a locomotive power ; and that it can be made to act with perfect regularity . Its only disadvantage , is its expensiveness . The machinery by which it is generated is costly , and requires frequent repairs ; and the fuel , by which it is maintained , is a very serious item of consumption . The price of engines , however , will be gradually reduced , as the demand for them increases . And it is probable , that , by improvement in their construction , the consumption of fuel will be greatly diminished ; while increased facilities for transportation wijl materially reduce its pftce . The introduction of steam power has greatly reduced the price of fuel in Great Britain . The question whether steam or water power should be used in any particular case , is , I suppose , to be decided by their relative expensiveness . This will be decided , principally , by the place in which the power may be required . Water power will generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sufficiently near to a market or to tide water . But where it is variable in quantity , or is at a considerable distance from the place of delivery , the cost of transportation will frequently overbalance its other advantages , and render steam power the more economical . Machinery , propelled by steam , can be erected and carried on upon a wharf , or in the midst of a city ; and hence it avoids all /z/ the cost of unnecessary transportation . Machinery , propelled by water power , can be erected only at the place where the water power exists , and , of course , is subject to all the expense of transportation between that place and the market . t The ADVANTAGES of inanimate over animate natural agent s , are several . 1 . Inanimate agents can , within a small compass , and with comparatively little weight , produce a vastly greater amount of momentum , than animate agents . Thus , a steam engine , of one hundred and fifty or two hundred horse power , occupies but a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo of a vessel . But so great a number of horses could scarcely be carried in any vessel designed to transport either freight or passengers ; and , besides , no mechanical arrangement has yet been devised , by which such a number of animals could conveniently be employed upon one operation . 2 . They are continuous ; that is , they are never liable to fatigue , and never need rest . Animals must spend the greater part of their time in feeding or in repose . Specially is this the case , if they are worked rapidly . During this time , the labor which they perform must either be suspended , or else other animals must take their place . A horse can not labor severely for more thjin eight hours in twenty-four . Hence , if die uninterrupted labor of horses were required for twenty-four hours , three relays must be provided . Thus , if a boat were required to perform a voyage in twenty-four hours , she must employ three relays of horses ; that is , a steam boat , worked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , would require four hundred and fifty horses , in order to create the necessary momentum . 3 . Hence , there is a great gain in Economy . The first cost of inanimate is generally less than that of animate agents ; they are liable to no diseases ; they require no food ; and create expense only while they are performing their work . Were the labor now performed by steam , to be performed by horses , the price of the ordinary necessaries of life would be quadrupled , and /z/ many articles of ordinary use would be placed out of the reach of any but the most opulent . Nor is this all . The substitution of inanimate for animate power , has a great tendency to reduce the cost or to increase the supply of all agricultural " products . Suppose that , by the use of steam , one thousand horses can be dispensed with . A horse requires for sustenance , throughout the year , as much agricultural produce as would support eight men . If , then , these one thousand horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the land which was formerly employed for the production of hay , as much wheat as will support eight thousand men . This must , at first , reduce the price of wheat ; and the result would be , that the district would support eight thousand more men than before . 4 . There is also , commonly , a gain in personal safety . Inanimate agents act under laws which may be known and obeyed , and of which the results may be commonly foreseen and guarded against . Animals are endowed with passions and will , which we can frequently neither control nor influence . Besides , the greater expensiveness of the individual machines employed in the use of inanimate agents , renders it for the interest of the proprietor to employ men of experience and responsibility to manage them . This very sensibly diminishes the risk . When we reflect upon the vast amount of travelling by steamboats and railroads , it must be evident , that , notwithstanding the accidents to which they are liable , a vastly greater amount of human life would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by horses . It is also to be remembered , that the use of steam is yet in its infancy , and that greater experience and skill will materially reduce the number of accidents to which this mode of conveyance is at present liable . 5 . Inanimate agents can be used without the infliction of pain . Inanimate agents are insensible . Where the labor to be accomplished is either severe , or where it requires great speed , animals must be rapidly destroyed . This exposes them to great suffering . A horse in a /z/ stage coach can rarely travel , rapidly , more than ten miles a day ; and most horses will endure even this labor but for a short time . From this suffering inanimate power is exempt . It never- endures pain from being over driven . 6 . Animate power decreases with velocity . Hence , we must soon arrive at a point beyond which it can no further be used to create momentum . If we represent the tractive force of a horse , when moving at two miles an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles , will be 8 1 ; at the rate of four miles , 64 ; at the rate of five miles , 49 ; at the rate of six miles , 36 ; while at the top of his speed , he can carry nothing more than his own weight . An engine , on the contrary , may be made to work as powerfully at one degree of velocity as at another . In all cases , therefore , in which both great power and great velocity are required , inanimate power must , of necessity , be employed . From these causes , we see that inanimate is rapidly taking the place of animate power , both where stationary and where locomotive force is required . By the additional speed which it is capable of producing , it gives rise to great economy of time . This , to all persons engaged in active employments , is a consideration of vast moment . Being a continuous agent , it is also enabled to act with the greatest certainty . Hence , men may adjust their transactions , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another source of economy , both of time and of capital . And , besides , notwithstanding the expensiveness of the arrangements for the use of locomotive forces , - yet the amount of additional travelling to which they give rise , is so great , that the expensiveness of transportation between different places is , in general , materially diminished . II . Of the natural agents by which momentum is APPLIED . It is obvious , that a great addition is made to human power , where the agents for creating momentum have been discovered . But this is not all . Several combinations of matter may be formed , by which mere hu- /z/ man force may be greatly assisted , and which , by being united with the agents for creating momentum , may greatly increase , and vary , and give adaptation to , its utility . These are called the mechanical powers , which are treated of at large in works on Mechanics and Natural Philosophy . In their simple form , they are the lever , the wheel and axle , the inclined plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are variously combined , for producing the different results of mechanics , but may be all reduced to these simple elements . By means of these , the muscular power of man is enabled greatly to increase its effect ; that is , a man by his own strength can now accomplish labor which he could not accomplish without them . Though these instruments give no new strength , yet they greatly increase the effectiveness of that which already exists ; and hence , their invention marks an important era in the progress of civilization . It is also to be remarked , that their origin , in point of time , is far in advance of the discovery of the creative agents . Archimedes had made great progress in the discovery and application of these modifying powers , when the use of creative agents was almost unknown . The triumph of human skill is , however , achieved , when these two forms of natural agency are combined in a single machine . By the one we generate power , to what extent soever 4 we choose ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give to it any application , and direct it to any purpose , that our convenience may require . It is in this manner , th#t man renders all the various powers of nature tributary to himself . He can thus create , and use as he pleases , as great a power as he desires . He devolves the labor on nature , and he has only to fabricate the instruments , and give them their direction . He is successful just in proportion as he does this ; since nature always works with undeviating accuracy , with unerring skill , with indefatigable perseverance ; and she always works for nothing . It may be useful to specify some of the results accomplished by the various instruments , which man em /z/ ploys for modifying that momentum which is exerted by the first class of natural agents . 1 . We are thus enabled to change the direction of the power . Thus , in the cylinder of the steam engine , the momentum is created either in perpendicular or horizontal strokes . This , being by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moves the paddlewheels of a steamboat . Thus , also , in the machinery for moving a trip-hammer , a circular is changed into a perpendicular motion , by the striking @#@ of the cogs of a wheel upon the short arm of a lever , while the hammer is attached to the other arm . 2 . We exchange power for velocity . This is done in all spinning machinery . By water or by steam , we cause a large wheel to revolve ten , twenty , or thirty times in a minute , and with a power equal to that which could be produced by fifty or one hundred horses . In spinning , however , we need small power , but great velocity . Hence , by the combination of various large and small wheels , we produce a velocity , in a thousand spindles , equal to many thousand revolutions in a minute . The whole of this fifty or one hundred horse power , is thus spread over a large manufactory , and adapted , by various contrivances , to every degree of velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 . We are thus enabled to exert forces too great for animate power . By water pow r er , or by steam , we can generate as great a force as we please ; and we have only to combine with it the proper adjustments , in order to exert upon any point any momentum which we desire . The power required to roll and hammer iron , or copper , to propel steamboats , to forge anchors , and that used in several other of the arts , is greater than could be exerted by any animate force with which we are acquainted , unless it were exerted by means of some combination of the mechanical forces . 4 . We are thus also enabled to execute operations too delicate for human touch . Very delicate operations , soon weary the nervous system by the excessive attention which they of necessity require . Thus , in order /z/ to spin the finest thread on a spinning wheel , there must be great accuracy , bath in the velocity of the wheel , and in the muscular power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort of attention , which the human system can not long maintain , and , of course , the thread will frequently be uneven . But v by means of machinery , both of these operations may be adjusted with mathematical accuracy ; and as machines have no nerves , they will be perfectly faithful to that adjustment . Thus we invariably see that the most delicate fabrics are those that are wrought by natural agents . Hence machinery is necessarily used in the manufacture of such articles as require for their formation identity of result , such as screws , types , &c.; 5 . By means of machinery , we are enabled to accumulate power . We thus exchange a continuous and small force , for a sudden and violent one . Such is the case with the pile-driver , and the common beetle or mallet , when used in combination with the wedge . 6 . By the same means we are enabled to exchange a short and irregular effort for a continuous and regular movement , or to spread the action of a short , over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watches , and other similar machinery . Here we spread the action of a minute , over a day , or a week , and with almost mathematical accuracy . In consequence of the above mentioned application of machinery , various other advantages are realized in production . For instance ; there is frequently a great saving of material , as in the change from making boards with the adze , to that of making them with the saw ; and again the labor of natural agents is so much cheaper , that many articles , which would otherwise have been worthless , are nwv deserving of attention , as they may now be profitably endowed with some form of value . I close these remarks , upon the use of natural agents , with an extract , very graphically describing the power of the steam engine , which has commonly been ascribed to Francis Jeffrey , Esquire , now Lord Jeffrey , of Edinburgh /z/ " It ( the steam engine ) has become a thing , stupendous alike for its force and its flexibility ; for the prodigious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision , and ductility with which it can be varied , distributed , and applied . The trunk of an elephant , that can pick up a pin or rend an oak , is as nothing to it . It can engrave a seal , and crush masses of obdurate metal before it ; draw out , without breaking , a thread as fine as a gossamer ; and lift up a ship of war , like a bauble in the air . It can embroider muslin , and forge anchors ; cut steel into ribands , and impel loaded vessels against the fury of the winds and waves . " It would be difficult to estimate the value of the benefits which these inventions have conferred upon the country . There is no branch of industry that has not been indebted to them , and in all the most material , they have not only widened most magnificently the field of its exertions , but multiplied , a thousand fold , the amount of its productions . It is our improved steam engine , that has fought the battles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous contest , the political greatness of our land . It is the same great power , which enables us to pay our national debt , and to maintain the arduous struggle in which we are still engaged , with the skill and capital of countries less oppressed with taxation . " But these are poor and narrow views of its importance . It has increased , indefinitely , the mass of human comforts and enjoyments , and rendered cheap and accessible , all over the world , the materials of wealth and prosperity . It has armed the feeble hand of man , in short , with a power to which no limits can be assigned ; completed the dominion of mind over the most refractory qualities of matter ; and laid a sure foundation for all those future miracles of mechanical power , which are to aid and reward the labors of after generations . " /z/ We have shown that the productiveness of human industry may be greatly increased by the discovery of the qualities and relations of things , and by the invention of instruments , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this manner , the power of man receives an almost incalculable augmentation . But this is not all . It is found that the result of human effort may be still further very greatly increased . Thus : supposing the agents of nature , and also their mode of application , to be known , and that a given number of men are about to perform an operation , they may make such arrangements among themselves , as will , in a given time , and with a given expenditure of labor , enable them to accomplish a vastly greater result than could be accomplished without such arrangements . The mode , in which this is effected , is by division of labor . . Division of labor is always , to some degree , employed where different individuals are engaged in the different branches of human industry . Thus , labor is divided when different persons employ themselves in the several departments of discovery , application , and operation . Labor is still further divided , when those employed in these great departments , are separated into distinct classes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object . Thus , one man investigates the laws of mechanics ; another , those of astronomy ; and a third , those of vegetation . One man is devoted to the profession of the law ; and another , to that of medicine ; while each separate trade is employed in the creation of a particular product . By all these divisions , it is manifest that the result of the whole is greatly increased . It is only the savage , that combines in his own person , in all their departments , the character of philosopher , inventor , and operator . He approximates /z/ to the civilized state , only in so far as he begins to confine himself to some particular calling . And it is always in the most advanced periods of civilization , that division of labor is carried to its ultimate limits . But , besides this , the different parts of any operation may be analyzed ; and to each part the whole labor of a single individual may be confined . Thus , the labor of making a pin may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading , tinning , &c.; In Political Economy , labor is said to be divided , just in so far as these several processes are assigned to separate operators . It is found , by experience , that such an arrangement increases the productiveness of human labor to an extent , which , to a person who had not examined the facts , would appear wholly incredible . The principles on which this increased productiveness of labor depends , are the following : 1 . Division of labor shortens the period required for learning an operation . The more complicated the operation , the longer is the time necessary for acquiring the skill requisite to the performing of it successfully . But this time spent in learning , is useless to the operator and to society , only in so far as it is necessary to the creation of the product . tThe longer the time necessary for learning an operation , the higher must be the wages of the operator , for the remainder of his life ; and also , of course , the greater must be the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price of course will fall . Now , that this is lessened , by division of labor , is evident from an obvious example . Suppose that a given process , say the making of nails , consists of seven operations ; and that each of these operations required one year 's practice , before it could be successfully performed . Now , if seven men were to learn this occupation , and each one were obliged to learn every operation , the time required would be 7 X 7 = 49 years ; whereas , if each of them were required to learn but one , the time would be but 7 X 1=7 , or , the difference would be , 49 7 =s 42 years of human labor , or six sevenths of the whole time , which would thus be saved . There /z/ would be six years more of productive labor , in the life of each of these men ; and , as they had spent less time in acquiring their art , they could afford to exercise it for . bwer wages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another , of considerable importance . Every one , in learning an art , must , by unskilfulness , destroy a considerable portion of capital . And this amount of capital will be in proportion to the number of operations which he is obliged to learn . Thus , suppose that a man learns seven operations , and , in learning each , destroys ten dollars ' worth of capital , the amount which he will destroy , in acquiring his whole trade , will be 7 X 10 = 70 . If he have to learn but one , it will be but ten dollars ; and thus , the difference will be 70 10 = 60 dollars , upon every such individual . A difference , so great as these two combined , when spread over the whole face of society , will have no inconsiderable effect upon the annual net revenue of a community . 2 . When one man performs all the operations required in a complicated process , much time is lost in passing from one operation to another . By division of labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to every one . It renders any operation easy , which is frequently repeated . The mind and the muscles become adapted to a particular form of labor ; but , if that form of labor be suspended , and our attention be directed to another , it requires a considerable time before we can acquire a different habit , and , in the mean time , the good effects of the preceding habit , are , to a considerable degree , lost . Hence , he who is frequently passing from one occupation to another , is in the condition of him who is , during his whole life , forming habits ; and never in the condition of him , who has the advantage of habits already formed . Besides , this long habit produces in the muscles a capacity for continued exertion . He who is in the habit of performing an operation , can perform it , without sensible fatigue , for several hours together . Every one who has ever sawed wood , or used a spade /z/ in a garden , is sensible of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by frequently turning from one operation to another . fc 3 . Where complicated tools are to be used , and there is no division of labor , much time is also lost in adjusting them to the different kinds of work . By division of labor , this disadvantage is obviated . Suppose that nails , of different sizes , are to be made , and it is necessary that the machinery , in order to adapt it to the different kinds of work , should be frequently adjusted ; the time so occupied produces nothing , and is lost . If , on the contrary , one machine is permanently used for the manufacture of nails of one particular size , all this loss is avoided . This is also more obvious , when the adjustment involves expense ; as , for instance , when a furnace is used . If a furnace be heated , and then suffered to cool while the operator is performing some other labor , the fuel consumed , after he leaves it , and that which is used to bring it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to that of the time and labor required in kindling the fire , and in waiting for the rise of temperature . By dividing the labor , so that one person shall be always employed at the furnace , whilst others are employed at other parts of the process , much capital and labor will be saved . 4 . By constantly pursuing the same occupation , a degree of skill and dexterity is acquired , which greatly increases the productiveness of human labor . This advantage is lost , by employing the same individual upon several operations . Adam Smith informs us , that a blacksmith , who occasionally makes nails , but whose whole business is not that of a nail-maker , can make but from eight hundred to one thousand nails a day ; whilst a lad , who has nevsr exercised any other trade , can make upwards of twenty-three hundred a day . All who have been accustomed to visit manufactories , must have been surprised to observe the dexterity which is acquired , even by children , in performing the operations in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performers of jugglery , or sleight-of-hand , de- /z/ rive their skill almost entirely from this cause . They seldom perform more than a few operations , but by practising these , and these alone , for a great length of time , they at last attain to a proficiency , which , to a spectator , is incomprehensible . 5 . Division of labor suggests the contrivance of tools for the performance of the operation in which it is employed . The more completely any process is analyzed , the simpler must become the individual operations of which it is composed : and the simpler any operation is , the easier is it to contrive a tool , or an adjustment , by which it may be performed . Adam Smith informs us , that , in the first steam engines , boys were constantly employed to open a communication between the boiler and cylinder , according as the piston ascended or descended . One of these boys observed , that , by uniting the handle of the valve which opened this communication with another part of the machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leave him at liberty to play with his fellows . One of the most important improvements of this machine was thus , by division of labor , brought within the capacity of a playful boy . It would have been very difficult to invent machinery for the making of nails , when all the processes were considered as a complicated whole . But after the several operations are divided , and are assigned to individuals separately , it becomes comparatively easy to construct an adjustment , by which any one of them , singly , could be performed . This is the first step in invention . But this is not all . After these several single instruments have been invented , the next step is to combine them together . This is the most finished effort of mechanical genius . This is the principal difference between a tool and a machine . A tool performs one single operation , a machine combines several tools together , and accomplishes either the whole , or a considerable part , of a complicated process . 6 . Every one , at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the op- /z/ erations in a given process , require greater muscular power , or greater skill , or greater dexterity than others . Some , for instance , can be performed only by the most experienced workmen , while others can be perfectly well performed by children . Now , by division of labor a manufacturer is enabled to employ , upon each operation , precisely the labor adapted to it , and is obliged to pay for each portion of the labor no more than it is actually worth . This must greatly diminish the cost of production . Thus , themanufacture of pins is divided into ten different operations , and each operation employs one laborer . But some of those laborers are men ; others are women and children ; and their wages vary from six shillings to four and a half pence sterling a day . If the labor were not divided , one person must understand the whole process , and , therefore , must be employed at the highest price of labor ; and hence , he must be paid at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work which is worth only four and a half pence a day . Every one must see that this would greatly increase the price of pins , and also occasion a great deficiency in labor . It is by this means , also , that occupation is provided for the weak and the aged , for females and for children , who would , otherwise , be unable to earn any thing . Thus , all the labor of the community is rendered productive , and an immense amount is annually added to the revenue of a country . Nor is the gain to be estimated at simply what is thus earned . The whole community is thus acquiring those habits of industry and self-dependence , which are essential to its happiness and well-being , no less than to the rapid accumulation of its capital . * * The following facts , respecting the manufacture of watches , illustrate very forcibly the extent to which the division of labor may be carried , and also the amount of value which may be conferred upon the cheapest substance by accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces , and forty-three trades are employed in their construction ; the chain , whose length is eight inches , has ' 165 links , each containing three plates and twopins , in all 825 pieces , and passes through fifteen hands , men , women , and children , of three trades , before it is complete : allowing them five hands in each trade , 215 persons find employment in making a watch . This extensive and /z/ Nor are the benefits of the division of labor confined to mechanical processes . The results have been equally interesting , in those cases where this principle has been applied to intellectual labor . The effect of such a division is seen in the following account , which I introduce here , not only because it very happily illustrates this whole subject , but also because it may suggest to scientific men , some other cases in which it may be again applied with similar benefit . During the period of the French revolution , the government was desirous of producing a series of mathematical tables , in order to facilitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently adopted . They directed their mathematicians to construct such tables on the most extensive scale . The superintendence of the work was confided to M. Prony . It happened that shortly after he had undertaken it , he opened , in a bookstore , Adam Smith 's " Wealth of Nations , " and , by accident , turned to the chapter on division of labor . The thought immediately suggested itself , that this might be adopted in the work in which he was engaged . He immediately followed out the suggestion , and arranged his plan accordingly . He divided the persons who were to execute the labor into three sections : The first section was composed of five or six of the most eminent mathematicians of France . Their duty was to ascertain the analytical expressions which were most readily adapted to simple numerical calculation , and which could be performed by many individuals employed at the same time . The formulae on the use of which it had decided , were to be delivered to the second section . numerous individuality will apply , more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but no branch of manufactures will afford such an illustration of the value of labor . The iron of which the balance-spring is formed is valued at something less than a farthing ; this produces an ounce of steel , worth 4%d. , which is drawn into 2,250 yards of spring wire , and represents in the market 13 4s. ; but still another process of hardening this originally farthing 's worth of iron renders it workable into 7,550 balance-springs , which will realize , at the common price of 2s. 6d. each , 946 5s. the effect of la bor alone . /z/ The second section consisted of seven or eight persons , of considerable acquaintance with mathematics , whose duty it was , to convert into numbers the formulae put into their hands by the first section ; and then to deliver out these numbers to the members of the third section , and to receive from them the finished calculations . These they could verify without repeating the work . The third section consisted of sixty or eighty persons . They received the numbers from the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtraction , returned to that section the finished tables . Ninetenths of this class had no knowledge of arithmetic beyond its first two rules ; and it is remarkable that these were usually found more correct in their calculations , than those who possessed a more extensive knowledge of the subject . The extent of the labor , which was thus executed in a remarkably short space of time , may be estimated , when it is stated that the tables thus formed are computed to occupy seventeen large folio volumes . And yet we see that the greatest part of the labor was actually accomplished by persons who might be employed at very small expense , and who could do the work assigned them , as perfectly as those whose labor was the most expensive. * We thus see the manner in which the productiveness of human labor may be increased . 1st . By discovering the various agents of nature which God has created for our benefit ; 2d . By applying these agents to the service of man ; 3d . By so arranging and adjusting human industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate with the greatest possible advantage . In one or other of these methods , must every improvement in the physical condition of mankind operate . And civilization advances just in proportion as all of them combined are brought to bear upon the work of production ; that is , of creation of objects of desire , in other words , of means for human happiness . /z/ We now proceed to another branch of the subject ; the Limitations of the Divisions of Labor . These may be considered in reference to individuals , and to nations . In so far as the individual is concerned , these limitations arise from three causes . 1st . The Nature of the process ; 2d . Deficiency of Capital ; and 3d . Demand . 1 . From the nature of the Process . Every process can be analyzed into its ultimate elements ; that is , into the various simple processes of which it is composed . Thus in pin-making the straightening of the wire is one operation , the cutting it into equal lengths is another , the sharpening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another , &c.; But when we have reduced the operation to its simple elements , we can proceed no further . Hence , here is our necessary limit ; for it is no division of labor to employ two men to perform precisely the same operation . Hence an establishment , which carries division to this limit , will be able , from what has been said , to undersell another which does not carry it to the same degree of perfection . And hence , in establishing a manufactory , it is important so to adjust the number and kind of workmen , that , when the different operations of a process have been assigned to different persons , these persons may be in such proportions as exactly and fully to employ each other . The more perfectly this is accomplished , the greater will be the economy . And , this having been once ascertained , it is also evident that the establishment can not be successfully enlarged , unless it employ multiples of this number of workmen . 2 . Division of labor may be limited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not /z/ be carried on , unless the proprietor have sufficient capital to employ , at the same vtime , al ; the persons necessary to such a division , and to keep them so employed , until the proceeds of their work- enable him to furnish them again with fresh material . This is , of course , a considerable outlay , and supposes a considerable accumulation of the proceeds of pre-exerted industry . Hence , in a poor or in a new country , there can be but little division of labor . No one has more than enough capital to employ himself , and , perhaps , one or two laborers ; and hence , each individual performs all the operations of each process , and frequently those of several processes . The same individual is the farrier , blacksmith , cutler , and , perhaps , wheelwright , for a whole settlement . To illustrate this by a single instance : If a nailer be able to purchase no larger amount of iron and coal than he can use in the manufacture of nails in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process himself ; and , of course , must labor very disadvantageously . As soon , however , as he is able to double his capital , he may employ another person to work with him , and they may then introduce a division of labor . When he has tripled his capital , he may employ another workman , and carry his division stfll further . He may thus go on until he has reduced the process to its simplest elements . When he has " gone thus far , the accumulation of his annual capital will enable him to invest something in fixed capital . He will thus be able to purchase some of the simpler machines , by which some of the parts ol his process may be executed . To these he will add others , as he advances in wealth , until his accumulated means enable him to combine them into one machine , for completing the whole process . Thus he becomes a manufacturer , and derives the larger part of his revenue , from the use of his fixed capital . At every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time the price of his product will become less . It is not pretended that all these changes always , or frequently , take place within the lifetime of a single individual . The progress of society is not generally so rapid . Yet they /z/ sometimes occur in the manner which I have stated . 1 give the illustration , to show the tendency of things , and the power of accumulated capital . But , whether the results are comprised in the lifetime of one , two , or three individuals , the principle is the same . 3 . Division of labor may be limited by the demand for the article produced . Suppose that , in a given district , there is a demand for one hundred pounds of nails per day , and that these can be made by two men . If three men could , by division of labor , make two hundred pounds per day , there would be but small gain , either to the workmen or to the public ; because these men would , of course , lie idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be paid , as well as for the time in which they were employed . Or , if they did not lie absolutely idle , that portion of their time , which was employed on other labor , would be of comparatively small value ; and they , by attending to other business , wouW lose the skill which complete division of labor confers ; and which is one of its principal benefits . The case is still stronger , if we take into view the fact , that division of labor supposes a large investment of fixed capital , and that those who are educated to any manufacturing business , can rarely employ themselves upon any thing else . If the laborers at any of our manufactories were employed only half the time , their wages must be doubled ; for their families must be supported , one day as well as another , and thus the interest of the whole investment must be charged upon half the quantity of product . These causes , together with the loss of skill in workmen , would more than double the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry back the division of labor to its less perfect state . But this demand must depend upon several circumstances . The most important of these are the following : 1 . The number of the consumers . When the number of inhabitants is small , as in a newly settled country , or in an isolated situation , the demand must , of course , correspond to their number . One hundred men will require but one tenth as many hats or shoes as one thou- /z/ sand men . It is on this account that wealth accumulates most rapidly on navigable waters , because the market of the producers is not limited to themselves , but may be easily extended to other places . 2 . By the wealth of the inhabitants . Demand does not signify simple desire for an article , but desire for it , combined with the ability and willingness to give for it what will remunerate the producer . Hence , the greater the ability , in a given population , to remunerate the producer , the greater will be the demand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , would be limited to . those persons in that population who were able to buy a hat . The larger the proportion of such individuals , the better it would be for the hatter , and for every other producer . Hence we see , that every individual is interested in the prosperity of every other individual in the community . 3 . By the cost of the article . The greater the cost of the product , the smaller will be the number of persons who are able to purchase it . Hence , the less will be the demand ; and hence , also , the less opportunity will there be for division of labor . And , besides , the greater the cost of the article , the greater amount of capital is required in order to produce it by division of labor . Hence , this cause operates in two ways to prevent the employment of this means of effecting the reduction of price . Thus , if a community consist of one thousand men , and of these , one hundred be worth one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dollars ; and the remainder be worth but two hundred and fifty dollars per year ; and an article be produced within the reach of only the first of these classes , it can have but one hundred purchasers ; if it come within the reach of the second class , it will have five hundred ; and if it come within the reach of the third class , it will have one thousand purchasers . Hence it is , that division of labor is but sparingly used in the manufacture of rich jewelry , and in articles of expensive luxury ; while it is so universally used in the production of all articles of common use . Hence we see , that the /z/ benefits of the use of natural agents and of division of labor , are vastly greater and more important to the middling and lower classes , than to the rich . These means of increased production , reduce the cost of the necessaries and of the essential conveniences of life to the lowest rate , and , of course , bring them , as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By facilities of transportation . This is evident , from what has been said . The cost of an article depends not only on the cost of its original production , but also upon the cost necessary to bring it to the consumer . Coal may be very cheap at a coal mine , but if it must be borne on the shoulders of men to the consumer , it would , at a few miles from the mine , become so dear , that no one would be able to use it . The demand would be so small , that there would be no profit either in investing capital in the machinery , or in employing division of labor to raise it from the mine . But if horses be used to transport it to the consumer , the demand will increase . Again , if , for horses , canals and railroads be substituted , it will become cheap , and the demand will increase still more ; and , with every such improve- , ment , that circle of consumption expands , of which the mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , specially those of iron or heavy ware , and it applies just in proportion as transportation forms a large or small part of the cost to the consumer . And thus , in general , we see the principle on which facilities for internal communication improve the condition of both the other branches of industry . For this reason , the price of land and grain , rises in a district through which a canal or a railroad passes ; and , for the same reason , manufactories may at one time be successfully established in situations where they at another time would have been useless , if not ruinous to the proprietor . And , still more generally , ' we see the manner in which all the branches of labor assist each other . A railroad or a canal can never profitably be constructed in a country where there is nothing to be transported . But where agriculture , manufactures , and commerce are productive , and hence /z/ require a large amount of transportation , there , these facilities are immediately in demand . Were Liverpool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad between them ? And , on the other hand , the railroad between them , by reducing the cost of all articles bought and sold , diminishes the cost of living in both places , enables the producer to come into market with greater advantages , increases the profit in all kinds of industry , facilitates the accumulation of capital , and thus adds greatly o the annual revenue of both cities . II . I have thus far considered the division of labor as it exists among the " inhabitants of the same place , and in the same situation . The same principle , however , applies to people of different districts . Here it is not merely a matter of choice , but , in a great measure , of necessity ; that is , it is required by the very conditions of our being . It is manifest , that the different portions of the same country possess different facilities for producing the objects of human desire . No district possesses advantages for producing every thing ; but almost every district possesses peculiar facilities for producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than means of increased productiveness of labor in the creation of any particular product . If one soil will produce forty bushels of wheat to the acre , with the same labor that another will produce twenty , the labor upon the first is twice as productive as that upon the second ; that is , the owner of the one has a machine by which he can , with the same labor , produce twice as much as his neighbor . But perhaps the soil which will produce only twenty bushels of wheat , will produce forty bushels of corn per acre , while the other soil will produce only twenty . This second soil is , therefore , an instrument which gives a double productiveness to labor in the raising of corn . Now , it is manifest , that if each one devotes himself to the production of that for which nature has given him peculiar facilities , his amount of production will be greater , he will himself be richer , and the whole community will be supplied at a diminished cost* /z/ Suppose that each occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had the greater advantages ; the result would be 20X40 = 800 of wheat , and the same of corn ; = 800 bushels of wheat and 800 of corn . Suppose , igain , they divided their crops , and each appropriated ten acres to wheat and ten to corn ; the result would be , 10X40 = 400 of wheat , and 10X20 = 200 of corn ; and 10X40 = 400 of corn , and 10X20 = 200 of wheat ; that is 600 of wheat and 600 of corn ; that is , there would be 600 instead of 800 bushels of each raised , and the loss to both , and to the community , would be 200 bushels of each a year . By so much would they both be poorer than by devoting themselves wholly to that product for which each had the greatest natural advantages . Or , to take another case . Suppose one district rich in soil , and adapted to the production of wheat , but level and far inland , and , therefore , unadapted , by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the production of manufactures ; and another district , on the sea-board , hilly and sterile , adapted to manufactures , but unadapted to the culture of wheat . On the first , with one day 's labor , a man may raise two bushels of wheat , but could produce but four yards of cloth . On the other , by the same labor , a man can produce twelve yards of cloth , but can raise but one bushel of wheat . Now , it is manifest , that by each district 's devoting its labor to that kind of production , for which it has the greatest natural facilities , the production of the whole country will be increased . It is also evident , that a man in the wheat district will provide himself with cloth at a cheaper rate , by raising wheat , and procuring cloth by exchange , than by manufacturing it himself ; and on the other hand , that the manufacturer will provide himself with wheat , at a much cheaper rate , by making cloth , than by raising wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , the productive power of both is increased ; their desires are gratified at the expense of less labor ; and thus , both are rendered richer and happier . All this seems obvious , if only the several districts /z/ of the same country be compared . And it is obvious , because every one perceives that God has bestowed upon different districts , of the same country , different advantages , which it is for the interest of that country that each district should improve to the utmost . but every one may see , that the same principles apply to different nations inhabiting the different quarters of the globe . The separation of the earth into warring nations , is nothing but the arbitrary work of man ; it alters neither the qualities nor the relations which God has given to things , nor the laws under which he has constituted man . If a man own a farm , of which one part is suited only to tillage , and another part only to grazing , and he divide it , and sell the pasture land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soil . Will it not be just as profitable to appropriate each part to the purpose for which God designed it , after the purchase , as before ? Every man needs , for the gratification of his innocent desires , nay , for his conveniences and even necessaries , the productions of every part of the globe . To be convinced of this , we have only to enumerate the articles which furnish our houses , the food that covers our tables , and the raiment which clothes our bodies . How greatly would all our means of happiness be diminished , were we deprived of the iron , the furs , and the hemp of the North ; the coffee , teas , sugar , rice , fruits , and spices of the South ; or the wool , the wheat , and the manufactures , of temperate climates . Every one must be convinced that the happiness of every man is increased in proportion as he is furnished with the greatest number of these objects of desire ; and furnished with them , in their greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is evidently the will of our Creator , that but few r of these objects , every one of which is necessary to the happiness of every individual , should be produced except in particular districts . Others , if they can be produced in several places , can be produced much more cheaply , and in greater perfection , in some places , than in others . Every part of the globe possesses peculiar advantages for the production of something ; but no part /z/ possesses advantages for the production of every thing . Hence , we see , on the principle illustrated above , that the annual production of the globe will be greatest ; that is , there will be the largest amount falling annually to the share of every individual ; that is , every individual will be richer and happier , when each portion of the globe devotes itself to the creation of those products for which it has the greatest natural facilities . If a man in New York can produce , by one day 's labor , one hundred pounds of flour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and a man in Cuba can produce twenty-five pounds of coffee , but can not produce more than one pound of flour , and they exchange , as we have before seen they must exchange , labor for labor : the one will produce , by a day 's labor , twenty-five pounds of coffee , instead of an ounce ; and the other , one hundred pounds of flour , instead of a pound . Is not this better than for the New York farmer to raise his coffee in a hot-house , at the expense of a day 's labor for an ounce ; and the West Indian to raise his wheat on the mountains , at the expense of a day 's labor for a pound . Such are the advantages of that division of labor suggested by geographical position . And the final cause of all this is evident . God intended that men should live together in friendship and harmony . By thus multiplying indefinitely their wants , and creating only in particular localities , the objects by which those wants can be supplied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and thus to render it no less the interest , than the duty of every one , to live in amity with all the rest . Nor is the application of this principle confined to geographical localities . The simple fact that a nation possesses facilities , be they either natural or acquired , for creating any product at a cheaper rate than any other nation , is a reason why that nation should devote itself to the creation of that product ; and why another nation should , for the same reason , improve its own peculiar advantages . Thus , there are certain states of society , and a certain amount of accumulation of cap- /z/ ital , most favorable to the creation of certain products . A nation in this state , and with this accumulation , can furnish these products cheaper than her neighbors ; and this is a reason they should purchase them of her . Could not one of our old States supply one of the new States with manufactures , cheaper than ' the new State could produce them itself ? And is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by exchange , rather than by direct production ? Is it not cheaper for an Indian to buy a rifle of an European , than to attempt to make one for himself ? This is , however , by no means to assert that such ' arrangements and relations are to be permanent . As a country accumulates fixed capital , it creates its own facilities for creating almost every kind of manufactured product . One nation will naturally begin to do this at the same point of accumulation at which another began to do it . And the way in which to , arrive at this point the soonest , is to become rich as fast as possible ; that is , to buy as cheap as we can , or , in other words , to procure , annually , as many objects of desire as possible , for a given amount of labor . A tribe of Indians would much sooner be able to make rifles for itself , by purchasing , at first , rifles of an European , than by determining that it would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the use of a rifle would render industry more productive , and thus render the tribe richer , it would bring them one step nearer to that degree of accumulation , at which they might begin to make rifles for themselves . But the resolution not to purchase of others , would have no such tendency , inasmuch as it would do nothing whatever towards accumulating production ; but would , on the contrary , shut them out from the very means offered them for most rapidly benefiting their condition . To sum up what has been said . It will be seen that production will be increased ; that is , men will be richer , and therefore may be happier , as the following conditions are complied with : 1 . As the laws of nature , designed by our Creator for our benefit , are understood ; /z/ 2 . As the means are devised for availing ourselves , in the most successful manner , of the utility of these laws ; 3 . As the human labor necessary to be expended , is so arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest and most perfect result ; and 4 . As the inhabitants of the earth , in different localities , devote themselves most exclusively to the production of those objects of desire , for the production of which they have received , either directly or indirectly , from their Creator , the greatest facilities . Or , still more generally , production will be abundant ; that is , man will enjoy the means of physical happiness , in proportion to his individual industry , both of body and mind ; and to the degree of harmony and good feeling which exists between the individuals of the same society ; and also between the different societies themselves . /z/ This subject has been already so frequently alluded to , and all the points on which it depends , so distinctly stated , that it will not be necessary to examine it so fully , as might otherwise be required . The result of industry applied to capital is product , value , or the means of gratifying human desire . The result of increased productiveness of human industry , is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or means of gratifying human desire . That is , in general , increased productiveness is equivalent to increased means of human happiness . This simple statement would seem sufficient to explain the whole subject . Tn order , /z/ however , to obviate any objections that may arise , we will proceed to show its practical operation , by several illustrations . Take the case of a single individual . Suppose a man , by the same amount of labor that he spent last year , to be able this year to create twice as much value . Suppose that a farmer has twice . as large a harvest ; that is , that his instrument is twice as good this year as it was last year . The result is , he will be able to satisfy the desire which that product gratifies , twice as abundantly as he did last year . He will have more to exchange with other producers , and hence he will be able to gratify other desires more abundantly . He will be able to make exchanges which were before out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his mode of living , new means of happiness . And , on the other hand , as he is able to make exchanges with others with whom it was before impossible , others , in return , are able to avail themselves of his product or means of happiness , who were before unable to do so . Hence , he is not only happier himself ; but the very means , by which he becomes so , render him the instrument of greater happiness to others . Hence , it is a benefit to a whole neighborhood , for a single member of it honestly to become rich . In other words , increased productiveness , in one branch of labor , increases productiveness in every branch of labor . Let us call this first individual A , and suppose that before the productiveness of his labor had been increased , he exchanged with another individual , B. , on equal terms . If the labor of A and B were 10 per day , they would exchange with each other at the rate of 10 for 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention , A 's labor produced 20 per day . He would offer to exchange on the same terms as before , but he would offer 20 , and expect from B , 20 in return . But , in consequence of the inferior productiveness of B 's labor , he would not be able to purchase so much ; he could afford to buy only 10 , as before . A , therefore , in order to induce him to exchange , that is , to buy /z/ would abate his price ; that is , would offer to exchange on better terms , and would offer him at the rate of 20 for 15 , or in some such proportion . What B would not purchase at the rate of 10 for 10 , he might be willing to purchase at the rate of 15 for 20 . Thus , we see , they would , in this case , share the benefit between them . But let the labor of B now be increased in productiveness , so that it shall be equal to that of A ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per day . They will now exchange at the same rate as before ; that is , at the rate of 20 for 20 , with this difference , that for one day 's labor , they will both have twice as many objects of desire as before , or as many objects of desire , with half a day 's labor ; that is , both will be twice as rich as before . Thus , the increased productiveness of B , is now a benefit to A , inasmuch as he now receives 20 for 20 , when , before , he only received 15 for 20 . Now it needs but a little reflection to perceive , that the case of A and B , is the case of the whole community . But the case is made still stronger , when the effect of competition is taken into the account . Let the productiveness of labor in any department be ever so great , where labor and capitaLare free , competition will always reduce profit in one department to the same average per cent , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor and capital , in any one mode of employment , be ever so great ; interest and wages , in that employment , will be no higher than they are , other things being equal , in other employments . That is , while the capitalist and the laborer receive the same interest and wages as the rest of the community ; in other words , while the community pay no more for this capital and labor than they pay for any other , they receive a greater amount of value in exchange , and , as much more , as the productiveness of that labor and capital has been iacreased . Thus , capital and labor in the cotton manufacture is not better paid , upon an average , than in other modes of investment and industry . If it were , capital and labor would flow into it , until the equilibrium was restored . But , while this is the fact , we obtain a /z/ yard of cotton cloth for one fourth the price , or at one fourth of the labor , at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times as much as formerly , in return for what we pay for the cost and labor of making cotton cloth . And thus , over the whole world , every instance of increased productiveness , whether it be from the use of natural agents , or from the division of labor , whether in our own country , or in another country , if we choose to avail ourselves of it , enables every man , by paying the producer the same as before , to procure a larger amount of value ; that is , of objects for the gratification of desire ; that is , enables every man to become both richer and happier . The above remarks will , I hope , be sufficient to illustrate the general principle . As , however , there are several consequences resulting from increased productiveness of human labor , especially from the use and improvement of natural agents , which seem at first view to be at variance with what we have here advanced , it ma be necessary to pursue the results somewhat more minutely , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor-saving machinery is prejudicial to the interests of the laboring classes . It may , however , be here premised , that the objection made against natural agents , is not to their use , but to their improvement . Men object to the use of a spinning jenny , but not to the use of a spinning icheel . They dislike a rake by horse power , but do not dislike a rake . But every one must see , that this sort of objection , if it be founded in truth , is by no means sufficiently extensive . A spinning wheel , or a hand loom , or a hand rake , is a labor-saving machine ; and it involves the use of natural agents , just as truly as a spinning jenney , a power loom , or a horse rake . If the use of natural agents be injurious , we should abandon them altogether , and spin , and weave , and rake , with our fingers . But if this would be unwise , and it be conceded that we must use natural agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best that we can procure ; that is , the best that God has given us ? If , as all must allow , the use of /z/ them , up to a certain point ; has conferred an incalculable benefit , what reason have we to suppose , that additional improvement in the use of them will not confer still additional benefit . But , passing this , I proceed to consider the effects of increased productiveness of labor , both upon Producers and Consumers . I. The effects of natural agents upon PRODUCERS . These are either immediate , or ultimate . I. Immediate . It is said that every improvement in machinery*enables the work to be done by fewer laborers , and hence many persons are thrown out of employment ; and that every change in the manner of labor , deprives many persons of the use of that skill , which is their whole means of subsistence . So far as change in the manner of labor is concerned , but little need be said , as this is but a temporary inconvenience . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons must learn to do it , and must be paid for learning . If a man do not choose to learn it , although he would be paid for learning it , and be supported by his labor , after he has learned it , it is his own fault . He may quarrel with his own obstinacy , but he has nothing else to blame . Nor is the simple change of employment a peculiar hardship . Few men pass through life , without , at some time or other , materially modifying their mode of employment , from choice , instead of from necessity . The main difficulty , therefore , which is supposed to result from the use of improved methods of production , is , that they employ a less number of laborers : and , hence , that many laborers are thrown out of employment . In reply to this it might be asked , what is the testimony of facts , in this case . Improvements in machinery have been going on , ever since the creation . Has the demand for labor diminished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laborers been , by these means , driven away ; or , on the contra-/z/ ry , are not these the very districts , to which laborers inevitably resort for employment ? But , aside from this , let us examine the assertion , that some laborers are thrown out of employment . Let us , however , first endeavor to ascertain how great the evil is. 1 . It is not universal . The improved mode of production always requires some labor , and , of course , a portion of those formerly employed must still find employment . To these , there results no other disadvantage , than that of a change in the mode of employment ; but with the meliorating circumstances of higher wages and less fatiguing labor . 2 . It is , by necessity , gradual . Improvements in machinery are made by slow degrees . Although the total change may show a greatly increased productiveness of labor , yet no one single change is often , of itself , great enough to produce a great change in the demand for laborers . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be introduced at once , over a whole nation . Hence , its effects will be , at first , to reduce the wages of those engaged in the former methods of manufacturing . The consequence will be , that no new laborers will learn the trade . This will tend to keep up the wages of those who remain in it . And , lastly : If a new instrument is to be employed , there must be an additional number of men employed to manufacture it . This will , of course , require an additional number of laborers , who must be withdrawn from other employments . This will tend to raise the price of labor , and , of course , either to furnish employment for those who wish to leave the former occupation , or else to keep up the wages of those who choose to remain in it . 3 . The infelicity here spoken of , is no other than that which belongs to the tenure of all property whatsoever . Skill and labor , as well as capital , are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in value , or even to become worthless . u Riches make to themselves wings , and flee away . " The wisdom of man , since the creation , has never yet discovered any link strong enough to connect a human being , indissolubly , with any sublu- /z/ nary possession . The laborer , therefore , in this case , holds his property precisely as any other man holds it , and is subject to no peculiar hardship . Let us however proceed to consider the ultimate effects of increased productiveness upon producers . 1 . The producer shares with the rest of the community in the benefit derived from increased productiveness ; that is , if he earn the same wages as before , he is richer ; and , if he earn less , he is less poor than he would have b ? en , if no such change had taken place . That is to say , money , or , in other words , a given amount of labor , is capable of procuring for him a greater amount of objects of desire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there must be , throughout the whole community , an increased demand for labor . Suppose a community of one hundred men to acquire , by their labor and capital , every year , just enough to support themselves , after defraying the expenses of their several establishments . So long as this state of things continued , there would be no increased demand for laborers ; for there would be no ' additional capital with which to maintain them . The young must therefore emigrate , or else there will be a competition among laborers for work , and thus wages will fall . But , suppose , that by some new mode of increased productiveness , the capital be increased in a single year , twenty-five per cent. , there will then be a demand for the industry of a greater number , say twenty-five additional laborers ; since this additional capital can produce nothing , unless it be united with labor . If there be not twenty-five additional laborers to be immediately procured , wages must rise , because there will be a competition among capitalists for labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices could earn nothing , will now be employed . And , if the demand for labor , arising from this increase of capital , could not be thus supplied , those engaged in less profitable employment in other districts , and other countries , would come in to supply the deficiency . Such is always seen to be the fact . Population follows capital . It goes where capi- /z/ tal goes , and it concentrates where capital accumulates , and it retires when capital retires . And hence , in a whole country , where the number of inhabitants is limited , the increase of capital must raise the rate of wages . And hence , by just so much as increased productiveness of labor increases the amount of capital , it must also tend to raise the price of labor throughout a whole country . That is to say , the obvious tendency of the use of natural agents is , to increase the wages of laborers in general . 3 . But , the tendency of the use of machinery is to increase the wages of laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are employed . The reason for this is obvious . Reduction of price produces an additional demand , more than sufficient to compensate for the diminished amount of labor necessary for the creation of the particular product . That this must always be the case , can , I think , be conclusively shown . Suppose that with the present machinery , one hundred men are able to manufacture cotton cloth at fifty cents per yard , and that the amount which they produce is precisely sufficient to supply the wants of the district for which they labor . At this price , no consumers , but those worth one thousand dollars per year , can afford to purchase cotton cloth , and , of course , the demand is limited exclusively to them . Suppose now , that improved machinery enables fifty men to manufacture as large an amount of cotton cloth as one hundred men could manufacture before , and the consequence is , that cotton cloth is sold at twenty-five cents per yard . It is evident , that if the demand be precisely doubled , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that their condition will be in no manner altered , except by change of labor with its correspondent advantages , and the gradual rise of wages , spoken of above . And , it is also evident , that every degree of increase of demand , beyond what is sufficient to produce this equilibrium must be for the benefit of those engaged in this sort of labor . But it is evident , for several reasons , that the reduc- /z/ f.ion of price one half , must more than double the demand for cotton cloth . Thus , when the price was fifty cents per yard , only those consumers who were worth one thousand dollars per year , could purchase cotton cloth ; and the sale " was , of course , limited to them . But now that it is at twenty-five cents , the class worth only five hundred dollars per year is just as able to purchase it , as those worth one thousand were formerly . Now , if this class were only of the same number as that worth one thousand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laborer would suffer no injury . But the fact is , that the class worth five hundred dollars , is three or four times as large as that worth one thousand . Hence , by all this difference , the laborer is the gainer , and a larger number of laborers is required . But this is not all . There are various classes , between those worth one thousand dollars and those worth five hundred dollars , who are now able to purchase the article , as , those of nine hundred , eight hundred , seven hundred , and six hundred , each one of them being larger than the class of first purchasers . All these unite to increase the . demand for this kind of labor . And again : The class worth one thousand dollars will now use a much larger amount of cotton cloth than formerly ; and cotton cloth will now be used for purposes to which it could never before have been appropriated , and it will supersede the use of many articles , with which it could never before have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits conferred , by the introduction of machinery , or by increasing the productiveness of labor , upon the laborers in this particular department . Every one must see that this benefit , thus resulting from increase of demand , which is the thing now under consideration , is absolutely incalculable . It may be said , that this is an exaggerated case . I answer : The case is not given for the sake of accuracy in numbers , but for the sake of illustrating a manifest tendency . And , that , in this respect it is accurate , the whole history of manufactures bears ample testimony . Compare those states of society m which machinery is /z/ not used , with those in which it is used , and inquire in which of them the wages of the laborer are higher , and in which his habitation displays the greater number of comforts , and in w r hich his shelf is covered with the greater number of books . Examine the statistics of a particular branch of manufacture , and inquire in what period there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest number of laborers required in that particular manufacture . Has this demand for this particular kind of labor been greater in the period when natural agents and machinery have been used , or in that in which they have not been used ? The answer to these questions is given in the history of the progress of the cotton manufacture , the manufacture of books , of nails , of pins , and every other article of common use : and such articles alone are of any consequence in such an estimate . This shows that the above illustration is true , so far as it teaches the tendency , which is all that is necessary in the present case . But this is not all . Suppose the demand for cotton cloth to be doubled , there must be twice the amount of cotton produced ; twice as many vessels built , to transport it ; twice as many men to navigate them ; besides the number of men required to construct the machinery necessary to fabricate it . Suppose the number of books to be doubled ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many rags purchased , twice as many types made , and twice as much transportation required for the supply of the market . All this must add to the demand for labor , and must tend , by just so much , to increase the wages of the operative . And hence , if these considerations be compared , it will be seen : 1 . That the introduction of machinery reduces the price of articles of consumption ; that is , renders the wages , whatever they may be , of the operative , of more value . 2 . That , by the more rapid multiplication of capital , it produces a greater demand for labor in general , that is , it makes the wages of all labor greater ; and 3 . That its tendency is to create an increased demand /z/ for labor ; that is , to produce a rise of wages in that department of industry , into which natural agents are specially introduced ; and it does this according to the degree in which they are introduced . That is , in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborer more valuable ; it raises the wages of labor in general , and raises the wages of labor specially , in that department in which natural agents are employed . What any man ' can reasonably ask for , more than this , I do not distinctly perceive . II . The effects of increased productiveness upon consumers may be easily explained , on the principles already illustrated . I need not , therefore , enlarge upon this subject , as it has already been so frequently alluded to . 1 . By increased productiveness , every consumer is richer ; that is , he is able , by the same amount of labor , to procure a greater amount of the objects of desire . This is evidently the same thing to him , as though his income were increased . If I am able , this year , with two hundred dollars , to purchase as much as I could purchase last year for four hundred dollars , and I can earn two hundred dollars , as easily as before , it . is precisely the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages had risen from two hundred to four hundred dollars . 2 . Production jsmpre perfect . This has already been illustrated , as one of the effects of the use of machinery ; that is , the consumer not only obtains more of the same article for the same sum of money , but he also obtains a better article . Every one must have observed that calicoes , crockery , and many other articles of ordinary consumption , are not only much cheaper , but also much more beautiful , than they were a few years since. , 3 . A vast number of articles is thus added to the means of happiness of the human race , of which , otherwTieTtEey must , from necessity , have been deprived . All that we possess , above the comforts of the naked savage , is the result of the use of natural agents , and of division of labor ; that is , of the increased productiveness of human labor . /z/ 4 . Nor is this all . While all the labor of man is necessary to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual cultivation . As soon , however , as he arrives at that condition of productiveness of labor , in which he is able to provide for his physical wants , with less than all his time and effort , opportunity is afforded for intellectual development . At this point , commences the dawn of intellectual improvement , As increase productiveness affords mcfre abundant leisure , improvement advances . As soon again , as , by improved intellectual power , man begins to discover and apply the laws of nature , a vast accession is made to the power of human productiveness . Henceforth , these two forces conspire to assist each other . Increased productiveness allows of increased time for investigation , discovery , and invention ; and discovery and invention increase the power of productiveness . The more actively these act and re-act upon each other , the more rapid is the progress of society , and the more rapidly . accelerated is the movement of civilization . If this be so , we see how puerile is the prejudice which frequently exists against the use of labor-saving machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing else , tends permanently to improve the condition of the laborer . We see , also , how groundless is the opinion , that education and science are without practical benefit , and that philosophers and students are merely a useless burden upon the community ; since it is knowledge which has given to us all the advantages which we possess over savages , and it is the application of that knowledge , which furnishes employment for nine tenths of the whole community . We see , also , how short-sighted is that national selfishness , which desires to limit and restrict the intercourse between nations ; since it is for the interest of each nation to improve , to the utmost , its own advantages , and to pro1 cure , by exchange with other nations , those productions for the creation of which it possesses , by nature , inferior facilities . /z/ WE have thus far , considered capital and labor , separately , and have endeavored to analyze the nature and functions of each . It is manifest , however , that we have not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of capital and of labor has never yet been employed . In other countries , capital and labor have been united at different periods , with different degrees of success . Hence , while some nations have rapidly accumulated wealth , the wealth of others has remained , for ages , stationary ; and in others , it has diminished . The most fertile soils of Europe and Asia , once the garden of the world , now under the despotism of Turkey , scarcely maintain their sparsely settled inhabitants . It remains for us , therefore , to proceed with our investigation , in order , if possible , to ascertain the laws which influence the application of labor to capital . /z/ In order to arrive at the truth with the greater certainty , it will be proper to consider the circumstances under which man is placed , with reference to the universe around him , so far as this subject is considered . 1 . God has created man with physical and intellectual faculties , adapted to labor . He has given us a mind , adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body adapted to perform all those operations by which , /z/ in obedience to those laws , the objects of desire may be produced . 2 . Labor has been made necessary to the attainment of the means of happiness . No valuable object of desire can be procured without it . Intellectual power can not be attained without intellectual discipline ; nor a knowledge of the laws of nature , without study . Neither physical comforts , nor even physical necessaries , can be obtained , unless labor be first expended to procure them . The universal law ot our existence is , " In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread . " 3 . Labor is necessary to the healthful condition of our powers , both physical and intellectual . Without intellectual labor , the mind becomes enfeebled ; and , were this labor wholly intermitted , it would sink into idiocy or madness . * Without physical labor , the body , feeble and enervated , becomes a prey to pain and disease . 4 . That labor , per se , is pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to our purpose , that it is less painful than idleness and the results of idleness . The laborer complains of his toil , but deprive him of his opportunity for toil , and he becomes miserable . When men are , in our penitentiaries , condemned to solitary confinement , and labor or idleness are left purely to their own . choice , they have never been known to continue longer than a few days , without beseeching , importunately , for work . The veterans who are supported at Greenwich Hospital , England , at the public expense , wholly without labor , are said to be , in general , very unhappy . The uncontrollable desire of children for some sort of employment , illustrates the same truth . Those persons who consider labor as degrading , obey the same law of our nature in another form . The gymnastic exercises of the Greeks and Romans , and the hunting , riding , shooting , and travelling of the moderns , are nothing more than expensive modes of exercise or labor . The poor man exercises himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The one does expensively and unproductively , what the ether /z/ does without expense and productively . Both equally yield obedience to the law of our creation ; and , in what manner soever it is obeyed , both reap advantages , from the mere fact of obeying it . 5 . On the contrary , the Creator has affixed several penalties , which those who disobey this law of their being , can never expect to escape . He who refuses to labor with his mind , suffers the penalty of ignorance . J The amount of this penalty may be estimated , by considering the blessings , both physical and intellectual , of which ignorance deprives us ; and by contrasting the comforts of savage with those of civilized nations , where the physical effort , made by both , is the same . He who refuses to laborwith his hands , suffers , besides the pains of disease , all the evils of poverty , cold , hunger , and nakedness . The results which our Creator has attached to idleness , are all to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this established law of our being . 6 . And , on the other hand , God has assigned to industry , rich and abundant rewards . u The hand of the diligent maketh rich . " " Seest thou a man diligent in his business , he shall stand before kings ; he shall not stand before mean men . " The pleasure , the indepen- - dence , and the power arising from knowledge , are the rewards of intellectual industry . u A wise man is strong , yea , a man of understanding increaseth strength . " And it is only by physical labor , that the riches of the earth are appropriated , and the laws of nature made available to the happiness of man . At the first there existed nothing in our world but the earth , with its spontaneous productions , and capabilities , and helpless and defenceless man . All that now exists of capital , of conven-j ience , of comfort , and of intelligence , is the work of L industry , and is the reward which God has bestowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . J 7 . If such be the facts ; if God have given to all men faculties for labor ; if he have made labor necessary to our happiness ; if he have attached the severest penalties to idleness , and have proffered the richest rewards /z/ to industry ; it would seem reasonable to conclude , that all that was required of us , was , so to construct the arrangements of society , as to give free scope to the laws of Divine Providence . If he have excited us to labor by sufficient rewards , and deterred us from indolence by sufficient penalties , it would seem that our business must be , to give to these rewards and penalties their free and their intended operation . 1 These , at any rate , should be the means first tried , in order to facilitate production ; wr should any others be resorted to , until these have been tried and found ineffectual . The effects of this constitution , under which- we are placed , will , I think , be fully exerted , in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man is permitted to enjoy , in the most unlimited manner , the advantages ol labor . 2 . As every man suffers the consequences of idleness . . And , these being equal , 3 . Labor will be applied to capital , according to the ratio which subsists between the whole amount of capital and the whole number of laborers ; that is , the greater the ratio of capital to the number of laborers , the more active will be their industry , and vice versa . And , 4 . Labor will be applied to capital , in proportion to the knowledge which men possess of the advantages which they shall obtain by labor ; that is , the greater the intelligence , the greater the industry . To these several topics , the four following sections of this chapter will be devoted . /z/ Although God has designed men to labor , yet he has not designed them to labor without reward . Hence , when men devise some form of labor , even for exercise , /z/ they always connect with it some result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watering place of the traveller or tourist . Thus , also , as it is unnatural to labor without receiving benefit from labor , men will not labor continuously nor productively , unless they receive such benefit . And , hence , the greater this benefit , the more j active and spontaneous will be their exertion . In order that every man may enjoy , in the greatest degree , the advantages of his labor , it is necessary , provided always he do not violate the rights of his neighbor , 1st , That he be allowed to gain all that he can ; and , 2d . That having gained all that he can , he be a/-lowed to use it as he will . I. It is necessary that every man be allowed to gain all that he can ; that is , that the arrangements of society be so constructed , that every man be able to render his labor , in the highest degree , available to himself . This will require , 1 . That property be divided . When property is held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs , has an equal , but an undivided and indetermined right to his portion of the revenue . Hence , every one is at liberty to take what he will , and as much as he will , and to labor as much or as little as he pleases . There is , therefore , under such an arrange- " ment , no connexion between labor and the rewards of labor . There is rather a premium for indolence than for industry . In such a case , there will be no regular labor , if indeed there be any labor at all ; and , what is still worse , even the scanty and spontaneous productions of the earth will frequently be gathered before they are ripe , since every one fears , that , if he do not seize them now , he will never enjoy them at all . The forest of an Indian tribe is held in common , and a few hundred families barely subsist upon a territory which , were it divided and tilled , would support a million of civilized men . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of division of property . His bow 1 and arrows , his wigwam , and his clothing are acknowledged to be , in the fullest sense , his own . Were these /z/ to be held , like his land , in common , the whole race would very soon perish , from want of the necessaries of life . On the contrary , as soon as land with all other property is divided , a motive exists for regular and voluntary labor , inasmuch as the individual knows that he , and not his indolent neighbor , will reap the fruit of his toil . Henceforth he begins to create a regular supply of annual product . With increased skill , this annual product increases , and he Begins to convert it into fixed capital , a form of wealth which could scarcely exist without division of property . Every accession to his fixed capital renders his labor more productive , and hence it creates a stronger stimulus to increased exertion . With increased exertion , his annual capital is increased , and a greater surplus remains to be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and increased industry results in more abundant production . Thus , division of property , or the appropriation , to each , of his particular portion of that which God has given to all , lays at the foundation of all accumulation of wealth , and of*all progress in civilization . It is for tHis reason that property held in common , is so generally prejudicial to the best interests of a society . A common , where every one , at will , may pasture his cattle , and a forest , from which every inhabitant may procure his fuel , are encouragements to indolence , and serve to keep a community poor . Thus , also , funds left at large for the support of the poor , on which every one is supposed to have an equal right to draw , have generally been found to foster indolence . Poor laws , in so far as they are to be considered a fund for this purpose , have the same sort of injurious tendency . 2 . But the division of property would be of no avail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless every o-ne be protected in the undisturbed possession of whatever he has rightfully acquired . As no one will labor , unless he knows that he shall reap the fruit of his toil , so no one will take the pains to reap the fruit of his toil , unless he also know that he will be able to hold it , and THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY . ill appropriate it to the purposes of his own gratification . And , hence , we see that human labor is exerted in different countries , very much in proportion as the right of property is both understood and enforced . The right of property may be violated by the individual or by society . It is violated by the individual , by cheating , stealing , robbery , and violation of contracts . And , universally , just as these crimes prevail , production languishes , industry diminishes , and the richest soil fails to support its few and impoverished inhabitants . Such was the case in Europe , during the era of feudal oppression . There was then no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a baronial tyrant , would reap the fruit of his industry . Hence , we see the economical importance of all means which shall prevent the individual violation of the right of property . These means are two . The first is , the inculcation of those Amoral and religious principles , which teach men to respect the rights of others as their own , that is , to obey the law of reciprocityjajjd which present the strongest conceivable reasons for so doing . This is the most certain method of preventing the violation of the right of property , inasmuch as it aims to eradicate those dispositions of mind , from which all violation proceeds . It is also the cheap- . est , as it aims at prevention , which is always more econ v ornical than cure . It is also necessary , inasmuch as good laws will never be enacted , or if enacted , will never be obeyed , only in so far as there exists a moral character in the community sufficiently pure to sustain them . In proportion as these are efficacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the reason why moral ; and religious nations grow wealthy so much more rapidly j than vicious and irreligious nations . The feeling of peirJ feet tranquillity and security , which a high social morality diffuses over a whole community , is one of the most beneficial , as well , as one of the strongest stimulants to universal industry . This is one of the temporal rewards ! which God bestows upon social virtue . And , inasmuch as no one can enjoy this reward , simply by being virtu- /z/ ous himself , but only as his fellow citizens also are virtuous , we see the indication in our constitution , that it is the duty , as well as the interest , of every man , to labor to render other men more virtuous . 3 . But inasmuch as all men are not influenced in their conduct by moral and religious principles , it is necessary that aggression be somehow prevented , and violations of property , in so far as possible , redressed . Hence , the importance of wholesome and equitable laws , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shall carry the decisions of law faithfully into effect . Hence the expense , necessary for the most perfect administration of justice , is among the most productive of all the expenditures of society . Good law , and the faithful administration of it , are always the cheapest law , and the cheapest administration of it . The interests of man require that law should be invariably executed , and that its sovereignty should , under all circumstances , be inviolably maintained . But the right of property may be violated by society . It sometimes happens , that society , or government , which is its agent , though it may prevent the infliction of wrong by individuals upon each other , is by no means averse to inflicting wrong or violating the right of individuals itself . This is done , where governments seize upon the property of individuals by mere arbitrary act , a form of tyranny , with which all the nations of Europe were , of old , too well acquainted . It is also done , by unjust legislation ; that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , by which the property of a part , or of the whole , is unjustly taken away , or what is the same thing subjected to oppressive taxation . Of all the destructive agencies which can be brought to tear upon production , by far the most fatal , is public oppression . It drinks up the spirit of a people , by inflicting wrong through means of an agency which was created for the sole purpose of preventing wrong ; and which was intended to be the ultimate and faithful refuge of the friendless . When the antidote to evil , becomes the source of evil , what hope for man is left ? When /z/ society itself sets the example of peculation , what shall prevent the individuals of the society from imitating that example ? Hence , public injustice is always the prolific parent of private violence . The result is , that capital emigrates , production ceases , and a nation either sinks down in hopeless despondence ; or else the people , harassed beyond endurance , and believing that their condition can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrors of civil war ; the social elements are dissolved ; the sword enters every house ; the holiest ties which bind men together are severed ; and no prophet can predict , at the beginning , what will be the end . Hence we see the importance to the industry of a country , of a constitution which guarantees , to the individual , immunity not only from private , but also from public oppression . Wherever this immunity is wanting , the progress of a nation in wealth will be slow . It is owing . rather to the freedom of her institutions and the equity of her laws , than to her physical advantages , that Great Britain has so far outstripped all other European nations in the accumulation of wealth , and in every thing that confers social power . It is almost superfluous , however , to add , that a free constitution is of no value , unless the moral and intellectual character of a people be sufficiently elevated to avail itself of the advantages which it offers . It is merely an instrument of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral disposition to use it aright . To sum up what has been said : Labor will be applied to capital , in proportion as every man is allowed to gain all that he can ; that is , as property is most perfectly divided ; and as this division is most strictly enforced ; that is , as the right of property is guarded by the most equitable laws ; and as there exist the strongest guarantees that these laws will be inviolate , whether they relate to individuals or to society . , II . The second part of the condition mentioned in the beginning of this section is , that the individual be allowed to use his own as he will . To this , is of course /z/ to be added the condition , that he use it in such manner , as not to interfere with the rights of his neighbor. p " A man 's possessions are his talents , faculties , skill , and the wealth and reputation which these have enabled him to acquire ; in other words , his industry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital with the greatest energy , it is necessary that every man be at liberty to use them both as he will ; that is , that both of them be free . And first , of industry . The aptitudes of men for different employments are very dissimilar . The choice of every man naturally leads him to that employment for which he is best adapted . By allowing every man , therefore , to employ his industry as he chooses , every man will be employed about that for which he is best adapted ; and hence , the production of all will be greatly increased , because we thus avail ourselves of the pe culiar productiveness of every individual . Nor is this all . By allowing every man to labor as he chooses , we very greatly increase the happiness of every individual . And every one knows that a man will labor with better success when his labor is pleasant , than when it is irksome . The case is the same with respect to capital . Every man is more interested in his own success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence , every man is likely to ascertain more accurately in what manner he can best employ his capital , than any other man can ascertain it for him . If every man , therefore , be allowed to invest his capital as he will , the whole capital of a country will be more profitably invested , than under any other circumstances whatever . And , since , when he is left thus at liberty , there will be the greatest gain to the capitalist , there will also be the greatest stimulus to his industry ; for the stimulus to labor is always in proportion to the rewards of labor . And , on the contrary , in just so far as , by any means , this productiveness is diminished , the stimulus to labor is also diminished with it . It may be said that men , if left to themselves , will be liable to invest their capital unwisely . Granted . Man /z/ is not omniscient , and therefore this liability can not be avoided . The question , therefore , is , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , who reaps the benefit of success and suffers the evils of failure , be less likely to judge correctly , than he whose faculties are quickened by no such responsibility ? Nor is this all . Not only are legislators , who generally assume the labor of directing the manner in which labor or capital shall be employed , in no manner peculiarly qualified for this task ; they are , in many respects , peculiarly disqualified for it . The individual is liable to no peculiar biases , in making up his mind in respect to the profitableness of an investment . If he err , it is because the indications deceive him . The legislator , besides being liable to err by mistaking the indications , is liable to be misled by party zeal , by political intrigue , and by sectional prejudice . What individual would succeed in his business , if he allowed himself to be influenced in the manner of conducting it , by such considerations ? And must not like causes always produce like results ? Besides , every man feels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital and his industry as he pleases , provided he interfere not with the rights of another ; and that , to restrict him in this use , is injustice . We have before said , that nothing paralyzes industry like oppression , and it is as true in this case , as in any other . If this sort of interference be violent or frequently repeated , capital and labor , whose motto , like that of Dr. Franklin , is , " Where liberty dwells , there is my country , " will emigrate to some more congenial social atmosphere . And if the interference be not so intolerable as to produce these results , yet , in just so far as it has any effect , it is all of this kind , and , by its whole operation , must diminish the incitements to industry . And , on the contrary , just in proportion as every individual is free to employ his industry and capital as he chooses , and thus both to receive a larger compensation for his labor , and also to labor more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investment of capital . /z/ If this be so , we see the impolicy of several forms of legislative interference , in relation to this subject . 1 . We see what must be the effects of monopolies . A monopoly is an exclusive right granted to a man , or to ' a company of men , to employ their labor or capital in some particular manner . Such was the exclusVe right granted to the East India Company , to import into the ports of Great Britain , or her territories , the productions of all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope . Such were the privileges granted formerly by Spain , to particular individuals or companies , of importing foreign commodities into the ports of her colonies in South America . The result of this exclusion was to prevent all other persons , except those thus favored , from investing their capital in this manner ; and hence , to reduce the value of that capital , by precisely the amount of this effect . Nor is this all . Those who hold this exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foir their commodities whatever they choose . Here is , therefore , a two-fold injustice ; first , the means of the consumer are diminished ; and secondly , the price which he must pay , is enhanced at the mere will of his oppressor. 2 . Hence we see the impolicy of obliging an individual , or a class of individuals , to engage in any labor , or to make any investment , contrary to their wishes . Thus , we are told that during the French revolution , some individuals were punished capitally , for raising cattle instead of wheat . Men may call this legislation , but the true name for it is robbery . To oblige a man to raise a crop worth fifteen dollars per acre , when he would otherwise have raised one worth twenty dollars per acre , is just the same thing as to let him do as he pleases , and then rob him of five dollars an acre afterwards . The wrong is the more intense , in the former case , inasmuch as it is done under the semblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the robber does not , that they have the right to do it . Such legislation as this will , in any country , soon produce a famine . 3 . Another form of injury under this class , is seen in /z/ the restrictions upon industry , formerly , if not now , existing in many of the countries of Europe . By these regulations , artisans were prohibited the exercise of more than one trade ; they were not allowed to exercise that trade , unless they had served a prescribed apprenticeship ; nor unless they joined a particular trade-society , and bound themselves to comply with certain restrictions , as , for instance , to sell at particular prices , and never to employ beyond a certain number of apprentices . The result of all this oppression is most iniquitous . It reduces the value of skill and industry , the sole estate of the laborer ; and places him in the power of those whose interest it is to reduce the supply as much as possible , in order to secure to themselves the most exorbitant profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry must be kept out of employment ; and , of course , production is , to this whole amount , diminished . The tyranny of trades-unions , though emanating from the people instead of the government , produces precisely the same effect . 4 . The same effect is partially produced by any mode of legislation , by which , in consequence of favor shown to one party , which of course another party must pay for , men are obliged to exchange an employment , for which they have peculiar facilities , for another which they do not prefer , and for which they have not the same facilities . The manner in which this would lessen the stimulus to industry , has already been illustrated . Thus , should our government , believing that commerce was more valuable to this country than manufactures , lay a tax , sufficient to meet the expenses of the government , upon all American manufactures , in order to increase the amount of foreign importation , this would drive manufacturers out of business and oblige them to become merchants and agriculturists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminish the stimulus to industry throughout the whole country . Men would not voluntarily engage in manufactures in preference to commerce , unless they found manufactures to be more profitable ; and to . oblige them to exchange the one for the /z/ other , is , therefore , to oblige them to leave a more productive for a less productive mode of employment . By all this difference is the country the loser , and the incitement to industry diminished . 5 . Hence , we also see the impolicy of laws regulating consumption . Such are sumptuary laws ; or those which limit the degree of expensiveness in our dress , clothing , or equipage . These were formerly common in Europe . Such also are laws which forbid or restrict the expenditure of money for the purposes of benevolence , religion , or any thing of this sort . Every one must see that one of the incitements to industry , is- the pleasure which men expect to derive from expenditure . Now , if this expenditure be innocent , it matters not what sort of expenditure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it can in no manner interfere with it , without doing injustice , and taking away one of the strongest inducements to industry . /z/ If God have made labor necessary to our well being , n our present state ; if he have set before us sufficient rewards to stimulate us to labor ; and if he have attached to idleness correspondent punishments , it is manifest that the intention of this constitution will not be accomplished , unless both of these classes of motives are allowed to operate upon man . We shall , therefore , cooperate with Him , in just so far as we allow his designs to take effect in the manner he intended . Now this result will be accomplished , 1 . By the division of property . When property is perfectly divided , and every thing is owned by some /z/ one , and every one knows what is his own , nothing is left in common . Of course , no man can then obtain any thing more than he now possesses , unless he obtain it by labor . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these are exclusively his own ; and as every one , who possesses capital , desires to employ labor with which to combine it , every man who possesses his natural faculties , has the means by which he may obtain something for his subsistence . The division of property is thus favorable to the laborer ; inasmuch as , in consequence of it , every one needs his labor , and also has something to give him in exchange for it . 2 . But suppose property to be universally divided . A man may possess himself , either dishonestly or by begging , of the property for which he has not labored . The dishonest acquisition of property , as by cheating , stealing , or robbery , will be prevented by the strict and impartial administration of just and equitable laws . Hence , we see that the benefit of such laws is two-fold . They encourage industry , first , by securing to the industrious the righteous reward of their labor ; and , secondly , by inflicting upon the indolent the just punishment of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences which God has attached to their conduct . Being thus thrown upon their own resources , they must obey the law of their nature , and labor , or else suffer the penalty and starve . If any man complain that this is a hardship , he must mean that this hardship has reference to our relations either to man or to God . So far as our relations to man are concerned , there can certainly be no hardship ; for every thing that we see is the result of labor , and is either the result of the labor of him that holds it , or of him who voluntarily parte.d with it for an equivalent in labor . Now r as every thing we see is the result of labor , the question is , who shall enjoy this result of labor , he who has labored , or he who has not . If it be a hardship for a man not to enjoy that for which he has not labored ; it would certainly be a much greater hardship for a man not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So that , the hardship would be greater if the system were arranged to suit the complainant , than it is now , under the system of which he complains . If the hardship turn upon our relations to God ; that is , if a man complain because God made him to labor , it is a difficulty which the complainant must settle with his Maker . We have nothing to do with it . But since God has ordained- it , we can not help it , and an indolent man has no just cause of grief with his fellow men , if they see fit to act according to it . II . But men may be relieved from the necessity of labor , by charity . It will be understood that I here speak of men as poor from indolence , and not by visitation of God . I do not here refer to the sick , the infirm , the aged , the helpless , the widow , the fatherless , and the orphan . When God has seen fit to take away the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he always teaches us , that this mode of expenditure of our property is more pleasing to him than any other . With this mode of charity I have now nothing to do . I speak only of provisions for the support of the poor , simply because he is poor ; and of provisions to supply his wants , without retiring the previous exertion of his labor . Of this kind are poor laws , as they are established in England , and in some parts of our own country , and permanent endowments left to particular corporations for the maintenance of the simply indigent . Now such provisions we suppose to be injurious , for several reasons . 1 . They are at variance with the fundamental law of government , that he who is able to labor , shall enjoy only that for which he has labored . If such be the law of God for us all , it is best for all , that all should be subjected to it . If labor be a curse , it is unjust that one part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , as is the fact , it be a blessing , there is no reason why all should not equally enjoy its advantages . 2 . They remove from men the fear of want , one of the most natural and universal stimulants to labor . Hence , in just so far as this stimulus is removed , there /z/ will be , in a given community , less labor done ; that is , less product created . 3 . By teaching a man to depend upon others , rather than upon himself , they destroy the healthful feeling of independence . When this has once been impaired , and the confidence of man in the connexion between labor and reward is destroyed , he becomes a pauper for life . It is in evidence , before the committee of the British House of Commons , that , after a family has once applied for assistance from the parish , it rarely ceases to apply regularly , and most frequently , in progress of time , for a larger and larger measure of assistance . 4 . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of paupers . It is a discouragement to industry , and a bounty upon indolence . With what spirit will a poor man labor , and retrench , to the utmost , his expenses , when he knows that he shall be taxed to support his next-door neighbor , who is as able to work as himself ; but who is relieved from the necessity of a portion of labor , merely by applying to the overseer of the poor for aid . 5 . They are , in principle , destructive to the right of property , because they must proceed upon the concession , that the rich are under obligation to support the poor . If this be so ; if he who labors be under obligation to support him that labors not ; then the division of property and the right of property are at an end : for , he who labors has no better right to the result of his labor , than any one else . 6 . Hence , they tend to insubordination . For , if the rich are under obligation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? nay , why not to support them as well as themselves ? Hence the larger provision therd is of this kind , the greater will be the liability to collis ion between the two classes . If this be so , we see , that in order to accomplish the designs of our Creator in this respect , and thus present the strongest inducement to industry , I. Property should be universally appropriated , so that nothing is left in common . /z/ 2 . The right of property should be perfectly protected , both against individual and social spoliation. 3 . There should be no funds in common provided for the support of those who are not willing to labor . 4 . That if a man be reduced , by indolence or prodigality , to such extreme penury that he is in danger of perishing , he should be relieved , through the medium of labor ; that is , he should be furnished with work , and be remunerated with the proceeds . 5 . That those who are enabled only in part to earn their subsistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiency only . And hence , that all our provisions for the relief of the poor , be so devised as not to interfere with this law of our nature . By so directing our benevolent energies , the poor are better provided for ; they are happier themselves ; and a great and constantly increasing burden is removed from the community . It has been found that alms-houses , conducted on this plan , will support themselves ; and sometimes even yield a small surplus revenue . This surplus , however , should always be given to the paupers , and should never be received by the public . The principle should be carried out , that the laborer is to enjoy the result of his industry . For the same reason , penitentiaries and State prisons should always be places of assiduous and productive labor . Idleness is a most prolific parent of crime . If the vicious could be accustomed to labor , one half of their reformation would be effected . Besides , by this means , a great diminution would be effected in the expense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred able-bo.died men , and such are generally the tenants of our prisons , should not both support themselves , and pay for the superintendence necessary to their labor . In a well regulated prison , hey will always do this . There must always be something deeply culpable in the arrangements of such an institution , where this is not the result . And thus where a society is so organized , that every man is left to suffer the results of idleness ; that is , /z/ where labor is made necessary to the acquisition of every thing desirable , and where the results of that labor are most perfectly secured to the laborer , there will exist the greatest stimulus to labor , and , of course , production will be most rapidly augmented . /z/ The principle to be considered in this section may be thus illustrated . Capital is useless , that is , will yield no re venue , , unless it be united with labor . A farm will yield nothing , unless it be tilled , and the grain harvested ; raw cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmen to labor in it . Hence , every jnan who holds capital , is desirous of uniting it with industry , that he may share , with the laborers , the profits of the resulting product . On the contrary , he who has industry is desirous of uniting it with capital , because , unless he can so unite it , it will yield nothing in return . A man can earn nothing by spending his whole time in beating the air . Hence , when the number of laborers is great ; that is , where labor is abundant , and the amount of capital small , there will be a competition of laborers for work , " and the price of labor will fall ; that is , the laborer will receive a less compensation for his work . On the contrary , when the number of laborers is small , and the amount of capital great , there will be competition among capitalists for labor ; that is , the price of labor will rise ; and the laborer will receive a greater compensation for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of capital , in proportion to the number of laborers , the greater will be the rate of wages , and , of course , the stronger the stimulus to industry . It deserves , however , to be remarked , that this principle is liable to some important modifications . Thus , it /z/ is practically true , only in so far as men continue to be operated upon by the hope of reward . When this ceases to operate , and wages are so low as to render the utmost amount of labor necessary to avoid starvation , men will work more assiduously , the lower the wages ; that is , the nearer they are to actual starvation . But , to this , there is also a limit . Human beings can not long endure great toil , under the depressing influences of despair . Many very soon die , and thus a diminished population again raises the price of labor . Another common result of such a condition of laborers , is domestic insurrection . Men who have long stood on the borders of starvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change could their condition be made worse ; hence cupidi rerum novarum , they unite under any agitator who promises them bread ; the whole fabric of society is prostrated ; and civil war and anarchy succeed . Another modification of this principle , is the following : I have said above , that the stimulus to labor is in proportion to the wages of labor . This will be true , only of those cases where the facilities of gratifying desire are equal . Although wages be high , yet if only few objects of desire can be procured in exchange for them , there will be wanting one important element in stimulating the human being to labor . Hence , the stimulus to labor will be the most effective , when the wages are highest , and when , by means of wages , the greatest number of desires can be gratified . Thus , in a newly settled country'of great fertility , wages are high , because a vast amount of land is open to cultivation , and a proprietor can afford to give a high price for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rate of wages , because , ihe desires which can be gratified in a new country are few , and a man can procure all that is attainable with a less amount of labor than he is able to exert . Hence , the reason why men labor so intensely in prosperous seasons , in large cities . The remuneration at such times is high , and the desires which wealth can gratify are innumerable . A merchant ux New York , during the season of business , when prof- /z/ its are high , will cheerfully impose upon himself , labor , which he knows will , in all probability , ruin his constitution ; labor , which , he would not , on any account , impose upon a slave . Hence , we see that the accumulation of capital is more for the advantage of the laborer than of the capitalist . The greater the ratio of capital to labor , the greater will be the share of the product that falls to the laborer . The greater the ratio of labor to capital , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the capitalist . Hence , the laboring classes are really more interested in the increase of the capital of a country , than the wealthy classes . Hence , when one class of the community repine at the prosperity of another class$ they repine at their own mercies , and the means of increasing their own rate of compensation . It is , however , evident , that the accumulation of capital , in any nation , does not depend simply upon its annual production , but upon the proportion that its annual production bears to its annual expenditure . A country that annually expends all its production , let it produce ever so much , will never increase its capital . A country that produces ever so little , if it annually expend somewhat less than its revenue , will be accumulating something ; and must , in progress of time , become richer than its more highly favored neighbor . This explains the fact , that the countries blessed with the richest soils , and the greatest natural advantages , have not generally become the richest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse . Hence , we see , that every mode of unnecessary ex penditure , whether individual or national , by diminishing the annual accumulation of capital , tends directly to lower the rate of wages , and thus injure the condition of the laboring classes . The millions which are wasted and destroyed by intemperance , if saved , would add to the capital of a country , and thus increase the demand for labor . All unnecessary expenditure , for the maintenance of civil government , has , of course , the same tendency . Hence arises , also , one of the most afflicting /z/ consequences of war . Had the almost incalculable sums which Great Britain has expended in wars , for the last hundred years , been added to her operative capital , and , but for these wars , it would have been so added , all her inhabitants would have found , at all times , abundant employment , and , at a rate of wages , which would , by this time , have banished almost the recollection of poverty from her shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a people , in two ways . 1st . By exciting a people to exertion ; and , 2d . By directing that exertion. 1 . Intellectual cultivation excites a people to exertion . Ignorant men are indolent , because they know neither the results that may be accomplished , nor the benefits that may be secured , by industry . This is one of the most common causes of the great indolence of savage nations . An Indian , who knows of no condition better than his own , of no covering better than a skin , of no habitation better than his wigwam , and pf no weapon better than his bow and arrow , has no motive to industry , beyond what may be adequate to procure these simple necessaries . Let him know that , by additional effort , he can pro vine himself with a blanket , and , by a still additional effort , that he can exchange his bow and ar row for a rifle , and his wigwam for a comfortable house , and you present motives to additional labor . His industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same with a nation , at a more advanced period of its history . Hence , the impulse which is always given to industry , by any important improvement in the intel- /z/ lectual character of a people . It was a knowledge of the conveniences and luxuries of the East , which the crusaders brought back to western Europe , that was the precursor and the cause of that dawning of improvement which succeeded the night of the dark ages . 2 . Intellectual cultivation directs to a profitable end , the industry which it has previously excited . Agriculture will " be successfully prosecuted , only in proportion as men are acquainted with the best modes and seasons of culture , the laws of vegetable and animal physiology , and the probable existence of that demand which it will be most profitable to supply . Manufacturing labor will be successful , in proportion @#@ * as the manufacturer is able , by his knowledge , to avail himself of the improvements of other countries , to understand the laws of nature , and invent means of applying them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by his intelligence , to modify his occupation in any manner that may be for his interest . The Merchant will be successful in proportion as he is able to select the most profitable places and times for exchange , to foresee the probable alternations of the market , and to avail himself of the fluctuations of capital which are always taking place , in various parts of the civilized world . And , in general , it is evident that , with a given amount of labor and of capital , production will be exactly in proportion to the knowledge which the operator possesses of the laws which govern that department in which he labors , and to the degree in which his labor conforms to his knowledge . If , then , labor will be in proportion to the benefits which it confers ; and if , by knowledge , these benefits are increased , we see in what manner labor must be stimulated by intellectual cultivation . Thus we see how it is , that an intelligent people is always industrious , and an ignorant people always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banishing indolence , is to banish ignorance from a country . But , it is evident , that improvement in knowledge , in order to be in any signal degree beneficial , must be uni* /z/ versal . A single individual can derive but little advan tage from his knowledge and industry if he be surround ed by a community both ignorant and indolent . In just so far as other men improve their condition , and become useful to themselves , they become useful to him ; and both parties thus become useful to each other . This is specially the case , where a government is , in its character , popular ; that is , where laws emanate from the more numerous classes . In such a case , not only is an intelligent man not benefited , but he is positively injured , by the ignorance and indolence of his neighbors . Hence , the reason why every man has a personal interest in , the intellectual improvement of every one of his fellow citizens ; and why the education of the whole population should be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole country . The efforts of a government maybe usefully directed , in this respect , to two objects . 1st . The increase ; and 2d . The dissemination of knowledge . First . The increase of knowledge . This may be promoted in several ways . 1 . By the establishment of colleges , universities , and other seminaries of learning . These , I suppose , should be furnished by the public , with libraries , apparatus , and all the means for instruction , investigation , and discovery . They should be so governed , and the remuneration so adjusted , that teachers should be placed under the strongest stimulus to labor for the promotion of science , and to communicate , most successfully , knowledge to their pupils . Colleges and universities should , at all times , be places of strenuous effort , and vigorous mental discipline , on the part of both instructors and pupils . As soon as they become the places of literary leisure , and intellectual indolence , they are not only useless , but hurtful ; inasmuch as they retard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this reason , I doubt whether endowments , for the support of professorships , are liseful ; at least , whenever they render a teacher 's support independent of his own exertions . For the same reason , a teacher should not /z/ be remunerated by a fixed salary , but by the sale of 1 tickets of admission to his lectures , or by a salary , vary- ing with his ability and success . Large foundations for " " the support of students in colleges , if under the control of the college itself , so far as they render the number of students in no way dependent upon the ability and faithfulness of the instructor , will have a tendency to remove from him one of the most valuable stimulants to industry . 2 . By rewarding those who have been successful in the advancement of science . 1 . This may be done , first , Directly- ) as " by bestowing premiums , rewards , grants of money , &c.,; to those who have made discoveries of pre-eminent utility . This is frequently done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , it is done wisely . In this country , however , it is , I believe , never practiced . The only rewards which we ever confer , are for military or naval service . The propriety of those , I by no means , in this place , dispute ; yet , I think it would be difficult to show , that warriors are the only benefactors of mankind , or that Whitney or Fulton did not deserve as well of their country , for the invention of the cotton gin and the application of steam to navigation , as they would have done , had they captured a fleet on the ocean , or routed a tribe of Indians in the forest . 2 . Indirectly , by granting to those who labor in science or invention , the right to derive advantage from their discoveries or inventions . This is done by laws 6Jf* " " copy and patent right . The justice of this provisional we h.ive elsewhere shown . We here see the manner , in which , by stimulating intellectual labor , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hence , facilitate production . Secondly . A government may improve the intellect- ' ual character of a people , by the dissemination of knowledge . This will be done , so far as provision is made 1 for the universal instruction of a people in the elements of a common education . The interest of every man demands that all his fellow citizens should be able to /z/ read and write , to keep accounts , to understand geography , and thus possess the means of self-improvement , to whatever degree they may be disposed to carry it . The effect of such a diffusion of knowledge , has already been illustrated at sufficient length . It will be necessary here only to allude to the means , by which this result may be best attained . 1 . As a stimulus to intellectual improvement , probably , the right of suffrage should be restricted to those who are able to read and write . 2 . Provision should be made , in every neighborhood , for the education of all children under a certain age . 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a general fund . This fund should , however , never defray more than a portion of the expense ; for no man values , highly , what he gets for nothing . If a fund be raised for this purpose , great care must be taken that it be not abused . 4 . Without a fund , the same result will probably be better accomplished by obliging every district , contain ing a given number of inhabitants , to provide itself with a school , on penalty of a fine to be paid to the school districts in its neighborhood , for the purposes of instruction . j 5 . To complete this arrangement , it might , probably , - be desirable that seminaries be provided for the purpose of educating teachers for the primary schools . This would ensure a supply of instructors , of assured qualifications , without which , such a system might not so readily go into successful operation . And now , to sum up what has been said : It will be seen that the inducements to labor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of happiness , in any give ; ; country , must depend , principally , upon two conditions , 1st . The degree of its intelligence ; and , 2d . The pu- v rity of its moral character . l 1 . On its intelligence will depend its knowledge of its own advantages , of the laws of nature , and of the means by which it may avail itself of those laws , for the promotion of its own happiness . A nation without knowledge , /z/ like a blind man in the garden of Eden , might be surrounded with every thing lovely to the eye or delightful to the taste , without ever being able to ascertain , either where a single object of desire was to be found , or how the possession of it might be secured . 2 . On the moral character of a nation depends the justice of its laws , its respect for individual right , secu- rity of property , individual and social virtue , together 1 with the industry and frugality which are their invariable . j attendants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to national prosperity . For , where virtue , frugality , and respect for right exist , riches will , by natural consequence , accumulate ; and intellectual cultivation will , of necessity , succeed . But , intellectual cultivation may easily exist , without the existence of virtue or love of right . In this case , its only effect is , to stimulate desire , and this , unrestrained by the love of right , must eventually overturn the social fabric which it at first erected . Hence , the surest means of promoting the welfare of a country is , to cultivate its intellectual , but especially its moral character . Until this have been done , no permanent foundation for a nation 's prosperity has yet been laid . And , if any one will take the pains to examine , he will find , that , other things being equal , the wealth , and happiness " , and power of every nation , are in exact proportion to its intellectual and moral character . And , here , it may not be amiss to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less upon principles of political economy , than of philanthropy . The circTflation of the Scriptures , the inculcation of moral and religious truth upon the minds of men , by means of Sabbath schools , and the preaching of the Gospel , are of the very greatest importance to the productive energies of a country . The argument is very short , but it seems very conclusive . No nation can rapidly accumulate or long enjoy the means of happiness , except as it is pervaded by the love of individual and social right ; but the love of individual and social right will never prevail ; without the practical influence of the motives and /z/ sanctions of religion ; and these motives and sanctions will never influence men , unless they are , by human effort , brought to bear upon the conscience . The same principles , will defend , upon economical grounds , the efforts of benevolence on behalf of foreign nations . Intelligence , virtue , and equitable laws , will have the same effect upon other men , that they have rupon us . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and raise them from a savage to a civilized state . Just in proportion as a nation is thus ' transformed , are its products increased ; the riches of the whole world are augmented ; the portion of wealth , which falls to the share of each man , is rendered greater ; and the ratio of capital to labor is higher . Just as a nation becomes intelligent and rich , its wants are multiplied , and the means for supplying them are provided . Hence , it becomes a better customer to other nations ; it gives an additional impulse to their industry ; and it % repays them for their products , with whatever God has bestowed upon it , which will add to the happiness of others . Can any one doubt that Great Britain and France reap incomparably greater advantages from each other , in their present condition of advanced civilization , than either of them would , if the other were in the condition in which it was found by Julius Caesar ? What demand would Great Britain make upon the productions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabited by half-naked savages ? Or again : How much greater benefits does North America confer upon the world , than it would if it were peopled by its aboriginal inhabitants ? How great a stimulus would be given to the industry of the world , at this time ; and how greatly would the comforts and luxuries of men be increased , if Africa were peopled by civilized and christianized men ? Now , if these things be so ; and that they are so , I see not that any one can dispute ; it seems to me , that civilized nations could in no way so successfully promote their own interests , as by the universal dissemination of the means of education and the principles of religion . /z/ l.0 , SECTION VI . /z/ I have thus far said nothing upon the effect of legislative enactments , by means of bounties and protecting duties , as a means of increasing production . The reason is , that I have not yet been able to discover in what manner they produce this effect . Nevertheless , since many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might seem that a discussion of this subject was incomplete , if they were passed over in silence . I shall devote this section to a consideration of their effects . 1 . Duties of this sort are to be considered apart from those levied for the support of government , because they are either not necessary for this purpose , or else they are levied for a different object . Thus , if five per cent , on an import be necessary to the support of government , and ten per cent , be levied , in order to favor , or , as it is said , to protect one branch of industry , the additional five per cent , is levied for a distinct object , aside from that of the support of government . It is only this latter part of the duty which we propose to consider ; that is , so much of the duty as is levied for the purpose of favoring one particular product . 2 . Now , if such a duty have any effect upon the pro ductiveness of a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must either first increase the capital of a country ; or , secondly , increase its number of laborers ; or , third , create a greater stimulus to labor . I think it evident , from what has already been shown , that every condition which affects production , must exert its influence in one of these three methods . 3 . I think it evident , that legislation of this sort can not increase the capital of a country . The capital of a country , at any moment , is its present amount of annual and fixed capital . Now , a law can not create capital ; /z/ since , if it could , there would be no necessity for any other labor than that of legislation ; and , in order to grow rich , a nation would have nothing to do but meet in public assembly , and spend its whole time in making and hearing speeches , and enacting laws . I believe , however , that this mode of growing rich , has never been found remarkably successful . If it be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital to our own country , I answer : this depends not upon legislation , but upon the rate of interest , and the security of property . If these conditions be more favorable here than in another country , capital will flow hither . If they be more favorable in another country than here , it will flow thither . The system of Great Britain has been exclusive , but capital does not go from this country to be invested there . 4 . Legislation of this kind can not increase the actual number of laborers . The number of laborers is as the number of inhabitants . Legislation has never been supposed to have any power to create men . It is true , population is found always to increase with the increase of the means of living ; that is , with the increase of the productiveness of labor . Population will increase or diminish , just in proportion as a laborer is able to procure greater or less wages for a day 's labor ; that is , as every thing is cheaper or dearer . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains to be considered . It must , however , be evident to all , that laws do not create human beings ; of course , they add nothing to the number of laborers , that is , of human beings in a country . It may be said , we may thus induce laborers to come from other countries . To this it may be answered ; this will depend upon the wages of labor . If laborers be better paid here than elsewhere , they will come here , and not otherwise . Besides , what is called protection changes only the mode of labor ; that is , it takes men from one mode of labor , to employ them upon another . Suppose , then , that it attracts foreign laborers to one branch of industry ; it deters those in another branch of industry from immigrating . If , for instance , manufactur- /z/ ers are protected , this will tend to encourage manufacturers to immigrate ; but it will , in a correspondent proportion , discourage agriculturists. 5 . If , then , discriminating duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulating industry ; that is , while the amount of capital and the number of laborers remain the same , by stimulating men to labor more industriously , and thus to create a greater amount of production than they would under other circumstances . This , I believe , is supposed to be the way in which the system produces its effect . This is the point of view in which we shall now proceed to consider it . The manner in which this is done is the following : Suppose a country to be under a free system , and that every one is devoting himself to agriculture , commerce , or manufactures , as he finds it the most for his interest ; under these circumstances , there will be a certain average of productiveness , both of labor and of capital . Woollen cloth can be procured , by exchange , for five dollars a yard ; but it can not , in the present state of the country , be manufactured for less than ten dollars a yard ; that is , capital and labor are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be abstracted from other employments at the same rate of profit , unless the manufacturer could receive ten dollars a yard for his cloth . Now suppose , that , in order to enable him to do this , a duty of five dollars a yard is levied on imported cloth , by which the price of all cloth is raised to ten dollars a yard , that it may be in the power of the manufacturer , to employ his capital and labor in this manner . There is no doubt that thus the manufacture of cloth might be established . Now I think it evident , upon inspection , that the productiveness of labor is not , by this operation , increased . The reason why cloth was not manufactured before , was , that the productiveness of labor and capital , in this mode of investment , was lower than the average productiveness of labor and capital in other modes of investment . All that has been effected is , to raise the productiveness her* to the general average elsewhere . /z/ There has been nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in any other employment ; for i presume that no one will contend , that one kind of industry should be really more highly paid than another ; nor that , if it were desired , it could be effected without the aid of a direct monopoly . But the manufacturer now gets ten dollars for that which before would bring only five . Let us inquire whence this additional five dollars comes . It is evident that government possesses nothing . All that it possesses is precisely so much taken from the annual revenue of individuals . In this case , therefore , it really bestows nothing , but only causes a transfer of annual revenues , from one party to another . The case is , therefore , the same as it would be if , while there had been no duty imposed , every man had been allowed to buy cloth for five dollars a yard , but had been obliged , for every yard that he bought , to pay five dollars to the manufacturer . It would be the same thing to both parties as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pay ten dollars a yard for cloth , and the manufacturer might sell it for five , if he received five more as a gratuity . . The five dollars that have been added to the revenue of the one , are precisely five dollars taken from the revenue of the other . Now if this be the fact , inasmuch as what is added to the productiveness of the industry of the one class , is taken from the productiveness of the industry of the other class , it would seem that what the one has gained , the other has lost ; and hence , that there can be no increased stimulus to industry on the whole , since , by as much as the one is stimulated , the other is depressed . But this is not all . What you have given to the one class has only raised his mode of labor to the pdint of productiveness at which that of all the other classes existed before ; while the means by which this has been effected , has , to the whole amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes lower than it was before . By just as much as this productiveness has been diminished , by so much has the stimulus to industry been , upon the whole , decreased . /z/ PROTECTING DUTIES . tO ? 137 /z/ ' - . i #@# r- ? f. " 1 4 ' ' /z/ But secondly ; As the price of the article is iricreased , the demand for the article is diminished . This has been before illustrated . There will , therefore , be less of the article produced , because less of it is wanted . By all this diminution is the demand for labor diminished ; the price of labor must , therefore , fall , and the stimulus to labor be , by so much , decreased . This effect will take place , in what manner soever the discriminating duty may operate . Suppose , that from scarcity of wool , the price of imported cloth had , without any duty , been doubled ? The result would have been , that the demand would so have fallen off , thatmul-. titudes would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been ruined . Suppose that , by a duty f we exclude the foreign cloth , and make it ourselves , but at double the price . There will be a less quantity made , than before . But the imported cloth was not to be had for nothing . Some of our own population were obliged to raise the products which we sent in exchange for it . As we do not take their cloth , they can not take our produce . Of course , all those who labored in the products which were exchanged for cloth , are out of employment . There was a demand for a sufficient amount of their labor to purchase one thousand bales of cloth ; suppose , now , there is a demand for labor sufficient to make only five hundred bales of cloth . By all the difference , therefore , between the labor necessary to procure one thousand bales by exchange , and that necessary to manufacture , or procure by exchange , five hundred bales , is the demand for industry diminished , and , , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , what is the tendency of a system of this kind . First , so far as the manufacturer is concerned , it can not increase his profit beyond the average profits of every other employment ; for , if competition be allowed , capital and labor will flow into it , whatever may be its advantages , until its profits fall to the general level . Secondly , the demand for other labor is diminished , by the reduced consumption created by a rise of /z/ price , and also , as this rise of price increases the expenses of living , it makes even these reduced wages of less value than they were before . Hence the tendency is , to reduce the profit of capital and of labor in the whole community lower than they were before such duty was imposed . To this reduced average , manufacturers must themselves conform ; and hence , by this very operation , they themselves must suffer . Hence we see the reason why , when once a duty is imposed for the protection of a particular branch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty is demanded ; and also why a protective duty , which at first is followed by great manufacturing enterprise and success , is so commonly afterwards followed by so universal a depression of manufacturing industry . This is the result , so far as the effect upon our own country is concerned . But this is not all . A rise of prices must , of necessity , follow a protecting duty ; for this is its very object . Its object is , to raise the price of some particular product , so that it may be created where it could not be created before . If it produce no rise of prices it is useless . Now , a rise of prices raises the cost of production , and , by its whole effect , must raise the price of every product which we create . By this whole effect , therefore , is our foreign market injured . If we can raise cotton at ten cents a pound , and bring it into market as cheap as other nations , w r e have as good an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise it at nine cents , we can undersell them and supply the whole market ; or , if we sell it at the same price as before , we gain one cent more on the pound . If , by increase of the expenses of living , we can not raise it for less than eleven cents a pound , they will undersell us , and we shall be obliged to give up the raising of cotton , either partially or altogether ; and the industry engaged in raising and transporting the cot , ton , and what we receive in exchange for it , must , be either partially or wholly thrown out of employment . Every one must see , that the manufactures of England could be afforded much lower : that is , would be able much better to /z/ compete with those of other nations , if , by abolishing her duties on corn , her manufactures could be supplied with the necessaries of life at half the present cost . At the same profit to the laborer and capitalist , her products could be afforded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole amount of the difference in the expenses of living . By this difference , she would both undersell other nations and increase the demand for her manufactures , thus reaping , at once , a double advantage . But once more : It is seen that , by such a system , the course of industry and of capital in a nation , must be greatly changed . Thus , when an article is imported , one class of producers must labor to create the article which we exchange for it ; another class must build ships to transport it ; and another class must carry on the transportation . By a. discriminating duty , all these classes must , either in whole or in part , be thrown out of employment , and this capital be either reduced in value , or rendered wholly useless . Now this is an injury , both to the capitalist and the laborer . The property of the one and the skill of the other are rendered useless , and by so much is it a total loss to the country . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True ; they must do this ; but this renders it not the less true , that there has been so much loss . If a man 's house be burned down , it is easy to say to him , move into another house ; but this does not alter the fact , that his house has been burned down , and that he has suffered loss to precisely this amount . But , suppose he turn to the other employment . It has been shown that the average of profit , in this employment , can not be higher than the average of profit was , in the employment which he left . He is then no better off than he was before , and , in the meantime , he has lost the skill and capital which he spent many years to acquire ; and he has lost them , not as in the case mentioned p. 97 , by the progress of civilization , and with the prospect of bettering his condition , but by an act of arbitrary legislation . By all this amount of depreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole country , poorer by the exchange . /z/ Of Bounties . The principle of bounties is the same as that of discriminating duties . The manner in which they are bestowed , is the following : If a manufacturer can not produce cloth for less than ten dollars a yard , and the imported cloth can be produced at five dollars , a bounty of five dollars a yard is given him , for every yard he manufactures , or for every yard he exports . The cloth , then , is sold , either at home or abroad , at five dollars , and he also receives five dollars as a gratuity . The principal reasons urged above , apply to bounties . They are , however , less objectionable , for several reasons : 1 . The price of the article is not visibly raised , and the consumption , therefore , on this account , is not so much diminished . 2 . The encouragement given , in this manner , is cheaper ; that is , we pay only for what is made , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether any thing be made or not . We pay a very heavy duty on cutlery in this country , while not a thousandth part of the cutlery used , is made here , It would be vastly cheaper to pay a bounty sufficient to raise all the cutlery made in this country to its present prices , and it would be , for aught I see , just as good for the cutler . The whole effect of this mode of encouragement is , to pay one man as much more as the bounty amounts to , for producing an article , than we should pay another man ; that is , one man will do it for five dollars , and we engage another to do it for five dollars , and give him five dollars besides , for the sake of economy . I have , thus far , considered this subject solely in respect to its connexion with economy ; that is , as it is favorable or unfavorable to production . It is , however , obvious , that an entirely distinct argument might be constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might be asked , by what right does society thus interfere with the property of the individual ? when did the individual surrender this right ! and how wise would it be for him to surrender it ? It is in vain here to urge , that society /z/ has the right to destroy individual property , in cases of extreme necessity ; because , in order to render this plea available , it must be shown that this is a case of extreme necessity . And besides , if society destroy individual property in case of extreme necessity , it is always bound to make- good the loss to the individual . I think that , if the protected interests were obliged to make good the loss which the system inflicts upon all other interests , the demand for protection w r ould be less urgent than at present ; and protection would be considerably less injurious . But , as these are questions of right , and belong rather to Moral Philosophy than to Political Economy , we shall not , in this place , discuss them any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered , several objections have been urged . It may be proper to notice here , some of those which are most commonly advanced . J. The above argument is made to turn upon production alone , and proceeds upon the supposition , that the prosperity of a nation depends upon the productiveness of its industry , more than upon any thing else . In ordey to meet this view of the case , it has been said , that production is a matter of no consequence to a nation 's prosperity , and that , in order to make a nation rich , happy , and powerful , all that is necessary is , to encourage and stimulate consumption . 1 . To this it may be answered , that this assertion leaves the above argument untouched , so far as production is concerned ; that is , it does not deny that the effects of discriminating duties upon production , are such as we have shown . 2 . But secondly : If a man assert that the wealth of a nation is the result of its consumption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the hand of the prodigal , and not that of the diligent , maketh rich ; that industry and frugality are the sources not of wealth , but of poverty ; that fire and sword , devastation and murder , are national blessings ; that ice ought to pay other nations , instead of their paying us , for spoliations /z/ of property ; that incendiaries should be rewarded , instead of being hanged ; and that the way to render a city rich , happy , and prosperous , is to reduce it to ashes . If a man really believe this ; I do not say if he assert it ; his case is beyond the reach of ratiocination . II . It has also been urged , that the only method of rendering products cheap , is to encourage competition ; that competition is the great source of increased productiveness of labor , and that to excite competition among our own manufacturers , by means of higher duties , is the only sure method by which to cause any article of necessity to be produced at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the principle assumed is erroneous ; and that the reasoning in support of it is self-destructive. 1 . The principle assumed is erroneous . Although free competition is necessary , to reduce prices to their natural rate ; yet beyond this , competition , within lon periods , can have no effect whatever . The price of every article is determined by the cost of its production ; that is , by the labor and capital necessary to produce it . Its price can be reduced in no other manner'than by reducing this cost . If the materials can be furnished cheaper , and it can be produced by less labor , its price will fall ; but it can fall from no other cause . If it be a monopolized article , the producer may , over and above a fair remuneration for his expenses , demand an excessive profit . If there be a free competition , his profits will be reduced to the general average of other capital and labor . A competition which obliged a producer to sell for less than cost ? would of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community . Such is the case in times of manufacturing depression , when the producer is obliged to sell at a loss . These are surely not times of prosperity . The result of such competition is , to drive a portion of the producers out of employment ; a less amount of the product is created , competition is diminished , prices rise to their natural level , and the whole effect of competition is at an end . If , then , when there is no monopoly , competition , be it ever so /z/ great , can reduce the price of no article permanently below the cost of its production ; and that , by this cost its price will always be ' determined , be the competition whatever it may ; it is evident , that the only way in which the price of any thing can be really reduced , must be by diminishing the price of the material and labor employed in creating it ; that is , by rendering every thing as cheap as possible . And it is also evident , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , of the articles of living , we shall also raise the price of whatever is produced , let the competition be ever so great . But , secondly , the argument drawn from the assertion is self-destructive . If it be the fact that competition is the great and proper cause of reduction of price , then , the wider the competition , the greater will be the reduction of price . If this be so , we should not only open our ports to every other nation , but should abolish import duties altogether , even for the sake of raising a revenue , and sustain the expenses of civil government altogether by direct taxation . It would , however , be a new mode of encouraging competition , if the citizens of New York should forbid every one , not a native of that city , to exercise the trade of a carpenter or joiner , within the limits of their jurisdiction . In what manner such an act would reduce the prices of house-building , I confess myself unable to discover . I think , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defended on the ground that they , by competition , tend to reduce prices . III . Again : It is asked , is it not better to labor for ourselves , than to have others labor for us ? I answer , undoubtedly . We must labor for ourselves , unless we mean to live either by begging or by stealing . And this is really the only alternative which the Creator has left us . On this point , therefore , there is no dispute . It is agreed on both hands , that it is better to labor for ourselves , than to have others to labor for us . Whatever either a man or a nation possesses , except by robbery or begging , must be the production of its /z/ own labor . The question then , is , whether it is better for us to receive a greater , or to receive a less result from our labor . Every man must labor for a coat . But is it better for him to procure it by labor , for five dollars a yard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should , by exchange , earn it by five days ' labor , or make it for himself , by fifteen days ' labor ? He procures it as much by labor in the one case , as in the other . I do not see that there can be any question , in which way his labor can be most profitably expended . If a manufacturer wish for oranges , he can procure them in no other way than by labor . The question is , whether he shall procure them by labor in manufactures , or by labor in raising them . In the first case , a day 's labor will produce , by exchange , a hundred oranges ; in the second case , it will cost several days ' labor to produce one . The question is , in which way , by labor , can a manufacturer , most easily , supply himself with oranges ? Upon this point , really hinges the whole matter in dispute . It is clear , as has been stated , that every thing which we possess , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor . It is granted , however , in every other case but this , that the greater the amount of product which we can create by a given amount of labor , the better it is for the producer . Suppose the labor of a particular community to be valued at a million of days ' works annually , it is certainly wise in this community to procure , by this amount of labor , as large an amount of product as it can . Suppose , that by laboring in those modes of production for which it has the greatest facilities , and then by exchanging a part of its products for those of another country , it can realize two millions of dollars ' worth of products ; but , by producing every thing for itself , it can only realize a million and a half dollars ' worth . In which case , I ask , is labor more amply rewarded ? Which is the wiser method of apportioning its labor ? In which way will capital accumulate most rapidly , and the nation soonest be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is said , although ' we may be obliged , at first , to procure manufactures at a higher price , yet , having once introduced them , they will , in the end , become cheaper than before ; and thus , our ultimate benefit will more than repay our temporary loss . In order to consider this objection , it will be necessary to refer to what we have already remarked on the nature of annual and fixed capital . It is evident , that , in the first stage of any society , there exists nothing but the earth with its capabilities , and man to labor upon it . The labor of man produces an annual capital . If Tie have been industrious and frugal , there will have arisen an annual surplus , which must , of necessity , be transformed into fixed capital ; and it is so transformed , for the purpose of increasing the annual capital . Thus , every addition to the fixed capital for this year , lays the foundation for the investment of a larger amount in fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , and the demand for fixed capital is annually increasing . It is evident that the investment in fixed capital will be , first , in those instruments themselves , necessary for the direct increase of annual production , as ploughs , fences , houses , barns , &c.; , and , secondly , in the machinery necessary to the creation of these , and of the productions for annual consumption ; that is , it will be in manufacturing establishments . But , inasmuch as the capital of a country is at first small , a nation will , of necessity , at first invest its annual surplus in those manufactures which require the least capital , and of ' which the price is most enhanced by transportation . As capital increased , it would become able to make larger investments of fixed capital . Manufactures , which it would have been impossible for it to conduct profitably in its tenth year , it may conduct profitably in its fiftieth year ; and what it could not conduct profitably in its fiftieth year , it may very profitably conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this variation is two-fold . In the one case , it did not , and in the other case it did , possess the capital necessary for the /z/ investment in this particular branch of manufactures t and , in the second place , though it possessed the requisite capital , that capital could not be taken from the employments in which it was at present engaged , and invested in any thing . else , without a loss , that is , a diminution of profit . As soon , however , as the most necessary investments have been made , their annual product will enable the nation to commence something else . By the multiplication of capital , the rate of interest is diminished , and a nation is gradually enabled to produce for itself every thing for which it has the natural facilities . And hence , the time when toy manufacture can be profitably established , in a country which possesses natural advantages for it , is decided by the amount of the capital of that country ; the amount of annual investment which it is able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest at the period in question . Now , suppose that the system of discriminating duties left the means of accumulation unaffected . In this case , the period of profitably producing the article in question would arive , at the same time as if no such system had been adopted . Previously , therefore , to this time , the article must have been purchased by the whole community , at an additional and unnecessary expense ; since , when this time arrived , in the natural course of things , the manufacture in question would commence , just as though nothing had been done , and just as every other manufacture had previously commenced . In this casej then , I see not that there would be any gain . All that has been paid , therefore , is so much unnecessary expense , without rendering this kind of investment profitable to the whole community , any sooner than it would have been , had no such expense been incurred . That , however , a discriminating duty does not increase productiveness , that is , the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it diminishes it , has , 1 think , been already shown . Now , by just so much as it diminishes productiveness , and of course diminishes annual capital , by so much it postpones the period , at which the manufacture in question can be profitably es /z/ tablished . Hence , the state of the case is this : In the present condition of capital and labor , the manufacture of a particular produce is unprofitable . In order to produce it now , instead of producing it at a later period , we diminish the productiveness of all other labor . And the only effect of this imposition which we have laid upon ourselves , is , instead of hastening the period of its profitable establishment , to postpone it to a still more distant period . But this is not all . We see that all this is done , and all this expenditure is incurred , without any certain knowledge of the result . It can not be certainly known when the period will arrive , at which the manufacture , in favor of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced , or whether , indeed , it can ever be commenced at dl . If it can never be commenced , we have thus imposed a duty by which we are all made so much the poorer , without the prospect of any benefit . And if it may profitably be established at some future time , but we know not when that time will arrive , we are paying out our money at random ; that is , we know not whether we shall gain or lose by the exchange . Supposing a benefit in fact to result , it is worth a given sum , and no more ; but we have no means of knowing whether the sum which we pay is only equal to the benefit , or whether it is ten times greater . Now , that it is very possible for a nation thus to pay for an advantage , supposing an advantage to be gained , vastly more than it is worth , is manifest . To illustrate the amount which has been frequently expended to gain this supposed advantage , I subjoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ " The French duties on iron , from 1814 to 1822 , have directed much capital to the iron trade . In 1818 , 1,140,000 quintals of unwrought iron were produced in France ; in 1825 , 1,976,000 ; in 1829 , 2,269,000 . Thus far the system has succeeded . On the contrary , as foreign iron is imported at a duty averaging twenty francs , the price of the whole /z/ 2,269,000 , above what it could have been imported for , is , 40,538,800 francs , the " direct cost for protection . This is about 20 sterling a-piece to every person engaged in the iron trade . The effect of these measures is , to add fifty francs to the price of a plough , and to render cotton machinery one third dearer than it would be if imported . The price of charcoal has been doubled or trebled , and from twenty-five to fifty per cent , has been added to the price of iron and wood . So great is the injury to other branches of production . And yet the iron trade is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too great a portion of capital has been directed to the iron trade ; and also to the increased price of charcoal . It must also necessarily follow , from what has been said above , that this pressure , which has been brought upon other branches of production , must reduce the average ratio of profit ; and to this average the iron trade must sink , as well as every thing else . Here there is an injury done to every other branch of business , and yet the iron business is not at the average rate of profit ; that is , it is depressed . There is a great annual loss ; but where do we see the prospect of a subsequent benefit ? Tke sugar trade . To encourage her polonies , France lays a duty of fifty francs per quintal , on all foreign sugars . This has increased the quantity made at home and at her islands . So far it has succeeded ; but , 2 . The difference between the duty on foreign and the duty on her own sugars , amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sugar growers of Martinique and at home . 3 . The quantity of sugar consumed is probably less by one third , than it would otherwise be . England , with half the number of inhabitants , consumes two and a half times as much sugar as France . 4 . But it is said , that , by this means , beet-root sugar will yet supply France at the ordinary price . It must , however , take twenty years , under the present system , in order to do this . The present protection costs 1,400,000 per annum . Suppose this to continue for twenty years , it will amount to 28,000,000 sterling , /z/ the interest of which , at five per cent. , will buy , at two and a half pence per pound , 126,000,000 pounds of sugar per annum ; or nearly the whole annual amount of sugar now consumed in France . The Cotton Manufacture . By pushing forward those products for which she has no capabilities , she has diminished those to which she is adapted . Countries which formerly bought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refuse to receive hers . Hence , the exports of wine , her natural product , have fallen off . Before the Revolution , her export of wine averaged 100,000 tons per annum . Since 1820 , it has varied from 39,000 to 63,000 tons . The result upon her silk trade has been the same . She has obliged other nations to raise silk for themselves . " * Such are some of the certain evils of such a system . These surely ought not to be voluntarily imposed upon ourselves , without equal certainty of future benefit , and a benefit so much superior to that which we should otherwise have reaped , as to compensate us for all the evils and expenses which we impose upon ourselves . And if it do no more than this , we are the losers , by all the cost of the agency for doing that which would as well have been done without us . But , if the system itself do nothing towards hastening the time of profitable investment in manufactures , then it is an immediate and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends to nothing but evil for the future . V. It is said , that it is frequently expedient to impose a duty as a measure of retaliation . The case is this . A nation will not receive our products , and we , in order to punish her , and thus oblige her to change her policy , refuse to receive hers . Let us proceed dispassionately , but briefly , to consider this argument . 1 . Is retaliation a virtuous or an honorable motive to action ? Do we not consider it vicious and mean in an individual ? Can it be otherwise in a nation ? The presumption must surely be adverse to a course of conduct , /z/ which is a manifest departure from elevated moral principle . 2 . Is retaliation , in the intercourse between man and man , generally wise ? Do we not commonly observe , that it leads men to headlong vindictiveness , which is as likely to injure themselves as their opponent ? 3 . Our object is to distress the other country until we oblige her to alter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to her fears be as likely to produce the change which we desire as setting her the example of manly generosity ? Of all means that can be conceived , a threat is the least likely to produce effect upon large masses of men . 4 . But if we resolve to injure our neighbor , let us see that we do not too much injure ourselves , and thus render her enmity still more effective . She refuses our products , and we retaliate by refusing hers . Now we can , by exchange with other nations , procure her products at a cheaper rate than we can manufacture them ourselves , or we can not . If we can not , then a duty is unnecessary , since we shall , in that case , of course , produce them ourselves . If , in consequence of the obstacles which Great Britain opposed to the reception of our raw material , her cottons were raised in price as high as those manufactured here , we should exclude them immediately by our own products . If , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can procure them cheaper than we could procure them in any other manner , it would be for our interest thus to procure them . Because another nation wishes to injure us , there is no reason why we should injure ourselves . We surely injure ourselves when we pay a dollar for an article when we could get it just as well for seventy-five cents . And besides , it is said , we wish to become independent of the other nation . True ; but how shall we become independent of her . Clearly by becoming wealthy and powerful . But the way to wealth and power is , surely , to buy where we can buy on the best terms , and sell where we can sell on the best terms . We thus /z/ shall the most rapidly accumulate wealth , and increase our population , and thus most readily shall we be able to compete with the manufactures of any other nation . The question , then , seems to be simply this . Shall we diminish our own happiness for the sake of diminishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the instigations of vindictiveness , and irrespective of the effect upon others , promote our own happiness by every means in our power ? Or still further , if we resolve to punish our neighbor , would it not be worth while to ask what it will cost ; and whether we are willing , for the sake of retaliation , to pay several millions of dollars annually . To all this , it is , finally , objected , that a government having adopted a restrictive system , and having thus obliged persons formerly engaged in other branches of industry to embark in manufactures , is under moral obligation to continue that protection ; at least so long as to e.nable the manufacturer to change his mode of employment without injury . To this objection I have no desire to make any reply . It is a question of morals , and not of political economy . Whatever the government has directly or indirectly pledged itself to do , it is bound to do . But this has nothing to do with the question of the expediency , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , thus bound itself ; nor with the question whether it be not expedient to change its system as fast as it may be able to do so , consistently with its moral obligations . For these reasons , I do not believe that the direct efforts of government are to be numbered among the means for encouraging the application of labor to capital . Their good effect , if it exist , must , therefore , be sought for , not in their effect upon production , but upon something else . But it may be asked , can a government do nothing to promote the industry of a people , and to increase the amount of their production ? I answer ; they can do much . 1 . They can enact wise , wholesome , and equitable laws , and thus protect the individual in the exercise of his right of person and property . /z/ 2 . They can do much to accomplish the universal diffusion of the means of knowledge , by the promotion of education among all classes of the people . 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , by fostering seminaries of learning . 4 . They can originate that knowledge , which must otherwise be obtained at great individual expense . As , 1 . By experimental farms , of which the results should be accurately registered , and published to the whole community . 2 . By experimental manufactures , which might show , from time to time , what branches of manufacture could profitably be introduced into a country , and how they might be most successfully conducted . In this manner , much might be done , and at small expense . When these means have been tried , and have failed , it will be time enough to make other and more expensive experiments . 5 . They can do much , by confining themselves to their own appropriate duties , and leaving every thing else alone . The interference of society with the concerns of the individual , even when arising from the most innocent motives , will always tend to crush the spirit of enterprise , and cripple the productive energies of a country . What shall we say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation are made the sport of party politics ; and when the power over them , which a government possesses , is abused , for the base purpose of ministering to schemes of political intrigue ? So far as I am able to discover , such are the most important conditions on which the productiveness of any society depends . They are briefly these : Industry and Frugality , Virtue and Intelligence . Possessed of these , no nation , with the ordinary blessing of God , can long be poor . Destitute of either of them , whatever be its natural advantages , no nation can ever long be rich . Patriotism , no less than religion , would , therefore , teach js to cultivate these habits in ourselves and in others ; and he is the purest patriot who cultivates them most assiduously. /z/ EXCHANGE , is a transaction , in which two individuals mutually and voluntarily transfer to each other the right of property , to a given amount , either in*capital or labor . Th*s transfer must be both mutual and voluntary by both parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , without the right of possession , be given in exchange , it is fraud . If I give a horse in exchange , which does not belong to me , I confer no right of property ; for I have none to confer ; since the real owner may reclaim him , at any moment . The exchange may be either of capital by both parties , as if A and B exchange wheat for corn ; or of capital for labor , as when A gives B a bushel of wheat for a day 's labor ; or of labor for labor , as when A agrees to work for B to-day , on condition that B shall work for him to-morrow . Exchange is of three kinds , viz : I. Barter in general , or exchange in kind . II . Exchange by means of a metallic currency . III . Exchange by means of a paper currency . /z/ 1 . IT has been already shown , that human labor , of some kind , is necessary to production ; that is , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence , without labor , no desire would be gratified ; that is , the race would speedily perish . As we have said before , the law of our being , imposed upon every individual , enacts that , by the sweat of our face we shall eat our bread . 2 . But by labor exerted upon any substance , in such manner as to give it value , we establish over that value , either in whole or in part , the right of property . If the original capital were our own , we possess that original capital , together with all the additional value , which the change that we have effected has created . If , by labor upon the capital of another , we have increased its value , we establish a right to a portion of it , to be estimated by the respective values of the labor and capital employed . Nay , this capital is nothing but the result of pre-exerted labor . So that the capitalist contributes his past , and the laborer his present labor , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the very conditions of our being , the act - of creating a value appropriates it to a possessor . This holds true of every thing not the spontaneous gift of God . Hence , every thing created by man , belongs to some man ; that is , he possesses over it the right of property . And this right of property is exclusive ; that /z/ is , he has the right to use it as he will , to the exclusion of every man and of all men . And , provided he do not interfere with the rights of others , no man can interfere with his use of whatever product he has created , without a violation of moral law . 4 . Different men are constituted by the Creator with different aptitudes for different pursuits , and with different dispositions towards those pursuits . One man is adapted to investigate , and another to apply to practice , the laws of nature , and another to perform the operation by which those laws are made to create value . And these aptitudes are still further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another intellectual , and another moral laws . Thus , also , in the various pursuits of operative industry , one man prefers agriculture , another manufactures , and another navigation . And it is found , as might be expected , that the disposition towards a particular operation , severally corresponds with a man 's aptitude for it ; that is , that , in general , a man is most strongly disposed to devote himself to that particular occupation , for which God has given him the greatest aptitude . Indeed , the disposition , in most cases , will do very much to create the aptitude . A man always labors more successfully in an occupation which he likes , than in one which he dislikes . 5 . Hence , a great public , as well as private advantage , arises from every one 's devoting himself to that occupation which he prefers , and for which he is specially fitted . Inasmuch as he likes it best , he is thus happier than he would be in the pursuit of any other . Every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every one will derive from this source , all the happiness which it is able to confer . And , inasmuch as he is better fitted for it , he will , with the same labor , create a greater amount of value than he will by labor in any other employment . He will also create the value much more perfectly . The annual amount of value , created in a community , will thus be greatly increased , with the same amount of labor , and , with a much greater amount of happiness . If every man labored at that employment in /z/ which he could create an amount of value equal to twenty , there would be , by the whole society , just twice as much created , as if , by changing occupations , each one labored at that for which he could create a value equal , only to ten . If all the different classes of laborers were , for a year , to be obliged to exchange work with each other , every one can perceive that , for that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this all , though every man created his own particular value with the ' greatest possible success , yet each man would , manifestly , possess but one value . The wheat grower would have ' nothing but granaries full of wheat ; the carpenter , nothing but ranges of houses ; the stone cutter , nothing but piles of stone ; - and the shoemaker , nothing but thousands of shoes . But while there exists in every man , both the aptitude and the disposition for the creation of a particular value , there exists equally in every man , a desire to enjoy every value that can be created . A man may like to create a value of which he desires to use but very little himself ; nay , for which , in itself , he perhaps has even less desire than most other men . The man who is the fondest of fishing , may be , by no means , a great lover of fish ! He who is the fondest of hunting , may be , by no means , the fondest of game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foxhunting , that he is fond of fox-eating . Thus , we see , that the desire for the creation of value , is one thing , and the desire for using the value created , is another . The one is limited to single objects , and the other is as widely extended as the objects to which it can be directed . And it is evident , that the one form of desire is as much intended to be gratified as the other . He who created the desire , and also created the object which would gratify it , intended the one for the other , restricting man only to the modes and degree of gratification which he has appointed . Civilization and social happiness advance , just in proportion as the greatest number of the desires of man are gratified , in conformity with the laws of the Creator . 7 . We see , then , that man is created with the aptitude /z/ and the desire for the creation of one product , but with the desire for the enjoyment of a thousand products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of desire is as much the intention of his Creator , as the gratification of the other . He is intended to produce one thing , and to hold this thing produced , by the right of property , while at the same time , every man is intended to require , for the gratification of his desires , a thousand things . Now , it is the existence of these contrary indications in his nature , that creates the necessity for exchange . The right to use his product as he pleases , is also the right to transfer it to whomsoever , that is , to exchange it with whomsoever he pleases , and for whatever he pleases . By doing this , all the indications of his nature are fulfilled . The right of property is preserved inviolate . Every one may employ his own capital and industry as he pleases , that is , as will best promote his own happiness , and also as will add the most abundantly to the wealth of the whole community ; and , at the same time , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he may procure every object of desire that every other man has created . And , inasmuch , as by division of labor , on the principle of which we have spoken , a larger amount will be created , and in greater perfection , he will procure every object at less labor , and in more perfect condition , than would be possible in any other manner . The necessity of exchange , therefore , as truly enters into the conditions of our being , as that of production . Without exchange , there could be no division of labor , and , of course , only the smallest possible amount of production . Without exchange , there would rarely be any stimulus to labor ; for labor could add but little to our means of gratification , beyond the most absolute necessaries of lite . There would be no stimulus to form societies , since , as man depended solely upon himself , he might as well be solitary as social . Hence , all progress in civilization would be hopeless , and each generation would tread precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ 8 . I have , thus far , spoken merely of exchange between the individuals of the same society . I think it evident , however , that the same principles apply with equal force to the exchanges between different societies . The aptitudes of different nations for the creation of different products , has , in many cases , been fixed by unchangeable , geographical , and physiological law . Cotton , coffee , spices , dye-stuffs , sugar , rice , and many of the most valuable fruits and medicines , can be cultivated only in southern latitudes . Wool , wheat , and breadstuffs generally , flax , and the most valuable animals , are found only in temperate climates . Iron is found in northern latitudes ; and furs , hemp , and feathers are brought from climates still further north . One country is better adapted to commerce , another to agriculture , and another to manufactures . Besides , as we have already shown , a society , at one period of its history , is better adapted to one sort of production than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap and fertile , a nation is better adapted to agriculture ; when capital becomes abundant and land dear , it becomes gradually better adapted to manufactures ; that is to say , nations , as well as individuals , both by original endowment and accidental circumstances , have their special adaptations to the creation of particular products . I suppose it unnecessary to state , that nations , that is , people , if left to themselves , are like individuals , disposed to avail themselves of the peculiar advantages bestowed upon them by their Creator . Selfinterest teaches them this lesson with sufficient clearness , and they willingly practise it , if left to their own natural instincts . It is also evident that , by each nation 's devoting itself to that branch of production for which it has the greatest facilities , either original or acquired , its own happiness will be better promoted , and a greater amount of production created , than in any other manner . And while all nations thus appropriate their industry , a much greater amount of annual value will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change that could possibly be /z/ made . If Cuba should relinquish the raising of coffee and sugar , and devote herself to the raising of wheat ; and New York , relinquishing the culture of wheat , should betake herself to the raising of coffee and sugar , would not both communities be poorer , and would not the price of coffee , sugar , and wheat be increased over the whole world ; that is , would not all the world , and these countries especially , be poorer than they are now ? But , whilst it is thus evident that every nation is intended by the Creator to improve its own advantages , that is , to create that product for the creation of which it has the greatest facilities ; it is also the fact , that every nation , and every individual of that nation , desires the productions of every other nation ; and is happy in proportion as he enjoys them . What nation could be happy without the cotton of the South , the hemp and iron of the North , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Nay , let any individual look at the clothes which he wears , the furniture of his room , or the food and utensils of his table , and he will be immediately convinced , that every latitude of both hemispheres , and almost every country on the globe are tributary to his happiness . His own country has peculiar adaptations , but they are adaptations for but few products , while every citizen of that country requires for his convenience , nay , almost for his existence , the production of every other country . These desires can be gratified only by national exchanges . Hence we see , that national exchanges enter into the constitution of things under which we are created , as much as individual exchanges . And the final cause of this constitution is , in both cases , equally evident . Individuals are made thus dependent upon each other , in order to render harmony , peace , and mutual assistance , their interest as well as their duty . Where men " are mutually dependent upon each other , the prosperity of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one , is the adversity of all . No one can enjoy many of the blessings which God has intended for him , only /z/ in so far as others enjoy them also ; and no one can be deprived of them , unless others are deprived of them to a considerable degree also . ' Thus , we see that the individual progress of man , is , by the constitution of things , indissolubly connected with , if not absolutely dependent on , his social progress . And , for the same reason , nations are dependent upon each other . From this universal dependence , we learn that God intends nations , as well as individuals , to live in peace , and to conduct themselves towards each other upon the principles of benevolence . Where all are mutually dependent , as in the former case , no one can prosper without increasing the prosperity of all , nor suffer without bringing suffering upon all . Hence , it is as truly our interest to seek the happiness , peace , and prosperity of other nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prosperity of our own nation . 9 . From the above constitution it is evident , that universal exchange is as necessary to the welfare , and even to the existence of the human race , as universal production . We have already seen , that in all the departments of human industry , a great saving , both of time and expense , is effected by division of labor . This is as true of labor in exchange , as in any other case . Since , then , exchanges must be made , it will be better for the whole , if a part of a society devote themselves exclusively to the business of making them . Thus ; suppose that , in a given society , the labor is divided , so that each individual devotes himself to the creation of a given product . One man raises wheat , another rye , another wool ; one labors upon iron , another upon wood , another upon leather , &c.; Now , these persons can procure the productions of each other only Dy exchange . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obliged to leave his labor to find a purchaser for his product , he will lose much time himself , and will consume a large portion of the time of all his neighbors . It would frequently take as much time to exchange a pair of shoes , as it would take to make them . This additional time must enter into the price of /z/ the shoes ; and hence , these , and every other article of consumption , would rise in price accordingly . In such a case as this , it would clearly be a great benefit to the whole society , if some one should devote himself exclusively to the business of making exchanges . Every producer might then deposit with him whatever he had to exchange , instead of going in search of a purchaser . When this was done , every one , by going to him , might ascertain immediately , what was to be exchanged , throughout the whole community , and at what price ; and also , what was required in exchange . He would thus be able , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever was procurable for it ; and to know what he must produce , in order that he may procure what he may need . Thus , the labor of a whole day , or of several days , might be accomplished in a few minutes , in a much more perfect manner , than by any other method . Hence , as all the time unnecessarily consumed in the other method would be saved , much more time might be appropriated to production . As , in a given time , and with given labor , there would be greater production , every thing would be cheaper , that is , every one would be richer ; and , at the same time , a reasonable profit would remain for him who devoted his time to the labor of exchange . Hence , we see that exchangers are as necessary to the cheapness of production as producers themselves . Hence , we also see how absurd is the outcry sometimes raised against them , because it is said they produce nothing . Did not a large class of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conceive what would be the price of the most common and necessary utensil . Were the farmer obliged to carry his wheat or his cattle to Sheffield , to exchange for needles for his wife , . or for a sickle for himself , who could estimate what these utensils would cost ? If the laborer were obliged to go to Birmingham for a spade , which he must use in New York , what would be the price of a spade , and how would he ever be able to gain a subsis tence ? The laborer may sometimes complain that the /z/ merchant is rich , and that he is poor ; that the merchant stands at his desk , while he labors in the street ; that the merchant rides in his carriage , while he travels on foot . But it may be to him some consolation to remember , that were not the merchant rich , the laborer would be still poorer , for every article would be dearer ; and , besides , there would be no one to pay for the labor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the merchant to be at his desk , the poor man would have no labor to do in the street ; and were not the merchant able to ride in his carriage , the laborer would be obliged to go barefoot . And accordingly , we see that whenever mercantile business , that is , the business of exchanges , is the most successful , then are the means of living cheaper in proportion ; and then are the operative classes richer ; and the avenues to riches the most widely open to all . The persons who conduct the exchanges of a community are called merchants . They are of two classes , viz : Retail Merchants and Wholesale Merchants . The retail merchant carries on exchanges between the inhabitants of the same country . He purchases of the manufacturer or the importer , in quantities too large for the means of the individual consumer , and sells again in any quantities that the consumer may desire . This produces a great saving of time , and of course of expense , to the whole community . Were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard of calico , the price of calico would be trebled . Were the importer obliged to open his hogsheads , to sell a pound of sugar , he must charge a price accordingly . And , besides , as each importer and manufacturer is supposed to confine himself to one particular product , the purchaser would be obliged , frequently , to go great distances , and transact with a great number of persons , business which he may now be able to accomplish with a single individual . Every one must thus perceive , that a consumer saves much time by purchasing his sugar , tea , coffee , pepper , salt , &c.,; at one shop , instead of going to the wholesale importers of these articles individually ; specially if , as is /z/ frequently the case , they lived some hundreds of miles asunder . It is much more economical to buy needles , tape , cotton , calico , and silk , at one shop , than to go to the several individuals , in different places , who have imported or made these articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community , the retail dealer is able to charge a profit on all the articles which he sells , and , at the same time , to furnish them at a much lower price than that at which the purchaser could procure them , in any other manner . The purchaser not only procures them cheaper , but he procures them of a better quality . It is the business of the retail dealer to understand the quality of every article in which he traffics , and it is for his interest to purchase it cheaply , and of as good quality as it can be purchased in the market ; since it is on the goodness and cheapness of his articles , that his custom depends . The consumer is thus enabled to employ for his benefit , a skill vastly greater than his own ; and at a much less cost , than that at which he could accomplish the business himself . Hence retail dealers are as necessary to the prosperity of a country , and to the cheapness of productions , as any other class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is much more economical to employ their services , than for a man to undertake to do their business for himself . The wholesale merchant , conducts the exchanges between the individuals of different nations . He exports , in bulk , the commodities of his own country , and imports , in return , the commodities of another country . His own interest induces him to export whatever is at the lowest price in his own country ; that is , of what may be there in the greatest abundance ; and bring back , in return , whatever will command the highest price at home ; that is , " of which there is the greatest need . And his own interest will , of course , teach him to procure what he brings home , at the place where it can be had at the cheapest rate ; so that he may be able to furnish it at the hightest profit to himself , and at the lowest price to others . Hence his interest , and that of the community , are the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those commodities , of which we have a superfluity , should be exported ; and the fact of this superfluity is known by the reduction of their price , in comparison with the price of other commodities at home , or of the same commodity in other countries . It is for the interest of the merchant to export the same comriodity , because the lower the price at which he purchases it at home , on the better terms he can exchange it abroad . It is for the interest of the community , that those objects of desire which are most wanted should be brought back in return ; and the rise in their exchangeable value is the proof that they are so wanted . It is for the merchant 's inte. est , also , to bring back these very commodities ; for , from these alone , can he expect gain , and that gain will be the greater , in proportion as he procures them on the most favorable terms ; that is , as he procures them where they are the cheapest and most abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can transfer the productions of the earth from those regions where they are least wanted , to those regions where they are most wanted. * And this is precisely what the interests of society require should be done . To the merchant , it is , of course , a matter of no consequence , what he exports and what he imports . Unless a commodity were more wanted at home than that for which he would exchange it , he could have no motive to make the transfer . And that it is so wanted , is evident from the fact , that the community is willing to give a higher price for it than for that which is exported . If he desired it , he could not make any profit , except by consulting the wants of the community ; and that profit will be the greater , in proportion as he is able to consult those wants with the greatest possible nicety . His gains are the gains of the community , and his losses are the losses of the community . Hence , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be restricted in the nature or the quantity of the articles which he exports or imports . The constitution of things , and his own self-interest , provide all the regulating forces which the nature of the case requires . /z/ 1 . Of the rate of Exchange , or the exchangeable value of Products . If two men have created their respective products , and are prepared to exchange them , it is manifest that they will not commonly exchange them , quantity for quantity ; because a given amount of labor will procure a much larger amount of some products than of others . The same labor which will procure an ounce of gold , will procure an hundred - pounds of iron . Hence , the gold miner will offer to exchange labor fot labor ; that is , an ounce of gold for an hundred weight of iron . And , if the miner of iron will not exchange on these terms , the miner of gold will procure his iron for himself . Since , if he can thus procure it for himself , by a less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so . Hence it is , that the general rate , at which every thing is exchanged , is the amount of labor which it costs to produce it . But we have previously seen , that labor appears in two forms , that of annual capital , and of fixed capital . Both of these enter into consideration , when we speak of labor as determining the exchangeable value of products . For instance : Suppose I purchase wheat , and grind it by hand ; I sell it again at an additional price , proportioned to the labor which I have bestowed upon it . Suppose I thus earn money enough to erect a windmill ; I shall then be entitled to the same amount of wages per day for my labor , and also to an additional sum sufficient to pay the interest of what was expended in my wind-mill , and also to pay for its wear and tear , in performing the operation . The price of grinding was , at first , only that of immediate labor ; it is now the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of the pre-exerted labor . It is however to be observed , that notwithstanding I am receiving emolu ; ment from two sources , and am growing rich faster than before , it is on terms vastly more favorable to the community , inasmuch as I can , for the same remuneration , give ten times as much in return as I could before . The case is the same , if two separate individuals are employed in the operation , the one owning the capital or stock , and the other performing the labor . In this case , the cost consists of the wages of labor , and of the interest on , and the wear and tear of , the capital . Here , however , as before , the community is the gainer ; - because , for the wages of labor and interest on capital , it receives a much larger product than it received before , for the wages of labor alone . Thus , if a machine cost one thousand dollars , and ther.e were paid for the use of it one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages of labor , at , a clollar a day , would be four hundred dollars , allowing threajtitindred working days a year . This would be but - " 5ne*hundred dollars more than would be paid for the fijbor of the man alone . But a man , with such an instrument , would , probably , in a year , accomplish ten times as much work as he could accomplish without it . All the gain of the change is , therefore , for the benefit of the public . We see , therefore , that labor and the interest of capital , must , necessarily and justly , enter into the price of every product which is offered in exchange . The producer can never , for a long period , charge more than a fair remuneration for his labor and capital ; because , then , it would be cheaper for the other party to produce it for himself . He can not , for a long period , charge less ; because , in this case , he will be ruined , and must leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminished , and the value of the product will rise to the average rate of profit . Nevertheless , for short periods , the exchangeable value of any product may be raised above the reasonable rate of profit . If the demand exceed the supply , there will be a competition among the buyers ; the more wealthy will overbid the less wealthy , and the price will /z/ rise . This rise of price will induce others to devote themselves to supplying the demand , and thus the price will fall . If the supply be greater than the demand , there will arise a competition among the sellers , and the price will fall , and will remain depressed , until either the demand increase , or else until so many leave the employment , as shall reduce the supply to the average demand . It is evident that it makes no difference as to " he result , whether the ratio between supply and demand be disturbed by a change in supply or in demand . If the demand continue the same , a diminished supply produces the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the supply remained the same . And , on the other hand , demand being the same , an increased supply produces the same result as when , supply being the same , the demand is increased ; that is , in the one case , the exchangeable value of the product will rise ; in the other case , it will fall . It deserves , however , to be remarke , that this effect , produced by the disturbance of the ratio between supply and demand , will be greater or less , according to several circumstances . These are : 1 . The durability of the commodity . If it be one which , unless it be consumed immediately , will become worthless , the fall of price , from increased supply , is great . Such is the case with oranges , lemons , figs , fresh fish , &c.; If , on the contrary , it be a commodity which will endure for years , without loss of intrinsic value , the effect will be less . Thus , an increased supply of iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price . 2 . Variation of price , from this cause , depends , also , upon the ease or difficulty with which the supply may be increased . Thus , manufactured articles can generally be produced in a short time , and , if necessary , in a much more than usual quantity . Agricultural products , on the contrary , require a year , in order to be brought to perfection . Hence , if a crop fail this year , we know that there must be a diminished supply in the whole /z/ country , for the remainder of the year ; and hence , as there must be a scarcity , every one is prepared to give as much as he is able . But , if cotton cloth be high , unless the rise of price be owing to a diminished production of the material , this high price will cause more cloth to be made , and hence , before long , the price will fall . We therefore purchase only as much as we absolutely need , ' and wait for the favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the demand for the article . If it be an article of universal necessity , it will rise more rapidly by scarcity , and sink less rapidly by increased supply ; while , if it be an article of mere luxury , it will rise less rapidly by scarcity , and sink more rapidly by increased supply . When every one must have a commodity , the demand is constant , and every one is alarmed at the prospect of suffering ; hence , he purchases it at any price . And , on the other hand , if the supply be abundant , the holder knows that the ordinary consumption will soon reduce the quantity in market , and pather than sell at a reduced profit , he will wait for the change of price . On the contrary , if an article of luxury be scarce , men begin to abandon it , and thus the demand is quickly reduced . If it be abundant , the number of purchasers does not increase with the supply , because men have not yet learned to use it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sustained by a correspondent increase of demand . These , I think , are the principal circumstances which enter into the exchangeable value of.products . They are variously combined and modified , so that they may sometimes counteract , and sometimes exaggerate each other . But , I think , that , by applying them to the actual occurrences of life , we may generally be able to explain the fluctuations of price , which are daily taking place in the market . II . When an article of produce is offered for exchange , the producer has conferred upon it his last value , and it is now ready for the consumer . By the consumer , here , I do not mean him only who gratifies his desire by the ultimate destruction of the s. r THE /z/ product , but also him who receives it for the purpose of giving to it some other modification . The exchanger confers upon it no new value . It is the same when it passes out of his hands to the consumer , as when it came into his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange confers no value at all upon products ; since they receive no modification by passing from the hands of one person to those of another . 1 . Hence , it will be seen , that the more rapidly exchanges are made , the better- The more rapidly they are made , the less is the loss of interest , and the smaller the advance which the exchanger must charge for his labor . If a merchant purchase to-day a thousand dollars ' worth of iron , which he sells to-morrow , he charges us for his labor and skill , and adds only the interest for one day upon his capital . If he must keep the iron a whole year before he- sell it , he must charge the interest of a whole year , or else he will be the loser by his operation . Nor is this all . If he sell his lion to-morrow , he may invest the same sum in iron , and sell it again fifty times in the course of the year ; and thus receive a profit fifty times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while , in the other case , he receives this profit but once . Hence , when exchanges are rapid , he can afford to exchange at a less rate for his labor and skill , than when they are slow . And hence , brisk exchanges are for the benefit of both buyer and seller ; and a benefit to one , is a benefit to all . It is for - this reason , among others , that we can frequently purchase at a cheaper rate in a large city , than in a country town . 2 . And hence we see a reason , why the profit upon one operation in some kinds of exchange , is greater than that in others . The profits of the wholesale merchant on a pound of tea , are , for instance , greater than those of the retail merchant . He who sends his capital to the East Indies , and receives in return a cargo of teas , must charge interest and risk , for the whole time consumed , from the day that he parts with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This may be /z/ nearly two years . The retail merchant who purchases one of those chests of tea , may sell it all in a week , and thus invest it fifty times in the course of a year . Now , if the profit on an exchange were as great in the one case as in the other , the annual gains of the retail merchant would be exorbitant . These are reduced , by competition , to the average level ; and hence , his gains on any single operation are much less than those of the wholesale merchant . The same principle applies to production . The greater the time consumed in an operation , the larger is the profit on each article which justly belongs to the producer . 3 . But , though the act of exchange add nothing to the absolute value of the commodity , it adds greatly to its relative value , that is , to the convenience both of the buyer and the seller ; inasmuch as it enables both to gratify a desire , which , otherwise , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I want a dollar , and a hardware merchant wants a dollar more than he wants a pen-knife , we make the exchange with each other . The dollar is the same as before ; it will buy no more in his hands than it will in mine . The pen-knife is the same as before ; it has neither gained nor lost ; and I might , if I chose , exchange it with the next man I met , for a dollar . But , both the merchant and myself are benefited by the exchange . I can use the knife for purposes for which I could not use the dollar ; and thus render my labor per day much more valuable . The merchant has received a full remuneration for his labor , capital , and skill , and is , by so much , richer than he was before . That both of us have been benefited by the exchange , is evident from the fact , that neither of us would make the exchange back again . If a hungry man have a piece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread , they will readily exchange with each other . The silver is the same , and the loaf is the same , as before ; but still , both parties are richer and bappier ; and neither would the hungry man take back the same piece of silver for his loaf ; nor the baker take back the loaf for the silver . /z/ The case is the same with nations . If a nation exchange iron , of which it has more than it can consume , for wheat , which it can not produce , with a nation which has more wheat than it can consume , but produces no iron , the wheat and the iron are the same as before ; but each nation is richer and happier : each has one more desire gratified than before , and is able the next year to increase , more largely , its stock of production . That both are happier than before , is evident ; because neither would reverse the exchange , if it were in its power . And thus , in general , whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , and are mutually gratified when the exchange is made , it is evident that both are made happier , and that the exchange has been advantageous to both parties . Hence we see , how fallacious is the notion formerly entertained , that , by exchange , only one party is benefited ; and consequently , that what one party gains , the other party loses . Were this the case , no country could grow rich by exchange , unless by impoverishing every other country ; and the gain of one nation , would be nothing else than a transfer of the wealth of other countries to itself . On the contrary , precisely the reverse is the case . The most favorable commerce to any one country , is , that by which the riches of both countries are the most rapidly increased . A merchant , whose gains were all derived from the impoverishment of his customers , would very soon have none but paupers for neighbors . A nation , whose traffic caused the impoverishment of another nation , would very soon be obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the African slave-trade , and the result has been the almost entire depopulation of the slave coast . And thus , we see , in political economy , as in morals , every benefit is mutual ; and we can not , in the one case , any more than in the other , really do good to ourselves , without doing - good to others ; nor do good to others , without also doing good to ourselves . In what I have said of exchange , it is to be observed that I have spoken of exchange simply , and not as com- /z/ bined with the labor of transportation . The labor of transportation gives an additional value to an article ; that is , it confers upon it change of place . This has been already spoken of . It is true , a merchant frequently performs this labor , or causes it to be performed . In this case , he is entitled to a double profit ; first , for Lie labor of transportation , and secondly , for the labor and skill of exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is entitled to the profit derived from that in which he labors ; and , he who labors in both , is entitled to the profit of both . In speaking of the profit of exchange , it is always to be observed , that the profit of the merchant is derived , partly , from his labor and skill , and partly from his capital . He who exports to France one hundred thousand dollars ' worth of cotton , must first buy the cotton ; that is , he must have one hundred thousand dollars to invest in this exchange . He exchanges the cotton for silks or for calicos , and replaces his first investment . He is entitled to interest and risk on that capital , for all the time that it is out of his hands , besides the remuneration for his labor and skill . III . Of the conditions on which the frequency or infrequency of exchanges depends . It is manifest that the more numerous are the exchanges , the better must it be for a community . As no one exchanges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , the more numerous the exchanges , the greater the number of desires which will be gratified , and the more universally will the condition of a people be improved . It is also evident , that facility of exchange is one of the greatest stimulants to production . If a man can not transform his products into what he desires , he will labor for nothing but the mere necessaries of life . But in just so far as he is able , by exchanging the products of his labor , to procure objects of desire , his motives to industry will be quickened . And the same is true of nations . Every one , whether poet , or philosopher , or traveller , in setting forth the prosperity of a country , has described its harbors thronged with ships , its roads covered with merchandise , and its sails /z/ whitening every ocean . But all these are only so many forms of expressing the general fact , that a nation 's exchanges , both internal and external , are abundant and prosperous ; that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , easily to avail themselves of every other production which they may desire . We have said that exchange is a voluntary and mutual transfer of the right of property . If this be the case , there must exist , in each party , 1 . A mutual desire for the property of the other , greater than the desire for his own . 2 . Mutual ability ; that is , each party must be alle to offer to the other , such a consideration as will induce him to make the exchange . Where both of these exist , exchanges will , of course , take place . If A have a dollar which he wishes to part with for B 's knife , and B has a knife which he wishes to part with for A 's dollar ; as soon as each knows the wish of the other , they will mutually gratify each other , and the exchange will take place . 3 . As , however , the right of property alone is frequently transferred , while the property itself is not delivered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such an act of exchange , a liability to fraud . Besides , a commodity may not prove to be as good as it was represented , or the owner 's title may not be satisfactory . In all such cases , there is an opportunity for the practice of dishonesty ; and the risk of suffering from such dishonesty , would , of course , diminish the frequency of exchanges . Hence , frequency of exchanges will also depend upon security of the right of property , and the existence of the means for enforcing that right . If we now reflect upon these facts , I think we must perceive , that the desires of a people for exchange , will depend , principally , upon their intelligence . Their ability will depend upon the productiveness of their labor and capital ; and the security of property will depend upon their individual and social morality . That is , exchanges will be frequent in proportion to the intelligence , wealth , and moral character of a people . /z/ 1 . Exchanges will be frequent or unfrequent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . It is only by the diffusion of knowledge that men ascertain how their desires may be gratified . It is by knowledge that the desires of man are brought into relation with the objects intended by his Creator for their gratification . Every one knows how - the dormant desire for exchange is awakened in the bosom of a child , the moment he enters a toy shop . I suppose that strangers rarely pass through the streets of a large city , without being strongly , if not successfully tempted to lighten their pockets , before the termination of their journey . Every reader knows , how quickly his desire for books is , enkindled , by passing a few minutes in a book store . And thus we see , how instantaneously a desire for exchange arises in the breasts of savages , as soon as they are brought into contact with civilized man . A multitude of objects for the gratification of desire , of which they were previously ignorant , is set before them ; and they are frequently stimulated to exchange , to their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fact . They represent themselves as overwhelmed with these rude people , who were incessantly offering every thing which they supposed their visitors would desire , for nails , beads , pieces of looking-glass , iron hoops , and almost every thing on which they could lay their hands . When , however , I speak of intellectual cultivation in this connexion , it is to be understood that I by no means refer exclusively to the knowledge and mental discipline which is acquired by the reading of books . Books , though important to the intellectual progress of a country , are only one means of introducing and circulating knowledge . Knowledge is gained by observation , and by conversation ; and it is , if I may say so , absorbed from the intellectual atmosphere which we breathe ; it is derived from the general spirit of the community in which we live . Thus , a man rarely goes from home into another country , or into another section of the same country , without obtaining a knowledge of various . conveniences of which he was before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conduces to the same result . Newspapers , filled with advertisements , circulated over every district of a country , have , in this respect , a powerful effect . All these causes combine to show every individual what he can produce which other men want , and how he may , by exchange , procure from them what he wants himself . We see all this illustrated , in every district separated oy nature from the surrounding country , as a valley inclosed by mountains difficult of access , or an island which has but rare communication with the main land . The progress of such a population in the arts , and in possessing themselves of the conveniences of life , is always much less rapid than that of their more highly favored neighbors . They know but little of what is going on around them , and their desires are but feebly stimulated to improve their condition . The state of such a population is always suddenly and rapidly improved , by any means of easy communication with their neighbors . They are stimulated at once to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits enjoyed by those around them . Thus , the Pastor Oberlin , a truly great and good man , when he wished to improve the condition of the Ban de la Roche , commenced by inducing his people to repair their roads . Hence we see , how important , in this respect , to a nation , are all means of internal communication , and the facilities for the universal circulation of the commonest forms of knowledge . 2 . Exchanges will be numerous , in proportion to the productiveness of a country . We have already seen , that simple desire , in both parties , is not sufficient to effect exchanges . Each party " must both possess , and be willing to pajt with , so large a portion of the product desired by the other party , that the other is willing to make the desired exchange . Every man desires a horse and carriage , and every man who either raises horses or manufactures carriages , , is willing to part with them for an equivalent . But until every man have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will induce the other parties to make the exchange , every one can not be so accommodated . If A have wheat which he is willing to exchange for rye , but if B either have no rye which he is able to offer in exchange , or have it not in sufficient quantity to remunerate the labor of A , no exchange can take place . " But if both have been successful , and each have enough of his own product for his own use , and is also able to offer , on fair terms , a portion in exchange , they may then exchange with advantage , and , of course , they will do so . Or , again : If A and B have only so much surplus product as will enable them to make this one exchange with each other , much as they may desire the product of C and D , these last desires must be ungratified ; since no further exchange can take place . Or , on the contrary , if A and B have abundance , but C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can part with , the same result will take place . But let A , B , C and D be all blessed with abundance , and all have surplus products which they are willing to exchange with each other , and in such proportions as will reward each other 's industry , and they will all exchange accordingly . Thus , exchanges must always be most numerous , in the most prosperous condition of a country ; or , as every one knows , mercantile business is most prosperous , that is , exchanges are most abundant , when manufacturing , agricultural , and all other kinds of industry are most productive . And we see , moreover , that this principle is of universal application . A good harvest in one country , is a benefit to every other country ; because the favored country desires a larger amount of the productions of her neighbors , and has a larger fund wherewith to pay for them . Hence , the exchanges between such a country and every other country , are increased . On the contrary , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one country , is a calamity to every other country , because the unfortunate country wants fewer of the productions of its neighbors ; since it has less wherewith to pay for then . Its exchanges , therefore , are of necessi- /z/ ty diminished . Hence , that merchant is short-sighted , as well as morally thoughtless , who expects to grow rich by short crops , civil dissensions , calamity , or war , in the country with which he traffics . A wiser and further-sighted reflection , would teach him that it is very difficult to grow rich by trading with beggars , and that the benefit of one is always the benefit of all . To illustrate all this by a single case , let us ask what would be the amount of exchange effected by the inhabitants of Great Britain , France , and the United States , either among themselves or with each other , if the productiveness of these several countries were no greater than it was in the time of Julius Ca3sar ? 3 . Exchanges will be numerous in proportion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality is highly favorable to exchange , inasmuch as it lessens the liability to fraud , and , of course , the risk to which exchanges are exposed . No one will , if he can avoid it , trade with a knave . In proportion to the prevalence of knavery , will be the disinclination to exchange . 2 . On the general moral character of a people depend the equity of their laws , and , of course , the full enjoyment of the right of property . As has before been remarked , exchanges are not always completed at the instant . One party frequently parts with his property today , on condition of receiving the property of his neighbor a month hence . Here is a liability to fraucl . Unless the one party have , by means of just and equitable law , the power of enforcing contracts , exchanges will be gieatly restricted . 3 . On the morality and intelligence of ' a people , will greatly depend the freedom of its civil constitution ; that is , the accuracy with which it limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the individual . When these are improperly understood , or insufficiently guarded , the property of the citizen is liable to suffer from the avarice or the oppression of rulers . To this evil , property , undergoing exchange , is specially liable . Exchange exposes to the view of the public , the posses- /z/ sion of the parties , and , of course , enables a tyrant to seize upon them with greater certainty . For this reason , exchanges are frequently , under bad governments , made in secret ; and , for this reason , under such a government , they are always as few as possible , and at great expense to the consumer . Thus , in general , the frequency of* exchanges will be in proportion to the wealth , and to the intellectual and moral character , of a people . And since , as the progress of a nation , in these respects , will promote her mercantile prosperity , we may easily see what will depress it . The frequency of exchanges will diminish , as a nation decreases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all history is filled with illustrations . After what has already been said , it will not be necessary to enlarge upon this topic . These effects , moreover , are principally to be observed , by comparing the condition of a country at long periods ; and tracing the effects of measures and events in those directions which are not always obvious to every observer . While , however , the government and laws of a country remain the same , there frequently occurs a temporary diminution of exchanges , which is denominated a stagnation of business . This deserves to be noticed . As the business of a merchant is to execute exchanges ; that is , to perform the labor of exchanging , for those who wish to exchange their products , a stagnation of mercantfle business must occur , when there is less of this operation to be performed ; that is , the merchant is ready to perform the exchange , but a less number of persons desire it to be performed . The reason why the merchant feels this more seriously than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this kind of operation . He buys of one party , that is , invests his capital in one kind of product , and sells to another , that is , receives his product in exchange , and he supports himself by the profit of these two operations . The moment exchanges cease , his means of support are dried up ; for he is supported only by making them . He can buy , but he can not sell . STAGNATlOiN QP BUSINESS . 179 Hence there arises , as it is called , a stagnation of business ; that is , a cessation or diminution of exchanges . The principal causes of this , are the following : 1 . It may arise from a diminished desire for a particular product . Thus the decrease of the Catholic religion , during the wars of the French revolution , diminished the desire for fish , which the Catholics eat in Lent , and on fast days . This produced a stagnation of business in the fish trade . It may arise from change of fashion . Thus , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased ; the manufacturers of shoe-buckles were thrown out of employment ; and there was a stagnation of business in this kind of trade . It may arise from the fact , that one particular product has been supplanted by another . Thus the increasing cheapness of cotton cloth , has materially diminished the demand for linen . Whenever , from any cause , the desires of men change , then the traffic in the article neglected , must be diminished ; since it is very difficult to sell to a man a commodity which he knows he does not want . To this disadvantage , all articles which derive their value from fashion and caprice are exposed ; and , on this account , they are always sold at a higher profit , in order to compensate for the additional risk . 2 . Stagnation in business may arise from a temporary failure in production . This must , of necessity , produce *t ; since , as we have already seen , two men can not exchange , unless they both have something to part with ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proportion to the amount which he is able to part with , and the amount which others are able to offer him in exchange . Thus , if the crop of sugar should be reduced one half , there would be a stagnation in the sugar business ; that is , there would be but haLf the quantity of sugar to be exchanged , and half the quantity of other things could be exchanged for it ; in other words , half the number or amount of exchanges would be made . A.nd , in general , the failure of any crop , or the diminu- /z/ tion of any kind of production , must cause a stagnation of business in that article itself , and also in whatever is usually exchanged for it . Thus , also , if production languish from civil war , or from insecurity of property , exchanges of all kinds diminish , towns are depopulated , harbors are deserted , and the accumulated treasure of past generations insensibly melts away . 3 . A glut , or stagnation of business , may also arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exchange . If a nation js able to produce but one hundred thousand dollars ' worth of exports , it can purchase but one hundred thousand dollars ' worth of imports . This , then , will generally be the annual amount that will be brought to its market . But if , from any cause , a larger amount , say one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ' worth , is Drought thither , there will arise a glut , or temporary stagnation of business . There will be fifty thousand dollars ' worth more than can be exchanged . The reason is not , that they do not want the additional fifty thousand dollars ' worth of the productions of other countries , but that they have nothing with which to purchase it . Hence , after one hundred thousand dollars ' worth have been purchased , there will be sellers , but no buyers . It will be seen , however , that such a case can generally exist only in new , small , or in very unproductive countries , or for short periods ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole community is but small . 4 . A stagnation of business may be the effect of legislation . Suppose the importation of coffee into this country be a million pounds per annum . This must be paid for , in some way , by the productions of our own industry ; and the demand for those productions to this extent , is for the sole purpose of paying for this coffee . There must , of course , be a great variety of exchanges required to collect these products , to bring them to the seaports , to exchange them for coffee , and again to circulate this coffee throughout the country . Now , let a duty be laid upon coffee , which shall double its price , and thus diminish its consumption one half . The demand /z/ for one half of the products by which it was paid for , ceases , the demand for coffee , to this extent , also ceases ; and the labor of transportation on both articles is reduced one half . Here must be a stagnation of business , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed , will , for a time , be useless . Hence , there must , of course , arise a stagnation of business ; that is , a permanent diminution of exchanges , in all the departments of industry affected by this arrangement . The same effect will be produced by any act of- legislation by which public confidence is shaken , the currency disordered , or the facilities of exchange diminished . IV . Of the effects of legislative enactments on Exchange . I think it too obvious to need remark , that duties on imports can have no favorable effect on exchange . Their only effect must be , to raise the price of the products , and , of course , to diminish the ability in both parties to exchange . Every one knows that the exchanges between two places are diminished by any natural obstacle to communication . If a road were so bad that it cost five dollars per hundred weight to transport merchandise between two places , every one knows that exchanges between these places would be fewer than they would be if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for twenty-five cents per hundred weight . Now , it makes no difference whether this additional four dollars and seventy-five cents be the result of the badness of the road , or of a transit duty between the two places . The diminution of exchange which it causes , will be precisely the same . In a severe winter , our northern harbors are closed , for weeks or months , by the ice . This is a natural tariff , and imposes a large protecting duty , inasmuch as exchanges must be effected , if they be effected at all , at a vastly greater price than in summer . It is not generally believed , that this increases the number of exchanges ; nor have I ever heard it mentioned , as favorable to domestic industry . I therefore think it evident , that government can do nothing to facilitate exchanges by means of discrimi-/z/ netting duties . They have , however , attempted to ac complish this result , by means of bounties on particulai exports . The manner in which this is accomplished , is this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offer to other nations in exchange , some particular article , say , for instance , iron . To encourage this export , a bounty is granted on every ton of iron exported , equal to the difference between our cost of producing it , and that at which other nations produce it . Our producer can then sell it in a foreign port , as cheap as the producer from another nation . But where does this bounty come from ? Why , it is from a duty laid on some other import , or else from a tax laid on some other product . The iron worker is no better off than any other man , and all the other exchangers or producers , or both , are just so much worse off ; and the value of capital and labor is , by the whole operation , diminished , as we have shown in the article on the effect of legislative enactments upon production . Did any merchant ever grow rich by selling under cost , for the sake of competition with his neighbor ? It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich in the same way . But , as the principles , on which this discussion depends , have been already treated of in the article above alluded to , I need not here repeat them . If , then , governments can do nothing in this manner to promote the business of exchanges , in what manner may exchange be effected by legislation ? We have said that exchanges are the natural result of mutual desire and mutual ability . In what manner may these be influenced by legislative enactments ? 1 . Of Desire . If by desire be meant the original impulses implanted in the bosom of man , it is evidei t that these can be neither increased nor diminished . These are a fixed quantity , with which we can not interfere . These desires , however , generally remain dormant , until they are awakened into exercise by the presence , or by the knowledge , of their appropriate objects . It is by a knowledge of the existence of these objects , /z/ therefore , and of the modes by which they may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence , it is plain , that the desire for exchange may be increased /z/ 1 . By the general diffusion of knowledge , especially of that sort of knowledge by which man is taught how he may benefit his condition . This will be accomplished , generally , by a universal diffusion of the means of common education . 2 . By removing all impediments to the diffusion of knowledge . In this respect , a duty on imported books , which is really a tax on knowledge , is , in a free government , exceedingly injudicious . 3 . By increasing the physical means for the dissemination of knowledge and intelligence . This will be done by allowing every facility for internal improvement ; by an efficient and cheap post-office system , pervading every portion of the country , and bringing to every man 's door the information circulating throughout the civilized world . I do not know that a government can do more than this to excite in a people the desire to exchange . 2 . Of Ability . The ability to exchange depends , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means by which the productiveness of industry is increased , will also benefit exchange . These have already been alluded to , in the former book , and need not here to be repeated . There is , however , one branch of productive industry which is more immediately connected with exchange than any other , and which deserves , on that account , in this place , a more minute consideration . I refer to internal improvements . On this , I shall offer a few remarks . An internal improvement , is any means by which the operation of change in place may be performed at a less expense than formerly . It is , in fact , a labor-saving machine , peculiar to this branch of industry . Of those at present in use , the most common are roads , railways , and canals . /z/ What is peculiar to these machines , is , First , they are very costly , and hence , in general , require more capital than can be commanded by a single individual ; and , therefore , must be owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must pass through the lands of various individuals who have no special interest in them , and are thus liable to interfere with the right of property . This interference can be allowed only by the whole community ; and , hence , there arises a necessity for legislative enactment , granting permission to this effect . Now , inasmuch as such machines , if properly constructed and skilfully managed , are greatly for the benefit of the whole society , it is manifestly the duty of society to grant all suitable facilities for constructing them . Inasmuch , however , as they , like any other privileges , are liable to be abused , and may , in the end , injure the interests which they were intended to benefit , it becomes a legislature , on all such occasions , to reserve , at the outset , the right of visitation ; the power to modify or amend , on equitable terms , the privileges granted , in such manner , as the exigencies of the public may require . Whether a government should itself undertake the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . On this subject , it may be suggested : 1 . If it will not be profitable ; that is , if capital thus invested will not be as productive as that invested in other employments , it ought not to be undertaken by the public , because the capital thus invested must be taken from other employments ; that is , it must be taken from a more productive , to be invested in a less productive employment . If it be said , though it be not itself productive , it may enrich the district in which it is constructed ; the answer to this is , then let that district pay for it , unless it can be shown to be either wise or just , to impoverish one district , for the purpose of enriching another . 2 . If it will be productive , private associations , in an intelligent community , will , with proper encouragement , /z/ be ready to undertake it . And of the question of profitableness , private individuals will judge much more accurately than a government , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intelligence is likely to be as great in the one case as in the other ; and the one party can be influenced by no motive but self-interest , which is here also the interest of the public ; while the other party may be influenced by party politics , sectional jealousy , love of power , and a thousand disturbing causes . 3 . A work of this sort will be executed at much less expense by private individuals , than by a government . The costliness of all public works is everywhere proverbial . The greater the number of intermediate agencies by which any work is performed , the more imperfectly is the work done , and the greater is the unnecessary expenditure . Now , government is itself an agent . It must perform the work by means of another set of agents . Under these may be half a dozen others , in the form of contractors , and sub-contractors . All these unnecessary agencies must be paid out of the public purse , and their accounts adjusted by those who have no special motive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who conduct the work , pay for it themselves , and whose profits , in the end , must depend upon the goodness of the work , and the cheapness of its execution . 4 . A work of this kind , when completed , will be more faithfully superintended by private , than by public owners . The private owner knows that he must conduct his operation economically , and maintain the favor of the public , or else he will gain nothing by his investment . A government is under no such salutary check- 5 . But a still stronger objection to the confiding of such works to the public , is , the amount of patronage which it must , of necessity , place in the hands of a government . The power to make roads and canals whenever it pleased , and to employ upon them whomsoever it pleased , once placed in the hands of a party , would /z/ perpetuate it in office forever , in spite of any violation of right which it might perpetrate , or any corruption of which it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that a large portion of the investment in internal improvement niade by our State authorities will prove- an almost total loss . For these reasons , it seems to me that the safer rule would be to leave works of this kind to be executed by private corporations . This , however , is a general , and not an universal rule . Works may be of such magnitude , or they may be of so great national importance , that they must be executed and controlled by the public at large . These cases are , however , I apprehend , the exceptions . The rule I suppose to be as above stated . There are , however , other improvements , of very great importance , the superintendence of which belongs , of necessity , to a government ; it is that class of improvements which reduce the expense , and lessen the risk of external commerce . Among these , the most important are the removal of obstructions from harbors ; the location of buoys and the erection of light-houses ; the execution of accurate surveys ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a country . The more perfect these become , the less is the risk of shipwreck , in leaving and approaching a coast ; of course , the less is the cost of insurance , and the less the price of every thing imported and exported . Hence , a nation , offering these advantages , becomes a better market for all other nations , and they will the more readily resort to her for exchanges . Improvements of this sort are one of the most economical forms of national investment ; they frequently save , in a single year , the whole cost of their erection . The loss of property and life , by shipwreck , on almost every coast , is enormous . The greater part of this loss might probably be saved , by judicious expenditure upon improvements on the coast , and proper regulations for the government of pilots . 3 . I have said , above , that exchanges will be effected by the security or insecurity of the right of property . Hence , legislators can do much to promote the prosper- /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , by which contracts shall be enforced , wrongs redressed , and injuries prevented . And they should be specially careful that they are not guilty , in their social character , of what they forbid to others in their individual character . They should be scrupulous in the observance of individual right , and should remember , that a single individual is as important as a nation , when the question of justice is concerned . And the same principles apply to the treatment of foreigners . No foreigner can traffic with another country , without placing his property in the power of the citizens of that country . If his rights be respected , and he be assured of the benefit of equal laws , he will invest his properly abroad as freely as at home ; and will , with confidence , and on the most moderate terms , effect exchanges to as great a'n extent as he is able . Hence , under these circumstances , exchanges will be effected to the greatest advantage of both countries , and they will naturally flow from other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the case , if the rights of foreigners are disregarded . Other nations will desire their custom , if we do not . Commerce will leave our shores , and we shall be left in the well-known condition of the dog in the manger . The fable , I believe , informs us that he was starved to death . /z/ IN the preceding chapter , I have endeavored to illustrate the general principles of exchange , and the conditions by which it is regulated . Exchange , however , like every other benefit which we enjoy in this life , can only be accomplished by labor . But in this , as in eve/y other case , it holds true , that a great advantage is gained by increasing the productiveness of labor ; that is , by enabling the same individuals , by the same labor , to accomplish a greater amount of exchange . And it holds true in this , as in other cases , that the result of labor is more perfect , just in proportion as the produc tiveness of labor is increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument or tool must be used . A man who can not split a log by the direct use of his hands , will find no difficulty in splitting it with a beetle and wedges . So , also , he who would find it impossible to effect a dozen exchanges in a day , if he insisted on exchanging the products themselves , will find no difficulty in doing it in a few minutes , by means of the instrument which has been invented for this purpose , and he will not only thus do it in a shorter time , but also on better terms , and with much greater exactitude . This instrument , of so much importance in exchange , is money ; to a consideration of the nature and uses of which , we shah 1 devote this and the succeeding chapters The present chapter will be confined to the considera /z/ tion of . a metallic currency . We commence with the use of a circulating medium . In treating of this subject , we shall first consider the difficulties which must necessarily embarrass exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which these difficulties are removed by means of a circulating medium . I. The difficulties which attend upon exchange in kind . By exchange in kind , I mean exchange of commodity for commodity , as when a farmer exchanges wheat for sugar , or pork for iron , &c.; 1 . Suppose a producer to have prepared jiis product for consumption . If he be obliged to exchange in kind , it may be a long time before he finds another person who desires the article which he has created . If he be obliged to wait long , his product , if perishable , will be either destroyed or deteriorated . Pie must go in search of a purchaser ; and if he at length find one , he may have consumed , in the search , as much time as the article originally cost . This must be added to the cost of the article , or else he will be a loser . But , by this additional cost , the product is no better ; it is only dearer . This must , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional cost , both parties are poorer . 2 . But it is to be remembered , that the producer not only wants to part with his product , but also to part with it for some definite object of desire . He who has raised wheat , does not wish simply to part with his wheat , but also to receive in exchange for it , tea , or coffee , or iron , or salt , or clothing . He must , therefore , in order to effect the exchange which he desires , not only find some one who wishes for wheat , but also some one who is able to give him , in return , the precise product he desires . If he desire clothing in return , it will not be sufficient to find some one who offers him bread , or shoes , or butcher 's meat . This , also , increases the difficulty of exchange , and , of course , the labor and the cost necessary to effect it . 3 . But this is not all . Men who wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal amounts . A /z/ grazier who brings a fatted ox to market , may find persons enough who want a few pounds of beef , bui very few who want a whole ox . The grazier can not divide his ox , and give a part of it for a few pounds of coffee or tea ; nor , probably , does he require one fourth of the value of the ox , in any article which can be purchased in the town where it may be sold . He wishes to obtain , by the sale of the ox , additional provender for the support of his remaining herd . This he can not , perhaps , procure , except in the country ; or if he could procure it , the merchant who owns the provender , would not want a whole ox for butcher 's meat . Thus , exchanges would be arrested ; or must be made very rarely , and at great cost , and under every possible disadvantage . 4 . Such are the difficulties which attend upon the exchange of material products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material products give rise to but a small part of the exchanges which are , by necessity , made among men . One great article to be exchanged is labor . This every man produces , and must produce , by the law of his nature ; and this , every man is able to offer in exchange for the objects of desire . Now , were exchange only in kind , a man who had nothing but labor or skill to offer , would not be able to labor for those who desired his labor and who would give him the greatest wages for it ; but he must labor for those who were willing to give , in ever so small quantity , the articles which he needed for his support . The laborer in an iron-foundry would be obliged to take his pay in ircr But , as he could not exchange his iron with the baker , the butcher , or the clothier , he must go and work for these producers , for any compensation by which he might obtain for himself the necessaries of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bread . But he would want only a small portion of bread for himself , and he must spend his time in exchanging it for whatever else he needed . If he could not thus procure tea , coffee , clothing , and other necessaries , he must leave his occupation , and work for those who wished to exchange them for his labor . The physician must take his /z/ fee in iron , or bread , or butcher 's meat ; and if any of his patients produced what he did not want , he must either attend them gratuitously , or they must die without assistance . Besides this , there are many products incapable of division . If a hundred men engaged in building a ship or a house , how would they take their pay in kind , without taking the ship in pieces , and thus rendering their work wholly useless ? 5 . Hence , were exchange only in kind , there would be no division of labor , except in its most imperfect form . No man could perfect himself in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , he could not possibly procure the means of sustenance . I have already shown , how impossible it would be for him to do this by the practice of any one of the ordinary mechanical trades . How much more , when these trades are minutely subdivided . I have elsewhere stated the advantages of this subdivision . But how could this be effected , if exchange were made only in kind ? Suppose a man employs his time in the single process of heading pins , or in forming the rivets for the handles of pen-knives ; how could he subsist by exchange in kind ? Who would give him what he needed for subsistence , for his pin-heads , or for his knife-handle rivets ? Hence , division of labor , so essential to the productiveness of human industry , to the progress of society , and to the use of natural agents , could exist only in its most elementary forms , were exchange limited in the manner we have supposed . And , if it be said that this inconvenience could be avoided by establishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could remedy it only in part . They could assist in the exchange of nothing but material products , and of those which were not rapidly perishable . They could present no relief for exchanges of labor . Hence , they would do almost nothing to facilitate division of labor , and could carry forward the progress of society in no respect beyond its most rude beginnings . From such causes as tjjese , arises the necessity of a circulating medium ; and it will be easily seen , in what /z/ manner , by means of a circulating medium , they are remedied . 1 . Suppose that the producer can always exchange his product , not for the article which he immediately wants , but for some other article which is universally wanted , and wanted at all times , and in all quantities . As soon as the producer has , by exchange , possessed himself of this commodity , he may then , on account of its universal desirableness , easily procure , by another exchange , whatever he may need . In this manner , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labor of days or of weeks may be accomplished . Thus , if salt were this commodity , and every one wanted salt in all quantities , at all times , and at a fixed value ; by exchanging every thing for salt , and then exchanging salt for whatever we might desire , the labor of exchanges would be vastly diminished . 2 . This convenience , however , will be much increased , if the article of universal desire be small in bulk ; because , in this case , much of the labor of transportation will be avoided . Were the- lace-maker obliged to exchange his lace for salt , he would be obliged to furnish himself with a cart , in which to receive his payment . And thus , in general , instead of a purse , in which to carry our money , we should require , for this purpose , the use of a wagon and horses . 3 . If this circulating medium be also minutely divisible , it will possess still greater conveniences . The producer may then part with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can procure , with a circulating medium , as small a portion of that which he wishes in exchange , as he may choose . The farmer , instead of exchanging one part of his wheat for tea , another part for coffee , and another part for clothing ; or else , exchanging it all for tea , and then endeavoring to find customers for his tea , may exchange it all for the circulating medium , procure as much of each as he pleases , or , if he choose , make no further exchange whatever . 4 . The case is still stronger , when labor is one of the articles to be exchanged . The laborer will now no /z/ onger be obliged to labor at any price , for him who is able to give him in exchange what he immediately wants ; but he may labor for any one who will give him , in return , this object of general desire . Hence % he is now at liberty to labor for him who will give him the best wages ; that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantageously to himself . With this he can procure whatever he wants , in such portions as he may desire . 5 . The practicability of the division of . labor now becomes immediately apparent . If the laborer be paid in the article of universal desire , it makes no difference whether the person who produces what he wants , needs or does not need , his particular product . He wants the object of universal desire , and this is enough ; for , by this , the laborer can effect exchanges with him or with any one else . If he can procure this circulating medium by means of pin-heads , err knife-handle rivets , this is all that he wants . He is now as independent as though he produced that which every one wants ; since , by means of *what he produces , he can procure that which every one wants . Thus , we see . that every man is , in tl ) 5s manner , able to devote himself to that in which his skill will be most productive to himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of universal desire , all are equally independent ; and all are able , in the most successful manner , to avail themselves of the fruits of their own industry . Now , whatever it is that performs the office of thus facilitating exchanges , is called a circulating medium . So great has been the necessity of some such instrument , that even the rudest nations have always been found adopting some such contrivance with advantage . Thus , the natives of the African coast were formerly n the habit of using , as money , small white sea-shells , denominated cowries . In pastoral nations , cattle were frequently used as a circulating medium . Thus we are told , by Homer , that the armor of Diomede cost nine oxen . Sheep , probably , were also used for the same purpose . The ordi-/z/ nary mode , among such nations , of estimating the wealth of an individual , was by the number of his flocks and herds . Hence , probably , arose the custom , among the Greeks and Romans , of stamping their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep . Hence , also , the Latin word pecunia , money , is supposed to be derived from pecus , a sheep . From reasons which will easily suggest themselves , all other substances soon gave place to the metals , as a circulating medium . Different metals were , however , used at firsT by different nations . The first instance on record , of the use of metals , as a medium of exchange , is found in Genesis 23 : 16. u And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron . And Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named , in the audience of the sons of Heth , four hundred shekels of silver , current money with the merchant . " We see that at this time the money was weighed ; that is , was not paid by tale . I presume that the metals were used as a circulating medium for a long period before they were fashioned into coin . At a much later period , the baser metals were used as money by the Greeks and Romans . Thus the Lacedemonians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Romans used copper or brass in the early ages of their history . Hence , ces signifies , in Latin , both brass and money . These , however , in all places , have long since given place to gold and silver , which are hence denominated the precious metals . These are now used for the purposes of money , throughout the known world , except among the rudest and most barbarous tribes . Copper is used only in the payment of sums less in value than the lowest denomination of silver coin . In some countries , both gold and silver are made a legal tender in payment of debts ; in other countries , only one of these metals is used . In this country , both are thus established by law . In Great Britain , gold is the only legal tender for all sums greater than twenty shillings , and silver for all sums of less amount . Copper is used only in payment of sums less than sixpence . /z/ In order to render any substance available as a circulating medium , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such . Its object is to facilitate exchanges , but it can accomplish this object , only by means of the willingness of the whole community to exchange for it every thing which they are willing to part with . If one individual of a community prefer one substance , and another individual another , exchanges will be embarrassed , by unnecessary multiplication , and by the useless consumption of time . And if , on the other hand , any substance be thus universally desired ; on account of the great facilities which it offers , and the great saving of labor which it effects , it will be immediately used for this purpose . And it will be so used , without any agency of government ; and even although a government did not exist ; just as a man will use any other instrument for increasing the productiveness of his labor as soon as he can procure it ; simply for the reason that it is for his advantage . If the exchanges of a country were wholly internal , it would be sufficient that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , inasmuch as every nation has important and extensive exchanges with other nations , it is an additional advantage to have the same substance used as a circulating medium by all . We have already seen , that that exchange is the most profitable for a country , in which it exports what is relatively most abundant at home , and imports that which is relatively most wanted at home ; and imports it from that country in which , what it exports is most wanted , and what it imports is most abundant . Now , it is evident , that the circulating medium may be . accumulated in any country , so that it shall be relatively lower in price than other commodities . Thus , the pre- /z/ cious metals may be so abundant in this country , that a merchant can procure more iron in Russia by sending a given amount of silver , than by sending the flour which would here be equal in value to the silver . It is , therefore , for his advantage to send the silver , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the same reason , if in this country there be a relative scarcity , it will be for the advantage of other nations , as well as for our advantage , that they should send silver in exchange for our products . In this manner , exchanges are made , of that which is least wanted by both parties , for that which is most wanted by both . This enables both parties to supply themselves at the lowest rates . Besides , it is very desirable that the value of the circulating medium , be as little as possible liable to fluctuation . Now if the same substances be used in all the civilized world , this fluctuation , if not absolutely prevented , will be so restricted , as to produce the least possible amount of evil . When exchanges between countries are frequent and numerous , and the prices of all commodities are universally known by the merchants of both , as specie may be sent abroad with very little cost of transportation , a very slight advance in its relative value will cause it to flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cause it to flow to other countries , until the common equilibrium be restored . In this , we see in what manner the universal employment of the same substances , by all nations holding intercourse with each other , will be an advantage to all ; inasmuch as it will prevent any great fluctuation in their relative value in any particular country . While , however , it is the fact , that any thing which is thus universally acceptable will be used as money , there are various circumstances on which this acceptableness depends . Some of these are the following : 1 . Its cost , or , in other words , the amount of labor necessary to its production , must be as invariable as possible . Hence , it could not be a vegetable product , because the variations in the productiveness of labor thus employed are very great . An abundant harvest pro- /z/ duces a rapid fall , and a famine produces a rapid rise , in the price of wheat . On this account , a metal is preferable ; because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labor employed in producing it , and is less liable to be influenced by disturbing forces . 2 . It should be an article of high price ; that is , within a small bulk , it should concentrate a large amount of value , or represent a large amount of labor . This is , of course , a great advantage , by saving the labor of transportation . Every one sees that the commerce of the world , at its present state , must instantly cease , if we were obliged to exchange our gold and silver for the iron money of Lycurgus . Yet , to this remark there is a limit . As a substance may not be of a price sufficiently high , so it may also be of a price too high for the purposes of money . Precious stones are minerals , and they cost all the price at which they are sold ; but they are too dear to be used for this purpose ; that is , though they might answer for the exchange of great values , yet , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they would be of so small bulk , as to be very easily lost . 3 . The substance must be capable of division , without loss of value . As it is desirable that provision be made for facilitating all sorts of exchanges , the substance used as money , should be capable of division into such portions as may suit the convenience of every one , without itself suffering , by this division , any diminution of value . On this account , also , the precious stones would be unsuitable for this purpose , because their value is not proportional to their size . A large diamond is worth several times its weight of small diamonds . If it be divided , its value is very greatly diminished ; and having been once divided , its value can never be restored . On the contrary , a lump of gold may be divided into one hundred pieces , and the value of all the pieces together , is equal to the original value of the whole . They may if occasion require , be again united into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as before . /z/ 4 . The substance should be of such a nature , that it can be easily verified ; that is , it should be susceptible of such preparation , that every one can readily assure himself of its purity and weight ; that is , of its value . Unless this can be done , at every exchange , every one must examine and try every piece by itself . This would consume much time , would require the possession of great skill in every individual , and would , by its frequent repetition , soon wear away the substance itself . Hence , it is of advantage that the metals used for money should be peculiar in their weight and color , and that their appearance should attract attention , so that their peculiarities may be easily learned and distinguished . The brilliant lustre of silver and gold , therefore , adds very much to their fitness for coin . Their weight , also , presents a ready means for the detection of adulteration . Platina , which is used in Russia for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in weight ; but it has no lustre , and , in appearance , it very much resembles the baser metals . This will be an objection to its universal acceptableness. 5 . It should be as little as possible liable to decay . Were it easily destructible , great , losses would constantly occur ; as the loss must fall upon the individual in whose hands it happened at the time to be . And besides , it would be from this cause liable to so great fluctuation in value , that it could never be used as a circulating medium . Were fish or wheat the circulating medium , since both are liable to rapid decay , a change of weather might frequently ruin a man . No one would exchange , at such hazards , for the circulating medium , and all exchange would be made in kind . Could the circulating medium always bear the same relative price to other commodities , it would probably be advantageous . But as this is impossible , it is manifest , that that commodity which is liable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best adapted to this purpose . 6 . As we sometimes desire to make small and sometimes large exchanges ; and , as the substance best adapted to the one is not always best adapted to the other , /z/ there is an advantage in employing two metals for this purpose . For this reason , both silver and gold are commonly employed in most civilized countries . For exchanges of less value than the smallest silver coin , copper is also generally used . And , if silver should ever become so abundant and cheap as to be too bulky to be used for effecting small exchanges , it would take the place of copper , and its place would be supplied by gold . Should gold become as abundant as silver , it would take the place of silver and some dearer metal , as platina would be used in its stead . Inasmuch as gold and silver possess all the essential qualities which are required in a circulating medium ; and as the condition of man so manifestly points to the necessity of some such instrument , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universally been adopted for this purpose . But it is always to be remembered , that we use them as a circulating medium , because ice want a circulating medium , and because they accomplish the purpose . We do not use them as a circulating medium , because we see a stamp upon them , nor because government has made them a legal tender ; but because we know that they represent a given amount of value , and we therefore know , that we can exchange them for the same amount of value , whenever we please . If a bushel of wheat sell for a dollar , we know that it costs as much labor to produce a dollar at the mine and bring it to us , as to produce a bushel of wheat and bring it to us . Hence , we know that , until some new and vastly more productive mines are discovered , this dollar can not be produced for less labor , nor represent a less amount of value . And , as every body wants a dollar , and no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will bring , in exchange , the same as we have given for it . We remarked , when speaking of exchangeable value , that the demand for any product , and , of course , its exchangeable value , was affected by the number of desires it would gratify . The greater the number of desires which it will gratify , the greater the number of persons who will want it ; hence , they will overbid each /z/ other ; and , unless there be some improved , that is , cheaper method of producing it , its exchangeable value will rise . This principle applies to whatever is used as money . The precious metals are used for ornament , for domestic utensils , and for coin . If the use of them for one of these purposes should be discontinued , the demand would be less ; and , as they are not liable to decay , their relative price would fall . Hence it is , that the amount of plate and utensils formed of the precious metals , in a country , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reverse . Should commerce be unproductive , and exchanges diminish , and our intercourse with other nations be cut off , and we be reduced to the condition of Europe in the dark ages , there would be but little need of the precious metals as an instrument of exchange , and their price would fall . Hence they would be melted down by the rich , into plate . And , on the other hand , when they have been used for plate , and the demand for them , and their consequent price , have from any cause subsequently increased , the temptation to use them productively , is too great to allow them to be employed in this manner ; arid the plate is melted into coin , and its place supplied with porcelain , or plated ware , or glass , or any other material of equal beauty , but of inferior costliness. /z/ Let us now suppose metals to have been selected by the whole community as the circulating medium , and that they have been so divided and verified as to be fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rome of the functions which these metals . would discharge . Money is the instrument for facilitating exchanges This , when considered as money , is its only office . By /z/ accomplishing this purpose in the least time , and at the least expense of labor , and transportation , and wear , it reduces the cost of every product , and thus adds immensely to the productiveness of human industry . The principles on which it accomplishes this result , have been already alluded to . They are briefly as follows /z/ 1 . The . cost or price of the money employed in every exchange , is equal to the cost or price of the article which is exchanged for it . If a barrel of flour in Lima be exchanged for ten ounces of silver , the cost of producing the flour , and of transporting it to Lima , is equal to the cost of producing the silver and transporting it to the same place . If a barrel of flour in New York , be exchanged for seven ounces of silver , the cost and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equal to that of the other . If the flour merchant wishes for a thousand ounces of silver , he can procure it more cheaply by producing flour than he can by going to the mines of Mexico , and working it out from the ore . And , if the miner wishes for flour , he can procure it more cheaply by working in the mine , than by attempting to raise wheat and manufacture flour on the mountains of Potosi . That this is so , is evident from the fact , that if the cost of the precious metals change , their exchangeable value varies , like that of any other product . Thus , if new and richer mines are opened , so that the cost of producing the precious metals is reduced , or , in other words , so that mining labor is more productive , the price of the precious meta*ls falls . In such a case , we receive more silver for a day 's work , for a bushel of wheat , for a pound of wool , or for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same principle that when a wheat harvest is abundant , we receive a larger amount of wheat for a day 's work , or for a pound of wool , than at other times . This is exemplified , in the great change of prices which occurred throughout the world after the discovery of the mines of South America . And , on the other hand , when the price of producing the precious /z/ metals is increased , their exchangeable value rises . This has been the case , for some time past , in consequence of the civil wars of South America . Hence , there has been for some time past , a gradual rise in the price of the precious metals ; that is , the price of other things has fallen ; or , in general , if the cost of the production of the precious metals diminishes , while that of the production of wheat remains the same , we shall receive more silver in exchange for a bushel of wheat . If the cost of producing an ounce of silver is increased while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we shall receive less silver , in exchange for a bushel of wheat . That is , in exchanging products for the precious metals , as for any thing else , we exchange on the principle of labor for labor . Besides , the price of the precious metals , like that of any other commodity , is influenced , in short periods , by the fluctuations of supply and demand . There is , in any country , the course of whose industry is not distorted by legislation , a supply of money , equal to the ordinary wants of the community , for the purposes of exchange . The price of both articles , is , in such a case , based upon the cost of the production of specie , compared with the cost of the production of the several articles for which it is exchanged . But , suppose that while this amount of specie remains the same , there should happen a year of universal productiveness in all the departments of agricultural , manufacturing , and commercial industry . In this case , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportionally increased . The instrument with which exchanges were to be made , would be relatively scarce ; the demand for it would rise ; and there would be competition among the bidders for it . Hence , its exchangeable value would rise ; that is , we should give more wool , and wheat , and cotton , for an ounce of silver ; every thing would be cheap ; or , in other words , for an ounce of silver , we should procure a larger amount of other products ; as we always do , in a season of universal productiveness . And , on the contrary , if , while the ordinary amount o ' /z/ specie remained in the country , there occurred a very unproductive season , the number of exchanges would proportionally diminish , and there would be less demand for the instrument of exchange . There would arise a competition among the sellers , and the relative price of money would fall ; we should give more money for every other article of necessity ; that is , every thing would be dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season of scarcity . We see , then , that the exchangeable value of money , is not derived from its shape or color , from the stamp of the mint , or from the enactments of the government ; but that , like every thing else , it is based upon the cost of its production , varying , slightly , and for short periods , like every thing else , with the accidental fluctuations of supply and demand . And hence , the reason why a man exchanges a bushel of wheat for two ounces of silver- , and a yard of broadcloth for six ounces , is , that it costs as much labor and capital to produce the one at the place of exchange , as the other , and that no one can produce the given amount of silver , by mining , or in any other way , without expending the same amount of labor and capital , that the flour merchant or the manufacturer has expended in the creation of his products . As , then , every man , when he exchanges his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commodity of as much cost ; that is , which represents the same amount of labor and capital , as that for which he exchanges it ; and , as he knows that every one wants this commodity , that is , he can procure with it any thing which any one else has to exchange ; and , as no one who wants it , can procure it on any better terms from any one else than from himself , every one is willing to exchange for money , and would rather exchange for it than for any thing else . As this feeling is universal , every one acts upon the same principle ; and 1 hence , all exchanges are either made in money , or else are regulated by it . II . But the question will naturally arise , if the value of the silver be equal to that of all the amounts exchang- /z/ ed for it , must not the value of the precious metals in the community , be equal to the value of all the other commodities ? We answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually made in money , and actually made at the same instant . But the contrary is the fact . No man exchanges all his products at once , but exchanges them in successive portions . If two men possess one thousand dollars ' worth of commodities ; for instance , if A and B live in different towns , and if A have wool and B have wheat , and they exchange the whole at once , and use money as the instrument , they must each possess also one thousand dollars with which to make the exchange ; that is , A must give B one thousand dollars for his wool , and vice versa . But , if they exchange in portions of the value of ten dollars , at one hundred successive times , ten dollars in the possession of each , and the same identical ten dollars , would accomplish the whole object . Now , as it is evident , that on any particular day , only a very small part of the whole amount of vahaes in the possession of the community , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instrument of exchange is necessary , as will accomplish the exchanges which the convenience of the community requires . No one supposes , because there is a million tons of merchandise in a city , that there must have been vehicles capable of carrying a million tons. , at once in order to bring it there . A - locomotive , carrying fifty tons at once , if it went and returned frequently , would speedily accomplish the whole work . 2 . But this is not all . A large amount of exchanges is constantly made in kind . A buys wool of B , and B buys cloth of A. They both estimate the value of their product in money , because , as this is the usual medium of exchange , and that by which they are obliged to estimate cost , this method of estimation is most convenient . Each charges the other with all that he purchases , at its value in silver . At the close of the year , they adjust their accounts with each other . If A and B have both received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silver , the one account balances the other ; and thus , no money at all is 1 required . If one have received more than the other , he pays merely the difference , either in silver , or else in his own product , at the option of his creditor . In this manner , a large proportion of the exchanges actually made , is conducted . In this manner , book-keeping tends greatly to diminish the amount of the circulating medium necessary for the exchanges of a community . 3 . We see that this is - still more emphatically the case , in respect to all the exchanges which take place between different districts , and different nations . Inasmuch as no society can gain possession of the objects of desire , except by its own labor , it must pay for what it receives in the product of the labor of others , with what it sends away , in the product of its own labor ; that is to say , the exports of any country must be substantially equal to its imports . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely equal , there would be no need of the transmission of any money at all between them If A send ten thousand dollars ' worth of cotton to Liverpool , and import ten thousand dollars ' worth ot calicos from Manchester ; he authorizes the manufacturer in Manchester to receive in payment , the ten thousand dollars which are due to him from the merchant in Liverpool ; and , thus , the whole matter is adjusted . If we receive from England , values to a larger amount than she wishes to receive in our own productions , we send some of our productions to a third country , and thus procure for England , what she wishes from the third country , in sufficient quantity to pay the residue . If we can get her products , in this manner , cheaper than we can make them ourselves , it is for our interest to do so . If they thus come to us at a cost greater than that for which we could produce them ourselves , we shall relinquish the trade , and begin to manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the use of money . And hence , in general , the onjy reason why money is sent from one country to another , in the transactions of commerce , is the same reason as that for which tea , or coffee , or /z/ cotton , or flour , is sent ; that is , because it is so much cheaper in the country from which it is sent , than in that to which it is exported , that a larger value can be procured for it , than for the same value of any other commodity . In this case , it is for the advantage of both countries that it should be so exchanged . The amount of the circulating medium , in any one country , and , of course , in all countries , must , therefore , be very small , in proportion to the whole amount of the capital of a country . Th actual proportion , perhaps , can not be estimated with accuracy . In Great Britain , writers on this subject have greatly varied . Some have estimated it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan of the whole capital . The latter is , probably , by far the nearer to the truth . III . We see , then , that , under given circumstances , in any country , a given amount of specie will be required to effect its exchanges ; and that , that amount will depend upon the relative value of the precious metals with other things , and upon the number and the facilities of exchange . These latter circumstances remaining the same , the same value in specie will always be required , and no more . If specie , equal in value to ten million bushels of wheat be required , no more in value can be used . If the amount be increased , its value will fall . If the amount be diminished , its value will rise . And this rise and fall will equally take place , whether the relative variation arise from a change in the cost of specie or of other products . Now , it is easy to see that these variations , if left alone , mil regulate themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value cf specie and of other products may vary . Let us suppose , in the first instance , that production , in any one year , is greatly increased , so that money in any country is dear , or , which is the same thing , that other products are cheap . Let us , for the sake of illustration , suppose , that in Kew York , flour is sold at four dollars per barrel If , now , a merchant wished to import a cargo of wine from Bordeaux , since four dollars and a barrel of flour /z/ here , are at the same price , he can as cheaply send out the one as the other , with which to pay for his wine . But suppose that a barrel of flour will purchase more wine in Bordeaux , than four dollars or four ounces of silver . He will then send flour , instead of silver ; and , as all other men in their senses will do the same , of course no specie will leave the country . On the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , will ascertain the relative value of specie , and that of calico , or hardware , or iron ; and will send specie in payment for his cotton , whenever he finds that , by a given value of this export , he can import a greater amount of cotton , than by the same value of any other . Other merchants in other places will do the same , until the requisite amount of specie has flowed in , and it has become as abundant here , as in other countries . Thus , when specie is high in any country , it goes gut nowhere , and comes in from everywhere . On the contrary : suppose an unproductive season to arise , and the relative quantity of specie in this country , to exceed the average in other countries . In this country , therefore , specie would be cheap ; that is , every thing else would be dear . The merchant , who wished to import a cargo of iron , would . compare the prices of flour and of money . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he could purchase , at the same price , a barrel of flour and fifteen dollars , he would easily ascertain by which , in Russia , he could procure the greatest amount of iron . If fifteen dollars would procure the most iron , he would send the dollars instead of the flour . This would be an advantage to him and to the country , because , by this mode of exchange , he receives the largest amount in return ; and he procures it by means of that which is relatively the most abundant ; that is , which is manifestly the least needed . And a merchant in Liverpool , who knows the prices of our products , observing that he can exchange more profitably with us by receiving his payment in specie , at the relative prices which specie and products sustain to each other , will receive his payments in specie . ' Thus , by the sending /z/ abroad of our specie , which we do not so much need , we shall be supplied with other products which we more need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other products , will be again brought to an equilibrium . In other words , when specie is cheajj in any country , it comes in from nowhere , and goes out everywhere . Thus , among countries between which there is frequent intercourse , and a free circulation of mercantile information , the price of the precious metals can never , for long periods , vary much from the medium rate , or , the rate which is fixed by nature , in the- cost of their production . Hence we see , that a provision is made , founded - on the self-interest of man , by which any great fluctuation in the exchangeable value of the metals used as a circulating medium , is prevented. * It is evident that the same consequences must ensue , from what cause soever the rise of prices may have taken place . Suppose that instead of a diminution of productions , there should occur an increase of the circulating medium , as , for instance , by very large issues of bank paper . The proportion between the circulating medium and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be plenty , and prices would rise . They might easily rise so high that products could not be exported as well as money . Specie would then be exported , and the bank notes would be recalled . Thus large issues and high prices , create , of necessity , mercantile distress and stagnation of business . IV . Hence , we also see what is a real scar city , and what an abundance of money ; if , by the term money , we understand merely a metallic circulating medium * While , however , this is the natural cause for the exportation of specie , other causes , which may be termed accidental , frequently occur . Where one pountry is largely indebted to another country , and its payments fall due at a time when the supply of its own products is insufficient to meet its indebtedness , or when the foreign market is glutted with those products ; specially if there be any doubt of its ultimate solvency ; then , in order to meet its engagements in time , t is frequently obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficiency . This is one of the results of the abuse of credit , and is always attended with great financial embarrassment . /z/ Money , we have said , is the instrument by which we facilitate exchanges . Now , if we bear this in mind , it is easy to see what is a plenty and what a scarcity of this instrument . A power loom is an instrument for facilitating the operation of transforming yarn into cloth Power looms are too plentiful , when there are too many to perform the work that is required to be done ; in this case , we can buy them cheap ; that is , we have to give for them a less amount of cotton cloth , or of wool , or of silver . Power looms are scarce , when there are not enough of them to perform the operations which are required ; in this case , we find it difficult to purchase them ; they are dear ; that is , we are obliged to give for them more than the ordinary amount of cotton , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same with vehicles for transportation , or with any other instruments . Now money is just such an instrument . It is required , to facilitate exchanges . To accomplish a given amount of exchange , a certain value in money is required , and , in ordinary times , this value always exists . And , the exchanges remaining the same , we can not employ for this purpose more than this amount of value . If a quantity equal to one thousand ounces of silver , o ? " of one thousand bushels of wheat , be required to perform the exchanges of a certain community , we can not employ more than this amount of value . If we increase the quantity , we shall only decrease the value proportionally . If such a country be insulated from other countries , and we introduce into its circulation one thousand additional ounces of silver , equal to one thousand additional bushels of wheat , the value of the whole two thousand will be just equal to that of the one thousand ounces before ; that is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , from such a country thus insulated , we remove half the circulating medium , the remaining half will accomplish the purpose of the whole ; that is , it will double in value . This is evident , because there are neither more nor less exchanges to be made than before , and a variation in the instrument does not vary the amount of the work which the necessities of the com-/z/ community require to be done . If there be a given amount of yarn to be woven by twenty looms , the quantity will not be increased , by employing forty looms . And , if we employ forty , we must work all of them but half the time ; that is , each one will be of half its original value . If the work be doubled , we must work them by day and by night ; that is , each one will be worth twice as much as before . But , manifestly , the quantity of work to be done being given , it can never be affected by varying the quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suppose the exchanges , in a given community , be equal to fifty millions annually , and that there are required , to effect these exchanges , one million ounces of silver , and that this quantity of silver actually exists in its possession . Under these circumstances , there will be neither a plenty nor a scarcity of money , and it will be neither exported nor imported . But suppose , that , owing to a very productive harvest , or some rapid improvement in the productiveness of human labor , the amount of products to be exchanged arises to seventyfive millions . Here will arise a scarcity of money ; there will be more exchanges than can be accomplished by the instrument employed for effecting them . The price of money will rise ; in other words , the price of other commodities will fall , and every thing will be cheap ; that is , though you can not purchase more wool , or butcher 's meat , or cotton , with a barrel of flour , than you could last year , you can purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money which a barrel of flc.ur cost last year . The same result will take place , if , while production continues as active , one half of the specie for any purpose , as the carrying on of a foreign war . were sent out of the country . In this case , as in the other , the price of money will rise ; that is , money wib be dear , and every thing else will be cheap . But it is easy to see , on the principles already explained , in what manner this difficulty will be met . In the first place , inasmuch as money prices are lower than any others ; that is , as specie retains its former value in /z/ all other places , but here , it is dearer ; that is , will purchase more than any other commodity ; other nations will send specie in exchange . This will be done , until the equilibrium is restored . And thus , this one nation shares the blessing of God 's providence with its neighbors , since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second place , something else , as , for instance , notes of hand , will be , in part , substituted for specie ; that is to say , as there is too much exchanging to be done in a given time by the instrument , at its utmost power of working , the work is spread over a longer time , and , instead of exchanging for specie now , the parties agree to exchange , but defer the payment for three or six months . Thus , when a weaver is unable to perform the work of his customers to-day , he promises to do it at a subsequent time ; and , in the mean while , if his present instrument will not accomplish it , he procures others that will . So , the merchant spreads the exchange of to-day over a larger time , and , in this time , is able to secure the instrument to accomplish the object . And thus we see , what is also an unusual plentifulness of money . If , while exchanges were at fifty millions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mine were discovered , by which the quantity in. circulation was doubled , the price of silver would fall , and we should give twice the usual price for commodities . Or , if while the silver remained the same , production , and , of course , exchange , diminished one half , the result would be the same . In this case , as we have already seen , specie would be sent in exchange to other countries , because it was less needed , and its place would be supplied by other productions which were more needed . Hence we see , that a plentifulness or a scarcity of money forms no occasion which calls for the interference of government , but that it is a matter , which , if left alone , will regulate itself . When money is really scarce , there is no need of prohibiting its exportation ; for no one will bs so unwise as to export it . When ' t /z/ is abundant , it is useless to prohibit its exportation , because it can not be prevented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by preventing it , we should deprive ourselves of the only method in our power of alleviating the evils which we suffer . The precious metals are relatively abundant in the states of South America ; that is , they need other kinds of capital more than they need this . How absurd a policy would it be , to forbid the exportation of those metals , and thus deprive themselves of all the conveniences of other countries , nay , of the very means on which progress in civilization and the arts , and in the real accumulation of wealth , depends . Hence the notion , that the plentifulness or scarcity of money is an unfailing indication of the prosperity or of the adversity of a country , is , in the highest degree , fallacious . If the scarcity result from an increased productiveness of labor , it is an indication of prosperity ; just as the business of weaving is most prosperous , when the weavers have more work than they can do . If it result from a casual withdrawment of specie , it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend upon the use which is made of that which is sent abroad . If it be employed in wars , or in other unproductive consumption , it is just so much loss ; and it matters not whether this amount of loss be in silver , or gold , or copper , or tea , or coffee , or cotton . If it be well invested , and return in the form of a profitable addition to the capital of the country , it is just as much a source of gain , as though the same profit were made upon any other article . It is profitable for an individual to give one thousand dollars for what is worth fifteen bun dred dollars , although , for a month afterwards , he be obliged to live somewhat more economically . And what is profitable for the individual , is profitable for the country . And so of the plentifulness of money . If a mine were discovered , by which the quantity of silver were doubled , and if this silver were produced at a fair profit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would open a new and profitable method of employing /z/ both capital and labor . But , in this case , it could be of use only by its exportation , because , as the number of exchanges in the country has not been increased , only the former amount of value is needed for a circulating medium , and lo increase the quantity , will be only to diminish the value . By being sent abroad , capital , in other forms , susceptible of change and increase of value , is imported ; and thus , a country is made richer . If the plentifulness be the result of the diminution of exchanges , it is an indication of adversity , because it shows that productiveness has fallen off , that the means of living are less abundant , and that capital is in haste to flee to more congenial climes . When this is the case , it generally springs from oppressive legislation . In this case , it is better for a government to remove the cause , than to aggravate the evil by additional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a case , is not only to oppress a human being , but to forbid him the use of any means by which he shall escape from your oppression . Thus it follows , that no indication of the prosperity of a country can be derived , either from the plentifulness or from the scarcity of money . The . only sure in  --  ' dication of its economical prosperity , is the increase of its productiveness ; that is , an increase of the supply of objects of desire at the same , or at a diminished amount of labor . The increase or diminution of the quantity of specie in circulation , is of importance , only in so far as it indicates this increase of productiveness , and no further . We estimate a man 's prosperity , not by the amount of money in his possession , but by his power Jo command a larger or a smaller amount of the objects of desire . V. And hence , we may judge of the truth of that oft-repeated , but worse than puerile maxim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as the money is in the country . " If a million of dollars be lost in an unprofitable canal , or ten millions are sunk by a profit less experiment in manufactures , we are told , that it is all of no consequence ; nobody is any poorer , because /z/ the money is in the country . That is , if a million dollars ' worth of labor and capital have ceased to exist , we are no poorer than we were when this capital was existing , and yielding to its owners , and , of course , to the public , its annual production . If so , why not invest the whole capital in this manner , or why not pay men for throwing it all into the sea ? The money was merely the instrument which we used to effect its destruction ; and surely , we are but little better off , because tho means of destruction remain . * If a thief , in the /light , had emptied your store-house with a wheelbarrow , you would not be very easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheelbarrow behind him . In the late disastrous fire in New York , it is said that fifteen millions of capital were consumed . I did not hear that any specie was destroyed , and yet , I think it would be difficult to show to the sufferers , that no harm was done , because the money was all in the country . Now , it matters not in what manner property is rendered valueless whether by fire , or by folly . It matters not , whether fire does the work for nothing , or whether you hire workmen to do it at heavy wages . It matters not , * whether the fifteen millions be turned into ashes , and thus rendered valueless , oi whether it be turned into a canal , which is equally valueless . If your store and goods are burned up , you would give away the ashes . If it be turned into a canal , which you would be equally willing to give away , in what respect are you better off in the one case , than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural price for the precious metals is the cost of their production , and that a given amount of them will be required for effecting the exchanges of the community . Suppose , now , these metals to be indestructible , and unchanged in quantity , and the quantity of other productions annually created , to be , for fifty years , the same ; it is evident that specie and other products would , at the end of that time , bear the same ratio to each other , as at present ; that is , the money prices of all commodities would remain unchanged . But neither of these is the case . In the first place . /z/ the productions of the earth annually increase ; this is evident , from the increase of its number of inhabitants . And , on the other hand , the precious metals are annually produced , in large quantities , from the mines . But they are also destructible , and suffer slightly from wear and tear , when used as coin ; and they are also rapidly consumed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two causes exactly counterbalanced each other ; that is , if the supply of the precious metals were precisely such as to correspond to the increase of productiveness , and to the amount consumed in the arts , prices would still remain as before . If the increase of the metals were not sufficient to supply the increased demand arising from increased productiveness , and other causes , the price of the metals would rise ; that is , the price of other things would fall . And if , on the other hand , the increase of the metals were greater than the increase of productiveness , their price would fall ; that is , the price of other things would rise . Now it appears that , previously to the discovery of America , for several centuries , there was no great change in the relative value of specie and that of other commod/q/
