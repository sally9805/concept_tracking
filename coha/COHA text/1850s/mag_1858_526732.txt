ATLANTIC MONTHLY . A MAGAZINE OP LITERATURE , ART , AN ) POLITICS . VOL. 11. - SEPTEMBER , 1858. - NO . XI .. ELOQUENCE . IT is the doctrine of the popular musicmasters , that whoever can speak can sing . So , probably , every man is eloquent once in his life . Our temperaments differ in capacity of heat , or we boil at different degrees . One man is brought to the boiling point by the excitement of conversation in the parlor . The waters , of course , are not very deep . He has a two-inch enthusiasm , a pattypan ebullition . Another requires the additional caloric of a multitude , and a public debate ; a third needs an antagonist , or a hot indignation ; a fourth needs a revolution ; and a fifth , nothing less than the grandeur of absolute ideas , the splendors and shades of Heaven and Hell . But because every man is an orator , how long soever he may have been a mute , an assembly of men is so much more susceptible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the speaking point , and all others to a degree that makes them good receivers and conductors , and they avenge themselves for their enforced silence by increased loquacity on their return to the fireside . The plight of these phlegmatic brains is better than that of those who prema turely boil , and who , impatiently break the silence before their time . Our county conventions often exhibit a small-potsoon-hot style of eloquence . We are too much reminded of a medical experiment , where a series of patients are taking nitrous-oxide gas . Each patient , in turn , exhibits similar symptoms ,  --  redness in the face , volubility , violent gesticulation , delirious attitudes , occasional stamping , an alarming loss of perception of the passage of time , a selfish enjoyment of his sensations , and loss of perception of the sufferings of the audience . Plato says , that the punishment which the wise suffer , who refuse to take part in the government , is , to live under the government of worse men ; and the like regret is suggested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , that they shall hear worse orators than themselves . But this lust to speak marks the universal feeling of the energy of the engine , and the curiosity men feel to touch the springs . Of all the musical instruments on which men play , a popular assembly is that which has the largest compass and variety , and out of which , by genius and study , the most wonderful effects can be drawn . An audience is not a simple // addition of the individuals that compose it . Their sympathy gives them a certain social organism , which fills each member , in his own degree , and most of all the orator , as a jar in a battery is charged with the whole electricity of the battery . No one can survey the face of an excited assembly , without being apprised of new opportunity for painting in fire human thought , and being agitated to agitate . How many orators sit mute there below ! They come to get justice done to that ear and intuition which no Chatham and no Demosthenes has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many are the friends of the golden tongue . " Who can wonder at the attractiveness of Parliament , or of Congress , or the bar , for our ambitious young men , when the highest bribes of society are at the feet of the successful orator ? He has his audience at his devotion . All other fames must hush before his . He is the true potentate ; for they are not kings who sit on thrones , but they who know how to govern . The definitions of eloquence describe its attraction for young men . Antiphon the Rhamnusian , one of Plutarch 's ten orators , advertised in Athens , " that he would cure distempers of the mind with words . " No man has a prosperity so high or firm , but two or three words can dishearten it . There is no calamity which right words will not begin to redress . Isocrates described his art , as " the power of magnifying what was small and diminishing what was great " ; - an acute , but partial definition . *mong the Spartans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharpest weapon . Socrates says , " If any one wishes to converse with the meanest of the Lace&amp;emonians , he will at first find him despicable in conversation ; but , when a proper opportunity offers , this same person , like a skilful jaculator , will hurl a sentence worthy of attention , short and contorted , so that he who converses with him will appear to be in no respect superior to a boy . " Plato 's definition of rhetoric is , " the art of ruling the minds of men . " The Koran says , " A moun tam may change its place , but a man will not change his disposition " ; - yet the end of eloquence is ,  --  is it not ? - to alter in a pair of hours , perhaps in a half-hour 's discourse , the convictions and habits of years . Young men , too , are eager to enjoy this sense of added power and enlarged sympathetic existence . The orator sees himself the organ of a multitude , and concentrating their valors and powers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my face . " That which he wishes , that which eloquence ought to reach , is , not a particular skill in telling a story , or neatly summing up evidence , or arguing logically , or dexterously addressing the prejudice of the company ; no , but a taking sovereina possession of the audience . Him we call an artist , who , shall play on an assembly of men as a master on the keys of the piano ,  --  who , seeing the people furious , shall soften and compose them , shall draw them , when he will , to laughter and to tears . Bring him to his audience , and , be they who they may , coarse or refined , pleased or displeased , sulky or savage , with their opinions in the keeping of a confessor , or with their opinions in their bank-safes ,  --  he will have them pleased and humored as he chooses ; and they shall carry and execute that which he bids them . This is that despotism which poets have celebrated in the " Pied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of gravitation ,  --  drew soldiers and priests , traders and Leasters , women and boys , rats and mice ; or that of the minstrel of Meudon , who made the pallbearers dance around the bier . This is a power of many degrees , and requiring in the orator a great raage of faculty and experience , requiring a large composite man , such as Nature rarely organizes , so that , in our experience , we are forced to gather up the figure in fragments , here one talent , and there another . The audience is a constant metre of the orator . There are many audiences in every public assembly , each one of // Eloquence. which rules in turn . If anything comic and coarse is spoken , you shall see the emergence of the boys and rowdies , so loud and vivacious , that you might think the house was filled with them . If new topics are started , graver and higher , these roisters recede ; a more chaste . and wise attention tal*es place . You would think the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundness . If the speaker utter a noble sentiment , the attention deepens , a new and highest audience now listens , and the audiences of the fun and of facts and of the understanding are all silenced and awed . There is also something excellent in every audience ,  --  the capacity of virtue . They are ready to be beatified . They know so much more than the orator ,  --  and are so just ! There is a tablet there for every line he can inscribe , though he should mount to the highest levels . Humble persons are conscious of new illumination ; narrow brows expand with enlarged affections : delicate spirits , long unknown to themselves , masked and muffled in coarsest fortunes , . who now hear their own native language for the first time , and leap to hear it . But all these several audiences , each above each , which successively appear to greet the variety of style and topic , are really composed out of the same persons ; nay , sometimes the same individual will take active part in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the consummate speaker and of many ai*idiences in one assembly leads us to consider the successive stages of oratory . Perhaps it is the lowest of the qualities of an orator , but it is , on so many occasions , of chief importance ,  --  a certain robust and radiant physical health , - or , shall I say ? great volumes of animal heat . When each auditor feels himself to make too large a part of the assembly , and shudders with cold at the thinness of the morning audience , and with fear lest all will heavily fail through one bad speech , mere energy and mellowness are then inestimable . Wisdom and learning would be harsh and unwelcome , 387 compared with a substantial cordial man , made of milk , as we say , who is a housewarmer , with his obvious honesty and good meaning , and a hue-and-cry style of harangue , which inundates the assembly with a flood of animal spirits , and makes all safe and secure , so that any and every sort of good speaking becomes at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly , and yet , as we must be fed and warmed before we can do any work well , even the best , so is this semi-animal exuberance , like a good stove , of the first necessity in a cold house . Climate has much to do with it ,  --  dimate and race . Set a New Englander to describe any accident which happened in his presence . What hesitation and reserve in his narrative ! lie tells with difficulty some particulars , and gets as fast as he can to the result , and , though he can not describe , hopes to suggest the whole scene . Now listen to a poor Irishwoman recounting some experience of hers . Her speech flows like a ver ,  - -  so unconsidered , so humorous , so pathetic , such justice done to all the parts ! It is a true transubstantiation ,  --  the fact converted into speech , all warm and colored and alive , as it fell out . Our Southern people are almost all speakers , and have every advantage over the New England people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , we do not like to open our mouths very wide . But neither can the Southerner in the United States , nor the Irish , compare with the lively inhabitant of the South of Europe . The traveller in Sicily needs no gayer melodramatic exhibition than the table d'k6te of his inn will afford him , in the conversation of the joyous guests . They mimic the voice and manner of the person they describe ; they crow , squeal , hiss , cackle , bark , and scream like mad , and , were it only by the physical strength exerted in telling the story , keep the table in unbounded excitement . But in every constitution some large degree , of animal vigor is necessary as material foundation for the higher qualities of the art . // But eloquence must be attractive , or it is none . The virtue of books is to be readable , and of orators to be interesting , and this is a gift of Nature ; as Demosthenes , the most laborious student in that kind , signified his sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as his motto on his shield . As we know , the power of discourse of certain individuals amounts to fascination , though it may have no lasting effect . Some portion of this sugar must intermingle . The right eloquence needs no bell to call the people together , and no constable to keep them . It draws the children from their play , the old from their arm-chairs , and the invalid from his warm chamber ; it holds the hearer fast , steals away his feet , that he shall not depart ,  --  his memory , that he shall not remember the most pressing affairs ,  --  his belief , that he shall not admit any opposing considerations . The pictures we have of it in semi-barbarous ages , when it has some advantages in the simpler habit of the people , show what it aims at . It is said that the Khans , or story-tellers in Ispahan and other cities of the East , attain a controlling power over their audience , keeping them for many hours attentive to the most fanciful and extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these improvisators , and how fascinating they are , in our translations of the " Arabian Nights . " Scheherzarade tells these stories to save her life , and the delight of young Europe and young America in them proves that she fairly earned it . And who does not remember in childhood some white or black or yellow Scheherzarade , who , by that talent of telling endless feats of fairies and magicians , and kings and queens , was more dear and wonderful to a circle of children than any orator of England or America is now ? The more indolent and imaginative complexion of the Eastern nations makes them much more impressible by these appeals to the fancy . These legends are only exaggerations of real occurrences , and every literature contains these high compliments to the art of the orator and the bard , from the Hebrew and the Greek down to the Scottish Glenkindie , who " harpit a fish out o ' saut water , Or water out of a stone , Or milk out of a maiden 's brea.st Who bairn had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure . For what is the " Odyssey , " but a history of the orator , in the largest style , carried through a series of adventures furnishing brilliant opportunities to his talent ? See with what care and pleasure the poet brings him on the stage . Helen is pointing out to Antenor , from a tower , the different Grecian chiefs . " Antenor said : Tell me , dear child , who is that man , shorter by a head than Agamemnon , yet he looks broader in his shoulders and breast . His arms lie on the ground , but he , like a leader , walks about the bands of the men . He seems to me like a stately ram , who goes as a master of the flock . ' Him answered Helen , daughter of Jove : This is the wise Ulysses , son of Laertes , who was reared in the state of craggy Ithac*t , knowing all wiles and wise counsels . ' To her the prudent Antenor replied again : 0 woman , you have spoken truly . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Menelaus , beloved by Mars . I received them , and entertained them at my house . I became acquainted with the genius and the prudent judgments of both . When they mixed with the assembled Trojans and stood , the broad shoulders of Menelaus rose above the other ; but , both sitting , Ulysses was more majestic . When they conversed , and interweaved stories and opinions with all ; Menelaus spoke succinctly , few but very sweet words , since he was not talkative , nor superfluous in speech , and was the younger . But when the wise Ulysses arose , and stood , and looked down , fixing his eyes on the ground , and neither moved his sceptre backward nor forward , but held it still , like an awkward person , you would say it was some angry or foolish man ; but when he sent // his great voice forth out of his breast , and his words fell like the winter snows , not then would any mortal contend with Ulysses ; and we , beholding , wondered not afterwards so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not fail to arm Ulysses at first with this power of overcoming all opposition by the blandishments of speech . Plutarch tells us that Thucydides , when Archidamus , king of Sparta , asked him , Which was the best wrestler , Pericles or he ? replied , " When I throw jiim , he says he was never down , and he persuades the very spectators to believe him . " Philip of Macedon said of Demosthenes , on hearing the report of one of ' his orations , " Had I been there , he would have persuaded me to take up arms against myself " ; and Warren Hastings said of Burke 's speech on his impeachment , " As I listened to the orator , I felt for more than half an hour as if I were the most culpable being on earth . " In these examples , higher qualities have already entered ; but the power of detaining the ear by pleasing speech , and addressing the fancy and imagination , often exists without higher merits . Thus separated , as this fascination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its momentary effect , it is yet a juggle , and of no lasting power . It is heard like a band of music passing through the streets , which converts all the passengers into poets , but is forgotten as soon as it has turned the next corner ; and unless this oiled tongue could , in Oriental phrase , lic* the sun and moon away , it must take its place with opium and brandy . I know no remedy against it but cotton-wool , or the wax which Ulysses stuffed into the ears of his sailors to pass the Sirens safely . There are all degrees of power , and the least are interesting , but they must not be confounded . There is the glib tongue and cool self-possession of the salesman in a large shop , which , as is well known , overpower the prudence and resolution of housekeepers of both * Iliad , III . 192. sexes . There is a petty lawyer 's fluency , which is sufficiently impressive to him who is devoid of that talent , though it be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expressing with accuracy and speed what everybody thinks and says more slowly , without new information , or precision of thought ,  --  but the same thing , neither less nor more . It requires no special insight to edit one of our country newspapers . Yet whoever can say off currently , sentence by sentence , matter neither better nor worse than what is there printed , will be very impressive to our easily-pleased population . These talkers are that class who prosper like the celebrated schoolmaster , by being only one lesson ahead of the pupil . Add a little sarcasm , and prompt allusion to passing occurrenc*s , and you have the mischievous member of Conguess . A spice of malice , a ruffian touch in his rhetoric , will do him no harm with his audience . These accomplishments are of the same kind , and only a degree higher than the coaxing of the auctioneer , or the vituperative style well described in the street-word " jawing . " These kinds of public and private speaking have their use and convenience to the practitioners ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of oratory is apt to disqualify them for eloquence . One of our statesmen said , " The curse of this country is eloquent men . " And one can not wonder at the uneasiness sometimes manifested by trained statesmen , with large experience of public affairs , when they observe the disproportionate advantage suddenly given to oratory over the most solid and accumulated public service . In a Senate or other business committee , the solid result depends on a few men with working talent . They know ho* to deal with the facts before them , to put things into a practical shape , and they value men only as they can forward the work . But some new man comes there , who has no capacity for helping them at all , is insignificant , and nobody in the com // mittee , but has a talent for speaking . In the debate with open doors , this precious person makes a speech , which is printed , and read all over the Union , and he at once becomes famous , and takes the lead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , are full of indignation to find one who has no tact or skill , and knows he has none , put over them by means of this talking power which they despise . Leaving behind us these pretensions , better or worse , to come a little nearer to the verity , eloquence is attractive a an example of the magic of personal ascendency ;  --  a total and resultant power ,  --  rare , because it requires a rich coincidence of power 's , intellect , will , sympathy , organs , and , over all , good-fortune in the cause . We have a half-belief that the person is possible who can counterpoise all other persons . We believe that there may be a man who is a match for events ,  --  one who never found his match ,  --  against whom other men being dashed are broken ,  - -  one of inexhaustible personal resources , who can give you any odds and beat you . What we really wish for is a mind equal to any exigency . You are safe in your rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amidst the police , and under the eyes of a hundred thousand people . But how is it on the Atlantic , in a storm ? Do you understand how to infuse your reason into men disabled by terror , and to bring yourself off safe then ? - how among thieves , or among an infuriated populace , or among cannibals ? Face to face with a highwayman who has every temptation and opportunity for violence and plunder , can you bring yourself off safe by your wit , exercised through speech ?  --  a problem easy enough to C*esar , or Napoleon . Whenever a man of that stamp arrives , the highwayman has found a master . What a difference between men in power of face ! A man succeeds because he has more power of eye than another , and so coaxes or confounds him . The newspapers , every week , report the adventures of some impudent swindler , who , by steadiness of carriage , duped those who should have known better . Yet any swindlers we have known are novices and bunglers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of face would accomplish anything , and , with the rest of their takings , take away the bad name . A greater power of carrying the thing loftily , and with perfect assurance , would confound merchant , banker , judge , men of influence and power , poet , and president , and might head any party , unseat any sovereign , and abrogate any constitution in Europe and America. * It was said , that a man has at one step attained vast power , who has renounced his moral sentiment , and settled it with himself that he will no longer stick at anything . It was said of Sir William Pepperel , one of the worthies of New England , that , " put him where you might , he commanded , and saw what he willed come to pass . " Julius Caesar said to Metellus , when that tribune interfered to hinder him from entering the Roman treasury , " Young man , it is easier for me to put you to death than to say that I will " ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pirates . What then ? He threw himself into their ship ; established the most extraordinary intimacies ; told them stories ; declaimed to them ; if they did not applaud his speeches , he threatened them with hanging ,  - -  which he performed afterwards ,  --  and , in a short time , was master of all on board . A man this is who can not be disconcerted , and so can Iiever play his last card , but has a reserve of power when he has hit his mark . With a serene face , he subverts a kingdom . What is told of him is miraculous ; it affects men so . The confidence of men in him is lavish , and he changes the face of the world , and histories , poems , and new philoso. phies arise to account for him . A supreme commander over all his passions and affections ; but the secret of hi* ruling is higher than that . It is the power of Nature running without impediment from the brain and will into // 1858 . Eloquence. the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , he can not be without resource . " Whoso can speak well , " said Luther , " is a man . " It was men of this stamp that the Grecian States used to ask of Sparta for generals . They did not send to Lacedtemon for troops , but they said , " Send us a commander " ; and Pausanias , or Gylippus , or Brasidas , or Agis , was despatched by the Ephors . It is easy to illustrate this overpowering personality by these examples of soldiers and kings ; but there are men of the most peaceful way of life , and peaceful principle , who are felt , wherever they go , as sensibly as a July sun or a December frost ,  --  men who , if they speak , are heard , though they speak in a whisper ,  --  who , when they act , act effectually , and what they do is imitated : and these examples may be found on very humble platforms , as well as on high ones . In old countries , a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved a personal distinction . He who has points to carry must hire , not a skilful attorney , but a commanding person . A barrister in England is reputed to have made twenty or thirty thousand pounds per annum in representing the claims of railroad companies before committees of the House of Commons . His clients pay not so much for legal as for manly accomplishments , - for courage , conduct , and a commanding social position , which enable him to make their claims heard and respected . I know very well , that , among our cool and calculating people , where every man mounts guard over himself , where heats and panics and abandonments are quite out of the system , there is a good deal of skepticism as to extraordinary influence . To talk of an overpowering mind rouses the same jealousy and defiance which one may observe round a table where anybody is recounting the marvellous anecdotes of mesmerism . Each auditor puts a final stroke to the discourse by exclaiming , " Can he mesmerize me ? " So each man inquires if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one suppose himself to be quite impregnable ? Does he think that not possibly a man may come to him who shall persuade him out of his most settled determination ? - for example , good sedate citizen as he is , to make a fanatic of him ? or , if he is penurious , to squander money for some purpose he now least thinks of ? or , if he is a prudent , industrious person , to forsake his work , and give days and weeks to a new interest ? No , he defies any one , every one . Ah ! he is thinking of resistance , and of a different turn from his own . But what if one should come of the same turn of mind as his own , and who sees much farther on his own way than he ? A man who has tastes like mine , but in greater power , will rule me any day , and make me love my ruler . Thus it is not powers of speech that we primarily consider under this word Eloquence , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection , and , being absent , leaves them a merely superficial value . Eloquence is the appropriate organ of the highest personal energy . Personal ascendency may exist with or without adequate talent for its expression . It is as surely felt as a mountain or a planet ; but when it is weaponed with a power of speech , it seems first to become truly human , works actively in all directions , and supplies the imagination wits fine materials . This circumstance enters into every consideration of the power of orators , and is the key to all their effects . In the assembly , you shall find the orator and the audience in perpettial balance , and the predominance of either is indicated by the choice of topic . If the talents for speaking exist , but not the strong personality , then there are good speakers who perfectly receive and express the will of the audience , and the commonest populace is flattered by hearing its low mind returned to it with every ornament which happy talent can add . But if there be personality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The audience is thrown into the attitude of pupil , follows like a child its preceptor , and hears what he has to say . It is as if , amidst the king 's council at Madrid , Ximenes urged that an advantage might be gained of France , and Mendoza that Flanders might be kept down , and Columbus , being introduced , was interrogated whether his geographical knowledge could aid the cabinet , and he can say nothing to one party or to the other , but he can show how all Europe can be diminished and reduced under the king by annexing to Spain a continent as large as six or seven Europes . This balance between the orator and the audience is expressed in what is calle*d the pertinence of the speaker . There is always a rivalry between the orator and the occasion , between the demands of the hour and the prepossession of the individual . The emergency which has convened the meeting is usually of more importance than anything the debaters have in their minds , and therefore becomes imperative to them . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart , how speedily he will find vent for it , and with the applause of the assembly ! This balance is observed in the privatest intercourse . Poor Tom never knew the time when the present occurrence was so trivial that he could tell what was passing in his mind without being checked for unseasonable speech ; but let Bacon speak , and wise men would rather listen , though the revolution of kingdoms was on foot . I have heard it reported of an eloquent preacher , whose voice is not yet forgotten in this city , that , on occasions of death or tragic disaster , which overspread the congregation with gloom , he ascended the pulpit with more than his usual alacrity , and , turning to his favorite lessons of devout and jubilant thankfulness , " Let us praise the Lord , " carried audience9 mourners , and mourning along with him , and swept away all the impertinence of private sorrow with his hosannas and songs of praise . Pepys says of Lord Clarendon , with whom " he is mad in love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did never observe how much easier a man do speak when he knows all the company to be below him , than in him ; for , though he spoke indeed excellent well , yet his manner and freedom of doing it , as if he played with it , and was informing only all the rest of the company , was mighty pretty . " * This rivalry between the orator and the occasion is inevitable , and the occasion always yields to the eminence of the speaker ; for a great man is the greatest of occasions . Of course , the interest of the audience and of the orator conspire . It is well with them only when his influence is complete ; then only they are well pleased . Especially , he consults his power by making instead of taking his theme . If he should attempt to instruct the people in that which they already know , he would fail ; but , by making them wise in that which he knows , he has the advantage of the assembly every moment . Napoleon 's tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always presenting a superiority of numbers , is the orator 's secret also . The several talents which the orator employs , the splendid weapons which went to the equipment of Demosthenes , of 2Eschines , of Demades , the natural orator , of Fox , of Pitt , of Patrick Henry , of Adams , of Mirabeau , deserve a special enumeration . We miist not quite omit to name the principal pieces . The orator , as we have seen , must be a substantial personality . Then , first , he must have power of statement ,  --  must have the fact , and know how to tell it . In any knot of men conversing on any subject , the person who knows most about it will have the ear of the company , if he wishes it , and lead the conversation , - no matter what genius or distinction other men there present may have ; and in any public assembly , him who has the * Diar2j , I. 469. // facts , and can and will state them , people will listen to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ungracefal , though he stutters and screams . In a court of justice , the audience are impartial ; they really wish to sift the statements , and know what the truth is . And , in the examination of witnesses , there usually leap out , quite unexpectedly , three or four stubborn words or phrases which are the pith and fate of the business , which sink into the ear of all parties , and stick there , and determine the cause . All the rest is repetition and qualifying ; and the court and the county have really come together to arrive at these three or four memorable expressions , which betrayed the mind and meaning of somebody . In every company , the man with the fact is like the guide you hire to lead your party up a mountain or through a difficult country . He may not compare with any of the party in mind , or breeding , or courage , or possessions , but he is much more important to the present need than any of them . That is what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact , and the elimination of a general fact , the real relation of all the parties ; and it is the certainty with which , indifferently in any affair that is well handled , the truth stares us in the face , through all the disguises that are put upon it ,  --  a piece of the well-known human life ,  --  that makes the interest of a court-room to the intelligent spectator . I remember , long ago , being attracted by the distinction of the counsel , and the local importance of the cause , into the court-room . The prisoner 's counsel were the strongest and cunningest lawyers in the Commonwealth . They drove the attorney for the State from corner to corner , taking his reasons from under him , and reducing him to silence , but not to submission . When hard-pressed , he revenged himself , in his turn , on the judge , by requiring the court to define what salvage was . The court , thus pushed , tried words , and said everything it could think of to fill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , captains , pilots , and miscellaneous sea-officers that are or might be ,  --  like a schoolmaster puzzled by a hard sum , who reads the context with emphasis . But all this flood not serving the cuttle-fish to get away in , the horrible shark of the district-attorney being still there , grimly awaiting with his " The court must define , "  --  the poor court pleaded its inferiority . The superior court must establish the law for this , and it read away piteously the decisions of the Supreme Court , but read to those who had no pity . The judge was forced at last to rule something , and the lawyers saved their rogue under the fog of a definition . The parts were so well cast and discriminated , that it was *in interes " ting game to watch . The government was well enough represented . It was stupid , but it had a strong will and possession , and stood on that to the last . The judge had a task beyond his preparation , yet his position remained real ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of states , which we could well enough see beetling over his head , and which his trifling talk nowise affected , and did not impede , since he was entirely well-meaning . The statement of the fact , however , sinks before the statement of the law , which requires immeasurably higher powers , and is a rarest gift , being in all great masters one and the same thing ,  --  in lawyers , nothing technical , but always some piece of common sense , alike interesting to laymen as to clerks . Lord Mansfield 's merit is the merit of common sense . It is the same quality we admire in Aristotle , Montaigne , Cervantes , or in Samuel Johnson , or Franklin . Its application to law seems quite accidental . Each of Mansfield 's famous decisions contains a level sentence or two , which hit the mark . His sentences are not always finished to the eye , but are finished to the mind . The sentences are involved , but a solid proposition is set forth , a true distinction is drawn . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and I read , without surprise , // that the black-letter lawyers of the day sneered at his " equitable decisions , " as if they were not also learned . This , indeed , is what speech is for , to make the statement ; and all that is called eloquence seems to me of jittle use , for the most part , to those who have it , but inestimable to such as have something to say . Next to the knowledge of the fact and its law , is method , which constitutes the genius and efficiency of all remarkable men . A crowd of men go up to Fanenil Hall ; they are all pretty well acquainted with the object of the meeting ; they have all read the facts in the same newspapers . The orator possesses no information which his hearers have not ; yet he teaches them to see the thing with his eyes . By the new placing , the circumstances acquire new solidity and worth . Every fact gains consequence by his naming it , and trifles become important . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth to mouth . His mind has some new principle of order . Where he looks , all things fly into their places . What will he say next ? Let this man speak , and this man only . By applying the habits of a higher style of thought to the common affaii*s of this world , he introduces beauty and magnificence wherever he goes . Such a power was Burke 's , and of this genius we have had some brilliant examples in our own political and legal men . Imagery . The orator must be , to a certain extent , a poet . We are such imaginative creatures , thatnothing so works on the human mind , barbarous or civil , as a trope . Condense some daily experience into a glowing symbol , and an audience is electrified . They feel as if they already possessed some new right and power over a fact , which they can detach , and so completely master in thought . It is a wonderful aid to the memory , which carries away the image , and never loses it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the French Chamber , or the American Congress , is commanded by these two powers ,  --  first by a fact , then by skill of statement . Put the argument into a concrete shape , into an image , some hard phrase , round and solid as a ball , which they can see and handle and carry home with them , and the cause is half won . Statement , method , imagery , selection , tenacity of memory , power of dealing with facts , of illuminating them , of sinking them by ridicule or by diversion of the mind , rapid generalization , humor , pathos , are keys which the orator holds ; and yet these fine gifts are not eloquence , and do often hinder a man 's attainment of it . And if we come to the heart of the mystery , perhaps we should say that the truly eloquent man is a sane man with power to communicate his sanity . If you arm the man with the extraordinary weapons of this art , give him a grasp of facts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interminable illustration ,  --  all these talents , so potent and charming , have an equal power to insnare and mislead the audience and the orator . His talents are too much for him , his horses run away with him ; and people always perceive whether you drive , or whether the horses take the bits in their teeth and run . But these talents are quite something else when they are subs ordinated and serve him ; and we go to Washington , or to Westminster Hall , or might well go round the world , to see a man who drives , and is not run away with ,  --  a man who , in prosecuting great designs , has an absolute command of the means of representing his ideas , and uses them only to express these ; placing facts , placing men ; amid the inconceivable levity of human beings , never for an instant warped from his erectness . There is for every man a statement possible of that truth which he is most unwilling to receive ,  --  a statement possible , so broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , but must either bend to it or die of it . Else there would be no such word as eloquence , which means this . The listener can not hide from himself that something has been shown him and the whole world , which he did not wish to // see ; and , as he can not dispose of it , it disposes of him . The history of public men and affairs in America will readily furnish tragic examples of this fatal force . For the triumphs of the art somewhat more must still be required , namely , a reinforcing of man from events , so as to give the double force of reason and destiny . In transcendent eloquence , there was ever some crisis in affairs , sulh as could deeply engage the man to the cause he pleads , and draw all this wide power to a point . For the explosions and eruptions , there must be accumulations of heat somewhere , beds of ignited anthra-. cite at the centre . And in cases where profound conviction has been wrought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who is inwardly drunk with a certain belief . It agitates and tears him , and perhaps almost bereaves him of the power of articulation . Then it rushes from him as in short , abrupt screams , in torrents of meaning . The possession the subject has of his mind is so entire , that it insures an order of expression which is the order of Nature itself , and so the order of greatest force , and inimitable by any art . And the main distinction between him and other well-graced actors is the conviction , communicated by every word , that his mind is contemplating a whole and inflamed by the contemplation of the whole , and that the words and sentences uttered by him , however admirable , fall from him as unregarded parts of that terrible whole which he sees , and which he means that you shall see . Add to this concentration a certain regnant calmness , which , in all the tumult , never utters a premature syllable , but keeps the secret of its means and method and the orator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracles they have no key . This terrible earnestness makes good the ancient superstition of the hunter , that the bullet will hit its mark , which is first dipped in the marksman 's blood . Eloquence must be grounded on the plainest narrative . Afterwards , it may warm itself until it exhales symbols of every kind and color , speaks only through the most poetic forms ; but , first and last , it must still be at bottom a biblical statement of fact . The orator is thereby an orator , that he keeps his feet ever on a fact . Thus only is he invincible . No gifts , no graces , no power of wit or learning or illustration will make any amends for want of this . All audiences are just to this point . Fame of voice or of rhetoric will carry people a few times to hear a speaker , but they soon begin to ask , " What is he driving at ? " and if this man does not stand for anything , he will be deserted . A good upholder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , they will long follow ; but a pause in the speaker 's own character is very properly a loss of attraction . The preacher enumerates his classes of men , and I do not find my place therein ; I suspect , then , that no man does . Every thing is my cousin , and whilst he speaks thi*igs , I feel that he is touching some of my relations , and I am uneasy ; but whilst he deals in words , we are released from attention . If you would lift me , you must be on higher ground . If you would liberate me , you must be free . If you would correct my false view of facts ,  - -  hold up to me the same facts in the true order of thought , and I can not go back from the new conviction . The power of Chatham , of Pericles , of Luther , rested on this strength of character , which , because it did not and could not fear anybody , made nothing of their antagonists , and became sometimes exquisitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished with anecdotes of these men , nor can we help ourselves by those heavy books in which their discourses are reported . Some of them were writers , like Burke ; but most of them were not , and no record at all adequate to their fame remains . Besides , what is best is lost , the fiery life of the moment . But the conditions for eloquence always exist . It is always dying out of // famous places , and appearing in corners . Wherever the polarities meet , wherever the fresh moral sentiment , the instinct of freedom and duty , come in direct opposition to fossil conservatism and the thirst of gain , the spark will pass . The resistance to slavery in this country has been a fruitful nursery of orators . The natural connection by which it drew to itself ' a train of ' moral reforms , and the slight yet sufficient party organization it offered , reinforced the city with new blood from the woods and mountains . Wild men , John Baptists , Hermit Peters , John Knoxes , utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitals . They send us every year some piece of aboriginal strength , some tough oak-stick of a man who is not to be silenced or insulted or intimidated by a mob , because he is more mob than they , - one who mobs the mob ,  --  some sturdy countryman , on whom neither money , nor politeness , nor hard words , nor eggs , nor blows , nor brickbats , make any impression . He is fit to meet the bar-room wits and bullies ; he is a wit and a bully himself , and something more ; he is a graduate of the plough , and the stub-hoe , and the bush-whacker ; knows all the secrets of swamp and snow-bank , and has nothing to learn of labor or poverty or the rough of farming . His hard head went through in childhood the drill of Calvinism , with text and mortification , so that he stands in the New England assembly a purer bit of New England than any , and flings his sarcasms right and left . He has not only the documents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his positions , but he has the eternal reason in his head . This man scornfully renounces your civil organizatbons ,  --  county , or city , or governor , or army ,  --  is his own navy and artillery , judge and jury , legislature and executive . He has learned his lessons in a bitter school . Yet , if the pupil be of a texture to bear it , the best university that can be recommended to a man of ideas is the gauntlet of the mobs . He who will train himself to mastery in this science of persuasion must lay the emphasis of education , not on popular arts , but on character and insight . Let him see that his speech is not differenced from action ; that , when he has spoken , he has not done nothing , nor done wrong , but has cleared his own skirts , has engaged himself to wholesome exertion . Let him look on opposition as opportur*ity . He can not be defeated or put down . There is a principle of resurrection in him , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give value to their suifrages . It is not the people that are in fault for not being convinced , but he that can not convince them . He should mould them , armed as he is with the reason and love which are also the core of their nature . He is not to neutralize their opposition , but he is to convert them into fiery apostles and publishers of the same wisdom . The highest platform of eloquence is the moral sentiment . It is what is called affirmative truth , and has the property of invigorating the hearer ; and it conveys a hint of our eternity , when he feels himself ' addressed on grounds which will remain when everything else is taken , and which have no trace of time or place or party . Everything hostile is stricken down in the presence of the sentiments ; their majesty is felt by the most obdurate . It is observable , that , as soon as one acts for large masses , the moral element will and must be allowed for , will and must work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiments invariably recall them when they address nations . Napoleon , even , must accept and use it as he can . It is only to these simple strokes that the highest power belongs , when a weak human hand touches , point by point , the eternal beams and rafters on which the whole structure of Nature and society is laid . In this tossing sea of delusion , we feel with our feet the adamant ; in this dominion of chance , we find a principle of permanence . For I do not accept that definition'of Isocrates , that the office of his art is to make the great small // and the small great ; but I esteem this to be its perfection ,  --  when the orator se3s through all masks to the eternal scale of truth , in such sort that he can hold up before the eyes of men the fact of today steadily to that standard , thereby making the great great and the small small , wh , ich is the true way to astonish arid to reform mankind . All the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this reality . One thought the philosophers of Demosthenes 's own time found running through all his orations ,  --  this , namely , that " virtue secures its own success . " " To stand on one 's own feet " Heeren finds the keynote to the discourses of Demosthenes , as of Chatham . Eloquence , like every other art , rests on laws the most exact and determinate . It is the best speech of the best soul . It may well stand as the exponent of all that is grand and immortal in the mind . If it do not so become an instrument , but aspires to be somewhat of itself , and to glitter for show , it is false and weak . In its right exercise , it is an elastic , unexhausted power ,  --  who has sounded , who has estimated it ? - expanding with the expansion of our interests and affections . Its great masters , whilst they valued every help to its attainment , and thought no pains too great which contributed in any manner to further it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore seventeen weapons in his belt , and in persoiial combat used them all occasionally , - yet undervalued all means , never permitted any talent , neither voice , rhythm , poetic power , anecdote , sarcasm , to appear for show , but were grave men , who preferred their integrity to their talent , and esteemed that object for which they toiled , whether the prosperity of their country , or the laws , or a reformation , or liberty of speech or of the press , or letters , or morals , as above the whole world , and themselves also .
