THE works of no modern writer have been presented to the public in greater variety of form , with more typographic skill , or with more ample wealth of illustration , than those of Sir Walter Scott . Yet the market seems never overstocked , and every edition , from the cheapest and poorest up to the richly adorned " Abbotsford , " or the still more beautiful " Library Edition , " finds its appointed readers . Until now , however , there has been no American edition , at once satisfying the most critical taste , and yet within fhe means of the poorest lover of letters . The enterprising publishers to whom we owe the beautiful volumes noticed at the head of our article have really left us nothing to desire . The novels , gracefully and appropriately dedicated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " are printed from the four best edited English editions , subjected to very critical proof-reading , and illustrated by the latest notes and emendations of the author . Of the poems , we doubt if there had previously appeared so complete and carefully edited a collection as that of Messrs . Little , Brown , &amp; Co . It contains , besides the larger and well-known works , all the shorter pieces , // mottoes of chapters , and playful trifles scattered through the novels and the biography by Lockhart , with brief notes by the editor , and not unfrequently with short illustrative criticisms from the most eminent contemporaries of Scott . To what is owing the undiminished popularity of the " Wizard of the North , " magician no less when he stood openly confessed , than when veiled under the sernitransparency of a pseudonyme , - no less now that the wand has been long broken , than a third of a century since , in the full plenitude of living power , - is a question which we do not propose particularly to discuss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only of its own age , but , in large measure , of every age . Its productions never grow old . They are literally possessions for ever , icr ara E9 aEL . Homer sings to us as heroically as he did to the Greeks at Athens . Shakespeare will be as reverently studied in New Holland and New Zealand a thousand years hence , as he is in England in this day of Collier and Halliwell . And Scott will be the delight of many generations , in lands which are now the abode of savage beasts and savage men . We review , with pleasure undiminished by familiarity , the story of Scott 's early life ; - the weak and sickly childhood ; the vigorous youth ; the activity , firmness , and courage of the boy ; the sound good-sense gradually and surely developed ; the story-telling dimly prophetic of future fame ; the fondness for history , and stirring events , and Scottish scenes , highland and lowland ; the genial companionship and joviality ; the raids , as he called them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explored the streams and lakes , the mountains and ruins , - when he became familiar with the huts of the poor , and learned their habits and language and songs , and stored in his capacious memory the wealth of incident and adventure which was afterwards to be poured forth , varied , combined , and enriched with all the power of an untiring fancy . Scott 's acquisitions at this early period were not in the line of patient and exact scholarship , but they were abundant in the substance of literature and knowledge . He knew no Greek , confessing in late life that he had forgotten even the letters ; and in Latin , though able to read most of the authors // 295 1858. with readiness , he was more interested in the narrative or the poetry than in the language . But one would have a narrow idea of learning and scholarship , who did not see that the boy was rich in that spirit which is the chief end of wise study . After a due period of discipline at the high school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual amount of preliminary professional study , Scott entered upon his proposed course at the bar , with fair prospects of success . This was in 1792 . The weakness of the child had given place to an uncommonly vigorous manhood . A slight remaining lameness did not prevent the love or the practice of the most manly and athletic sports . " Will , " said Archie Park , brother of the celebrated traveller , to William Laidlaw , when Scott first met the Selkirk troop of yeomanry , - " Will , what a strong chield that would have been , if his left leg had been like his right ane ! " A few years later the young advocate , after one disappointment in love , was married to Miss Charlotte Carpenter . By degrees a taste for letters gained the ascendency in his mind . He acquired the German language , and translated from Burger and Goethe . He plunged deeper into Scotch antiquities ; extended his acquaintance among literary men ; visited London ; printed several ballads ; and altogether gave evidence of rising power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border , " published in 1802 , when he was at the age of thirtyone . It brought him little money , but much fame ; and more than all , it opened the way for subsequent publications , the success of which decided his course in life . His inquiries and studies , during the preparation of these volumes , had led to immense acquisitions of that peculiar knowledge which formed afterwards so largely the body of his works . Already , quite unconsciously to himself , were gathering those beautiful and gallant companies , to be in after time marshalled by his genius before the eyes of the world , and to move in imperishable beauty and spirit , beside the immortal Pilgrims to Canterbury , beside Godfrey and Tancred , beside Desdemona and Ophelia . One step forward was still to be taken , however , before the irrevocable decision in behalf of literature was made . His // mind was already more than wavering . He had already casually remarked to Wordsworth , with a confidence which surprised the English poet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose , get more money than ever he should wish to have , from the booksellers . " Before the publication of the Minstrelsy , he had received the appointment of Sheriff-depute of Selkirkshire , an office of small demands upon his time , of considerable local importance , and bringing with it the acceptable addition of three hundred pounds a year to his income . Its indirect influence was still more important . It compelled him to fix his residence in the county , and thus led the way to Abbotsford , preserved and cherished the healthful freshness and simplicity of his tastes , and the breadth of his sympathy , and did much , we doubt not , to insure the soundness of his judgment , and to free him from the danger of narrow and local influences . During these years Scott 's income was such as to place him quite at ease . In 1804 , from one source and another , apart from the receipts from his profession and the rewards of his literary labor , it had reached the fixed sum of a thousand pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when " The Lay of the Last Minstrel " came from the press , and was so eagerly received , Scott , conscious of his own powers , and secure at any rate against want , should have determined to abandon a mistress he never loved for another whom his heart chose , and who promised him the noblest rewards . " My profession and I , " he says in the delightful Introduction to that poem , " came to stand nearly upon the footing which honest Slender consoled himself on having established with Mistress Anne Page : There was no great love between us at the beginning , and it pleased Heaven to decrease it on further acquaintance . ' " Yet his fee-book shows no necessity for this change , since his professional income was gradually increasing , and gave fair promise of an honorable reward to his labors , if he had chosen to continue them . The " Lay " was born of the " Minstrelsy , " but the direct occasion of its production was the request of a lady ( the Countess of Dalkeith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homer . The recollection of the wild music of Coleridge 's // " Christabel , " repeated to him some time previously by a friend , suggested the then unusual metre . The kick of a horse , when he was on duty as Quartermaster of the Edinburgh Light Dragoons , confining him for three days to his lodging , the sound of the bugle and the sight of military manoeuvres expanded his ideas on a larger scale , and suggested the tumults and incidents of border warfare . A friend advised the division into cantos , with a suggestive motto to each , and his mind , in a moment of inspiration , leaped to the happy conception of the last minstrel . After being long on the stocks , and part of it having been communicated to many friends , the poem was at last published , in 1805 . It at once flashed into universal popularity . Critics and poets , gentle and simple , were alike charmed . Both Pitt and Fox , bending from their high places , united to render their tribute of sincere admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picturesque scenes , the touch of mystery and magic , the solemn earnestness , and the pathos touched the common heart . Poetry descended from her lofty throne and walked among men . Her stiffness and formality were dashed aside by the new-coiner , who seemed clothed with the fire of Homer and the tenderness and simplicity of the old ballads . His great success left Scott , as we have said , no choice but to abandon the bar as a profession , and to betake himself to literature . But even now his calmness , self-possession , and good sense did not fail him , in the midst of the universal adulation , and he seems to have entered on his new career with modest hopes , justified by a fair estimate of his own capacities , as well as by the favor of the public , on which he seems not to have reckoned too strongly . The introductions to the different works of Scott , furnished for the complete edition of 1830 , abound in pictures of great beauty and exquisite humor , deepening not unfrequently into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Lay , " he indicates the principles by which he early determined to be guided in his literary life , - principles which , if generally followed by writers , would have saved many a child of genius from unnumbered sorrows . " It was my first resolution , " he says , " to keep as far as was in my 26* // power abreast of society , continuing to maintain my place in general company , without yielding to the very natural temptation of narrowing myself to what is called literary society . By doing so , I imagined I should escape the besetting sin of listening to language , which , from one motive or other , is apt to ascribe a very undue degree of consequence to literary pursuits , as if they were , indeed , the business , rather than the amusement , of life . The opposite course can only be compared to the injudicious conduct of one who pampers himself with luscious draughts , until he is unable to endure wholesome bitters . Like Gil Bias , therefore , I resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeking that of a more literary cast , and to maintain my general interest in what was going on around me , reserving the man of letters for the desk and the library . " My second resolution was a corollary from the first . I determined that , without shutting my ears to the voice of true criticism , I would pay no regard to that which assumes the form of satire . I therefore resolved to arm myself with that triple brass of Horace , of which those of my profession are seldom held deficient , against all the roving warfare of satire , parody , and sarcasm ; to laugh if the jest was a good one ; or , if otherwise , to let it hum and buzz itself to sleep . " It is to the observance of these rules , ( according to my best belief : , ) that , after a life of thirty years engaged in literary labors of various kinds , I attribute my never having been entangled in any literary quarrel or controversy ; and , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the personal friendship of my most approved contemporaries of all parties . " - Introduction to the Lay of the Last Minstrel , pp. 13 , 14 . Thus Scott found himself , at the age of thirty-four , after thirteen years of indifferent service , withdrawing from the bar to a more congenial life . He was destined , however , for many years to sit beneath the shadow of the Bench in the Scottish Court of Session , and to spend a portion of every day in the mere mechanical occupation of a clerk . In looking about for some mode of retreat at once honorable and not without profit , he soon found one of those " respectable offices of the law , in which persons of that profession are glad to take refuge , when they feel themselves , or are judged by others , incompetent to aspire to its higher honors . " Through the kindness of his friends , he obtained , during the year 1806 , the reversion of the clerkship of the above-named court , upon the labors of which office he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its emoluments for many years after . His prospects had now come to be most flattering . Living at ease , with a sufficient income , surrounded by friends whom he " grappled to him with hooks of steel , " known and esteemed all over the kingdom , with a family growing up about him in health and prosperity , there seemed little more for him to desire , or little which he might fairly desire that he could not obtain . Yet , as all prosperity has its attendant peril , and " no man may be accounted happy till his death , " one who could have seen the end of Scott 's career from its beginning , would have preferred for him a more moderate measure of early success . James Ballantyne , at Scott 's suggestion , had removed from Kelso some time before , and established himself as a printer in Edinburgh . The demands upon his press , in consequence of the beauty of his work , exceeded his power to meet them without an increase of capital . He applied to Scott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance , for additional aid . Scott at first demurred , but finally agreed to furnish a loan on condition of being admitted as partner in the business , and at once put into it the whole fortune at his disposal . Thus he entered on that career which , bringing to him many facilities , and making his way easy along heights of unexampled prosperity , finally ended in a precipice off which he 0 fell with those to whom he was thus irrevocably bound . For a while all went on , not only well , but in a manner the best possible . Gigantic undertakings already loomed up in the distance , - a complete edition of the British Poets , the works of Dryden , poems , even novels . Some of these were carried out , and some failed . It is certain that Waverley was commenced as early as 1805 , though it was thrown aside for a seven years ' sleep after a few chapters had been written . The poet seems also to have entered upon that methodical employment of his time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been realized . He habitually rose early , dressed himself as he intended to remain till dinner-time , and by six o'clock was at his desk . At noon his day 's work was done , and he was ready for those constant excursions on horseback or on foot to which he owed so much of his health of mind as well as of body . // " Marmion " was published in 1808 , and was received with little less enthusiasm than the " Lay , " although with somewhat more closeness of criticism . It certainly has held its ground for fifty years quite as firmly as the earlier work , and the general opinion would probably affirm that Scott never rose to a loftier or more vigorous flight than in the last canto ; nor indeed would it be easy to find a poet , from Homer downward , by whom this portion of the poem has been surpassed . The following years were very busy and very happy . One work followed another , and the literary labor was interspersed with a constant succession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and planting at Abbotsford , journeys to London , and excursions northward even to the " wind-swept Orcades . " The Quarterly Review sprang up from Jeffrey 's article on Marmion . Dryden , Somers , and Sadler were edited . In 1810 , " The Lady of the Lake , " the most widely popular , perhaps , of all the longer poems , saw the light . " The Vision of Don Roderick , " " Rokeby , " and " The Bridal of Triermain , " followed in rapid succession . And now , when the vein of chivalric poetry was somewhat exhaust *d , a new candidate for public favor arose , more audacious , less scrupulously moral , at once surprising and deJ*ghting by strength and intensity of movement , by absolute command of an unusual metre allowing a more noble music , by new yet familiar scenes , and by the powerful exhibition of human sympathies and passions . Scott did not yield the ground at once , yet he felt that his empire was less secure ; and while meditating the abdication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten pages of Waverley . At once he determined to try a new venture . The novel was finished with great rapidity , - the last two volumes being written during the evenings of three weeks , while the author was performing all his duties as clerk , - and printed anonymously . There was a risk , it was thought by the booksellers , in the publication . Constable , the most enterprising of the tribe , refused to give a thousand pounds for the copyright , at the same time that he was glad to offer fifteen hundred guineas for one half the copyright of " The Lord of the Isles , " and it was finally published on an agreement to divide the // profits equally between author and publisher . Within a year several distinct editions had been disposed of , and each partner in the bargain had received considerably more than a thousand pounds . The vein proved indeed rich , - how rich no one then conjectured , - and the author needed but a single experiment more to lead him to desert the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord of the Isles , " the sale of which , compared with anything he had written before , was small , and still less when compared with the vast circulation which was at once given to some of Byron 's poems . The announcement of this fact , made to him by Ballantyne , was a trying disappointment , but he rallied at once , with accustomed manliness . " At length , " writes Ballantyne , in his memoranda , " he said with perfect cheerfulness , Well , well , James , so be it ; but you know we must not droop , for we ca n't afford to give over . Since one line has failed , we must just stick to something else ' ; - and so he dismissed me , and resumed his novel . " The new novel was Guy Mannering , " the work of six weeks at a Christmas . " " It was published , like Waverley , in three humble little volumes , " within a month after " The Lord of the Isles , " and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was possible for the author of both to be the same person . The secret of authorship , - first concealed , partly in caprice and partly from prudence , assuming some importance from the unexpected popularity of the novels , adding to the interest by stimulating curiosity , and prompting some very ingenious literary criticisms , - though open to many friends , was carefully preserved , occasionally by means of at least doubtful morality , it being denied sometimes playfully , and sometimes with rather too much seriousness , until the bankruptcy of the publishers compelled a disclosure ; in which , after all , the main interest was the assertion of Sir Walter 's sole and undivided claim to the production of his own works . It is quite unnecessary to follow the career of splendid and unexampled successes , as rapid , startling , and contrary to all precedent , in literature , as those of Napoleon in war . The times favored the writer . All were waiting for his coming . Scottish literature had not kept pace with Scottish science , // nor advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Playfair , Adam Smith , Hume , Reid , Stewart , Robertson , were hardly equalled by Ramsay , Home , Beattie , and Mackenzie ; Burns was comparatively little known , and imperfectly appreciated ; and especially throughout the whole island was there a dearth of fictitious literature . Scott 's intellect seems to have been in its high meridian between 1814 and 1819 , in the years of his own life from forty-three to forty-eight . During this time he finished Waverley , and produced Guy Mannering , The Antiquary , Old Mortality , Rob Roy , The Heart of Mid-Lothian , and Ivanhoe . In the last of this grand and unequalled series , his genius may be said to have culminated . Certainly , in splendor of exhibition , vigor of movement , extraordinary vividness of scenes , exhibition of manners and life , and breadth of interest , if not in tenderness of personal feeling , nothing that he wrote ever surpassed it . Both before and after this period he did great things , - enough , and more than enough , to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the fame of half a dozen men of ordinary capacity . Outside of these limits we find on one side , the Lay , Marmion , and The Lady of the Lake ; and on the other , Kenilworth , Q , uentin IDurward , The Talisman , and Woodstock . But these , beautiful , grand , and unique as they are , are the lesser peaks of the majestic range , the Eiger and the M*inch , compared with the Jungfrau , Monte Rosa , and Mont Blanc . To estimate the rank of Scott 's genius , we must look at its force and its nature , at the quantity of the production and the quality . When we remember that from 1802 , when the Mmstrelsy of the Scottish Border appeared , until 1831 , a period of twenty-nine years , not a twelvemonth elapsed ( with but a single exception ) , in which he did not publish some original work , and in some years so large a number of such works that the average reaches four volumes a year for every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such ponderous works as Somers 's Tracts , Sadler 's Life and Letters , Dryden 's Works , and Swift 's Works , besides , also , reviews and songs and letters without number , we may form some idea of the irrepressible force within , as well as of the exhaustless energy in // execution . For a considerable portion of this time , Scott was not impelled to write by present or prospective want . He was in possession of an ample income , and had already accumulated , as he thought , not only a competency , but what might be fairly considered affluence . Yet he labored as if the bread of every day were dependent on his unflagging exertion . Now this power of continuous production , even were the material produced but of moderate value , is no small gift . The full and steady stream gushes not from a cistern , but only from perennial fountains , with their sources deep within the everlasting hills . The works of Scott were not the result of an accidental stimulus , but of native , irrepressible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of thought , there is doubtless in different men a vastly different amount of written production . One often spends his time in concentration , composes slowly , meditates profoundly , and brings forth with pain . With Scott , to write was almost as easy as to think . His facility of composition was really prodigious , and combined with this were an industry and a resolution quite as extraordinary . When a novel was on the stocks , it may be said that he was composing at all times ; not only in his study , but in his rides , his walks , and even sitting at his clerk 's desk in the courts . Of this , one of his biographetA* gives an interesting , and , we can easily believe , an authentic account . On one occasion when Jeffrey was arguing a case with great felicity and eloquence , Scott was observed to be very busy in writing . After the plea was finished , Jeffrey leaned over the bar , and archly requested of Scott a sight of his notes . The request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with flying pen , proved to be the lyric commencing - " Pibroch of Don nil Dhu , Pibroch of Donuil , Wake thy wild voice anew , Summon Clan-Conuil . " Scott asserted that the spirit of the lyric was all owing to the eloquence of the advocate . At another time , it is said , the poet was so much engrossed in his own thoughts , that , in drawing up a decision of the judges , he precisely reversed it . // Fortunately , it was examined before being signed , and the error remedied by a new record . " Frequently , " says one writer , " Scott sat doing nothing but staring about him in a vacant manner , with his under lip far drawn into his mouth , as if he experienced a difficulty in breathing . At such times , his countenance seemed to have rather a stolid expression ; but to those who examined it closely , it evidently arose from intensity of internal rumination . He would frequently cast his eyes up to the gallery , which fronted the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , he usually watched his demeanor for a good while , and often broke out into a hearty laugh , as if tickled by the associations called up by the appearance of the personage before him . During these involuntary cachinnations , his face assumed a peculiarly droll expression . His eyes , which , in what may be termed the moments of repose , gave little animation to his features , appeared then to light up the whole visage with the sunshine of humor . " So well did this habit of his seem to be understood by his friends and intimates , that , when walking in the " outer house , " as was his custom during the recesses of the court , he was frequently left to himself , as if they were unwilling to interrupt , by unimportant conversation , the train of thought which he might be carrying out for a new novel or poem . The preliminary labor may thus be said to have been often entirely accomplished when the author took his seat at his desk , and his pen seldom waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of rapid composition by his methodical habits , as well as by that extraordinary memory , which kept sleepless watch over every fact , event , and word once committed to its charge , and rendered them up in due time with untiring docility . In turning to the quality of these productions of Scott , we believe that time will never reverse the decision pronounced by acclamation throughout the civilized world . We accept the judgment given more than a generation since , that " the Waverley Novels are , even from their mere popularity , the most striking literary phenomena of the age . " Scott is still the monarch of novelists , - still wears the crown , the right to which none has dared to dispute . He marches in the van of a bold , ambitious , daring , and chivalrous company of friends // and rivals , drawn from all countries and climes , and armed with all sorts of weapons . One is more agile , another more wary , one with sharper wit , another more subtile in delineation of character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , and that more familiar with the slang of thieves and the vulgarities of crime ; but in the completeness of accomplishment in the whole circle of " morall and polliticke vertues , " who can be compared with him ? The Red Cross Knight and Sir Guyon , Artegall and Britomartis , move before us with dignity and power , they compel our admiration and win our love , but Arthur overtops them all . If one seeks for terrible and bloody catastrophes , for intense excitements , for sly and bitter satire , for plots intricate as the problem of the perturbations of Uranus , or for any unnatural or fantastic modes of exciting or keeping the attention , he will be disappointed . If he is looking for the profoundest depths of passion ; obstinate questionings ; thoughts which wander through eternity ; hearts dissected in the agony of awful sorrow ; crime working out by slow degrees and against itself its own punishment , or overwhelming the good in remediless ruin , the avenging Nemesis tracking her victim to the world 's end ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild and beautiful and terrible scenes which Shakespeare calls up so easily , - he will find but glimpses and intimations . Tragedies and comedies there are in Scott , but almost every single quality which goes to constitute them we may see matched in some other modern novelist ; yet none can equal the grand combination of excellences which we trace in him . He still remains the standard by which we unconsciously measure all others . One ground of the fame of Scott is , that he virtually created a new school of novelists . Detecting the weaknesses , while he acknowledged the power , of the great story-writers that had gone before him , from De Foe to Smollett , he chose a new path , capable of endless ramifications , and leading over loftier and serener heights , through sweeter meadows and by purer streams . When he appeared , but one novelist , Miss Edgeworth , commanded the popular ear ; and her genius , though admirable , moved within xvdll-understood limits . // " The dead past had buried its dead . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careered over it with such grace and strength , such splendor of appearance , such kingly courtesy , such gentleness and sweetness , that for a time there seemed room for no other . The permanent grounds of the perpetual delight which Scott affords , are found in his broad and strong pictures of life in many ages and countries , his high and generous spirit , his refinement , gentleness , and delicacy , his catholicity of taste , his high-toned honor , his patriotism and humanity , and , in general , his sound morality . He shares with Shakespeare the great virtue of being at once thoroughly national and widely cosmopolitan . Each product has the flavor of the native soil , yet each is rooted in sympathies of which none can claim exclusive possession . Scotland owes him a debt which she may well despair of paying . He made her a classic land . He peopled her shaggy solitudes . Her cities and towns , her forests , her lakes , her mountains , her battle-fields , her great men , her martyrs , her history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotchmen all over the world received higher honor , and might well become more proud of their birth-land , because of him ; and through his writings Scotland herself acquired more substantial power than by any political event in her history since the union of the two crowns . No future Johnson will repeat his sneering definition of " oats , " nor can any general satire on the country be other than malicious dulness or falsehood . This high praise can not be given , in equal extent , to any writer of the world . At the same time he touches the universal heart of the race . If he moves with consummate courtesy and grac* among the most cultivated and refined , he is no less at home with the lowly , as true in delineating their life , as full of admiration for their humble virtues , and of pity for their misfortunes . Hence no writer seems more closely bound to his readers by something like the ties of a personal friendship . We can not help quoting a few words in evidence equally of Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathies . They were in reply to Lockhart , who had said something of poets and novelists as looking at things only in reference to art . // SIR WALTER SCOTT . " A soft and pensive shade came over Scott 's face as he said , I fear you have some very young ideas in your head . Are you not too apt to measure things by some reference to literature , - to disbelieve that anybody can be worth much care who has no knowledge of that sort of thing , or taste for it ? God help us ! what a poor world this would be if that were the true doctrine ! I have read books enough , and conversed with enough of eminent and splendidly cultivated minds , too , in my time ; but , I assure you , I have heard higher sentiments from the lips of poor uneducated men and women , when exerting the spirit of severe yet gentle heroism under difficulties and afflictions , or speaking their simple thoughts as to circumstances in the lot of friends and neighbors , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible . We shall never learn to feel and respect our real calling and destiny , unless we have taught ourselves to consider everything as moonshine compared with the education of the heart . " ' Of similar purport is his reply to his daughter Anne , who happened to say of something , " that she could not abide it , - it was vulgar . " " My love , " said her father , " you speak like a very young lady ; do you know , after all , the meaning of this word vulgar ? T is only common ; nothing that is common , except wickedness , can deserve to be spoken of in a tone of contempt ; and when you have lived to my years , you will be disposed to agree with me in thanking God that nothing really worth having or caring about in this world is uncommon . " This feeling it was which led him with the truest instinct to avoid the rock on which , with his high tastes and ambition , he might have been wrecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find no one trait so thoroughly distinguishing Sir Walter from the great body of romance-writers who preceded him , as his deep spirit of humanity ; and it is precisely this which takes his writings from the sphere of merely immediate and temporary interest , and stamps them with immortality . " Thanks to the human heart by which we live , " into the fleeting and transitory scenes which he has pictured so graphically , he has thrown enough of the salt of human joys and sorrows , of temptation and triumph , of patient endurance and high resolve , of fidelity and love , to preserve them for ever . We may become indifferent to joust // and tournament , to Highland and Lowland , but never to Rebecca , the " bright , consummate flower " of a despised and persecuted race ,  --  never to the self-denial and truth and meek heroism of Jeanie Deans , the high loyalty of Flora M ' Jvor , the courtesy of Mannering , the rough virtues of Rob Roy , or the good sense , kindness , and substantial excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely peopled our world with real characters endowed with more than the life of history . What a void would be left in our thoughts were they removed ! These characters , too , not a few of them , partake largely of the Shakespearian type of vitality . They are made known to us , not by description , but by their words and their actions . They glow with life . They act and speak as they do , because they are what they are . Nor are we stimulated to observe them through any unnatural exaggeration of qualities , or caricaturing of faults and foibles , but by a well-sustained exhibition of traits which in themselves are replete with interest . To excite surprise and attract attention by a display of the monstrous and distorted , is far easier than by justness and accuracy of delineation to depict some of the multitudinous forms of original character . A writer of an inferior order may seize upon some hideous or ludicrous characteristic , and make it play a striking part among the scenes and incidents of fiction ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of a complicated character , and higher still to interweave the thousand strands of many lives so as to produce an harmonious unity . It is easy to determine the law which governs the falling of a stone , but to discover and demonstrate the complicated laws of the celestial mechanics is quite a different matter . Now Scott is none the less a master in this subtile and grand department of fiction , because he conceals his skill , and leaves us to discover it only by the results . In reviewing at this distance of time the historical fictions of Sir Walter , we are struck with their general truthfulness . Individual pictures are liable to criticism . Neither Cromwell nor Charles may appear in the exactest colors and propor // tions . Claverhouse may be too attractive , and the Puritans too sour . Scott was strong in his political feelings , yet he was also magnanimous , chivalrous , and just .

" And even on the more delicate and hazardous ground of religious differences , although correctness of statement is much more difficult , and prejudice stronger , we can not see that Scott fairly laid himself open to very severe criticism . His mind , though serious and earnest , was not profoundly religions , and he might well mistake or misunderstand the depth and awfulness of those convictions and emotions which led martyrs joyful to the stake , or even misconceive the better side of that enthusiasm and fanaticism by which they were driven to the caves , or " scattered on the Scottish mountains cold " ; yet not only was Scott 's life irreproachable on the score of morality , but the national spirit , devout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ancestors , the under color of old Presbyterianism shone through the lights and shadows of his maturer tastes , and the noble and beautiful liturgy of the Church of England was familiar to him by choice . The Colonel Gardiner of Waverley is the Colonel Gardiner of Dr. Doddridge . The truthfulness of Jeanie Deans under the most terrible temptation that could assail a loving heart , sprang from a devoutly religions , God-fearing soul . When " Old Mortality " first appeared , it was assailed vigorously and angrily by Dr. M'Crie , on the charge of its defaming the character of the Covenanters ; but the criticism seems to us more vehement than necessary , and we more than doubt whether the early defenders of the faith in Scotland against the unwise efforts of the English government and the persecutions of Lauderdale and Claverhonse , stand less high in the general esteem than they would have done had Scott never written . They certainly are more widely known , and as a body they move 27 // before us even on his canvas , pure in life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been somewhat the fashion to speak slightingly of the poetry of Scott ; yet in its line what other has been so popular , or has maintained so permanent a hold on the public regard ? There is indeed a " fatal facility * in the metre which he chose , and a strong temptation to be betrayed into carelessness and superficiality . Yet in dwelling upon the spiritual essence of poetry , it is possible to estimate its music at too low a rate . And when we look at the pictures of life , at the movement of the action , the variety of incident , the gentleness and tenderness , the truth and moral purity of every poem , we need not be surprised that no poet of " fifty years since** has so entirely kept his ground . It were quite unfair to compare him with Shakespeare or Milton or Spenser or Byron or Wordsworth . He aimed at no such flight as the " first three* ' ; he yielded before the intense vehemence and the philosophic profoundness of the others . But he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the didactic quietness , the occasional prosaic simplicity , and the rather dangerous self-esteem of Wordsworth . Not occupying the " glory-smitten summit " of English song , to which indeed he did not aspire , he will long move , we believe , in honorable fellowship with those who midway encircle the poetic mountain with beauty and joy . The four or five years following the publication of Ivanhoe were among the happiest . Scott had acquired an ample fortune , and re-established an honored name . For more than two thirds of the period ordinarily assigned to a generation , he had contributed more to the delight of tens and hundreds of thousands than any other man . His productions had become almost a necessity of life . He was overwhelmed with attentions and praises , which would have destroyed the balance of a mind not firmly fixed upon its centre . Not without labor , yet with few disheartening struggles , with the least possible envy and jealousy , and attended all along his way with congratulations and kind wishes , he had reached the highest literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scotland , and daily more and more the observed of all // observers . Lawrence , at the command of his sovereign , painted his portrait , and Chantrey sculptured him in marble . Both Oxford and Cambridge tendered to him honorary degrees . The king , of his own motion , created him a baronet . Wealth flowed in upon him in a stream so deep and full and steady as to seem exhaustless . Ashestiel , where he was a tenant , had long before been exchanged for Abbotsford , and Abbotsford had grown from the small though comfortable house , into the fantastic , castellated , pointed , pinnacled , and turreted structure , his joy and pride , crowded with comfort , bursting full with books and paintings , steel armor and curious weapons , relics of the chase and objects of antiquity , - the Mecca of pilgrims from many countries . From its windows its master looked out over his broad plantations , upon objects to whose fame his pen had contributed not a little , and which he loved almost as a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melrose Abbey , and the Tweed . The love of possession grew by what it fed on . Land and still more land was added to the original estate ; - here a hill and there a glen ; a loch on this side to correspond with the river on that ; here the veritable haunts of Thomas the Rhymer , and there the battle-ground of Melrose . Nature had clothed his possessions with richness . The hills which he purchased barren and bare were waving with foliage and fruitful with harvests . He cut timber from forests which his own hand had planted . His children were prospering in the world ; his grandchildren already enlivening the house with their prattle . His name and lineage should not close with himself . Strangers in ever increasing numbers flocked to Abbotsford , attracted not only by the fame , but by the ample hospitality , the considerate , refined , and gentle courtesy of the host . Friends , too , among all classes , gentle and simple , were becoming more numerous and more kind . We are not surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among all who knew him ; for there have been few natures more happily formed for friendship than his , few with a spirit more genial , with a disposition so destitute of envy and jealousy , or with manners less lordly , overbearing , or dictatorial. * // Scott was a high Tory in politics , yet some of his most intimate acquaintances were Whigs . He was devoted to royalty and power and rank , yet his sympathies were ever with the lowly and humble , with the natural and not the artificial ; and the characters which he portrays with the most warmth , and through which his own heart 's blood seems to circulate , are such as the poor fishermen of Fife , or the devout cowfeeder of St. Leonard 's . His relations to other authors had always been genial and friendly . We do not remember a word of harsh or unkind criticism , or an ungenerous judgment , and many were the young writers to whom his sympathy and counsels , and sometimes his pen , were free . He who loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn ? Men as opposite as Lyron and Wordsworth , Coleridge and Moore , seem reconciled under the shadow of his wide humanity . No literary life was ever attended with such a splendid retinue ; no literary man - not even Johnson - was ever the centre of a group of philosophers , poets , critics , artists , and men of affairs , more ample in intellect , more various in tastes , more hearty in friendship . Yet how mingled with sadness now is the thought of all that building and buying and furnishing , the taste and kindness of friends called so largely into requisition , the rejoicing of neighbors , the enjoyment and hope of the illustrious owner ! All the apartments of Abbotsford were thrown open on the 9th of January , 1825 , at a ball given in honor of the affianced bride of young Walter . They were never but once thrown open for company again , and that was at Sir Walter 's funeral . The wheel of fortune never stands ous appreciation of favors received , and the enhanced value he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There had been some obstacles interposed by the friends of Miss Jobson to her marriage with Scott 's eldest son . These - known , of course , only to the parties interested - were removed mainly through the intervention of a mutual friend , Rev. Dr. Dickson of Edinburgh . After the matter had been fully settled , the Doctor was invited to dine with Sir Walter and a few friends . Near the close of the dinner , Scott asked Dr. Dickson , who sat near the opposite end of the table , to do him the favor to exchange snuff-boxes . As the boxes passed to the opposite ends of the table , Scott proposed as a toast the health of the Rev. Dr. Dickson , afriend at a pinch , and the Doctor , on looking at the box , saw that it was an elegant one of gold , bearing his own name , with the addition , " From his friends Walter Scott and Ann Jobson. " // still , and he who would moralize on the vanity of human wishes finds here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these last proud and happy years , a sagacious observer might have more than once noticed somethingleaning buttress , or loosened stone , or settling foundation to awaken suspicion , and excite fears for the security of the aerial structure of that great fortune , " rising with the sound Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet . " Recent purchases , at high prices , had made a demand on Scott 's resources not very easy to be met . Personal and family expenses had increased . The sale of the later novels had fallen off from the standard of the Heart of Mid.Lothian and Ivanhoe , and this , with injudicious kindness , had been kept from the knowledge of the author . At the same time , his publisher , proud of success , was forming gigantic plans , and pursuing them with something of the audacity and recklessness of a despot . At the moment , then , of highest prosperity and unclouded joy , when the marriage-bells were ringing , and he had just settled Abbotsford with its ample domains upon his son by the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeping over the horizon , and within a twelvemouth all was darkness and dismay ; " The lights were fled , The garlands dead , " and Scott was left to a few years of comparative poverty , to the most overwhelming labor , but yet to friendships the noblest , because proved so severely , and to high , perpetual honor . Scott lived a double life ; - one genial and free among his friends and neighbors , a life of activity and business , of prudence and sound sense and practical judgment , of planting and building , of hunting and fishing , of visiting and entertaming ; and another of fancy and romance , in the past and the distant , among the shadows of early history , among the creatures with which his own imagination had peopled the world . He lived in a world of books , and of rare books . He seldom read newspapers , and except the larger questions // of politics , or the immediate interests of his friends , seemed to have little concern in what was going on among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelling so much in an unreal world , his plans should have been sometimes visionary , nor that , in the full tide of the most extraordinary literary success ever seen , he should have forgotten some of the requisites of commercial soundness and strength . It much exalts , then , our estimate of the self-possession , the entire selfmastery of his mind , to read , in some of his letters , the prudent and wise counsels which he was able to give to others , and the unquestionably sound principles of conducting pecuniary affairs which he commended . His mistake was , in being linked with those over whom he had but a partial control , and of whose affairs he had but a partial knowledge . Early in January , 1826 , came the crash which involved Sir Walter in irretrievable ruin . Constable failed . Ballantyne was connected with Constable , Scott directly or indirectly with both , and all went together . " It was between eight and nine in the morning , " says Ballantyne , in his memorandum ( January 17 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was greatly stunned , but upon the whole he bore it with wonderful fortitude . " Soon after , his friend Mr. Skene came in by appointment . Scott rose and said , " My friend , give me a shake of your hand , - mine is that of a beggar . " Then came the revelation to the world of the great author 's commercial relations . Then followed how many sneers from the vulgar , how many self-complacent expressions of pity , how much blame from the prudent , what profound sorrow from his friends , what deep mortification to Scott himself , who had concealed his business partnership from his most intimate companions , - yet how much noble sympathy from every land penetrated by his fame ! In a moment his air-castles were dissolved , his children were without patrimony , Abbotsford fading from his grasp , and a debt of a hundred and twenty thousand pounds weighing upon his shoulders . His own imagination had hardly conceived a position more appallingly calamitous , or demanding more force of character to meet and surmount it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration of the true nobility of Scott 's life . " All was lost but honor " ; but that never shone so bright , never rose so high and beautiful , as when emerging from the clouds of that melancholy year . The oak was fearfully wrenched by the blast , stripped of its leaves , and bereft of some of its branches ; yet it stood firm , its trunk unbroken , and its roots still going down into the heart of the earth . " Scott ruined ! " said the Earl of Dudley when he first heard of the catastrophe ; " the author of Waverley ruined ! Good God ! let every man to whom he has given months of delight give him a sixpence , and he will rise to-morrow morning richer than Rothschild . " This was said of Englishmen in 1826 . But give it a literal and universal application at the present day , and what a fabulous stream of wealth would be flowing towards Abbotsford from every province of the world ! It is sad to think that for the want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all honor to give , a frame so strong , a mind so affluent , should have been pressed prematurely to the grave . But no constitution could avert the inevitable result , nor indeed would any aid be received . It was most generously offered , but respectfully and firmly declined . The harvest must be gathered by him who sowed the seed . It would have been commercially fair and honorable to attempt a composition with the creditors , and none would have refused the most favorable terms . But Scott* s nice sense of justice would not allow this , so long as a possibility remained of a more favorable issue ; and he at once set himself to the monsfrous task , of which no literary man before or since could so much as have dreamed , of coining from his own brain six hundred thousand dollars . The narrative reads like a romance , yet no writer of novels would dare attach to any hero so improbable a story . He proceeded at once with cheerfulness to adapt himself to his changed circumstances . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminished ; his hospitality somewhat curtailed ; his property fairly put under the charge of his creditors ; and he himself bending to work as if in the full vigor of youth , // sent forth volume after volume , novels , biographies , histories , as if he commanded a score of brains and a hundred hands . Henceforth no time was given to himself . The methodical diligence of former years was insufficient . His labor began as before with the early morning , but it ended only when he was obliged to sleep at night . No hour was allowed for reading , for recreation , or for pleasure . All was cheerfully consecrated to work . Woodstock went on at the same time with negotiations with creditors . The Life of Napoleon followed close upon it . The Chronicles of the Canongate , first and second series , appeared soon after . Then the Tales of a Grandfather , Anne of Geierstein , the History of Scotland , and Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft , all at the rate , for three years , of nearly ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also bought in , and a new edition published , which reached an average sale of twenty-three thousand copies . " In the mere production of the work , apart from the sale , " says Mr. Chambers , " nearly a thousand persons were supported . " Within four years , besides his personal and family expenses , he had paid to his creditors fifty-four thousand pounds . At this rate of working , it was evident , even to the incredulous , that the great debt would soon be cancelled . But , alas ! his sturdy frame could not endure the unrelaxing labor . He was coining his blood for drachmas . And of this he was not unwarned . Not yet an old man , he grew weak , and still more weak . One recreation after another was abandoned . At last a stroke of something like paralysis startled all his friends , as too sure a monition of what might be near at hand . His physicians forbade labor ; but what could stop the working of his brain ? The mill would grind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last it became evident that the only hope lay in rest so far as it was possible , and a long absence from home . A voyage to Italy was decided on . The government placed a frigate at his disposal . On the 23d of September , 1831 , Sir Walter left Abbotsford to return only to die . Wordsworth had come to take leave of him the day before , and commemorated his visit and the sad occasion of it in one of the finest sonnets in our language . // " A trouble , not of clouds , or weeping rain , Nor of the setting sun 's pathetic light Engendered , hangs o'er Eildon 's triple height : Spirits of Power , assembled there , complain For kindred Power departing from their sight ; While Tweed , best pleased in chanting a blithe strain , Saddens his voice again , and yet again . Lift up your hearts , ye Mourners ! for the might Of the whole world 's good wishes with him goes ; Blessings and prayers , in nobler retinue Than sceptred king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be true , Ye winds of ocean , and the midland sea , Wafting your Charge to soft Parthenope ! " The journey , the voyage , and the foreign residence were attended with the most assiduous kindness of friends , the delicate courtesy of strangers , and with some pleasure to the invalid . Yet the clouds of disease gradually gathered thicker and thicker , and the party were obliged at last to hurry home , almost by forced marches . On the 11th of July , 1832 , lying almost torpid in his carriage , Sir Walter drew near to Abbotsford . The old scenes revived the old affections , and for a little while seemed to feed the exhausted lamp with fresh oil . His mind , in its few hours of consciousness , turned to the Bible , the Liturgy , and a few favorite poets , especially Crabbe . On the morning of the 17th of September , he awoke with perfect consciousness , and , calling for Mr. Lockhart , gave him his touching legacy of kind advice , too memorable to be forgotten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockhart , I may have but a minute to speak to you . My dear , be a good man , - be virtuous , - be religious , - be a good man . Nothing else will give you any comfort when you come to lie here . " These were among his last words . Four days of almost entire unconsciousness followed , and the generous , noble heart ceased to beat . " It was a beautiful day , - so warm that every window was wide open ,  --  and so perfectly still that the sound of all others most delicious to his ear , the gentle ripple of the Tweed over its pebbles , was distinctly audible as we knelt around the bed , and his eldest son kissed and closed his eyes. ** // " So fades , so languishes , grows dim , and dies , All that this world is proud of . From their spheres The stars of human glory are cast down ; Perish the roses and the flowers of kings . " The title of great has been denied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and his life merely " economical , material , of the earth , earthy . " This judgment seems to us not only harsh , but narrow and false . It were easy to adopt a standard according to which no man could be called great . " God only is great , " said the French preacher , and who will deny the truth of the utterance ? It is the dictate of inspiration , and equally of philosophy and of history . But when we speak of greatness in man , it is , of course , in comparison with man . We confess that , in the sphere in which he moves , . we look upon Scott as very great . As a writer , and still more as a man , judged by what he did and by what he was , we can not fail to acknowledge the propriety of that eminence which , by common consent , he occupies . That he stands on the same ground with Dante and Shakespeare and Milton , we of course would not affirm . He nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or attempts to solve the full problem of life . Such is not the aim of his fictions . But in depicting the peculiarities of different times and scenes , in giving to the abundant suggestions of his imagination " a local habitation and a name , " he has realized high thoughts , generosity and magnanimity , the constancy of martyrs , the self-devotion of patriots , the courage of men and the modesty of women , and a thousand of the virtues and graces which go so far towards ennobling and beautifying life . And still he himself was always greater than anything that he produced . We are not surprised in him at any production of high quality , but are rather surprised , and ascribe it to some accident , if by any distance he fails of the noblest aim . True , the splendors of life caught and delighted his eager eye ; the temptations of wealth and applause , the fascination of rank , position , and an honored name , were nearly irresistible . Let us acknowledge that he thought more of these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these as the governing elements of his life would be no more just , than to see in // Bacon only his dishonor , or in Goethe nothing but his cool and detestable selfishness . And , allowing these strong tastes of Scott , do they not enhance the serenity and self-possession with which he yielded his hopes and expectations ? Few men have been tried by such prosperity and by such adversity , and proved themselves so fully equal to either fortune . Few men have climbed to the dizzy heights of wealth and popularity , and stood there with firmer feet and more unmoved brain . Fewer still have seen the highest worldly good vanish in smoke , and still retained in undiminished lustre all their strength and beauty of character . If he had loved these things as the supreme good , could he have relinquished them with so little regret ? " I have seen , " he says to Laidlaw , after the catastrophe , " all that society can show , and enjoyed all that wealth can give me , and I am satisfied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Here , at least , as well as in those last words to Lockhart , is there not an effluence of divine wisdom ? We do not commend the life of Scott as being governed by absolutely the wisest aims . We see and feel that , if he had obtained all that he struggled for , it would not have been the greatest or best possession . But did not he feel this too ? Did he not form an estimate of wealth and popularity , and station and power , on the whole as nearly just as any of his critics have ? Great praise indeed it is that Scott preserved in all his writings so high a moral tone . He was not betrayed by his popularity into any licentiousness of picture or of phrase , and from beginning to end scrupulously avoided every sentiment which would offend the moral judgment of the most sensitive . He had no ambition to attract the praises of the vulgar by ministering , however indirectly , to their self-indulgence . And this not from policy , but from principle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage from the Introduction to Ivanhoe , as showing a striking clearness of moral insight , as well as the method in which that element of character affected his productions . " The character of the fair Jewess , " he says , " found so much favor in the eyes of some fair readers , that the writer was censured , because , when arranging the fates of the characters of the drama , he had not // assigned the hand of Wilfred to Rebecca , rather than the less interesting Rowena . But , not to mention that the prejudices of the age rendered such a union almost impossible , the author may , in passing , observe , that he thinks a character of a highly virtuous and lofty stamp is degraded rather than exalted by an attempt to reward virtue with temporal prosperity . Such is not the recompense which Providence has deemed worthy of suffering merit , and it is a dangerous and fatal doctrine to teach young persons , the most common readers of romance , that rectitude of conduct and of principle are either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratification of our passions , or attainment of our wishes . In a word , if a virtuous and self-denied character is dismissed with temporal wealth , greatness , rank , or the indulgence of such a rashly formed or ill-assorted passion as that of Rebecca for Ivanhoe , the reader will be apt to say , verily virtue has had its reward . But a glance on the great picture of life will show , that the duties of self-denial , and the sacrifice of passion to principle , are seldom thus remunerated ; and that the internal consciousness of their high-minded discharge of duty , produces on their own reflections a more adequate recompense , in the form of that peace which the world can not give or take away . " With these words of truth and wisdom , we close . We assent again to the free , spontaneous judgment of the world ; and , with reverence and love , would add one more leaf to the immortal chaplet , one more flower to the ever-blooming amaranth.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
