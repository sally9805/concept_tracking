txt ART . VIII . - Annals of the American Pulpit ; or * ! ommemora* tire Notices of Distinguished American Clergymen of Various Denominatiomts , from the Early Settlement of the Country to the Close of the Year Eighteen Hundred and Fifty-Five . With Historical Introductions . By WILLIAM B. SPRAGUE* D. ID . Vols . I. and II . Trinitarian Congregationalists , New York : Robert Carter and Brothers . 8vo. pp. 723 , 778 . WE wish the poet had put the same thought into a statelier or more eloquent form than the perpetually quoted line , " The proper study of mankind is man . " It tells a truth which needs repeating so often , that no one phrase , unless very nicely worded , can safely sustain the reiteration . Such a royal text-book as a Lexicon of Biographical Annals supplies for this study , can of course accept so readily no less comprehensive sentiment as a just introduction to public notice . Man , even taken miscellaneously and without classification , claims and rewards study as no other subject but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his gen // erations , - those of special vitality in themselves , or those most influential in their effects upon other gene rations , - man preparing for eras , evolving eras , or as evolved by eras , - man in the great classifications which religious , political , and social life requires and creates , offers superlative attractions to every intellect studious of its kind . A subdivision of one section of one class of men , whose names are gathered and arranged on the line of the few generations composing our national life , is introduced to the reading world in the volumes named above . Few treatises ever solicited public notice with fuller and richer material for study of character , than these . They snmmon our interest by unusual qualities . Ten thousand families , . and twice ten thousand persons , search such annals for matters more or less personal . Dim shadows of ancestors are sought there ; glimpses of forces or beauties of character , coveted or thought to be perpetuated in living descendants ; links for the impaired or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked for in such books . And when personal incentives cease , that deep instinctive interest , common to all men in the story of any human carccr , prolongs the charm and power of the record . These volumes have an incidental advantage of no little force in addition to those named . Ten years ' work is in them . An industry that divides our surprise and admiration , a kind of coral-insect diligence , has reared these piles . It is a law greatly creditable to human nature , that true labor is invariably respected . That which costs time-consuming toil , be it an ivory crucifix almost pulsing with life , or a cathedral needing centuries in which to grow to completion , or a poem , chronicle , or history , in which years of unwearied study have hidden their treasures ,  --  whatever the work produced , to know that it embodies long-protracted diligence adds an interest and merit to whatever intrinsic worth it else might claim . Both the structure of these Annals d the recorded fact testify to the long and patient toil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by manly labor , and , yet more , the true pledge of faithful endeavor involved in such labor , give a noble rank to this work . // Until we reflect upon the force of quality in a product , the worth of this element of toil is not fully felt . But let accredited scholarship , for instance , conclude , and convince the world , that the IEneid was the product of twenty weeks , instead of as many years , how would its hold upon the esteem of scholars be loosened ! The confident plaudit of the cultured and learned would subside into hesitating admiration and critical scepticism . Jts merit as a model would at once be denied . Truth , the child of time , would not own it as now . Build a St. Peter 's by the job , and put into its history the boast of vain contractors , that the great temple was merely a six years ' task , how would its stately fame dwindle ! The years spent on such creations are taken in part as testimonials of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are glad that these massive Annals were not a piece of vacation pastime , nor a gush from a four weeks ' impulse , - a kind of flippant pretence which this hurrying and impatient age is very fond of setting up about anything it performs . We revere the work as a growth , a thing of time ; it can he better trusted . The roots strike deeper , we thii*ik ; and the branches stand the firmer for it . These , too , are accounts of men held in repute in their own day . The prime and controlling incidents of any life that has come to renown , strongly and fitly engage our interest ; for incidents in themselves attract us , and when they bear the lustre of a success to which they visibly contributed , when they are seen to be the necessary accessories to a final fame , they draw us by a vastly heightened force . No department of American public life - except perhaps that of the transition career of the Revolutionary fathers - has been so fully recorded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most fragmentary elements of our literature ; each life a sphere by itself , and the memorial of it designed either for local use or for the interests of local friendship . A state church or a clergy in any such connection as would have required a legal registration of names , dates , inductions , and removals , would have produced a much more accessible , though less truthful and faithful , record of the men whose names are not willingly left to die . // The structure of Dr. Sprague 's work is hence quite largely compilation , - the gathering into consecutive chronicle of the vastly diffused memorials which his research through the land has found and acquired . His plan constrained him to become to a great extent a friendly editor , and the courtesy on which he was compelled to rely in collecting his materials must have sometimes precluded his careful taste and discrimination from their wonted office . But generally there is little to offend , even where much would be looked for . Such a promiscuous authorship can hardly be found in so small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the fifteen hundred pages produce a diversity which none but a master could combine into an agreeable unity . The biographies are , some of them , sketches traced in former generations ; many of them by aged persons who had survived the executive vigor of mind ; and among the writ*rs are persons with all varieties of culture , taste , and acquirement . To adju*t and adjoint these with a tolerable harmony was a task which a feeble or inexpert hand might better have left alone . The admirable management - we want to say manwuvring - by which these troops are got into marching ordcr , is a charm of the work , and a marked proof of excelling authorship , or generalship . The reader is sometimes perplexed to say which interests him most , the writers , or the men written about . Indeed , we found ourselves amused once or twice in noticing how the mind unconsciously crept away from the portrait , and gazed at the painter , as the more engaging of the two ; just as dull schoolboys will sometimes show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , while the interest is wholly in the master 's vivacity or grace of manner , not at all in the theorem . We imagine that Dr. Sprague must often have found rich relief in his unexampled labors from this source , - a choice , excellent letter , arriving now and then , refreshing his spirit , much as the aroma from parcels of spices does the tired merchant who has brought them in his ship . This , moreover , is one of the useful services these Annals may render , - eliciting and preserving specimens of skilful biography . It will be in part a book // of models to this memoir-craving and memoir-scribbling generation . A genuine service - we hope it may be taken for - is this , of setting an example of that comprehensive , discriminating biography which is alone of real value to the living . How little a third or fourth generation care to retain of those famed in their own times , may here be leurned . We care so much to enforce this suggestion , that we resort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Professor Felton , of Cambridge , gives this admirable picture of Dr. Popkin - " My personal acquaintance with Dr. Popkin commenced in 1823 . I knew him more as a teacher and Professor of Greek than as a preacher , though he still continued to supply the pulpit , occasionally , in the College Chapel , and the neighboring churches , for a considerable number of years after that time . He was a man of singular modesty , and during his connection with the Federal Street Society was constantly oppressed with a nervous apprehension that he was not qualified to discharge the responsible duties of a clergyman in such a community . His discourses , however , according to the traditions of the Society , and as appears from his published works , were able , pious , and often eloquent ; and parishioners by no means shared in the opinion of his qualifications entertained by himself . In the Society of Newbury he felt better satisfied with the sphere of his labors and duties He could not , I believe , have found a congregation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or more disposed to a just appreciation of his worth . Assured , as he soon was , of their entire confidence and affection , he felt no restraint among them from the peculiarities of temperament which he was so conscious of possessing , but enjoyed the utmost freedom in his social and parochial visits . Dr. Popkin was in truth a model minister , as he had been a model scholar . His pastoral duties , in season and out of season , were performed with a most hearty fidelity . The sick and the poor were never forgotten by him . His darling studies could not detain him a moment from any call to them . In all his parochial intercourse he was so kind , sympathizing , and generous , - so frank , pleasant , and apt in his remarks and interchange of good feeling and good humor , - that he was a most welcome guest with every class of people , and made to feel that he was welcome , not only as their minister , but as a friend and companion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orator . His nervous susceptibility , amounting at times to intellectual timidity , prevented , him from doing justice in public to the great powers which he unquestionably // possessed . He always preached from written discourses . His manner , though sometimes agitated , and never conforming to the rules of polished delivery , was solemn , impressive , and well suited to command the attention of an audience . His devotional exercises were fervent and earnest in the highest degree . His voice was naturally rich and powerful , and , with the training to which a man ambitious of public distinctions would have subjected himself might have become the organ of most effective oratory . In person , Dr. Popkin was tall , well-proportioned , and commanding . His head was large , his features massive , and his brain capacious . His walk was upright , and his step firm and vigorous , until , as he approached the age of fourscore , his figure bowed under the load of years , and he supported his yielding limbs by a staff . There was a singular power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his conversation , notwithstanding his melancholy temperament , was rich with racy wit , quaint expression , solid sense , and comprehensive scholarship ; and his character in general was strongly marked with that simplicity , wherein - to borrow the striking words of Thucydides - nobleness of nature most largely shares* ' His religious views were what are called Evangelical , as distinguished from Unitarian and Rationalistic ; but he never took part in theological controversy , and refused to be called after the leader of any particular sect . Being once asked by an anxious lady of his parish if he was a Hopkinsian , - a sectarian designation formerly much in vogue in the religious circles , - he replied , Madam , I am a Popkinsian . ' A short time before his resignation , he withdrew from the College Chapel , and joined the Orthodox Congregational Society . Finally he sought rest in the Episcopal Church , finding much to approve in its quiet and moderation , and having become satisfied by the study of the early ecclesiastical writers that liturgies were used by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heart , integrity of life , consistent piety , modesty , and self.distrust , were daily exhibited . The confessions of sin in the offices of the Church express deep and earnest humility ; but he was accustomed to say , I would fain have them more and deeper . ' " Di* . Popkin was never married . In his youth and early manhood he is said to have been not deficient in a taste for social life ; but many amusing stories used to be told of his shyness in the presence of women , and of his aversion to the thought of marriage . It was jokingly asserted , that the only fault he ever found with his favorite language , the Greek , was that it had a dual number . Yet there was a tradition long current in College , that , in the circle which Mr. Popkia occasionally frequented in his youth , there was an amiable and accomplished person // 475 SPRAGUE 'S AMERIOA* PULPIT . to whose attractions he was not insensible . But whatever feeling warmer than friendship may have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all but himself ; and was only a matter of inference with the spectators . Half a century afterwards , on the death of an estimable and venerable lady , Dr. Popkin , contrary to the long fixed habits of his life , attended her funeral , and followed her in his carriage to the grave . Perhaps some lingering memory of an early dream of romance , untold at the time , but unforgotten afterwards , may still have dwelt in that lonely heart . " - Vol . II . pp. 436 - 438 . As an example of condensed description , we offer a part of the account of Professor Eliphalet Pearson , LL . D. , given by Rev. Daniel Waldo , the nonagenarian Chaplain of the last Congress . " Everything about Dr. Pearson was in admirable keeping . He had a noble , commanding person , which looked like a tower of strength . His face was indicative at once of strong thought and strong feeling . If you had met him casually , without knowing who he was , and he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that he was an extraordinary man . His mind was a great storehouse of knowledge , and it was not easy to introduce a subject , especially one connected with literature or science , on which he was not perfectly at home . He seemed familiar with the whole history of learning , and his conversation was enlivened by pertinent and endlessly varied illustrations . His taste was most exact ; and I have understood from those who have been his pupils , that , as a critic , he was well-nigh without a rival . In all my intercourse with him , I uniformly found him courteous and kind , and , I may say , a very model of politeness ; and yet I always knew that he had at his command a fearfully stern manner ; if occasion required , he could wrap himself in a thunder-cloud and make every look a dagger ; but I believe he never did this , except in what he considered cases of flagrant delinquency . He was quick to discover an overbearing spirit in others , and had as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people . A young man was sent to the Seminary at Andover , who not only made no profession of religion , but was said to have doubts in regard to the truth of Christianity , and withal had a severe and ungovernable temper . lie became a member of the institution by his father 's particular request , in the hope that he might be spiritually benefited by living in such an atmosphere , and the result was that he was really hopefully converted , and has since made a useful and somewhat distinguished minister . After he professed to hope that he had experienced a change of character , Dr. 41 * // Pearson undertook to examine him in regard to his Christian evidences , and one of the first questions he asked him was , whether he was able to keep in subjection that hitherto ungovernable temper . It was said that the answer he received was such as to show at least that grace had not had its perfect work . " - Vol . II . pp. 128 , 129 . Another example of comprehensive summary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . D. , of Riudge , N. H. , by Isaac Robinson , D. D. , of Stoddard . " He was a son of the Rev. Phillips Payson , who was a native of Dorchester ; was graduated at Harvard College in 1724 ; was ordained at Walpole , Mass. , September 16 , 1730 , and died January 22 , 1778 , at the age of seventy.four . He was a highly respectable and excellent minister . He published two Fast Sermons , occasioned by the war with Spain , 1741 . The son was born in September , 1758 . Little is now known respecting his early youth , except that he had a feeble constitution , and was subject to epilepsy , which threatened him with loss of reason , and premature death . He was , however , free from that malady during the greater part of his life , and enjoyed vigorous health till within less than a year of his death . In 1773 , he entered Harvard College and when he graduated , in 1777 , he received one of the highest honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Payson possessed much more than common abilities . His intellect was sharp and vigorous , his imaoination lively , and his memory highly retentive . His acquisitions were extensive and varied ; and there were few subjects on which he could not converse with intelligence , and no class of men that were not interested in listening to him . He was known as a distinguished civilian in New Hampshire , and for two years successively held a seat in the Senate of that State , and was regarded as one of the ablest of its members . But though he paid considerable attention to political economy and was somewhat in political life , yet theology was his favorite study and the ministry his favorite work . As his ideas were admirably arranged in his own mind , so he was able to communicate them to others with great clearness and force . His brethren in the ministry were always gratified and edified by his conversation . As a preacher , his reputation was deservedly high . His sermons were plain , luminous expositions of Divine truth , fitted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and impress the heart . He excelled especially in devotional exercises . Free alike from affectation , uniformity , and tedious repetition , his prayers were appropriate and impressive to a degree rarely surpassed . " - Vol . II . pp. 209 , 210. // A specimen of mingled eulogy and history occurs in the sketch attached to a familiar name among the elders . " Cotton Mather 's character was a strange mixture of strength and weakness , of desirable and undesirable qualities . It can not be doubted that the ruling passion of his life was for doing good His learning was probably more varied and extensive than that of any other person in America . Dr. Chauncy , who knew him well , pronounces him the greatest reader he ever knew ; and he seems to have remembered everything he read . He could despatch a folio of many hundred pages in the course of a morning ; and he wrote as well as read with almost unexampled rapidity . His library was larger than any other private library in America in his day . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote over his study door in capital letters , - BE SHORT . ' He was accustomed every morning to read a chapter of the Old Testament in Hebrew , and another in French , and a chapter of the New Testament in Greek . He was familiar with the Spanish and Iroquois languages , and published treatises in both . There were two books in which he wrote something every day ; one was his Quotidiana , in which he transcribed striking passages from the works that he read ; the other was his diary , in which he noted passing events , and especially his religious frames and feelings . " His publications amounted to three hundred and eighty-two . A large part of them were single sermons and other tracts ; but others were of considerable magnitude . The largest and most celebrated is his Magnalia Christi Americana , or the Ecclesiastical History of New England from its first Planting in 1625 , to the Year 1698 . ' " His habits of devotion and self-discipline were truly remarkable . The principle of association he turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he heard a clock strike , he would pray that he might so number his days as to apply his heart to wisdom . When he mended his fire , it was with a prayer that his love and zeal might be kindled into a flame . When at the table , looking on the gentlewoman that carved for the guests , he said to himself Lord , carve a rich portion of thy comforts and graces to that person . ' Looking on a gentlewoman stricken in years , Lord , adorn that person with the virtues which thou prescribest for aged women . ' So when he walked in the streets , he implored blessings upon those who passed by him . At the sight of a tall man , he said , Lord , give that man high attainments in Christianity . ' For a lame man , Lord , help that man to walk uprightly . ' For a negro , Lord , wash that poor soul ; // make him white by the washing of thy Spirit . ' For a very little man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a very old man , Lord , make him an old disciple , ' &amp;c. , &amp;c. , &amp;c . It appears from his diary that in one year he kept sixty fasts and twenty vigils ; and the whole number of days of fasting that he observed , as stated by his son in his funeral sermon , was four hundred and fifty . " - Vol . I. pp. 193 , 194 . These volumes are rich indeed in finished specimens of that difficult art which chooses the really elemental and constituent forces of character , and so portrays what culture has added to the gifts of nature , as not to confound the two or wrong either . The jumble of qualities which many modern biographies display shows that the authors do not understand their own work . We can not forbear transferring one picture of the death of a good man , partly to extend the acquaintance with so sweet a scene , and partly as a specimen of simple , impressive detail . It is that of Thomas Hooker , 1633 - 1647 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chelmsford in Essex , silenced by the " Spiritual Court " in 1630 , an exile in Holland three years . He fled from England in 1633 , and arrived at Boston in the autumn of that year . With admirable courage and enterprise , after two years and a half , he and a part of his flock - the Church in Cambridge - set out for the Connecticut , and reached Hartford in about a month . After eleven years ' service , " while he was yet in the midst of his usefulness , " he fell a victim to a violent epidemic . The death-scene , as drawn by Cotton Mather , is as follows - " In the time of his sickness , he did not say much to the standers-by ; but being asked that he would utter his apprehensions about some important things , especially about the state of New England , he answered , I have not that work now to do ; I have already declared the counsel of the Lord . ' And when one that stood weeping by his bedside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive the reward of all your labors , ' he replied , Brotber , I am going to receive mercy . ' At last he closed his eyes with his own hands , and gently stroking his own forehead , with a smile in his countenance , he gave a little groan , and so expired his blessed soul into the arms of his fellow-servants , the holy angels , on July 7 , 1647 . In which last hours , the glorious peace of soul which // he had enjoyed without any interruption for near thirty years together so gloriously accompanied him , that a worthy spectator , writing to Mr. Cotton a relation thereof , made this reflection : Truly , Sir , the sight of his death will make me have more pleasant thoughts of death than ever I yet had in my life . ' " - Vol . I. pp. 34 , 35 . With much approval we mention the notes , or the subsketches of persons incidentally named in the text . They contribute greatly to the completeness of the work , and alone would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they are priceless here , as the elements of future extended annals . This toil was assumed wholly by the author ; and , as a mere supplement , impresses the reader with the immense range of inquiry , personal knowledge , and tireless care he has expended on the work . We have been tempted to call this feature a specimen of that not uncommon afterthought of authorship which is sometimes found to be the master-thought in the real worth of a book . We have known a foot-note , of very harmless intentions , to raise a tempest of popular concern , while the discourse or treatise to which it was appended would have gone to speedy oblivion , had not the note held it back to serve as a finger-post to its own locality . Not that in any such sense Dr. Sprague 's notes hold the vitality of this work ; but so far as his skill and assiduity are at stake , they are rather his best pledges . We beg that the next edition may have a special index-table of the names in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained in them , and there is now no special guide to them . Another eminent merit of the Annals is the lists of publications left by the persons they commemorate . These lists bring to us the themes of thought , and outline for us the grand thought-work of the generations along which they lie . The titles of the pamphlets and books of any period are a forcible record of what the men of that period were meditating , - of what subjects and interests engaged the mind and study of their times . These now too Sibylline leaves hold the wisdom , faith , and spiritual portraiture of those gone before us . They are a species of transcript from the life-journal of their respective spheres of duty . If these // lists were gathered out of the Annals into a special catalogue , they would form a priceless index temporum , a choice portfolio of the minds and hearts producing them , and also of the opinions , dogmas , studies , and acquirements of the days in which they were written . The extent and apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honors of this masterly labor . Another quality to be spoken of is the incessant glimpses of forgotten literature and biography found here . Books long ago passed from the knowledge of most men are continually reappearing by extracts or references ; not only reminding the reader of their existence , but , by the often striking selections from them , inviting him to seek them out for further perusal . It was a characteristic saying of Chalmers , that " a great part of learning is to know where learning can be found . " Preeminently is it so , in relation to such learning as these Annals are filled with . It is a praiseworthy service to this class of letters , to point us to the chambers , closets , and garrets in which so much of the knowledge vital to a just judgment of our ecclesiastical past is hidden . More difficult than in most books we have dealt with have we here found it to keep the author fully in sight . He is but a man , and though of special interest to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us persons attractive from all the diversity of traits which men admire in one another , we continually forget the one living man in the multitude of famous and revered dead to whom he introduces us . And this has put us upon picturing the subjects of his pious toil as a long gallery , - all living , - in all their characteristic activities , busy in their sacred spheres . What a company ! When had the world , in the same space , such a group of men ? What other generations ever wore such jewels as these ? Name a characteristic which the Christian world accounts as deserving fame , and number the examples which illustrate it , from among these . What style of heroism , of moral and manly courage , has not been exemplified , - what dignity not adorned , - what devotion , what self-denial and self-sacrifice , not equalled ? What genius , scholarship , eloquence , power in argument , force in appeal , felicity in persua // sion , charm in private virtues and personal excellences , finds not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Survey the royal procession : the feet of the earliest ranks bathed by the surf of Massachusetts Bay , the footprints of the later ones midway ahross the Continent . Is not all their way radiant , - the path that " shineth more and more unto the perfect day " ? Consider the forces proceeding from this noble line of men , outward upon society . What examples of the faith that overcomes ; of singleness of heart and fervor of hope , which no temptations or trials could pervert or quench ; of perception and power in philosophy , waiting yet to be matched by any school or master ; of a love of learning which patiently planted the lands with schools ; of a warmth of religious zeal which tamed the rude Indian , and made him a pupil of the Divine Word in his own almost unconquerable speech , and which devised plans by which missionaries of the Gospel have been sent into almost every tribe of the race ? Where , we ask , were such forces of character ever shown by any equal number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; stopping a moment now and then , as some striking eminence or winning grace comes to view , - the masterly Robinson , the apostolic Eliot , the learned Hooker , the erudite iVilathers , the seraphic Shepard , the eccentric Moodys , the subtile Edwards , the classic Stiles , the dialectic Eminons , the serenely philosophic Woods , the scholar-Christian , Bela B. Edwards ; and , of youthful fame , the laborious John King Lord , ending his glowing life at thirty years , and the cultured , engaging William Bradford Homer , gaining in his twenty-four years of Christian loveliness a rank among scholars , a hold upon hearts which twice his lifetime will not loosen , and the tribute of one of the choicest memoirs extant from the pen of his revered teacher and fervent friend , Professor Park . In a letter near the close of the last volume , from Professor Huntington , concerning this gifted youth , there is another name mentioned , which , though not found in the index , claims a word from our personal affection , Henry J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him gifted in mind , - touched with fervors of sensibility , a Christian-poet flame , before which his // life fell an early prey . " His soul was all quick , " says the friendly letter which introduces him to this volume . The sentence is a true epitome of the character . These beloved and precious young men fitly close this remarkable group . The world , we think , will be slow to turn their eyes from them . Strong persuasions draw us to bear them in reverent and affectionate remembrance . One of our most eminent scholars has written , " If we cut ourselves off from the past , we shall be disowned in the future . " Such annals as these , beyond any work short of elaborate history , join us to the past , and teach us how to win a remembrance from the future . The powers of our life are too frail , its day too short , to complete any career so as to be worthy of remembrance , unless we bring from the past wisdom , impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be transferred from one generation to another . This neglected , there inevitably results a barren , unshapen existence , lacking the friendly fruitage of a reverent , generous knowledge of men , and sympathy with them . These defects justly diminish our merit in the eye of our contemporaries , and provoke the future to judge , that , as we made no account of those who were ancestors to us , we can have little claim on those to whom we in turn are ancestors . Moreover , we justly owe the future a debt for the past . The services of those who went before us are a claim on us payable to those who shall succeed us . Yet further , unless we carefully gather the rills and streams descending from events of earlier times , they soon will be choked and buried by the digging and piling of this age of pickaxes and spades ; and so our neglect will not only rob us of the benefits of such recollections , but will also preclude our wiser posterity from reaching them . Each generation must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the stream of history can have no sure and even flow . We are bound by historic gratitude to gather with care the res gestw of ancestors , and to leave them within the reach of those to whom we shall yield place . We mentioned it gratefully , that no department of American public life , excepting perhaps that of the early fathers of the Revolution , has more faithful record than the clerical ; and // perhaps in point of influence and of positive public efficiency , through the earlier periods at least , this was the foremost profession . We are persuaded , however , that a similar service to this of Dr. Sprague would be a memorable benefit to the other commonly styled " professions . " We should fervently welcome " annals " of the lawyers and of the physicians of our country . We think that a substantial and friendly buttress of the merited reputation and influence of these professions would be built up by such works . Scores of the incidents in practice , which attach public confidence and interest to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the current conversation , and gradually grow into impressive traditions . Vastly better for preserving the lawful but criminally abused reputation of classes of men exposed to a certain kind and measure of popular prejudice would such a mode be , than the style of indignant and retaliatory vindication now so often resorted to . Are there not members of these professions fitted by a devout love to their calling , by generous care for the honors of it , and by position and acquirement , to bestow such a fundamental and permanent benefit upon their brethren ? Would it not be as truly a professional service , thus to rescue the excellent names , once adorning each of these walks of public duty , in much of their living lustre , from the oblivion which is speedily hiding them , as it would be to push a little further the boundaries of mere technical learning ? But what can be done in this behalf should be done at once ; for forgetfulness of what is good and great seems often to come on men , as night between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down these volumes thankfully . We are thankful to that Divine Providence which endowed our earliest and latter periods with such men . There is pledge and prophecy in such a favor to any nation . They were a " royal generation . " Theirs was a character which must more or less perpetuate itself . A good man is , in a sense , self-multiplying . An inherent vitality belongs to him , reproducing his image in descendants . We are thankful to the author . The literature of the country has in these Annals , and will have in their completion , an // original treasury of the very elements of national growth and permanence . It is not a piece of work on a pattern set by older and abler communities ; not in any sense a specimen of the imitation literature of which we have sometimes the malcredit . It is an original , unique , and purely national book of Annals , which can not fail to bear the author 's name in affectionate honors to a distant posterity .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
