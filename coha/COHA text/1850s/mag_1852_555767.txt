London : William Pickering . 1851. 8vo. pp. 128 . THE most distinguishing characteristic of the literature of the present age is the attention which it bestows to that portion of society which is generally called " the lower classes . " No one , comparing the literature of even fifty years ago with that of to-day , can fail to notice the great difference in this respect . A kindlier , more generous spirit , a deeper , more earnest feeling , have begun to be manifested . The relations between man and man are now more fully recognized , the common ties of human sympathy binding together the highest and the lowest are now more readily acknowledged , the rights of the ignorant and the suffering are now more warmly asserted , and the duties of all classes towards each other are now more strongly urged . From the folio report to the novel , the essay , and the poem , the claims of labor and the laborer are set forth with various power , but with a single object . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , and the masters of the thought of the world , each in his own way , and with his own best arms , engaged in this struggle // against the evils and unhappiness of earth . It is the visible sign of the influence of the spirit of Christianity , and the progress of Christian principles . While so many of the foundations upon which men have built their hopes for the advance of the world are crumbling away , the existence of this spirit in literature affords a ground of encouragement which can not be shaken . But it is , as it were , only the dawning of the day , not the full light of morning . The wisdom and the truth which is contained in these hooks must be turned by other hands into practical action . The hooks will have been written in vain , the deepest , most earnest thoughts will be worthless , unless we who read them , and are stirred by their power , contrive to gain from them the inducement and the method of personal exertion . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for those beneath him in the world ; and there is no one who , if he neglects this little something , is able to furnish any better plea than that of elfishness ; for the excuse of ignorance will not avail . The books whose titles stand at the head of this article , are illustrations of the amount and character of the thought which is now given to lessening the inequalities in the condition of men . But it is not as literary productions that they claim our attention . It is on account of the suggestions which they contain in regard to what may be done to raise the condition and character of the poor , that they chiefly deserve our interest . In America , at this time , any such suggestions are of great , almost preeminent importance . The lower classes here , as in the old world , are the dangerows classes . The danger from them may differ in amount and in development , but it is the same in character . The very blessings of peace and prosperity which we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase it . They have led us to look at the established order of things as so fixed and stable as hardly to be separated from the course of nature . But this is no time for such a delusion . Even now , there is fear lest the sea of ignorance which lies around us , swollen by the wave of misery and vice which is pouring from revolutionized Europe upon our shores , should overflow the dikes of liberty and justice , and sweep away the most precious of our institutions . // The relief of the misery of the poor is the object to which our most earnest efforts should be given . As disciples of Christ , as lovers of our country , as men , we can not refuse them . And in order that they may be effectual , in order to avoid a perpetual round of increasing evils and unavailing remedies , we must begin at the very foundation ; we must labor to prevent . The prevention of pauperism is the end to be sought for . And it is a fact which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a true social economy , that to prevent pauperism at any cost is better for a community than the care of it after it exists . As men are not always to be addressed through the highest feelings , as religion and justice are often less powerful over their hearts than habit and selfishness , it is fortunate that it can easily be proved , that , besides the injury that is done to God 's work , man , by allowing him to become a pauper , there is also an injury to the community which may be reckoned in money . It could also be shown , by taking the result of a series of years , that , whatever might be the sum expended in preventing pauperism , the amdunt would be more than returned to the community in the services which it had created . It is not , indeed , to be disguised , that , as society is at present organized , with unjust inequalities on every side , and yet with no remedy obvious , it is utterly impossible to hope to extinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and manifestly one which contains the seed of many blessings ; and while poverty exists as God 's dispensation , pauperism may follow as the result of men 's arrangements . But because , in the present imperfect state of social institutions , we can not look to preventing it altogether , there is the stronger reason for doing the much that may be done to diminish it . So much , indeed , is to be done , that often we may feel the feebleness of our means , and be ready to take counsel of despair as to the hopelessness of our efforts . But the greatness of the work is to serve not for a discouragement , but for an incitement . As has been well said , " A difficulty is a thing to be overcome . " Delay will not increase our strength , and every day 's delay but makes the toil more hard . Our little performance is to be measured , not by what might be done , but by what we could do ; and though , with all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , that one is cleared from the path of the next corner . From these general reflections , let us come to the consideration of some of the special provisions which are to he adopted in furtherance of this great end . Recognizing that something must he done , let us see what may he best effected ; and feeling the smallness of our means in comparison with the need , let us examine how to apply them to the greatest advantage . We must begin by putting out of our heads all desire for originality , all half-formed expectations of serving our own vanity or worldliness under the cloak of benevolence . XVe must he prepared to follow in straight and trodden paths . We are to deal with society as it exists , and we must dismiss all fancies , however alluring . We may hope for the regeneration of society ; we must secure its improvement . In the very front rank of the practical measures for the prevention of pauperism stands the improvement of the dwellings of the poor . It is upon this that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend for their success . The subject has excited comparatively little attention in this country , but it would he difficult to place its importance too high . The character of a population depends upon the nature of its habitations . " I have studied , " says M. Blanqui , whose authority is not to be questioned , " I have studied with a religious anxiety the domestic life of a large number of the work people , and I am bold to affirm , that the unhealthiness and wretched condition of their dwellings is the primary source of all the misery , of all the vices , of all the calamities of their social existence . There is no reform whatsoever that so highly deserves the attention and devotion of the friends of humanity . It is by that they must begin . Other improvements will flow from that as a natural source - without it , all others will be useless and inefficient . The moral character of a working family is almost without exception to be guaged by the character of their dwelling . " * Virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or disease . There is a fixed relation between cornfort and morality , and there is a terrible positive connection // between physical and spiritual degradation . When one accustomed to all the comforts and luxuries of easy life enters into one of the low , disgusting haunts of poverty , he feels how little of what is best in him could long withstand the assaults of misery ; he learns for how much he has to thank God , and he acknowledges that his blessings are but the measure of his responsibilities . No imaginary picture can be drawn equal in horror to the realities which the dwellings of the poor present . The details are in all places the same . The accounts of foreign cities , which we have shuddered at when reading them , are reproduced , with little alleviation , in life in our own . In houses built upon close alleys , where the sun never shines , and where the stagnant air is filled with exhalations from accumulated filth ; in cellars dark , wet , rotting , stifling , - are the homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pervade every thing ; there are no accom* modations for the decencies of life ; a huddled crowd of men , women , and children herd together like brutes . The very ideas of neatness , of prudence , of sobriety , of chastity , of self-respect , are lost . The passions are early roused , and are subjected to no restraint . Misery seeks a short forgetfulness of itself in the gratification of sensual desires . The affections are stunted ; the natural instincts become the guides of life . And in the hearts of our cities swollen with prosperity , within sound of our boasts of progress and songs of happiness , exists a people more brutal than the savages whom Givilization has never approached. * * In a " Report of the Committee on Internal Health , " made to the City Government of Boston in 1849 , in speaking of the " wretched , dirty , and unhealthy condition of a great number of the dwelling-houses occupied by the Irish population , " it is said , " These houses , for the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by two or three families ; hut each room , from garret to cellar , is filled with a family consisting of several , persons , and sometimes with two or more families . The consequence is an excessive population wholly disproportinned to the space or the accommodations . In such a state of things there can be no cleanliness , privacy , or p roper ventilation . . . . In Broad street and all the surroundin , , neighborhood . . . the situation of the Irish in these respects is particularly wretched . During their visits last summer , your committee were witnesses of scenes too painful to be forgotten , and too disgusting to he related here . It is sufficient to say , that this whole district is a perfect hive of human beings , without comforts , and mostly without common necessaries . . . " The houses above alluded to are also insufficiently provided with the necessary in and out-of-door conveniences which are required in every dwelling-place . The great mass of them , particularly in the region last referred to , have but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , as is frequently the case , into a passage-way or street , and but one privy , usually a mass of pollution , for // The means of remedying this state of things do not lie , as some might assert , with the poor themselves . They could not , if they would , help themselves . " The poor , " says Dr. Southwood Smith , " can by no prudence or foresight on their part avoid the dreadful evils to which they are exposed . " The circumstances that surround them inevitably produce sickness , improvidence , and recklessness . The long exposure to a poisoned atmosphere gradually destroys the s* ) ring and elasticity of life . Fever wastes the strength of body and of spirit ; and at last , the very impulse and hope of improvement die out . The remedy for these evils must come from others than the immediate sufferers . It must come from the action of the public authorities , and from the efforts of benevolent societies and of private individuals . all the inhabitants , sometimes amounting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prtvy . " In Half Moon Place The houses are built around an area from which air is almost totally excluded by the perpendicular wall of Fort Hill on one side , and the high houses of Broad Street on the other . A large part of the area is occupied by some twelve or fourteen privies constantly , overflowing , and by ill-constructed and worn-out sinks and drains , into which are hourly thrown solid substances , which choke them up and cause the liquid parts mixed with them to run over . " - Boston City Document , No. 66 , December , 1549 , pp 12- 14 . The City Physician 's Report , accompanying that of the Committee , contained details not less horrible . He says , " The plan which is given of a triple cellar would scarcely be believed to represent a reality by those unacquainted with some of these localities . " - . . " The third , a dungeon six feet square , and the same in height , with no aperture for the admission of air , save the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate boarders . The landlord said the tide came through the floor of his rooms but rarely ! - . . One cellar was reported by the police to be occupied nightly as a sleeping apartment , by thirty-nine persons . In another , the tide had risen so high that it was necessary to approach the bedside of a patient by means of a plank , which was laid from one stool to another ; while the dead body of an infant was actually sailing about the room in its coffin . " - pp. 172 , 173 . In March , 1850 , a census of the inhabited cellars in the City of New York was made by the Chief of Police . 8 , t4t cellars were found to be occupied by 18,456 persons , who had no other rooms . One twentieth of the population of the city lived under grottnd . The proportion is probably nearly the same in Boston . From the account of this census published in the New York Tribune , June 13th , 1850 , we quote the following passages - " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear , and very few of them have any opening except into the main room . Without air , without light , filled with damp vapor from the mudewed walls , and with vermin , they are the most repulsive holes that ever a human being was forced to sleep in . " . . . " There are cellars devoted entirely to lodging , where straw at two cents , and bare floor at one cent a night can be had . . . . Black and white , men , women , and children , are mixed in one dirty tnass . Scenes of depravity the most horrible are of constant occurrence . " We might fill our pages with more of these sickening details ; but we have quoted enough to show the character and extent of misery which exists among the poor in our cities . For , let it not be forgotten , these accounts are of our own most flourishing , most Christian cities . What a frightful contrast is this misery to our refinements , our delicacies , and our luxuries ! 40* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public authorities . The end of municipal government , as of every other govern ment , is the promotion of the welfare of the people under its charge . The rights of all classes are equal before it , and its duties in relation to every individual are the same . Its interference in any private concerns is to be deprecated , when the interests of the individual and of society coincide ; . but when those interests differ , the government becomes unjust and partial , unless it interferes to bring them again into mutual harmony . In cases of such interference , however , there is often much private opposition , and much foolish talk about the danger of a government invading the rights of property . But this is a danger little to be feared , in comparison with that which comes from guarding the assumed and fancied rights of property too jealously . And , moreover , whatever be the rights of property , they weigh nothing against the rights of humanity . Nor is the interest of an individual to be set off against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erect an establishment , which should bring him in a rich return upon his outlay , but which , from some neglect on his part , should be the source of continual expense and suffering to all the neighbors ; - no one would doubt that the government of the place ought to interfere to compel him to remedy the defect , - no government would hesitate to do it . Now this is a parallel case to that of the dwellings of the poor : Houses in all respects unfitted for their abode ; the very living in which produces loss of money , of health , and of life to the occupants ; and whose polluting vicinity is the cause of disease through the neighborhood , - such houses are let out by individuals as a source of large profits to themselves . A case of murder by violence is at once investigated , and its perpetrator punished . Murder by slow torture is going on every day in houses in our own cities , and no one recks or interferes . This is no figure of speech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More than half the deaths which occur in these houses iire from preventable causes . Who is to answer for this ? * * It was shown , in the North American Review , No . CLII. , for July , 1851 , that the mortality in the healthy district of Boston was not over 1.80 per cent. , while in the unhe*ithy district it was 5.65 per cent . A most appalling difference . // It is not to be demanded of the government , that they should provide suitable homes for the poor ; but it is to be demanded of them , that they should see to it that the houses occupied by the poor should be rendered compatible with health , decency , and morality . No violent or alarming measures are called for ; no measures which would shift a burden from one class of the community upon another , are needed to carry this object into effect . A system of inspec-. lion and regulation of the dwellings of the poor should be organized under the municipal authorities , which should secure such alterations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abodes unfit for any human creature . Suitable means of ventilation and drainage , a proper supply of water , the arrangements necessary for health and decency , should be provided in every case . And , in addition to this , regulations in regard to the number of occupants in each building should be established and enforced . The proprietors of the estates should , whenever it was possible , he forced to make these arrangements at their own cost , - and in case of their refusal , or of any other difficulty , the estate itself should be held liable for the payment . Nor would it be a small benefit from this just exercise of authority , that the owners of the property thus improved would be taught that their own interests and those of their tenant&amp; are , to a certain extent , identical . There can be little doubt that the value of the property would be increased , in a majority of cases , proportionately to the outlay upon it . The selfishness of men is always short-sighted . Extortion always cheats itself. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this plan , and neither of them is such as would be advanced by those who properly feel the importance of the matter , or appreciate the responsibilities which rest upon them in relation to it . They might both , consequently , be disregarded ; but the answers to them are short and conclusive . The first might be , that , to carry out such a system would involve considerable expense . There can be no doubt that *E A plan similar to the above was strongly urged by the Committee on Internal Health , in the Report from which we have quoted . It is a disgrace to the city of Boston that such a recommendation should have been so long unattended to . // this would be the case ; hut it should be remembered that this expense would result in a great saving . Diminish the misery of the homes of the poor , and crime is lessened , sickness is lessened , pauperism is lessened . The jails and the courts , the hospitals and the almshouses , would show the economy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer , even in fancy , such objections as this ; - as if money were worth more than justice - as if the riches of a people were to be reckoned by its hoarded heaps of gold . The plea of the expense of doing right will not be listened to at the bar of Heaven . The other , and more suitable , objection to which we have referred , might be that such a system involved insurmountable difficulties , and that it would be impossible to carry it into execution . This is an argument to which every new plan of improvement is exposed . Fortunately it is without force in this case , for a measure similar to the one now proposed has been adopted in several cities on the continent of Europe , and has been attended with the most beneficial results . An account of a Report on this subject , of the College of Mayor and Sheriff* , to the Communal Council of Brussels , is given in a recent pamphlet by Dr. Gavin . " By the revival of an old law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwellings , which has been most minute in its applications , and most serviceable in its results . " The tabular returns of the improvements effected , show that no part of a dwelling , or of the conveniences necessarily attached to a dwelling , have been disregarded ; but that a wise and prudent humanity has stepped in to regulate the condition of all those structural arrangements which are comprehended in a healthful dwelling . " It is most satisfactory to find in the report referred to , that , of 2,020 houses , of which 1,355 were in alleys , or cul-de-sacs , only sixteen houses , nine rooms , two garrets , a third floor , and a part of a house , have been interdicted as unfit for human habitations ; while only five houses and a part of a house required to be demolished on account of their dilapidation and resulting danger . " Two only of the proprietors to whom delay was accorded , in order to complete the required works , refused to do any thing ; and only three properties required to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised by the proprietors voluntarily effecting the required works . " It is calculated from this statement , allowing a population of eleven to each house , that of 22,220 persons who were living in houses which required works of some kind to put them into a habitable condition , 21,957 derived the advantages contemplated by the law , and 263 were displa6ed from habitations incompatible with healthy existence , or manifestly unfit for human habitation. " * Having thus briefly considered what is to be done by the public authorities , it remains to be shown what may best be effected by benevolent associations . A preliminary and most important consideration in regard to this point is , that nothing should be undertaken by an association simply as a matter of gratuitous charity , or as an affair in which benefits are to be conferred without a corresponding return . The good ends of charity are most surely gained by avoiding all interference with the usual laws which govern men 's dealings with each other . They will necessarily follow the exercise of justice and good judgment . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferring apparent favors , is dangerous and deceitful . To establish a society on charitable grounds alone , would be injurious in two ways ; it would excite unnecessary opposition on the part of those interested in preserving the existing state of things , and it would tend , ( and it is most important to guard against this , ) to diminish the self-reliance and self-respect of those receiving its aid . The special objects which an Association for the improvement of the homes of the poor might hold in view , would be the directing of public attention to the pressing nature of the subject ; the guiding of individual exertion to the same end , by the erection of buildings as models ; the purchasing and altering , or destroying unfit dwellings ; and the obtaining and letting out pieces of ground " to individual builders upon conditions compelling the desired structural arrangements . " The experience of the " Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes " in London , is a guaranty of the beneficence of such undertakings . This society was * " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 91. t See " The Claims of Labour , " p. 234 . This excellent hook was written by the author of " Friends in Gouncil , " and " Gompanions of my Solitude . " Like all his books , it is distinguished by generous feeling , wise and liberal thought , and grate of style . // founded in 1844 , and has directed its chief attention to " the arranging and executing Plans as Models for the Improvernent of the Dwellings of the Labouring Classes . " The establishments now belonging to it in London are seven in number , and consist of houses variously fitted to accommodate men , women , and families . In the Seventh Annual Report of the Committee , presented in July , 1851 , it is stated , - * * the whole of their buildings have been full for many months past . 2 . That the rents continue to he paid with great regularity . 3 . That the health of the inmates is excellent . " * The Earl of Shaftesbury , ( better known as Lord Ashley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society , at their last annual meeting , said , - " The return on the whole property is equal to about 4 per cent . on the land ; and on the buildings , fittings , and furniture , of about 6* per cent . Now , observe we have thereby proved what we undertook to prove , that in works of this kind we would carry into effect no eleemosynary principle , no mere matter of charity ; we would make it an affair of business , instigated , it is tr ue , and governed by a sound and solemn principle , but one that , between man and man , should be purely a matter of business . " t Now , really , I must impress upon this meeting , more and more , as the result of growing experience , the absolute and the indispensable necessity , if you wish to do permanent good to your people , and if you wish to enable them to do per . manent good to themselves , to direct your unremitting attention to the condition of their dwellings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shafteshury has stated clearly the principle upon which such works as these should rest . The Society has not attempted to lower the price , hut to improve the quality of the dwellings ; and , while providing the necessities and some of the comforts of life for its tenants , to receive in return from them a just percentage on its outlay . It has established proper relations between its tenants and itself , and it has shown the feasibility of such works , as affording a fair employment for capital . There exists no reason why the same results should not be obtained in this country . In 1846 , the establishment of a Society for the * The Labourer 's Friend , July , 1851 , p. 106. 1 " There is no private interest in the matter . By the charter which has been granted , whatever profits may accrue , must be directed to the extension of the system and the designs of the Society . ' // improvement of the dwellings of the poor was strongly urged in an excellent Report of a Committee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Poor . One of the conclusions arrived at in this Report was , " that property invested in well-constructed and well-situated houses , to be leased to the poorer classes of tenants by the apartment , and by the week , is as safe as any other real estate , excepting the very best , and far more so than the average . " * Another most striking and happy result from the works of the London Society , has been the general health of the occupants of their buildings , in comparison with that of the neighborhood . Mr. Grainger , an officer of the Board of Health , makes the following statement . " From the evidence I have received , it appears , that , in six out of seven of these establishments , including the Lodging Houses for Single Men , and containing about 957 persons , there has not been a single case of typhus since they were opened whilst in the Metropolitan Buildings , which have been opened upwards of three years , and have an average population of 550 , there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a total of 1,507 persons , one case only of typhus has occurred since these institutions were provided specially to test the value of sanitary arrangements . Now , ' he adds , just look , for the sake of illustration , - if the 1,507 of the working population of the model buildings , several of which are situated in the most crowded and unhealthy parts of London , and where , as in Church Lane , fever prevails , be contrasted with the Working population of Liverpool , about sixty cases of low fever ought to have occurred annually ; and yet there is but one case from the beginning . ' " The Laborer 's Friend , July , 1851 , p. 101 . The moral good effects resulting from these houses have been not less remarkable than the physical . It is hardly necessary to detail them here . The evidence is of the strongest character , and the testimony is invariable . Such are the general results which have followed the workings of this Society ; * results full of encouragement , and * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations in England , and particularly the Metropolitan Association for the Improvement of the Dwellings of the Industrious Classes , have engaged in the same work , and their efforts have been attended with the same success . In Paris , " La Soci*t4 des Cite*s Ouvrii3res , " has lately been established for the purpose of building improved Lodging Houses for the Poor . In this country , attempts have been made by benevolent individuals wiLh the same design , but nothing has been done on a large scale . // amply sufficient to prove the advantage which would accompany the establishment of similar associations in our own cities . The details of the plan of work must vary in each locality according to its peculiar demands ; but the same general principles must regulate every attempt to improve the condition of the poor in this respect , wherever made . Some of the more important principles of construction which have been adopted by the London Society , and which are of universal application , are given by Mr. Henry Roberts , the honorary architect of the Society , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labouring classes , the most rigid economy of arrangement , consistent with accommodation sufficiently spacious to be convenient and healthy , and the utmost attention to cheapness of construction , consistent with durability and comfort , are essential elements of a really good and suitable plan . The architect should bear in mind , that the rents which the working classes usually pay , though exorbitantly high for the wretched accommodation afforded them , will only just yield a fair return for the outlay on buildings constructed for their express use , and fitted up with all the conveniences which it is desirable they should possess . Any expenditure on unnecessary accommodation , which involves an increase of rent beyond that usually paid by the occupants of such a class of dwellings , appears to be at least hazardous , and may jeopardize the whole or a portion of the interest to be fairly expected from the investment .

To secure ventilation there must be a free circulation of air ; a sufficient number and size of openings , and adequate height of the rooms , which I should fix at not less ' than seven feet six inches to eight feet ; in town buildings I have allowed nine feet from floor to floor . The number and area of the apartments should be in proportion to the probable number of occupants ; where intended for families there should , as a general rule , be not fewer than three sleeping apartments , each with a distinct and independent access ; no other arrangement can secure a due separation of the sexes . The living room ought not to contain less than 140 feet to 150 feet superficial , and the parents ' bed room should at least measure about 100 feet superficial . In the latter , as a provision for sickness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room an opening for the escape of vitiated air ought to be made near the ceiling , especially in the smaller bedrooms for children , where there is no fireplace . " - pp. 4 , 5 . In our cities , model dwellings for families are more needed than any others ; and owing to the peculiar character of our poor population , to the high value of ground , and to the desirableness of putting the homes of laborers near their places of work , it will be found necessary to erect buildings which , while covering a small space , may accommodate a large number of occupants . The following plans and details , copied from one of the late publications of the Society , show what has been done in London to meet these wants , and may afford suggest ions applicable to our circumstances . " Of the several examples of improved dwellings for the Laboring Classes undertaken by the Society , the most important is that of a Model Building to accommodate a large number of families , on a plan adapted to situations where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited space . . . " In undertaking to provide in one pile of building for the The Model Houses for Families in Streatham Street , Bloomsbury . // 0 -i 0 r GEORGE STREET . VA *A E*ET. // accommodation of a large number of families , amongst the most important considerations has beea that of preserving the domes. tic privacy and independence of each distinct family , and so disconnecting their apartments as effectually to prevent the communication of contagious diseases ; this , it will be seen on a reference to the plan , is accomplished by dispensing altogether with separate staircases , and other internal communications between the different stories , and by adopting one common open staircase leading into galleries or corridors , open on one side to a spacious quadrangle , and on the other side having the outer doors of the several tenements , the rooms of which are protected from draught by a small entrance lobby . The galleries are supported next the quadrangle by a series of arcades , each embracing two stories in height , and the slate floors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the enclosure railing . One tenement or set of apartments , with their appropriate fittings , comprise all the conveniences requisite for a well-ordered family ; and in addition to the sleeping rooms , provision is made for an enclosed bed in the closet out of the living room. * " The nature of the foundation requiring excavation to a considerable depth , a basement story has been formed with a range of well-lighted and ventilated apartments . A wash-house and bath are provided for the common use of the tenants , under the control of the Superintendent or Keeper , for whom an office is placed near the public entrance . To him is also intrusted the retailing of coal at moderate prices . " The question of rendering the building fire-proof had much consideration , and the plan finally adopted secures this important object , as well as prevents the communication of sound , and all percolation of water between the several floors .

The arrangement of the building is such as to render the floor and roof arches a continued series of abutments to each other , excepting at the extremities , where they are tied in with seven eighths inch iron rods , secured to stone or cast iron springers . With peculiar satisfaction it may be stated , that the extra cost of the fire-proof construction beyond that with the ordinary combustible floors and roof , did not amount to one per cent . on the contract of ? 7370 , for the entire pile of building . " The income derived from this building , at very moderate // rates of charge , varying from 4s. to 6s. , and in three cases 7s. a week for a set of rooms , yields a return on the amount of outlay amply sufficient to encourage investments in similar undertakings , - a point quite essential to the success of a model intended for general adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the reach of a society , of effecting great good by attention to this most urgent necessity , we hardly need add that such possibilities are not to be thrown away .

Such possibilities come to us directly from the hand of God ; as we receive them , they turn to blessings or to curses . We pass now to a topic intimately connected with the improvement of the homes of the poor , the education of their children . In the consideration of the means of preventing pauperism , these two subjects can not be dissociated . We have hitherto been accustomed to regard our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sufficiently recognized its defects ; we have not enough considered that , excellent as it is in many respects , it yet leaves the class most needing instruction wholly uncared for . The reports that are made from year to year of the increase of juvenile vagrancy and depravity among us , are terribh* proofs of its incompleteness . A remedy must be found and applied to this growing evil , or the dangerous classes will daily become more dangerous ; and for this we shall have no one to reproach but ourselves , and our neglect will , in accordance with the inevitable laws of God for this world , bring its own retribution . The same general moral and economical arguments , which have been urged in relation to the improvement of the homes of the poor , apply with equal force to the question of their education . Others of a similar character belong exclusively to it . We spend large sums to secure the benefits of education to our community ; but so long as any class does not receive instruction , so long the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain by this expense . While any persons who might have been educated remain ignorant , the state is exposed to the evils which it has desired to prevent . The ignorance of a few may produce evil effects destructive to the happiness and prosperity of many . The good from educating a hundred may be counterbalanced by the evil from neglecting five . But even were there no danger to the community from leaving an ignorant class in its midst , the chief motive and the true principle of effort for the education of all would remain the same . Every human being is in possession of a boundless , immortal capability of happiness . Many are unable to procure for themselves in this world the means of making that capability a reality ; the means must be supplied 41* // to them by others , or the work which God has appointed , and which Christ has exemplified , is left undone on earth . The difficulties which lie in the way of properly educating the very poor , are numerous and peculiar . No system which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In England , the results which have been arrived at from the establishment by individuals of " Ragged Schools , " and in France by the public support of " Salles d'Asile , " have been of the best nature . These attempts seem to have successfully overcome the chief obstacles before them , and they afford examples well suited to our wants . In the little treatise on the " Philosophy of Ragged Schools , " whose title stands at the head of this article , the system of these institutions is clearly developed. * Our school system offers the benefit of education to all who may apply for it ; but for those who are too poor , too neglected , too ignorant , too wilful , or too idle to seek its advantages , it makes no provision.t Now it is to be remembered that what we technically call education is , in fact , but a very small part of the education of life . The circumstances by which a child is surrounded are what form his character , that is , are his education . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily moulded , and it is then that the hitter experiences of want , sickness , and unkindness are , for the most part , the lot of the young children of the poorest classes . The example of vice is often their daily lesson , and they grow up ignorant of their duties as well as of the necessary consequences of their conduct . They are children , but with little of the innocence , and still less of the happiness , of childhood . * This essay is one of a series of " Small Books on Great Subjects , edited by a few Well-wishers to Knowledge . " In its little compass it contains much wisdom . It is the work of a man of no ordinary liberality and grasp of mind . t The present efficient City Marsbal of Boston , Mr. Francis Tukey , in a report made in 1849 counted the number of truant and vagrant children , between the ages of six and sixteen , in the city , at 1066 . He said , ( and repeated the same statement in 1851 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , from eight to nine hundred ( from neglect and bad habits ) are not fit to enter any of our present schools . From the best information which 1 can obtain , I am satisfied that the whole number in the city at the present time , ( including the above number , ) is not less than 1500 of the same class as those described . " And I earnestly call your attention to them , and the necessity of providing some means to have these children properly brought up , either at public or private expense ; for I am satisfied that it wil I cost the State and City more for police , courts , and prisons , if they are suffered to go at large , than it would to take them now , maintain them , and make them useful citizens . " - Journal of the Society for the Prevention of Pauperism , No . II . p. 36. // In order to counteract the evil effects of this state of things , it is necessary to adopt such means as will insure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which they are naturally exposed , and shall receive other education than that which comes from their condition . Schools such as the youngest may attend , must be established on such a system as to secure their attendance . As the ignorant have little regard for long-delayed , ultimate advantages , as their imaginations are often too blunted to recognize any good except that which is immediate , it follows , that , in order to gain the interest of parents , and to insure the attendance of children , some positive immediate advantage should be seen to be connected with the schools . In Paris , this necessity is admirably met by the " Salles d'asile . " They are established for the sake of protecting early childhood from abandonment and neglect , and from the accidents of all sorts to which it is exposed . They are designed , also , for the cultivation of the growing intelligence , and for the religious and moral instruction of children from two to seven years old . The style of teaching is simple , and fitted , by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A meal is daily given to the children , and perhaps more than one . " The salles d'asiie are under the inspection of a committee of ladies , to whom the warmest thanks are due , since , from the moment that the municipal administration took charge of these establishments , they have watched over them with a zeal and care which have never for a moment relaxed . . . Their functions are not confined to the watching over the intellectual and moral state of the pupils ; they hear from the chiefs of the establishment , all the wants , not only of the children , in regard to clothing , but also of those of the parents who may be in extreme poverty . Not unfrequently , these ladies themselves carry their benevolent assistance to the homes of the wretched . These salles d'asile ' are among the most useful and popular institutions of.our time . . . . . If public benevolence , ' adds M. Fr*gier , from whose account the foregoing is abridged , can ever be applied with success to the moral amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concurrence in the establishment and multiplication of these asylums. " * // The facts which are given in the foregoing passages leave no room for doubt , that establishments similar in their character to the " salles d'asile " should be added to our present system of schools . Even if the experiment were uncertain , there could be no hesitation about trying it . The matter is of such a sort that there is no safety in neglecting a single suggestion that seems to make for good . Nor are we without an instance of the benefit which may be done here in our cities by an institution of this kind , even when it depends on a single individual for efficiency and success . It is now not two years ago that a " Charity School " was opened in one of the poorest quarters of Boston , with the design of affording shelter , instruction , the necessary clothing , and occasional food to the children of destitute parents , who would otherwise have been left to run wild in the streets , and pick up a degrading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforts which they r*eive are sufficient to induce the children to attend regularly . As often as any become fitted to enter the public primary schools , or as often as suitable places in private families can be found for their reception , they are removed from the " Charity School , " and the vacancy is filled by other children of the same class . A number of ladies have assumed the responsibilities of visitors of the school , and have aided it with their counsel and their sympathy . Nearly three hun* dred children have received the benefit of this excellent institution . It is impossible to estimate the exact amount of good which it has effected ; - each person will measure it by a different standard ; its results may have been more or less successful ; - but of this there can be no question , that such a work is in the true spirit of benevolence , and is worthy of all encouragement . It ought not to be left to the uncertain chances of individual capacity and private charity ; but the municipal administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a foundation as would render it permanent as long as the need for it should remain , and extensive enough for all whose welfare it might serve. * * This " Charity School " is now established at No. 2 Chanuing Street . In order to secure the full advantages of such an institution , and to confirm the good which is gained by the children , it will , in all cases , be found necessary to endeavor to raise the character of the parents . According as this is // The establishment of Evening Schools in our cities and towns has , in part , occupied the ground of the " Ragged Schools " in England . In the city of New York , they are now supported at the public expense ; and we trust that her exam pie will soon be generally followed . Though not confined in their operation to any one class , their chief attention should be bestowed on the poorest and most depraved . So far as this is done , so far will they be likely to he followed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The work , however , is difficult . It requires peculiar traits of character in those who engage in it , and the teaching is hy no means a simple process of cultivating the intellect . The affections are to be developed by sympathy and kindness ; confidence is to he won by consistency ; the moral truths taught by words are to be illustrated in conduct , and the progress of the intellect is to be based on the cultivation of the heart . We would willingly quote at length from the Philosophy of Ragged Schools , in proof of the efficiency of this method ; but we must he content with the following description of the mechanism which is employed . " Reader , have you ever entered a Ragged School ? If you have not , suppose yourself at my elbow , and make a visit to B- street . You pass through rather a dirty street , and then enter a very dirty alley , near the lower end of which you see a door , and , on entering , find yourself in a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls of the most squalid appearance are assembled in small groups round several well.dressed persons . They are reading or spelling , or perhaps tracing letters or words on their slates . You see among them a sharp , eager look , which tells of wits sharpened by necessity ; you speak to one ; you receive none of the usual homage paid by poverty to riches , but you receive the appellation of teacher , ' which is , in their minds , the noblest they can give ; and in a moment , without the least disguise or mauvaise honte , the child will tell you his history , and talk as freely as to an old friend . . . . Presently the reading ceases , a gentleman mounts done , the results of the school will he more or less satisfactory . We are oftea apt so to limit our benevolence , as to reap from it but a stunted growth of good fruits . - Connected with the School in Channing Street , is an office where such work as can be obtained , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced idleness or ignorant incapacity might otherwise lead to intemperance and increased misery . // a kind of rostrum , a little elevated above the children , and addresses them . lie explains the moral doctrines of Christianity , exhorts them to follow the example of our One Great Master , who was himself poor and suffering ; encourages them to hope in his goodness , and to see in the present zealous endeavors to ameliorate their condition , a proof that His mercy indeed watches over them . Many of the children listen with the most fixed attention ; you see that , at any rate , they understand what has been said ; sometimes , a general Thank you , ' marks their satisfaction when the lecture is concluded ; and often shrewd remarks show that they have fully apprehended its purport . A prayer and a hymn sung by the teachers , and such of the children as are capable , concludes the meeting ; and whilst the singing is still going on , the teachers gather and dismiss small lots of nine or tea at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such is the mechanism of a Ragged School ; but without the warm benevolence which animates the teachers , and which shows itself in all their actions , little would be done . " * - Philosophy of Ragged Schools , pp. 63- 65 . After this extract , more need hardly be said . Shall we urge again the duty that rests upon every city and town , upon every individual , that there should be no sparing of effort to see that those who may gain good from such schools are not left without the means of gaining it ? Selfishness dictates exertion for this end . Charity , benevolence , all right feelings join in urging it ; and if we would show that our professed belief is not a mere profession , we must give our strength to this Christian work . Some time ago , a thief asked to be allowed to go over one of the Ragged Schools in London , and then said , " I shall subscribe a sovereign , annually ; for if these schools had been in existence some years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It depends on us to determine the destiny of the poor , forlorn , tempted child in our streets . How shall we determine it ? We have now very briefly gone through with our subject , the prevention of pauperism by the improvement of the homes and the education of the poor . We have left many * " A man , then a notorious thief , said to one of the missionaries who attended him in prison , I always considered religion all humbug , and the parsons humbugs , who were paid for praying and preaching ; but when I see people taking young thieves who are following in my steps , out of the streets to save them from ruin , this is something like Christianity . ' " // collateral suggestions untouched , and we have left undeveloped many arguments and instances by which the views here stated might have been confirmed . But we have brought forward enough to prove that something should be done to better the existing state of things , and we have shown means by which some progress may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . But before we leave off , we would speak of one thing more , the most important of all , inasmuch as it is the foundation upon which all that *can be accomplished must rest , - we mean individual exertion . It is a matter of deep personal interest to us all , and yet it is a matter about which there has been , and is now , much coldness of feeling and much want of thought . Individual benevolent exertion is only another name for charity ; and charity has been too much regarded as a virtue well to be admired , and excellent to be practised , but not of imperative obligation . We lay up good stores for ourselves first , and then we give out of our overflowing abundance , and mean to be charitable . We are too apt to measure our duties by the standard of worldly approbation , and it is easy to neglect that which our narrow world cares little for . Still we profess to be followers of Christ , and believers in an all just God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world our respectable faith . But how is it with our hearts and our lives ? Are they not often unchristian and unbelieving ? Do we not forget God , and do we not live as if God would forget us ? Lazarus sits at the gate or Dives to-day as he did of old ; and to-day , as of old , Lazarus is neglected . No one will deny that the elevating of those who are poor and miserable in body and soul , is a work worthy of the greatest and most constant efforts . It is a work to be accomplished only by such efforts . Now , no great work ever has been , or ever can be , done on earth except by the combined exertions of individuals . If we look at the amount that is to be done , before the poor can be made what they ought to be , it might seem as if any single person could do very little ; but the weakness of one is not like the strength of a thousand . Let every man do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as great , would be soon completed . Nor is any one held excused because of his want of power . Have we nothing for others ? No gifts which we can spare ? No superfluity bounti. * // fully given to us that it may serve the need of ' those less rich ? Have we no single talent , no thought , no word , no action , no sympathy ? But while we recognize this need and this power of individual exertion , we can not he blind to the difficulties which surround it . " If there is any thing , " says the wise author of The Claims of Labor , " If there is any thing that requires thought and experience , it is the exercise of charity in such a complicated system as modern life . " The difficulties are not merely with regard to the objects of charity , and to the method of securing the ends of ' benevolence , but they relate also to the means which we use , and involve the consideration of all social arrangements . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw the line between proper and improper expense , between suitable and unsuitable indulgence . But our danger is not that we shall forget ourselves too much . The need of thought and experience does not diminish our responsibility , nor is it to serve as an excuse for careless inaction . The exercise of charity should not depend on fitful and uncertain impulses ; it must rest on high and abiding principles . Enthusiasm may light its fire , but the constancy of a right will must support its steady flame . We are to look for no new principles in morality or in politics , by which any sudden and happy change is to be produced in the condition of men . " The Christian religion , " says the author we just now quoted , " has been eighteen hundred years before the world , and have we exhausted the morality in that ? " We must make use of the means we have . We must not attempt the work in any spirit of dilettanteism or affectation . There is often an attractiveness about the representations given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched by such pictures to endeavor to imitate them , and add this to their other worldly graces . They may be sure that such imitation is worthless . Too often , the earnestness of the real lover of this heavenly mistress is chilled by disappointment . Humility , patience , and constant hope must be with him to refresh his zeal . And now , why is it that , with this work set before us , a work which might well engage the affections of the noblest heart , and the powers of the strongest mind , and yet one // which rejects no willing laborer , however humble , - why is it that so little is done ? It is from want of thought and want of imagination . In our pleasant homes , it is hard to imagine the sufferings of the poor . In the whirl of our busy occupations , it is hard to catch a moment in which to think of what we might do for them . *C The wounds I might have healed ! The human sorrow and smart ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill a part . But evil is wrought by want of Thought , As well as by want of Heart . " Does the shadow of the sick woman , of the shivering child , never darken the brightness of our luxurious , lighted rooms ? At our tables , is a place never filled by the image of the halfstarved , hopeless man ? In the pauses of the music , do we never hear the sound of the children crying for help ? " Oh ! songez vous parfois que de faim ddvord Peut-*tre un indigent dans les carrefours sombres S'urrdte et voit danser vos lumineuses ombres Aux vitres du salon dor6 ' ? " We who can spend so much for pleasant trifles for ourselves , we who can build large houses , and buy gaudy furniture , and laces and jewels and all costly finery , can we not spare one of these vanities for the wants of others ? " Lady ! Lady ! Wear hut one robe the less , - forego one meal , - And thou shalt taste the core of many tales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The sweeter for their sadness . " The evil that comes from thoughtless carelessness is perhaps as Inuch , and is as certainly to be laid to our charge , as the evil that comes from design . Recollecting then this , and living according to this recollection , we may also recollect with hope the words , " Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these , ye have done it unto me.
