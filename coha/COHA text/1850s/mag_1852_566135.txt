ART . IX. - LOUIS KOSSUTH . WE place the title of no book at the head of this article . Louis KOSSUTH himself is both a history of the past and a prophecy of the future . The first governor of independent Hungary , driven by Despotism from Europe to Asia , brought by Republicanism from Asia to America , charged with the hopes and pleading the cause of Europe 's oppressed nations before this great Republic , and , to adopt his very words , " with the boldness of a just cause , claiming the principles of the Christian religion to be raised to a law of nations ; and to see not only the boldness of the poor exile forgiven , but to see him consoled by the sympathy of millions , encouraged by individuals , associations , meetings , cities and states , supported by operative aid , and greeted by Congress and the Government as the nation 's guest , honored out of generosity with honors which only one man before him ever received  --  and that man received them out of gratitude-with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , there is a history of future ages in all these facts . " We can imagine no prouder eminence of influence and responsibility . To plead as the representative of one continent before the people of another , as the representative of the oppressed before the millions of the free ; at the time when despots and their armies are combining against the people , speaking on the great question which is agitating the world in such a position that both continents listen with breathless interest , the powers of despotism and the powers of freedom ponder his utterances , and tyrants shut them out of their dominions as anxiously as they would resist a hostile army-this is a position of sublime influence and responsibility such as few have ever occupied . To this nation , involved already in discussing a change of settled national policy , his visit must be fraught with important consequences . Without committing ourselves to every one of his sentiments or to the advocacy of his proposed measures , without being led astray by a blind and undiscerning enthusiasm , without deeming it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Batthyany sends across the ocean , or the imputations circulating in some of our own newspapers , we can not but express our profound satisfaction that from a position of so extraordinary influence , have been uttered some of the most ennobling principles of Christianity . We can not but feel a profound // satisfaction in directing attention to these principles , long familiar to our own pages , now that a masterly eloquence , aided by wonderful events of Providence , is causing them to resound throughout Christendom . Kossuth and Mazzini are the representatives , in continental Europe , of true constitutional liberty , in distinction from red republicanism and socialism , from the revolts unworthy to be called revolutions , which result from impatience of restraint without even the idea of well-ordered freedom , and from the republicanism of Cavaignac and Lamartine , which , regarding only political institutions , recognizes not the connection between the eternal principles of liberty and the eternal laws of God , and strikes no roots deep into man 's spiritual nature , in which all abiding and vigorous human progress must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize the authority of God as the source and regulator of human liberty ; they recognize the Bible as the depository of the lofty sentiments , true principles , and constraining motives which alone give to men the will to be free and the selfcontrol to use their freedom aright , which alone originate and sustain the true progress of society ; they cut through the sophistry of tyrants and found the rights of man on the grant of the eternal God , the only basis of inalienable rights , which no ages of prescription , no centuries of oppression can annul or impair . In America , Kossuth appears as the representative of another principle , the universal fraternity of man . This also he grounds on the authority of God . As he utters the cry of oppressed humanity , he claims that it is invested with the authority of God , who " hath made of one blood all nations of men , " who has required us to love our neighbor as ourselves , and who has taught us that our neighbor is every one whom it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry of suffering humanity , wherever raised , comes to us , not as a supplication but as a command . As a supplication , as a piteous cry of distress , it goes up into the ear of God ; from the throne of the eternal it is sent down to us , a divine command . These principles , presented avowedly as principles of Christianity , Kossuth claims ought to be recognized as the basis of governmental action . Founding his plea on eternal and unchangeable principles derived from God , he does not hesitate to recognize the law of God as the supreme authority , and claims that governments should acknowledge its supremacy and determine their action by its requirements . Were we required to state his position in a single sentence , it would be this : Principle , not policy , the basis of governmental // action ;  --  or thus , The requirements of God 's laws as really obligatory on governments as on individuals . Before considering the application of these Christian principles to governmental action , the occasion seems to demand a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be desired from this extraordinary presentation of them . And we feel at once , when we come within the scope of this man s eloquence , that we are raised above the sphere of selfish ambition , the jangling of faction , and the chicanery of office seekers , to an atmosphere of manly thought and invigoratingprincipie ; that we are in the presence of an honest , earnest , fearless worker , who has proposed to himself a great achievement for humanity , and is working with the energy and straightforwardness of truth to effect it . It is worthy of note that these principles are the principles of Christianity . While it is remarkable that they should be proclaimed so powerfully , and should become , all at once , the grand topic of discussion to the public mind , it is significant of the power which they have already acquired . The very fact that these are the principles of Christianity is one of the greatest reasons of the powerful impression which Kossuth makes . The people , wearied with the strifes of party warfare and personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul and cause it to thrill with sublime emotions . Christianity has gained a power in the world which gives to one who boldly proclaims its great sentiments of love , an influence which nothing else can impart . And all history teaches that these are the principles on which the earnest workers in the conflict with despotism and slavery always are compelled to stand . On this basis our fathers laid the massive foundation of our liberty , our constitution and our nation . On this basis the Pilgrims stood and the English Puritans ; on this stood Knox , Calvin and Luther , and all the mighty wrestlers against that which is the centre and life of all European despotism , the Papacy . And to this basis all must be driven who make determined and desperate stand against despotism and slavery . When the ploughshare of confusion is driven through the earth and all that is conventional and prescriptive is torn up and swept away , this is the only foundation left to stand on  --  the bare and solid rock , deep and broad as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's eternal authority , giving to mankind rights ineffaceable as the truth of God , and imposing on them obligations unchangeable as His throne . We have , besid* , the unanimous verdict of mankind in favor of these principles . The ancients say that no man can be elo // quent , unless he is good . This is true , to this extent at least , that no man can by eloquence rouse and control the hearts of man , unless he pours forth great thoughts , true thoughts , which embody sublime principles of action , and electrify the heart to ennobling motives and deeds . L*t the orator avow the principles of selfishness and deny the rights of man ; let him avowedly teach men to honor despotism and hate liberty ; let him bid men to forget the brotherhood of man ; let him avowedly insult the supplications of wronged and suffering humanity , and repudiate the claims of outraged justicQ-it is not in the power of genius or learning to produce eloquence out of such materials . It is not in the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals . The ethereal fire of eloquence can be lighted only in*heaven . Search history through , the great efforts of eloquence have always been in vindication of right against wrong , of liberty against despotism , of principle and duty against selfish policy . And the times of struggles for liberty , or reformation or revival of religion , of the vindication of great principles , are always times of eloquence . When the fire comes down from heaven , it always finds hearts in which it kindless . The church has always had its eloquent men ; even in times of corruption it has had enough of the fire of heaven s truth to produce Bossuets and Massillons ; but where is the eloquence that ever pleaded for infidelity ? The Reformation produced its immortal eloquence ; but where is the eloquence that . pleaded for the sale of indulgencies and the supremacy of the Pope ? Greece had its Demosthenes ; but where is the orator of Philip ? The Roman Republic had its Cicero ; but where is the orator of the Triumvirate ? The American Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the British Parliament , its Chatham , its Burke , and its Barre ; but where is the orator of King George ? In France , liberty had its Mirabeau ; but where was the eloquence of tyranny ? The emancipation of negro slaves produced its Willberforce ; but when did eloquence ever plead avowedly for slavery ? And now Hungary has its Kossuth ; but where is the eloquence of Austria ? Liberty , with human face of intelligence and love , looks forth and speaks ; and the heart of the world is thrilled by her words . Despotism , like a muffled mute of the Inquisition , strikes and is silent . Despotism in the sternness of mere strength frowns like a mute bastile , terrific in its silence . Or , if ever a bad cause is defended by eloquence , it is by disguising its own nature and falsely appealing to noble sentiments . The tongue of man stiffens when it pleads for injustice , %ppression , or selfishness ; and the great heart of the world will not throb in answer // to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it we have the silent but decisive verdict of mankind in favor of the great principles under consideration . We have the same verdict in another way . Daniel Webster , speaking on the death of Jeremiah Mason , uttered this true sentiment : that a solemn and religious regard to spiritual and eternal things is an indispensable element of all true greatness . It is so . Greatness , which commands the universal and abiding homage of the world , is greatness founded in principle and producing the sacrifice of interest to principle . Whenever such a character appears  --  a Miss Dix , a Howard , a Washington-it commands the spontaneous homage of the world . This very preference of principle to interest is an essential element of true greatness . Louis Napoleon is not great ; he was unequal to the emergency , because he could not restrain his personal ambition to save France ; could not cast off old ideas , could mark out no new path , could only follow that old commonplace route by which hundreds of bloody heroes have marched to power ; could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Ciesars and Alexanders of the world have not had this element of greatness . No man is great who is less than his own passions and capable of being carried off by his own ambition ; And such is the verdict of the world . However great the admiration of such men 's talents , however great the wonder they at first excite , the interest of the world in them is continually lessening ; and at the best it is only admiration , not homage or veneration . But they who identify themselves with principle , they who sacrifice personal aggrandizement to principle , to the welfare of man , have a talisman which opens all hearts and compels the profoundest homage ; and this homage abides and grows . Such characters are sometimes crushed by tyranny and consigned to opprobrium for a time ; but the world is interested , even ages after , to do them justice ; their characters are vindicated ; they take their places among the benefactors of mankind ; and as ages roll on , receive a more profound and universal veneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true religion . That which is the crowning excellence of human greatness , is the first element of piety . Every man , woman and child who enters the kingdom of Christ , must receive in entering this element of true grandeur ; he must learn to renounce self for the good of man ; he must learn to bear the cross ; and so the cross , taken up by man , becomes the crown of his highest glory . Hence it is that the history of the church , being a history of martyrs , is a continuous history of heroes . While secular his. * // tory is proud to point to scarcely one in a century  --  a Leonidas , a Washington-who at long distances shed on its dark records the lustre of self-sacrifice , such heroes throng every part of the history of the church , like the stars that crowd the evening sky . Even in the rudest nations , as now in Madagascar , even in ages of* the most general enervation , as in the decline of the Roman Empire , the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to death for truth and right . The world , then , has given its verdict that none shall stand honored and revered in all hearts till time shall end , except those to whom righteousness and mercy have been dearer than personal aggrandizement ; and this is , again , the silent but decisive verdict of the world in favor of the principles now under consideration . These are the principles of Kossuth ; and we thank God that he has uttered them . We would not imply , indeed , that this is specially an honor to them . They are too glorious to be honored by any man 's receiving them ; rather it honors him to stand in this position , like the angel standing in the sun ; and we can not restrain the hope that God , in whose hands the kings of earth are but " the saw " and " the axe " by which he builds his temple , will use this man to elevate the people to loftier sentiments and more godlike virtue . It is not unreasonable to hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Christianity itself . Not a few extol these sublime principles when uttered by the eloquent Kossuth , who are accustomed to slighting thoughts of the Christian religion . But while they honor these sentiments , it is only simple justice that , like the hero whom they admire , they should give honor to Christianity as their source . While they shout for the rights of man , let them , like Kossuth , acknowledge the Bible as the Magna Charta of liberty . While they shout for the fraternity of men , let them acknowledge that this is an old principle of religion , always taught in the pulpit , that it lies at the basis of all missionary and Bible societies , and all the enterprises of Christian benevolence-sneered at often by worldlings , and yet embodying the very principle for which Kossuth awakens so great enthusiasm and in behalf of which a multitude are ready to take up arms . It would seem that they who see so much sublimity in the principle of universal benevolence in its application to Hungary , might see an equal sublimity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perseveringly to renovate the whole world . We speak now of the principles themselves on which Kossuth rests his plea ; not of the measures which he recommends ; and we have believed it reasonable to hope that the utterance of these principles in // the audience of the nation , by one who has so extraordinary a power over human hearts , may compel men to see that , when great achievements for humanity are to be made , they must always be originated and impelled by the principles of Christianity ; and thus , while honoring Kossuth , men may learn to honor Christianity , from which he avowedly derives his principles ; and to honor the teachings and benevolent enterprises of Christianity , which embody those principles in all their sublimity , and apply them , with tearful earnestness and prayer and self-denial , to the regeneration of all the nations of the earth . Thus we may hope he will contribute some important service in extending a more just appreciation of the Bible as the foundation of all our hopes of human progress . The visit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be frank and honest , and to trust to principle and truth . Accustomed as we have been to hear these principles derided as incompatible with sound statesmanship and practical political wisdom , it is encouraging and refreshing to hear them from the lips of one of earth 's strong workers , fresh from the strife for liberty ; and still more encouraging is the rush of enthusiasm with which the masses have hailed these sentiments . This enthusiasm is not a mere war spirit ; it has risen highest in those States where commerce and religion have made the xvar-spirit the most feeble ; and in the fiery south , the enthusiasm has been wanting . It is an enthusiasm for his frank and manly character , and his noble sentiments . It is a significant intimation to politicians to flatter the people less and to trust them more ; to depend on truth and not on chicanery . Kossuth trusted but did not flatter ; American politicians flatter but do not trust . This enthusiasm teaches emphatically that the people appreciate manliness , honesty and noble principle ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition and the selfish arts of party policy ; that they hail , like a rising sun , a true man who speaks strong , masculine truth , and propounds eternal , sublime principle . It is a significant prophecy that the days of the demagogue are numbered . It is not strange-far as we are removed by the lapse of years from the strife which secured our liberty , and surrounded by the enervating influences of uninterrupted prosperity-it is not strange that we have begun to forget the importance of these foundation principles , and that the life and vigor of liberty should have begun to wither . It is well that one , wrenched and scarred in the strife , with the stain of imprisonment yet upon him , and the mighty storm yet swelling in his soul-it is well that such a man has come to reinfuse into the national mind these principles , which are the life-blood of true liberty . We // say this without endorsing the particular measure of armed intervention , though if we believed that liberty and the blessings of religion and education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured by arms , the fact that war would injure our interests , would cost money and blood , we should not consider a sufficient argument against it . Here is where he is strong , and all are weak who attempt to answer him merely by the argument that compliance with his request might injure our interest . rhere are considerations higher than interest . Liberty , religion , the acquisitions which make man 's highest elevation , never were nor can be secured by mere appeals to interest . The cause that relies on that plea alone must appear weak and contemptible beneath the scathing and indignant eloquence that springs from eternal truth . There are attainments more to be valued than money , or commercial prosperity , or life . For the attainment of these values for mankind , the sacrifice of millions of money , the sacrifice of life , is cheap . When in any nation this truth ceases to be appreciated , when public sentiment regards only profit and loss , and , in the very spirit which coins men s hearts and drops their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering humanity by the price of stocks , and the worth of liberty by dollars and cents , and values commercial prosperity above truth and justice , liberty and religion , when in any nation the spirit is gone , which cries , with our fathers , " Give us liberty or give us death , " - that nation is demoralized , the sap and vigor of its life is gone , it waits to be numb*red with the dead. * And this is the very truth , sent down originally from heaven to burn on sordid hearts , which now , in the providence of God , is pressed on the national mind . The present is no time for sluggish inaction or of pleasurable ease . It seems as if it were a crisis in the world 's history . To look on the confusion of the world and grasp no great principles that contain the power to bless it ; to see the workers toiling and bleeding for liberty , men and women going on apostolic missions of love to the ends of the earth , to behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to catch no * Perhaps the greatest evil caused by negro slavery is just this , that it withers the principles of liberty at the root ; that throughout the nation it dims the idea of the inalienable rights of man , and the obligation to relieve the oppressed ; that it accustoms the people to hear these principles ridiculed as mere abstractions and to decide on the question of emancipation by mere commercial considerations , so as , for example , to deem it a convincing argument against the emancipation in the West Indies , that it injured the sugar trade . Throughout the entire nation it has diffused a poison which debilitates the very spirit of liberty . - // enthusiasm of mercy , to accept no self-denial , to live only to press the pillows of ease and breathe the J ) erfumes of luxury ; to see the deadly struggle between truth and error , and to feel no zeal for the right , no nobler aim than personal enjoymentis it possible that man , created by the Almighty , capable of being like God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it possible that man or woman , whom God has made7 can fail so utterly of all the noble impulses of humanity , can lead a life so unutterably contemptible ? Every act of the patriot Kossuth , every shout which greets his sentiments , rebukes a life of selfish ease , a life devoted to selfish ends . We can not but hope that his life and his words may help to elevate the people to loftier motives , to purer , more invigorating and mQre energizing thoughts . We had at first proposed to content ourselves with the foregoing remarks on the moral bearings of the remarkable visit of this remarkable man . But we should fail to do justice even to this part of the subject , if we neglected to consider his claim that the requirements of the Bible should be recognized as principles of legislation and international law . Shall governmental acts be based on the eternal principles of truth and rectitude , or only on policy ? In determining their official actions , shall the administrators of government ask , " What do truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , " What is politic ? what does interest require ? " Says Jeremy Bentham , " What a government ought to do , is a mysterious and searching question , which those may answer who know what it means . The word ought , if it means any thing , must have reference to some kind of interest or motives ; and what interest a government has in doing right , when it happens to be interested in doing wrong , is a question for the schoolmen . The fact appears to be that ought is not predicable of government . " The error here is sufficiently palpable and shocking , and few would venture thus plainly to avow it ; yet this very sentiment , a little disguised , is prevalent ; and we welcome , with intense delight , the broad principle , whoever proclaims it , that the law of God , and not policy , is the basis of governmental action . There is no need of proving this ; for to our mind there is nothing which can be urged in proof plainer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side ; for since God 's law is universal , it behooves them who believe that some men in some actions are exempted from its authority , to bring from the law itself proof of their exemption . In truth , when the apostle declares , in the 13th chapter of Romans , that government is instituted by God for the benefit of // the governed , he teaches that government is necessarily subject and responsible to him that instituted it . It is admitted , however , that policy is not to be excluded . The Bible does not forbid the individual to consult his interest ; it is even urgent to rouse men to regard it . Prudence has a legitimate place in religion . There are many actions the character of which can not be determined without regard to circumstances and consequences . But in all these , the Bible still recognizes certain principles of action always and unalterably the same . It does not , then , set principle in opposition to policy , duty in opposition to interest ; it harmonizes them by setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to find out his interest by asking what is his duty ; not to find out his duty by asking what is his interest . And this is the only way of determining what is interest . As the seaman can not calculate his safe course by watching the clouds and currents , but only the compass within the ship , so the safe course of life can not be calculated by studying surrounding circumstances , but only from the conscience within the breast . Conscience , it is true , needs to be enlightened and guided . But as the seaman determines his position by observation , not of the billows around , but of the heavens above him , conscience is to be guided by the light of heaven shining in God 's word . And this we must believe applicable to men acting as officers of government , as well as to men acting in a private capacity , until we can be shown the enactment of Him who instituted government and gave it all its authority , exempting its officers from obedience to His law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christianity are obligatory on government , is our government obliged to accede to Kossuth 's request respecting Hungary ? He asks our government to take this position , that when any people is engaged in a revolutionary war against their oppressors , if any other government shall interfere to aid in crushing that revolution , the United States will not regard it with indifference , and if this declaration shall not be respected , he admits that this government would be bound to sustain it by arms . Admitting that governments as well as individuals are bound by the Christian law of universal benevolence , is our government therefore obliged to adopt this proposed measure ? We answer , no. * * It is to be observed that this argument is confined to that interference on the part of our government which is made avowedly with the determination to enforce its protest , if disregarded , by a war . It does not decide whether this or that form // It is to be remarked at the outset , that if this law requires this nation to prevent intervention by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people in revolution against their own government , and equally require it to overthrow despotism and liberate the people of those nations where the " churchyard quiet " of despotism is not yet disturbed by revolution . The law of benevolence is as binding in the latter cases as in the first . Such application of the law of universal benevolence , therefore , in the case of Hungary and in like cases , involves other and far wider applications . It in fact raises this general question : Is war the proper means to be used by governments for performing those duties towards the people of other countries which are derived from the principle of universal benevolence ? And upon this it may be remarked , in the first place , that there is no specific command in the Bible to this effect . God has not laid upon the nations this dreadful necessity . In the second place , the Scriptures place the end of government definitely and specifically in another thing . Inspiration teaches that each particular government is instituted for a single object , the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God to thee for good . " It would seem , therefore , that the more vigorously government confines itself to the single object for which it was instituted , the more effectually will it promote the general welfare of man . In the third place , all history shows that it would be perilous to the rights and interests of man for governments to exercise , on the ground of principle , this tremendous power . It is the very power which establishes inquisitions , refuses the rights of religious belief , silences the press , and carries on the most fearful persecutions . It is the very power which in the hands of the catholic priesthood has deluged Europe in blood for the maintenance of what we hold to be falsehood and despotism . But we will pass from general considerations to our own government ; and , here , these difficulties are enhanced by the addiof interference will produce this result , nor does it refer to any action of the government with foreign nations for the establishment of free institutions in other countries , which may fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of war merely for the purpose of aiding the cause of freedom in other countries . This of course excludes from consideration a question which may possibly arise hereafter , whether , in case the despotical governments of the old world should combine to destroy the free governments of Europe and this country , we should not in self - defense unite with England and other free governments to resist it . We limit the question to the case of war with a despotical powerfor no other reason than to aid those who are struggling to found a free government . We ought to add that we do not suppose those Christian ministers and members of our churches , who have sympathized so deeply with Kossuth , intend to take this ground the we should do so , thQugh for want of discriminating the different points of the subject from each other , some of their language has looked that way . // tional difficulty that the gravest questions are made subservient to party purposes . Already we have had instances of annexation and war under pretence of extending the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be remembered that the principle , if once established in respect to Hungary , might be pleaded as obliging us to give liberty to Cuba ; for the law of love reaches all the oppressed alike . And when once government has taken its position , that it will not regard with indifference intervention to crush nations struggling to be free , the administration must decide under what circumstances the position must be sustained by an appeal to arms . And can we trust the government with this power ? If we can trust this administration , are we sure we can trust the next ? Would not this very position of the government be mingled at once with party politics , and made to minister to personal ambition ? Have we any warrant that the action of the nation in sustaining this position would not ultimately be determined by mere party-spirit , and not at all by enlightened regard to the interest of Hungary ? Have we not , rather , in the history of the past , grounds for assurance that this would be the melancholy issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a confederacy like the United States is , by its very constitution , unfitted to sustain such an appeal with vigor ; and the very existence of armies and foreign war must tend to change the spirit and nature of our institutions , and , by underming our own institutions , impair our moral strength and influence among the nations . We do not believe , indeed , for another reason , that it would be in the power of the United States to bring such a war to a successful issue . In calculating our resources for such a war , other elements must be considered besides the number of dollars and muskets . A successful war for the liberty of other nations must result from a true love of liberty in our own . That is a true and profound sentiment of Kossuth , that a revolution must be the outgushing of the sentiments of the people 's hearts ; otherwise it would be only a revolt , not a revolution . How much more must a war for European liberty be the outgushing from the national heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a nation relentlessly holding three millions of slaves , systematically shaping its legislation and its executive councils for their safe keeping ; for a nation holding , as Kossuth once hinted , " some lust of cotton , " as a sufficient argument against efforts for human freedom , how is it possible for such a nation to engage in such a war successfully ? How is it possible such a war should gush out from the heart of such a people ? Would it have any issue but to provoke the more bitter sneers of the world at our inconsistency , bring out in deeper colors // the great stain of our glory , divide us against ourselves , and weaken our moral strength among the nations ? Such a war would be far other than the Mexican war , that brilliant series of victories over an adjacent and feeble nation , which scarcely made itself felt as a burden within our own frontier . And we venture to predict that the enthusiasm of its beginning would issue in a languid prosecution ; because there is not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of which such a war , if successful , must flow . Therefore , while we hold that government is bound by the great principles of Christianity , we believe that the very nature of government , and especially of a popular confederacy , involves an incapacity for successful action in the way of armed intervention ; that the more strictly government confines itself to the simple object for which it was instituted , the more effectually it will promote the welfare of other nations ; and that thus this nation is to be the benefactor of the world , by conducting all its international intercourse , even with the weakest powers , in justice and magnanimity , offering an asylum for the oppressed , and exhibiting an example of well regulated and prosperous freedom . Perhaps here we might stop . But , at a time when the martial spirit is becoming so strong in the land , we think it not unbefitting to set forth the claims and power of moral influence , and to urge upon the churches to put forth their energies in the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort shall not be in vain . But , here , lest we might be thought to deny the right of oppressed nations to fight for freedom , we would expressly declare that the rights which God has given , which he has required all men to respect , we are , for that very reason , justified in defending . Oppressed nations have the right of revolution . When government , instituted as the minister of good to the people , fails of its end and becomes a minister of evil , when reversing its divine commission it becomes a terror to good works and a praise to them that do evil , the people have the right to overturn it . When ambitious conquerors invade our territory , or when despots come with giant strength to crush our rights and exterminate the advocates of liberty , then it is right to draw the sword in defense of what is dearer than life . Such words Wordsworth ascribes to the Tyrolese : " The land we from our fathers had in trust , And to our children will transmit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our piety , And God and Nature say that it is jusC ' von . x. 18 // True , the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church ; true , the blood of one martyr has often a moral power greater than all the blood of an Austerlitz or Waterloo . But persecution may literally exterminate the church in a nation ; and where then is the growth of this seed ? Protestantism , when likely to become the prevailing religion of the French , was exterminated by blood and banishment , and all continental Europe to day sits in chains and ashes beneath the scourge of despotism in consequence of that triumph of tyranny . if arms could have averted that triumph , would it not have been right to use them ? History shows that civil and religious liberty has seldom been won without force . Despots are not wont voluntarily to surrender their power . The spirit of freedom must first be infused into the people ; but then they are usually obliged to seize their liberty by arms . When the fruit has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though arms can not lay the foundation of liberty , there are times when they must be interposed to secure it . In the words of Kossuth , " Bayonets may support , but they afford no chair to sit upon . " And , yet , war is not an instrumentality to which we ought mainly to look for the advancement of man . Knowledge , science , political truths , and , above all and more than all , the gospel , these are the chief instrumentalities . The historical demonstration of the power of moral influences is manifold . Truth requires time to prove its strength . Force , like the builders of Babel , begins in the show of strength , but ends in confusion ; truth , like the grain of mustard seed , begins small , and imperceptibly grows to greatness . " Truth , crushed to earth , shall rise again , The eternal years of God are hers .

" " But the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance . " It would be risking nothing to predict that in three hundred years the influence of S. J. Mills and his coadjutors , who originated American Missions by their prayers and counsels , will be greater and more manifest than the influence of Napoleon . We are justi // fled , then , in expecting from the Bible and the moral influences associated with it , a silent efficacy in promoting liberty greater than armies can exert . Beautifully does Isaiah express the contrast : " Every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and garments rolled in blood , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child is born , and his name shall be the Prince of Peace . " So men bound the demoniac with chains and fetters - mere outward force  --  and he broke the chains and fetters in pieces ; but Christ spoke the word which went to the heart , and the demoniac sat clothed and in his right mind . We further affirm that the power of the Bible and moral influences has not been fully developed . We are justified in expecting from them greater results and a more undivided efficiency in the advancement of mankind . The Bible is continually operating with a self-evidencing power . It has already wrought out for itself convincing proofs of its divine origin . It will work out a demonstration of its truth which will eventually supercede the usual external evidences . God has said , " My thoughts are not your thoughts ; - as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my thoughts higher than your thoughts . " The Bible contains these thoughts of God , lofty as the heavens . It is continually incorporating them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporates these thoughts of God into the heart and life of the individual , and the renewed man , glowing with heavenly experience and godlike sentiments , becomes an embodied gospel , a living epistle of God 's thoughts written on the heart . From the individual the Bible extends these thoughts of God , till they are incorporated into the usages of societ.y and ultimately into the laws and institutions of government ; and what was first written with ink on the pages of the blessed book , we next see exemplified in the life of the individual , who , amid sneers and obloquy , toils and perhaps endures persecution and death to utter them to the world ; and presently we see them , confessed in their heavenly glory , beam out in the usages of society and the laws of states . Thus the Bible is demonstrating its own truth . David in the 19th Psalm compares it , as it thus goes forth showing its own glory in its effects , to the sun and the stars , going forth and revealing their divine origin by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , lofty as the heavens , which we have already seen dimly in individuals , fragments of which already shine forth in the usages of society and the laws of government , when these divine thoughts shall all have incorporated themselves into the lives of individuals and of nations , the divine glory of the Bible will shine forth as resplendent and as undeniable as the divine glory of // the heavens . And we need not " make haste " to demand that all these glories should be incorporated into society at once . It were more in accordance with God 's methods-for his ways are as much higher than ours as his thoughts-it were better for the discipline of our faith , that the work be gradual ; that these principles come out one by one and take their places as the lights of the world , even as the stars in the evening twilight come out one by one and take their stations in the sky , until the heavens are crowded with the glorious hosts . Religious liberty is one of God 's high thoughts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already , in a few nations , displaced man 's intolerant thought , and is shining forth in heaven 's own light upon the nations . The principle of civil liberty is another of God 's thoughts . The principle , though not in its application to civil affairs , was long preached in pulpits ; it inspired the spirit of many a martyr . But the American Declaration of Independence first embodied it into national institutions and laws . And the whole growth of America , what has it been but the growing up and incorporation into the national life of the principles of God 's word ? The truth of God " transfused Into the mighty vision passing there , As in her natural form , swells vast to heaven . " And as from the vale where night yet hung in darkness , the poet gazed on Mount Blanc , tinged with the dawn , so may the nations in their darkness gaze on this nation 's towering grandeur , already radiant with the dawning glory , and destined to reflect from its massive and ponderous greatness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very principle under consideration , that the renovation of the world is to be promoted , not by force , but by moral influences , is itself an instance of the ever increasing power of the latter . Man 's thought is , force ; if anything is to be gained , " fight for it . " God 's thought is , peace on earth ; or , as Paul expresses it , " The weapons of our warfare are not carnal , but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds . " This principle is rapidly displacing the world 's old opinion and embodying itself into the public sentiment of the people and the acts of nations . Daniel Webster has lately said , and said it in a position attracting the attention of nations to his words , " We are too much inclined to underrate the power of moral influence and the influence of public opinion and the influence of principles . We think that nothing is powerful enough to stand // before despotic power . There is something strong enough , quite strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that is the power of intelligent public opinion in all the nations of the earth . There is not a monarch on earth whose throne is not liable to be shaken by the sentiment of the just and intelligent part of the people . " The rapid course of events has been and is teaching the dullest to hope less from force and more from truth ; less from revolutions and more from instruction . Already it is common to read in political newspapers and to hear in legislative halls the sentiment that the Bible is the basis of all human progress . Thus this lofty thought of God is working its way among men , and already we begin to see its heavenly form in society and in the state . Therefore we are justified in expecting more from moral influences in the future than has been realized in the past . For as any principle of the Bible becomes incorporated into public sentiment , into the usages of society , and the laws of states , it gains an authority which may secure its recognition in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly growing up ; the public sentiment and authority of enlightened nations . Therefore a few missionaries have just wrought , wholly by peaceful means , religious toleration in Turkey , a change which once would have cost a deluge of blood . Therefore we must expect that force will have less and less to do in the advancement of mankind , and that the peaceful influences of Christianity will continually become more powerful and more prominent ; and therefore we are justified in expecting that even the stern necessity of wresting a constitutional government from oppressors by force will ultimately cease , and the principles of truth , incorporated into the public sentiment of enlightened governments , will have power peacefully to secure their own triumph in the world . Even in those extreme cases where the advocates of liberty and religion have been exterminated , and there seems no possibility of repairing the loss , a redeeming power may yet go forth from the very ashes of the martyrs . John saw under the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried with a loud voice , saying , " How long , oh Lord , holy and true , dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ? " This is a sublime revelation ; and those martyrs will not plead in vain . God may answer them by dashing the wicked in pieces as a potter 's vessel . It is a most significant fact that the Bible often exhibits God as the judge of the oppressor and the vindicator of the oppressed . Even the // Saviour is often exhibited in this attitude , as he establishes his kingdom on the earth . God will remember his faithful martyrs , and by his own arm will vindicate them ; and if this is done in judgment and desolation , tim* will discover , and providential events will render inevitable the part that man will take in the fearftil work . But there may be a brighter future , even for nations that have exterminated the church . When the righteous are all destroyed , if God should take of the destroyers themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be according to a common method of his operations . When he has a particular class of adversaries to subdue , it has been usual for God to take one of that very class and make him the leader in their conversion . When the time had come to preach to the selfrighteous Pharisees , that their nation was no longer to be exclusively the favored of God , and the gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles , God took one who according to the straitest sect had lived a 1*harisee ; he took him in the heat of his rage against this very sentiment , and in the very act of persecuting the church , and Paul , the Pharisee , became the apostle to the Gentiles , and suffered the loss of all things , and died in resisting Jewish exclusiveness and spreading the gospel to all nations . When Christendom was all shrouded in papal darkness , and to the eye of man there seemed not one to act as God 's agent in the work of Reformation , God went to the cloister itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible and showed him his own sins ; and then at Rome , the very seat of the Papacy , and in the very act of superstition , climbing Pilate 's stair case to do penance for sin , he caused the truth of God 's word to thunder in his ear , " The just shall live by faith , " and Luther sprung up the Reformer of Europe . When God desired one to speak the burning words of truth to the illiterate , he went to the illiterate ; he took a man whose whole library was , " The plain Man 's Pathway to Heaven , " and " The Practice of Piety ; " he took a tinker from the roadside , profane and profligate , and made him a preacher to the hearts of the common people till time shall end . When the church of Scotland was sunk in* formalism , and its ministers , unconverted , were more interested in science and literature than in the gospel , and God was about to work a reformation , he took one of those very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in print that he needed but one day in a week for his ministerial preparation ,  --  him , with more intellectual pride than they all , God took , and Thomas Chalmers , subdued by the gospel , became the leader of the Exodus of the Scotch Free Church . When Geneva had become // rationalistic , and its seminary itself was wholly given up to error , God sent an agency from abroad , equally demonstrating that no universality of error and corruption precludes God from finding agents of reformation . A pious seaman , after an action on board a British ship of war , reproved his commander for blasphemy . It led to his captain 's conversion . That captain was instrumental of converting his brother ; and that brother , the well known Robert Haldane , was instrumental of a reformation at Geneva , among the subjects of which were Felix Neff , Merle D'Aubigne , and Frederick Monod . All their influence , with much of the present evangelical movement in France , God originated in a single sentence of a seaman on board the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such facts before us we are forbidden to believe that moral influences may not yet secure a bright future , even to nations where persecution has once exterminated the church , and where the eye of man can discern no agency to be used for their renovation . It would be nothing more wonderful than what God has done , should he presently tame the Russian giant himself , and make him use his rugged strength as the protector of the weak and the liberator of the oppressed . And we earnestly affirm that the power of Christianity is not appreciated ; that the church has not put it to the test ; that , if fairly put to the test , it would amaze the world by its hidden power . And this we do earnestly urge , this we believe is a thought worthy to go down to the very depths of the Christian heart , that , while the attention of the nation is concentrated on this subject , while politicians are discussing it , and many are ready to go to war for it , the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prove what it can do to regenerate the nations . This the churches have not done . M. Bridell and M. Pilatte have come to our shores and pleaded the cause of evangelical religion in France . They argued and entreated ; they told us of the Spirit of God operating there in revivals , and of the church springing up again on the soil drenched with the blood of martyrs ; they warned us that the opportunity of aiding them might be short . Did the churches aid them ? Did they even begin to appreciate , have they yet begun to appreciate the vital importance of sustaining the evangelical church of France ? Verily , if we repudiate war , it is not because we fear the cost of money and of life . But we would seize the opportunity to urge the thought that to rescue the nations by moral means demands an enthusiasm , a self-denying toil equal 4o what war would cost ; that in the very earnestness and practical energy with which Kossuth pleads the cause of Hungary , the // church is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is needed , this we desire , that the directing of all minds to the struggle for European liberty may be the occasion of promoting a new baptism of the churches into the very spirit of enthusiastic , operative , self-denying zeal to deliver the nations from their ignorance , their irreligion , and their oppressions-a new appreciation of the greatness of the effort demanded , and of its present , practical , immediate urgency . The plea of Kossuth is , that despots are combining to crush liberty out of existence . That plea rests on truth . And it is as powerful for the Christian as for the politician . The papal throne , after the temporary disguise which has concealed its character , is again revealed , the central support of all despotism . Papal journals in England , France and America are openly avowing the right of persecution . The leading Romish periodical in England says : " It is difficult to say in which of the two popular expressions- ' the rights of civil liberty , ' or , the rights of religious liberty - is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as much truth and good sense as would be found in a cry for the inalienable right to suicide . " " We have ever avowed our conviction that in certain circumstances what is called persecution ' is both lawful and expedient . * * * To persecute Catholicism is to sin against Almighty God ; to persecute Protestantism , or Judaism , or infidelity , is perfectly right , provided only it be so judiciously planned and executed as not to defeat its own ends . " And around this central hierarchy , despots are combining to crush both liberty and religion ; to re*inact , if they but have the power , the scenes of blood by which in former days the powers of evil have resisted and crushed the defenders of truth and right . Strangely are the churches apathetic to the reality of the fact and to the importance of the emergency . If we are to rely on the peaceful agencies of Christianity , they must be used with the earnestness of men who believe that they wield an agency adequate to the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church , but its Very existence is staked on their success . The angel of God 's providence is moving before his people in events most rapid and momentous ; and God 's language of warning is , " Behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way , and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared . Beware of him and obey his voice ; provoke him not ; for he will not pardon your transgressions ; for my name is in him . But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak , then I will be an enemy to thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries . "
