txt NARCISSO LOPEZ AND HIS COMPANJONS. * FOR the present , at least , the attempt to rescue the Island of Cuba from the stern despotism of Spain , appears to have totally failed . Lopez has suffered an ignominious death , in a daring enterprise , which , had it succeeded , would have placed him among the heroes and benefactors of mankind ; his followers have been dispersed , hunted by bloodhounds , captured , and executed without trial , or transported to Spain to suffer under the relentless maxims of Spanish justice ; and so far from being objects of sympathy to their own countrymen , have been classed with Morgan , Lobnois , Roche , Braziliano , Bat , the Portuguese , and others of the bloody hueeaniers of Tone , whose sole object was plunder , and whose only means of success , treachery and murder . The drama being closed , and the curtain fallen , we propose briefly to review the plot , the author , the actors , and the incidents ; first , however , offering a few preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the largest and richest islands of the world , containing about half as many inhabitants as the thirteen British American colonies , when they threw off the yoke of the mother country , and achieved their independence . Owing to influences which it is not our purpose to specify , it took no part with the Spanish colonies on the Continent in their struggle for independence , but remained , and still remains , a dependency of Spain , whose colonial system is a compendium of all the abuses of the worst species of government . While the Queen of Spain is struggling to maintain a waning and precarious authority at home , she exercises a despotic sway in Cuba , administered by petty officers , who govern without control , and almost invariably exhibit the characteristic of every slave when he becomes a master . Abjectly subservient to those above them , they make amends for their bondage by treading on those beneath , and signalize their loyalty to the sovereign by oppressing the people . The inhabitants of Cuba have no constitutional rights ; no voice or influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers ; and in addition to these deprivations , by far the larger portion of them , the Creoles , natives of the island , are excluded from all the high offices , and considered as an inferior race by . what are called " The old Spaniards . " - These are among the grievances they suffer . Connected with and arising from that source , is a train of petty social abuses and mortifications , too tedious to enumerate , and , perhaps , not worth enumerating. // Now , what did our ancestors do here in these United States , when suffering under the evils of a colonial system , by no means so mortifying and oppressive ? They declared themselves independent , and justified their conduct by asserting the great truth , that the people had not only a right to change their government , but also a right to decide when such change became necessary to their prosperity and happiness . On this ground they fought , and on this they triumphed . They wrested the sceptre from kings , and shook the colonial system to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great radical change , not only in our ideas of the limits of authority and obedience , hut in the very structure of society itself which is gradually extending to the old world . Having proclaimed themselves independent , and made good that independence by great sacrifices of blood and treasure , it seems not a little strange and inconsistent , that a people thus circumstanced should withhold all sympathy from those in a similar situation with that they once felt so grievously , and who were at least presumed to be ready to discard a despotism ten times more galling than that which called forth their own resistance . iDoes it not seem equally strange , that long before it was ascertained whether or not the great majority of Cubans were in favor of independcnc* , and ready to assert it by arms , there should be a hue and cry raised from one end of the Union to the other , against all whose sympathies or service. * were enlisted in a cause hallowed in the heart of every true lover of freedom ? Does it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been shown for the fate of some hundreds of as gallant men as ever lived ; men , many of whom had shed their hlood and would have glories in dying for their country , captured when incapable of resistance , shot down without trial , like dogs without owners , and buried like dogs , not in the heat and excitement of battle , and resistance , but in the cold indignity of cowardly revenge , without being allowed time for repentance , had they been conscious of wrong ? And does it not seem strangest of all , that the administrators of a government founded on the right of resistance to wrong or oppression , and that of choosing their own rulers and making their own laws , should have made a treaty which may be , or at least has been , so construed , as to operate in effect as a guarantee to Spain of the right to oppress her colonies , and to place the United States under an obligation to uphold , if not actually assist her in riveting their chains ? Further : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon , that this same government , being the champion and exponent of liberty-at least in Africa-should not only concede to a foreign state the right to shoot down any of its citizens found on Spanish territory under suspicious circumstances , but actually declare war against them in a proclamation , converting them into ferce naturce , to be huntcd by two-legged and four-legged bloodhounds , and employ its naval force in arresting every attempt to assist a people who it was presumed were about to struggle in a cause hallowed by our own example ? Yet such is actually the case . Following in the wake of England , in this , as in everything else , with abject servility , the present whig administration has not only slily and insidiously , but openly and directly discouraged the progicss of liberty everywhere , except among the negroes , and now stands before the world , not as the champion of human rights , but of human wrongs . While shutting its eyes to the gross violation of law in Boston , New-York , Pennsylvania , and all over the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it displays all its energies in discouraging and repressing the struggles of white men for the attainment of the same boon . Its subsidized organs and official dependants , in all parts of the country , instead of expressing sympathy for the fate of their countrymen , whose published letters , written at the very muzzles of the guns pointed at their hearts , show that they were of the stuff of which heroes are made , take pleasure in stigmatizing them as common freebooters , cut-throats and pirates , animated only by the love of plunder , and destitute of every sentiment as well as motive , that might offer the slightest excuse for their conduct . Even the organs of Spanish falsehood and deception have not dared to accuse these men of committing any depredations on private property , or offering the least insult or violence to the inhabitants , although suffering the extreme of hunger as well as provocation . All clap their hands and shout for joy ; all raise the language of British scribes and Spanish officials , in triumphantly announcing , that again , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despotism , and her wrongs perp etuated . The organs of British freedom , which is exemplificd in the present deplorable moral , physical , and intellectual condition o*thc laboring classes of that country , and the representatives of American freedom at Washington , have forbidden the people of the United States even to sympathize with their butchered brethren , or in the cause for which they suffered . It appears fi-om their dying declarations , that they were deceived by the representations of others , aided probably by their own self-deception . They undoubtedly believed that they would be joined by a much greater number of their countrymen than accompanied them ; and what is far more important to their justification , they believed that a majority of the people of Cuba were impatient of despotism , and stood on tip-toe ready to join them the moment they*appeared in arms on the island . Had this been really the case , they would not only have been acquitted of madness and folly , but there can be little doubt , that success would have converted them from pirates and robbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always judge of undertakings by their success ; and our feelingr are more apt to be enlisted in behalf of those who perish in a noble cause than of those who triumph in a bad one . But the loyal and orthodox British scribes , who give the tone to our whi administration , and expound for us the principles of international law , and teach us the sublime doctrines of universal philanthropy-if not by their example , at least by their precepts-have consigned the memory of these gallant victims to infamy , and we , the people of the United States , must not shed a tear over the spot where they lay buried , like dogs , in ditches , lest we , too , should be denounced as pirates , robbers , and cutthroats . What though La Fayette came in aid of the people of the United States when struggling for fr9edom , and when his government was bound by its obligations of neutrality to England , as firmly as the United States are at this moment bound to Spain ? What though Montgomery , Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were either natives of England , or of countries at peace with England , when they gave their services , some of them their lives , to a country engaged in an attempt to throw off the fetters of colonial dependence 3 What though General Devereux , a subject of England , raised a regiment under the very nose of the government , in open day , and embarked in open day , intentionally to aid // the people of Mexico in their attempt to cast off the Spanish yoke ? What though the Swiss Cantons have for ages past , hired out their soldiers to any power that chose to buy them to fight against nations with whom they were at peace ? What thou6h England purchased the troops of Hesse Cassel , at so much a head , to assist in subjugating the people of the New World ? And what though we read of innumerable instances of distinguished men of all countries entering into the service of foreign nations at war with each other , while their own government was neutral , either with a view to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the love of glory ? None of these cases were held to be a violation of neutrality , nor were those , thus employed , stigmatized as pirates and outlaws , and when taken prisoners , quartered , or shot in cold blood , without trial , without preparation for death , or Christian burial . Yet , the very governments which encouraged or permitted , or were parties to these violations of neutrality , are now the loudest in their denunciations of the people of the United States , because a few of our citizens became volunteers in an attempt to aid a people they believed were engaged , or about to engage , in a great struggle for freedom . Had they enlisted in the cause of despotism-4-had they embarked in a crusade against liberty , they would have been canonized in the same quarter , as heroes and martyrs . We do not cite these examples as cases directly in point , but to show that the obligations of neutrality have heretofore been considered as strictly national , and involve no duty beyond that of abstainit*g @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of belligerents . No government can justly be held responsible for the violation of neutrality by private individuals , acting without its authority , or at least encouragement . It is impossible to prevent frequent instances of this kind , except by imposing such restraints on the actions of private individuals as interfere with their personal freedom , their lawful business , and their blameless inclinations . And it is equally impossible to carry these into effect , without instituting a system of official espionage , accompanied by all those peevish precautions which the fears and jealousies of European despotism have adopted against a discontented people , impatient of long-continued abuses . This is most especially the case in the United States , where the law is so chary of the personal rights of citizens , and the government has no great standing army at its disposal , to enforce the observance or the violation of laws ; where every citizen can go where he pleases , without a pass to be supervised by any petty official , which , when acting in opposition to the popular feeling , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest in the world . Let it not be supposed that we deem lightly of the obligations of neutrality ; on the contrary , we consider them indispensable to the prevention of general and universal wars between civilized nations . At the same time , we maintain that these obligations have their limits , and that no government has a right to enact laws for their preservation in direct violation of the general principles on which it is founded . It is a dangerous policy to create new crimes by making new laws , or to infringe the personal rights of the citizens generally , for the attainment of a particular object , though that object may be highly important and praiseworthy . Such we consider the late law of Congress , passed solely in reference to a particular case , but equally applicable to all similar cases . It confounds a mere intention with an actual violation of neutrality , and punishes the act before it is committed . What is still more objectionable , it places every citizen at the mercy // of official suspicion , and may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obnoxious individual , as in the case of Governor Quitman . It is sufficient to say that he contemplates a violation of neutrality , and he may be arrested , his property seized , be held to bail , or imprisoned in default , and subjected to all the expense , disgrace , and vexation of a trial in which the whole weight of government influence is brought to bear against him . His personal or political enemies have only to get up a charge of intention , and he is , for the time being , placed out of the way effectually . This is exemplified in the late New-Orleans tria.ls , in not one of which was there any sufficient evidence , even of intention , to establish their guilt . Governor Quitman was arrested while in the actual exercise of his official functions as chief magistrate of a sovereign state , and many other persons , brought before a court of justice , whose members are subjects of executive patronage , charged with a violation of this law . They were all , without exception , either acquitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney of the prosecutor , the government of the United States , against which they have no redress for slanderous imputations and false imprisonments . It may be , and has been asserted , that these men were undoubtedly guilty of the intentions charged against them ; but that such was the state of public feeling in New-Orleans , that no jury could be found to convict them , even though the proof had been direct and positive . In cases like these , we are very apt to draw the conclusion , that such a general feeling among an entire community is much more likely to arise from a universal sense of right , than a resolution to maintain that which they know to be wr@ng . But we have seen no evidence of the truth of this sweeping charge against the New-Orleans juries , and have , therefore , a right to believe that the acquittal or release of the persons on trial before them , was owing to the want of evidence to establish their guilt , rather than a pre-determination to acquit them whether guilty or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline and downfall of liberty in all ages and nations , will recollect , that the first and most successful inroads on personal freedom , were made under pretence of maintaining law and order among the people . For this purpose it was said to be indispensable to extend the powers and strengthen the arm of government ; and all lovers of law and order were called upon to acquiesce in *tliese encroaehmenj*s on the general liberty , in order to guard against a particular evil , often imaginary , and as often created by ambi. * tious rulers , solely to justify the remedy . When they wished to restrain the people in the just exercise of their rights , they were first goaded into resistance , then charged with being licentious and ungovernable , and denounced as madmen , to justify their being chained . The apprehensions of the rich for their property , and the fears of the timid for their lives , were appealed to , and thus a large portion of the people became accomplices in robbing the other , to secure themselves . The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run mad ; and mankind became gradually divested , not only of the right to judge what was best for them in this world , but relieved from the care of their souls in that to come , by being compelled to adopt the creed of the sovereign . Thus , by a gradual process , they lost all the feelings and habits of freemen , in the total absence of all occasions for their exercise ; and at length it became no longer necessary to employ any other instrument in keeping them in subjection , but brute force . This is the usual progress in // all usurpations of power , and it most especially concerns the people of the United States , who are said to be emphatically a law-abiding people , to watch the progress of legislation ; for legislators are their sovereigns in fact , and they may be much more easily enslaved by insidious laws involving general principles fatal to liberty , than by great standing armies of hirelings led by ambitious rulers . Under pretence of suppressing piracy , and preserving neutrality , our government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehement desire to obtain the good graces of that of England , and the good word of its multifarious scribes , may embarrass the lawful commerce of the country , by recognizing the right of search on the high seas , on suspicion ; arrest a citizen in the prosecution of his lawful business on the land , to be imprisoned and tried , on suspicion ; declare him a pirate and outlaw , on suspicion ; and finally , employ that naval force whose proper business is to protect the commerce of the country , and defend its rights , in embarrassing that very commerce , and making war on its own citizens , to preserve peace with Spain . The truth is , that there is , at this moment , no nation or government so completely under foreign influence , as that of the United States . They seem to have no opinion of their own . British reviews and newspapers , known to be the paid oracles or servile depeiidents of some one or other member of the British ministry , the British aristocracy , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whence public opinion is disseminated through all parts of the Union , and furnish our rulers and statesmen with both argument and authority . The " Edinburgh and Quarterly , " the " London Times , " the " London Morning Chronicle , " and the " London News , " are our instructors in the law of nations , the principles of liberty , and the duties of philanthropy . If one of our distinguished statesmen wishes to enforce the adoption of a particular measure or line of policy , instead of inquiring whether it is favorable to the interests and happiness , or suitable to the present condition of the country , or in accordance with the principles on which this government is based , he cites the example of England , and fortifies himself in the impregnable intrenchments of British precedents . We all know , and all acknowledge , that the system of artificial expedients adopted by that government , to the entire exclusion , as far as possible , of those great influences through whose instrumentality Providence governs the world , has been pi-oductive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great portion of the people . We all know , that it has resulted in a vast system of monopoly , and converted that labor which is the source of all national wealth , into a half-starved pauper , dependent on the crumbs that fall from the rich man 's table . In short , we all know , from their own acknowledgments , their own official statements , that there is less of happiness , and more actual physical suffering and privation among the people of England and Ireland , than in any other region under the sun ; that England is in fact bankrupt , because she owes more than she can ever pay ; that , so far from possessing a shadow of practical freedom , her government is one of military despotism , which alone prevents a violent revolution ; and that she can only keep her head above water by exacting tribute from the world , and outraging the rights of every nation too weak to resist her aggressions . Add to this , that the government of Eng land is totally different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its geographical position is contrasted with ours ; that // one is an old superannuated nation , dependent on artificial expedients for a sickly existence ; the other a hale he arty youth in the prime of his vigor , and requiring neither pettifogging nor quackery to keep him alive . All this is notorious , evident , palpable . Yet , taking their cue from England , the government and a large portion of the people of the United States , have been stimulated into a course of policy which has shaken this confederation from one extremity to the other , and excited feelings which , if not speedily allayed , will rend it asunder . Under the same influence the *vhig administration of our government is , for aught we can see , blind or indifferent to the British policy in relation to Nicaragua and the Isthmus , which , if successfully carried out , , will enable England at once to arrest the most magnificent project of a Ship Canal across the continent , deprive the United States of a great portion of the advantages they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a position which would enable her to cripple their commerce at pleasure . It is evident that England will not i'elinquistr the protectorate of the Mosquitoes , unless the government of the United States takes a decisive stand on that question . But we propose to enter fully into this most important subject on some future occasion , and will here leave it for the present . This base subserviency to British opinions , which are always the offspring of British interests , is one of the most pernicious influences operatin* , against the interests and dignity of this confederation , and the progress of free principles . Not the Emperor of Russia , or he of Austria , is so dangerous a foe to the liberties of mankind , as England . The gov eminent of that country , while pretending to the enjoyment of liberty at home , and to sympathize in its struggles abroad , is at the same time laboring with a sly , insidious hypocrisy everywhere to discourage its progress , by its literature , its money , and its power . Its leading newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who pretend to know the secret springs of European policy , and play into the hands of their employers , by giving whatever coloring they please to the actions of kings , and the movements of the people , which latter they at one time represent as rational and justifiable struggles for their rights ; at another , as the mere ebullitions of an ignorant , licentious ferocity , impatient of all proper restraint , and arrayed against every principle of order and good government . Jn* the former case , you may be sure that the movement in some way coincides with the interests or policy of the British government ; in the other , that it interferes with them , either directly or indirectly . This is equally the key to its denunciations of the one , and its sympathy for the other . Every intelligent observer must see with half an eye the motive for all this hubbub on the part of the British scribes , on the subject of the violation of our neutrality in relation to Cuba . It is not that England disapproves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any regard to the faith of treaties , or the interests of that power , but that she fears its subsequent annexation to the United States , whose growth and prosperitY she watches with a sleepless , malignant jealousy , as the sure forerunner of the decline and downfall of her boasted pie-eminence in arms , in arts , and in commerce . It is here the shoe pinches . There is no danger that Hungary will be annexed , and therefore she pretends to sympathize with the Hungarians ; there is great danger that Cuba may be , and therefore she denounces all those who afford her either assistance or sympathy . // These newspapers and reviews are the great oracles of our comrnercial cities , as previously observed . Nine times in ten , the first news we get from Europe is copied from the London Times , the great Choryph*us of the civilized world , whose editor , if not a jesuit , is certainly a disciple of Ignatius Loyola . He is a perfect Mrs. Candour in politics , and , more than any avowed and open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by occasionally pretending to excuse or defend them . Now and then , indeed , he gives them a good word , and affects a marked civility , but it is only to give the more efibet to his sarcasms and inuendoes , and more venom and point to his sly malignity . Yet the opinions and statements of this paper , being tacitly adopted by our commercial city organs , or at least copied without contradiction and without comment , are disseminated through every vein and artery of the country . They ascend our rivers ; they fly on our steamers and railroads ; they penetrate the deep forests of the *iXrest , and everywhere propagate British opinions and British politics , both which are equally at war with the principles of liberty and the interests of our country . These organs of British opinions and British interests , we firmly believe , have at this moment far more influence over what is called the most enlightened class in the United States , and especially over our doughty whig statesmen , than the lessons of wisdom and experience coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under this influence , the present whig administration has displayed a freezing indifference , if not hostility , to any movement in behalf of the independence of Cuba , and that too before the conduct of the degeneratQ creoles afforded grounds for the belief that they were content under their present colonial degradation , and did not aspire to become independent . But however appearances may justify this conclusion , we are not prepared to acquiesce in it implicitly . In the first place , it is believed there is no American citizen , imbued with the great principles of liberty and equality , and who is acquainted with Cuba , who will pretend to deny that the system of government inflicted on the people of that island , is not , at least according to their ideas , oppressive , insulting , and tyrannical , inasmuch as it entails civil disabilities and degradation on them in almost every form . It is the despotism of a monarch , distant thousands of miles administered through the instrumentality of dependent governors , the tenure of whose office is implicit obedience to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his officers , and of all those exercising authority under him , the people have no more voice or influence than those of the moon . On the contrary , there is one instance , at least , of a captain-general being recalled , for seeking to make himself popular , by consulting the wishes of the people . This , if we do n't mistake , was at least the case with General Tacon . Be this as it may : the captain-general of Cuba is entirely independent of the people . If he oppresses them , or if he outrages the laws of humanity , and becomes another Haynau , by butchering his prisoners in cold blood , and without trial , it is enough that he acts by command of his sovereign , whose au thority is pleaded as a full justification , and whose will is law . Now we would ask our countrymen , at least those who hold that all lawful authority emanates from the people , and should be exercised for their benefit , whether they believe , whether they can conceive the pos. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the common feelings of our nature , so besotted with a devotion to arbitrary power , so // enamored of degradation and chains , as not to wish to be relieved from the pressure of such a leaden despotism ? Is it , we ask , is it not in direct opposition to our own experience of our own feelings , as well as the universal feeling of all mankind , to presume , that those who suffer will not ardently wish for relief ? Does not the very worm turn , when trod upon , unless crushed to death ? Is not human nature everywhere the same , and is not its common object the pursuit of happiness , so large a portion of which depends on being well governed ? Does the Gulf Stream separate man from his fellow-man , and cause the Spaniard of Cuba to be totally insensible to those grievances which make the blood of an American boil ? No ! the native of Cuba is not more insensible than the worm ; and we firmly believe , that when the period arrives which offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acquire freedom and independence , they will rise and vindicate themselves from the charge of abject , willing submission to the tyranny of the mother country , in spite of English newspapers , and their disciples , our whig statesmen. * There can be no doubt , however , that the great body of the Creoles of Cuba are not only depressed in spirit by a long course of misgovernment , and , what is still more unfavorable to the anticipation of their rising , in a great degree under the influence of the priests of a Church , which everywhere , and at all times , in the old world and in the new , has been an inflexible foe to the progress of liberal principles , and the establishment of civil and religious liberty . A long habit of submission to wrong or indignity , coupled with long-continued abject subserviency to the despotism of a Church which inculcates implicit obedience , is very apt to degenerate at last into a sort of imbecile dullness not easily excited to action ; an insensibility hard to awaken into any powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of Cuba may , for aught we know , be under the influence of this species of suspended animation ; but for our part , we believe that other causes contributed not only to prevent their co-operation with Lopez , but prompted them to take sides against him , as is asserted in the late letter of Mr. Van Veebten , whose view of the subject is , we can not help suspecting , not a little influenced by a feeling of gratitude for the very singular , not to say unaccountable clemency displayed by Don Jose de la Concha in his behalf . Other causes may be adduced to account for the total inaction of the Cubans in behalf of Lopez in the first instance , and their reported hostility in the second . First : the bloody , barbarous threat of letting loose their slaves against them . Second : the fear of exemplary punishment in case of co-operation , and the certainty that it would be inflicted with all the inflexible severity of Spanish vengeance . Third , . and most weighty of all : the hopelessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclamation of our President , outlawing every American citizen enlisted in their cause , and placing him at the mercy of any body who chose to hunt him down as a beast of prey . We do not hesitate to say , that the President of the United States stands at this moment responsible , not only for the butchery of his countrymen , but for the failure of the attempt to give liberty to Cuba . He has , for the present , preserved his neutrality with Spain , only at the sacrifice of the first duty of every government , // that of protection to its citizens . Had Lopez landed with a sufficient force , and sufficient supplies to justify the anticipation of success , the people of Cuba would , in all human probability , have set these menaces at nought , and joined him . But he came with a mere handful of men , without an adequate supply of arms and ammunition , of both which the inhabitants were destitute , and there was nothing to inspire a reasonable hope of success . That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be wondered at . It was natural , when all circumstances are considered ; although we can not forbear observing , that those who are governed by such motives and such fears , will never , while they cherish them , achieve their liberty . They must risk all , to save all . This inaction , and alleged subsequent hostility on the part of the Cubans , was , however , fatal to Lopez and his followers . Had they joined him in any considerable numbers , and furnished him with provisions , the result would have been very different . Revolutions are often miracles , which are believed to be impossible until their accomplishment . Even the storm of rain , which rend*red their arms and ammunition useless , may have been decisive of the fate of Lopez and his followers . Let us do a little more justice to both , than has been meted out to them by the strenuous admirers of legitimate government . Many of them were Poles , without home , without country , and without any government on earth to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their rights trampled under foot , and their property confiscated by a combination of hungry despots , leagued together in the unholy cause of plunder and devastation . They had become citizens of the world ; exiles and wanderers , who , finding no resting place in the old , had sought refuge in the new . Is it a matter of surprise , that persons thus cut loose from the rest of mankind , and set adrift by the exercise of an arbitrary usurped power , should join the standard of liberty wherever it was unfurled , and make eternal warfare against despotism wherever it existed ? Others of these adventurers were Hungarians , companions of Kossuth , and , like him , victims to arbitrary power . But by far the larger portion were Americans , our countrymen , a majority of whom were men of education , connected with families of the first respectability , and imbued with high heroic feelings and principles . Who gave us the right to say that these men were exclusively influenced by a love of plunder and a passion for blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining the hue and cry of pirates , robbers , cut-throats , and outlaws , raised against them by the organs of British policy and Spanish despotism , and echoed by those of our whig administration . The common feelings of humanity might , lead us to lament the fate of hecatombs of our brave countrymen , helonging to that class which gathered such green laurels in Mexico , and were hunted by bloodhounds , manacled like felons , and shot down like dogs , by scores at a time , in cold blood ; and buried like dogs , after their remains were outraged arid mutilated by the rabble of Havana . But with these we are forbidden to sympathize , and nothing remains for us but to rejoice that Spanish despotism is established in Cuba , and the " Fillibusters " offered up at its bloody shrines . Be it so . Time will decide whether they were pirates and cut-throats , or heroes and patriots ; and , for the present , to time we leave them . Whatever may have been their lives , the mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , one would think might at least call forth the sympathies , if // not the applause of their countrymen . If they committed a crime in going forth to succor what they undoubtedly believed to he an oppressed people about to assert their freedom , they have paid the forfeit . Let their ashes rest in peace . If we can not approve their actions , we may at least be permitted to lament their fate . On General Lopez we will bestow a few parting words . He has been called a fool or a madman , and what is of more consequence , accused of having wilfully deceived his followers by false representations of the disposition of the Cubans , coupled with exaggerations of the , number of his adherents in the United States . He must indeed have been a fool or a madman to have done this . Embarked in the same vessel , exposed to the same dangers , and certain of the same fate if the expedition was unsuccessful , what possible motive could he have had for deception ? If deception was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either a device of Spanish policy to lure him into premature action , or of heartless speculators for their own private purposes . Unquestionably Lopez was himself deceived in relying on the co-operation of the Cubans , who in turn were probably deceived as to the amount of aid they would receive from the United States . Until new facts are brought to light , we must be content to remain in doubt and darkness on the subject . As for Narcisso Lopez , we affirm that he was neither pirate nor cutthroat , madman nor fool . We are neither afraid nor ashamed to say , that as earnest well-wishers to the freedom of mankind , we have watched his motions with the deepest interest , wished him success most sincerely , and as sincerely now lament his fate . And why should we not ? Shall we Americans , whose ancestors gained immortal glory by suc*ess in precisely the same cause in which he perished , be called on at this day to stigmatize his name and his memory as a lehder of pirates and freebooters ? Shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pulaski , Dc KaIb , Steuben , and Montgomery , in honored and grateful remembrance , and who , in coming to our aid , committed the same violation of Messrs . Fillmore and Webster 's great principle of neutrality , triumph in the fate of Crittenden , Kerr , and the rest of their countrymen , alike volunteers in the cause of freedom ? We assert that such is the requisition of our own government , echoed by the sentiments of Americans . If we do not mistake , the time is not very distant when , instead of being derided as rash fools or slandered as outlaWs arid pirates , they will be classed with those illustrious martyrs to liberty , who , though they perished themselves , prepared the way for the apotheosis of the goddess . Narcisso Lopez fought bravely , and died bravely . At first we were inclined to blame him for suffering himself to be taken alive , when , in our opinion , he should have died like a Poman . But it since appears that he was scented by bloodhounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by long-continued fatigue and hunger . His last words , the instant jhe iron-collar was about to be placed about his neck , were , " I die for cuba .
