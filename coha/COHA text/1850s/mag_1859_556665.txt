" For nearly half a century it had to struggle with a lingering attachment to one of the " former translations . " But from the Restoration , in 1660 , to the present hour , the Bible of 1611 has been the most authentic expression of the Word of God to the mass of Christians speaking the English tongue . It has been domesticated by emigration on every continent . The earlier versions have become antiquated , and newer ones have been either shamed into oblivion , or allowed , at best , to be helps in the study of this . This is " the English Bible , " while others are barely Bibles in English . In this respect its fate differs noticeably from that of its predecessors . Within a century before its appearance no less than six versions or revisions of the Bible in English had been published , one of which was but slowly superseded by it . But it has found no successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , unaffected by the greatest revolutions , attracting to itself an increasing measure of veneration and love . It has taught letters to children , eloquence to men , religion to all . In literature it is our great English classic . In religion it is our " daily bread . " This more than classic pre-eminence is due to various causes . The preceding century had been an era of great mental and moral activity , directed by religions motives or in the name of religion . The politics of Europe sprang from reformation and counter-reformation in the Church . Theology as yet was not only the noblest , but almost the only science . The standard of Biblical scholarship was high , relatively much higher than at present . But with the seventeenth century began the stirring of those secular agitations , which have seldom slept since , and are still active . From the civil war to the settlement of the Hanoverian succession , politics ruled in the Church quite as much as the Church ruled in politics . A kind of leadership was demanded that asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here and there a scholar , whose achievements received about as intelligent ad-16 // miration from the majority of his clerical brethren as the polyglot attainments of our " Learned Blacksmith " may be supposed to have excited among his fellow-craftsmen . What little learning the eighteenth century gave to the cause of Christianity in England was chiefly expended upon apologetics , and at its close both theology and criticism had sunk to a very low estate . The great Evangelical revival which followed the birth of Methodism , indeed , made religion once more a power in society . But this was the fruit of devotion rather than of learning , and relied for its success upon the impression of those elementary spiritual truths which no erudite research is requisite , or even able of itself , to discover . A few great names , as of Mill , Lowth , and Campbell , light up what is mainly an age of decline in critical learning . The work of Bible translation naturally came to a stand . The authors of the received version laid , indeed , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving on the work of their predecessors . They professed to have made " honest and Christian endeavors " after " a more exact translation . " There is no reason to suppose that they expected their own work to be exempt from a similar revising process , or ever flattered themselves with the hope that it would receive the unqualified veneration of ages . But there was at first no demand for improvement , and afterwards there were few who could have answered the demand had it been made . Thus time was given for its words to sink into men 's hearts , till they have come to fashion the very texture of thought . But it would be unjust to represent its extraordinary success as due wholly or mainly to accidental causes . Its great excellence is a more evident and more honorable reason . The era at which it was made was most fortunate for its merits and its fame . The " old masters " of our literature had moulded and enriched our rude vernacular , and made it for mingled strength and sweetness the noblest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who were among the choicest spirits of their times , and the compilation of the Book of Common Prayer , had done for the English what the Seventy , the Jewish philosophers , and the Christian Apostles and Fathers did for the Greek , and what Tertullian and Cyprian // did for the Latin tongue . A doctrinal and devotional dialect was formed , - a fit medium for expressing those ideas which Divine inspiration had brought within the reach of human intelligence , - and this dialect became the common property of the people . The translators of King James were late enough to secure the ripe fruit of these invaluable labors . They were equally fortunate in being early enough to escape those influences which have made our la*nguage at once more ductile to the varied purposes of modern usage , and less fitted for the highest offices of eloquence , poetry , and devotion . More than all , they lived when the martyr age of English Protestantism was fresh in memory . The words of the old Bibles which they " compared and revised " were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense religious earnestness of the men who wrote them , - men who plied their pious task in prison or in exile , with visions of the rack and the stake interposed between them and their heavenly consummation . Our English Bible is the Bible as interpreted by scholars who represented the best learning of a learned age , and whose characters were formed under the influence of a piety refined in the fiery furnace of persecution . Its diction , if not faultless , is yet the best example of the power and compass of our language . It has come to us without essential amendment , because its great positive excellences have caused its defects and blemishes to be viewed with more than the tenderness that forgives the faults of a beloved friend . To this general sentiment there have been some illustrious exceptions ; but the utter listlessness with which the public have received all suggestions of revising the version must have been discouraging to their authors . After men of the calibre of Lowth , Kennicott , Newcombe , Waterland , Wesley , and Campbell have declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in it , to the signal advantage of religion , and their words have failed to awaken the slightest audible echo , it might have seemed that the English Bible , faults and all , had been accepted by English-speaking Protestants " for better , for worse , " to the end of time . Had any one predicted , as lately as ten years ago , that by this time sufficient public interest would be felt in the project of revis // ing our translation to call forth works such as are named at the beginning of this article ( to say nothing of many others , with the enumeration of whose titles it seemed not worth while to cumber the page ) , to call into existence large societies , with funds liberally provided by popular contribution , and to engage the co-operation of some , and the respectful attention of more , of the best Biblical scholars on either side of the Atlantic , he would have , been pronounced a visionary . Yet such is the fact . It may be that the present agitation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attachment to our Bible as it is ; but it seems evident that this conclusion will be resisted by many until they can at least understand " the reason why . " Possibly some will be more disposed to inquire why the question is raised at all , and what can be the occasion of so unexpected a degree of interest in its discussion at this time . If we believed it to be one of those epidemics of public caprice to which we seem to be increasingly liable , we could afford to leave it , with other ephemera , to those who " spend their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing . " But such , we are satisfied , is not the fact . It is a serious question to many minds , and among them some of the first min.ds in England and America , whether it is not our duty to endeavor to make the best version of the Scriptures still better . The interests involved in the determination of this question are too important to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its merits . The apparent cause of the movement was humble enough , - a schism in the " American and Foreign Bible Society , " an organization originated by a secession of the main body of the Baptists from the support of the American Bible Society . The denomination was by no means a unit in the action by which a rival society was organized , and in 1850 that society was itself rent asunder by a proposition to publish an amended version of the New Testament in the English language . Thus originated the American Bible Union , having for its object the revision of the English Scriptures and the publication of " pure versions " in other languages . It might well be thought , as it was by most lookers-on , that this division and // subdivision of a denomination , on what seemed to be merely a question of sectarian policy , could have no effect on the Christian public at large , nor any good effect upon those immediately concerned in it . But from this inauspicious beginning a new impulse has been given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only an aspiration of individuals , has become a matter of popular interest . Men like the late Professor Scholefleld and Archdeacon Hare had modestly suggested the desirableness of an amended version , without any sensible effect . But the announcement that what had beer only desiderated was actually to be attempted , had the effect to give courage to some who had hardly ventured to speak , and to arouse others who might have been indifferent . The question has come to enlist the attention of numbers who know very little of the history or movements of the American Bible Union , until such scholars as Dean Trench and the Five Clergymen think it no condescension to look into the matter . So far as we can judge by the most obvious indications , the interest is more general in England than in this country . We see no evidence that there is in either country a very numerous party in favor of the measure ; but it has more friends than the most sanguine would have looked for a few years ago . For such a turn of opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the sectarian activity of a fraction of a sect . That , of itself , would have tended to make the whole matter odious . If there were not a feeling extensively diffused , a train laid which needed only a spark to kindle it , there would have been no such kindling as we now witness . And whoever will attentively consider the condition and tendencies of Biblical study for the last thirty years , and its relations to popular religious instruction , can not fail to observe an unconscious preparation for the entertainment of this question . So far from wondering at the popular interest which , as Dean Trench observes , " differences the present agitation of the matter from preceding ones , " we might rather have anticipated an earlier and more general attention to it , at least in this country . The depressed state of critical learning in England during // the last century had its counterpart here , but from a different cause . The influence of President Edwards turned nearly all the more active thinkers on religion to the pursuit of metaphysical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Original Sin , and his most important practical work , on the Religious Affections , alike and almost equally invited thoughtful men from study of the written revelation to scrutiny of their own souls . Not that Edwards was wanting in reverence for the Scriptures , or in the proper mental and spiritual aptitudes for their successful interpretation . But his own experience and the stress of circumstances concurred to give his powers another direction , and the immense force which he exerted upon his contemporaries and the rising ministry determined most aspiring minds into the same line . Thence arose that school of New England theology , whose direct development may be said to have been brought to its ultimate result by the clear insight and dauntless logic of Emmons . But an influence had been meanwhile arising in another quarter , and preparing to work a complete revolution . The German mind began to come into communication with that of England and America . Much as our Teutonic cousins have to answer for in some respects , especially for the unbelieving and irreverent spirit which too many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided flavor of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , we owe them a lines deleted // was possible to the best scholars of the seventeenth century . And there are scholars to use them with effect . lie who compares the commentaries now current with what were deemed , fifty years ago , the most valuable helps to clerical study in the English language , whatever merits of the old-school annotators he may miss , can not fail to recognize the fruits of a more generous culture than was known in the last or attainable in any preceding age . The effect of this progress has not been confined to any narrow class of learned men . It has pervaded the religious community . Not that gill the people or all the clergy are advanced scholars , but scholarship is more worthily appreciated by both . Higher qualifications are sought by candidates for the ministry , and are demanded by the laity . By a happy coincidence , simultaneously with this revival of interest in sacred learning , there has taken place among us a revival ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense ) of experimental and practical religion , awakening a greater zeal for the diffusion and enforcement of spiritual truth . The Biblical instruction of the young has come to be more systematically pursued . An impulse has been given to the creation of a Biblical literature for the people . The amount and increasing value of popular works for the aid of Bible-students can hardly be estimated by one who has not had occasion to observe with some care their number and character . In these general statements we are anxious to be understood as speaking comparatively , and in contrast with the condition of things in the past . Tried by a standard of absolute excellence , comparing what is accomplished with what is desirable or ideally possible , we " have not attained . " Or , if we inquire whether the men of our time have improved their advantages as faithfully as the men of the seventeenth century did theirs , it may appear that we have nothing to boast of . By as much as the materials for sound critical knowledge have been multiplied , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their use . Still , - and this is all that concerns our present purpose , - it is certain that the English version , after the lapse of more than two hundred years , does not adequately represent what is known of the meaning of the Scriptures . // Now , without intending such an effect , and very generally without being aware of it , the votaries of sacred learning have been criticising our version , and making its imperfections notorious . Any interpretation of the original which involves a departure from the sense of the English text , is a criticism of the latter , whether formally stated or not . Every theological seminary is a college of revisers . The professors teach , and the pupils study , the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures . The vernacular Bible is not expressly disparaged , nor even irreverently thought of , but as an authority it is quietly set aside . The commentaries referred to are founded on the original , not on the translated Scriptures . This tendency affects all departments of study . The instructor in systematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lecturer on church polity must define *K'cXio1a , and investigate anew the passages touching the offices and duties of bishops , elders , and deacons . The youthful theologues carry with them into the ministry the habits acquired in the divinity school . A sensible preacher xviii of course avoid pedantic displays of learning in the pulpit . But if he is an honest man , he can not promulgate what he believes to be erroneous interpretations of the Word of God . Whether he quotes Greek in his sermons or not , his people will soon find out that their pastor does not regard the English version as inspired . Dr. Trench seems to suppose that this thought would be a novelty to the mass of the people . He says - " We must never leave out of sight that for a great multitude of readers the English Version is riot the translation of an inspired Book , but is itself the inspired Book The English Bible is to them all which the hebrew Old Testament , which the Greek New Testament , is to the devout scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have never realized the fact that the Divine utterance was not made at the first in those very English words which they read in their cottages , and hear in their church . " - pp. 174 , 175 . These remarks may be just , as applied to rural congregations in England , but they are of very limited application here . If the title-pages of their Bibles and Testaments did not hint to them the existence of certain " original tongues " and of " former translations , " the people would be at no loss to find // out the fact in other ways . Even in England , judging by the practice of eminent divines , men must be exceedingly dull of hearing to escape information on this point . Archbishop Whately , in his " Lectures addressed to his Parishioners by a Country Pastor , " is profuse of amended translations , some of them extremely felicitous . Instances of the same freedom appear in the sermons of William Archer Butler . In the Occasional Sermons of Dr. John Harris we find a discourse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rom. i. 16 , 17 : For lam not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ' ; it is that through which the power of God is manifested in saving every one that believes - to the Jew first - to him it is offered in the first instance - and also to the Greek ' - or Gentile . For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith ' - therein is revealed to our faith the doctrine of justification , or acceptance with God - of interest in a Divine righteousness , acquired by faith alone . As it is written ' - in the Old Testament - the just by faith shall live . ' " - p. 1 . Here , besides the mixture of exposition , the careful reader will notice that in the last clause the words " by faith " are made to connect themselves grammatically with " just , " which is used as equivalent to the participle just Vied , giving to the clause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith shall live . " While the minister is thus engaged in amending the translation , and publishing his emendations from the pulpit , the people are favored with more elaborate essays to the same purpose in the books they study . The most popular commentaries interpret the original Scriptures . Professor Bush 's learned notes on the Pentateuch , thickly studded with Hebrew and Rabbinical quotations , ( each duly rendered into English , ) are designed " for popular use . " Mr. Barnes 's notes on the entire New Testament , and on several important books of the Old Testament , were avowedly composed for common readers of the Bible , and in some of them nearly every verse is re-translated . Of these and similar works , thousands of copies are circulated . They are found all over the land , in the possession of teachers and advanced pupils in Sunday // schools . New contributions to the stock of popular expository works are made every year , and it is noticeable that they are increasingly critical in their character . The authors ostensibly comment on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their own independent translations . We recently watched with interest a group of young persons studying their Sabbath lesson , guided by a " question-book , " and aided by a volume of notes on the New Testament . They studied socially , one reading a question aloud , and the others searching for an answer . The commentator whose notes they used had evidently written from a study of the Greek . For half an hour we listened in vain for evidence that they once looked at the thin margin of text at the top of his pages . So far from making the English Bible the object of study , they did not pay it the compliment of a reference . We believe that this scene was only an example of what is going on weekly in places innumerable . Is it surprising , then , that the proposal to revise our version , so as to add to its other excellences the merit of more faithfully exhibiting the meaning of the sacred writers , should be received with increasing favor ? The only object of a translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are unable to read it for themselves ; and if men are taught that the version in their hands fails to do this , it would seem that their most obvious conclusion must be in favor of a new or corrected version . This is in fact just such a proposal as is most likely to be received with approbation by the popular mind . It is only men of rare scholarship who are able so to comprehend the work of translation as to appreciate its difficulties . Common minds know nothing of this , but they are abundantly capable of understanding the desirableness of the object . If they believe the Bible to contain the Word of God , they have the highest possible interest in its contents , * A minister of the Baptist denomination , graduated at a New England col. lege , proposed at first to enter the ministry , as many of his brethren have done , without a special theological and exegetical course of study . His purpose was changed in consequence of the embarrassment he experienced from his ignorance of the Hebrew language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the Old Testament . He had commentaries , - but so had they . // and can not be indifferent to the question whether it is accurately translated . An erroneous version is worse than none , for it may mislead them . A defective version is diminished in value in proportion to the amount of defect with which it is chargeable . Such men would not be prone to suspect the authenticity of the common translation , and would never have originated a movement for correcting it . But the matter once brought to their notice , it is naturally seized upon and tenaciously adhered to . They are likely to be far more incredulous of difficulties . " What ! " we have heard an unlettered Christian exclaim , " do you say that our version can not be made better ? You think yourself able to correct it , and have often done so . The commentaries you study correct it . You are all of you ready enough to do this for yourselves , why can you not do it for us ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . When first organized , it made a schism in the denomination in which it originated . Against it were arrayed their most respectable scholars , their most popular and influential preachers , their literary and theological seminaries , and the principal presses under their control , while other churches and sects looked on with mingled pity and disgust . But the people in considerable numbers gathered around it , and have sustained it . Its treasury has been well supplied with funds , and its operations have hardly been impeded for a day . Its influence has overleaped sectarian boundaries . Men of high and deserved reputation , who were hostile or indifferent , have come to identify themselves with the enterprise . It has not indeed attained to a flattering popularity . The opposition to it is very great . But it is steadily gaining friends . The movement , though not rapid , is mainly in the direction towards success . We see nothing in experience , or in present indications , to justify the belief that it is likely to be arrested by anything short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization may not endure , but the agitation in some form will continue . What duty is imposed upon us by this state of facts ? It seems to us very clear , that we can not and ought not to rest content with things as they are , but that the duty and re // sponsibility of at least attempting a revision must be met . It may be an unwelcome , as it must be a difficult duty . We might perhaps prefer that the question had never been raised . But it is here , and it claims to be soberly dealt with . It is not by the American Bible Union , nor Mr. Ellicott , nor any other man or body of men , that the necessity is laid upon us , but by Divine Providence , by the inflexible logic of events . Whether we will or no , we are fast tending towards a state of things in which the English Bible , as it is , must part with a portion of the reverence in which it has been held . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet Bible , the spring of holy and consoling thoughts , the storehouse of sacred eloquence , the inspirer and the liturgy of prayer and praise . But it is not , in the degree in which it once was , the authoritative Scripture . It is not , or it is fast ceasing to be , the minister 's study Bible . It is not the book which the commentator expounds . With every advance in the popularizing of Biblical interpretation , it must come to be less and less regarded as the real source of popular religious instruction . How long can this process go on , and not withdraw from it , to a very injurious extent , the reverence of the people ? The duty of revision , we have said , and the word was not lightly chosen . This is a matter which rises infinitely above any question of inclination or taste . If our vernacular Bible were merely a book of . English literature , a proposal to attempt an improvement upon it might well excite astonishment . All that is so often said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of its preciousness as an English classic , would be in place . But when we receive it as a book of religious authority , we can accept it in that character only as it conveys to us the true meaning of the inspired original . If the version is imperfect , and its imperfections are remediable , there is a presumptive obligation to amend it . The burden rests upon those who resist , to prove that revision is either unnecessary or impracticable . This seems to be forgotten by some , who exclaim against " innovation , " as if they really believed that King James 's Bible was older than the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures . The words of Dean Trench on this point are very much to the purpose : - // " Nothing is gained , on the one band , by vague and general charges of inaccuracy brought against our Yersion ; they require to be supported by detailed proofs . Nothing , on the other hand , is gained by charges and insinuations against those who urge a revision , as though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith of England As little is the matter advantaged , or in any way brought nearer to a settlement , by sentimental appeals to the fact that this , which it is now proposed to alter , has been the Scripture of our childhood , in which we , and so many generations before us , first received the tidings of everlasting life . All this , well as it may deserve to be considered , yet , as argument at all deciding the question , will sooner or later have to be cleared away ; and the facts of the case , apart from cries , and insinuations , and suggestions of evil motives , and appeals to the religious passions and prejudices of the day , - apart , too , from feelings which in themselves demand the highest respect , - will have to be dealt with in that spirit of seriousness and earnestness which a matter affecting so profoundly the whole moral and spiritual life of the English people , not to speak of nations which are yet unborn , abundantly deserves . " - pp. 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated , - that revision is unnecessary , - though very commonly taken , we must regard it as a strange one to be so much as admitted by Protestant Christians . We are told that , although our version is in some points inaccurate or obscure there are no grave and essential errors " in it . " The scholar can resort to the original , and , if need be , communicate to others the results of his studies . " * " The rule of faith " for the laity , then , is to be , not the Scriptures , but the Scriptures plus the priest or " doctor . " We are concerned to know by what gauge any part of a Divine revelation is ascertained to be superfluous . We should presume that the teachings of Scripture concerning the future state deserve to be ranked among those of the greatest moment . Is there no ambiguity in the language of our version on that subject , which might be removed by a more accurate translation ? It happens by a curious , almost a whimsical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for errors of translation comes oftenest from men who hold to the verbal inspiration of the Bible . A distinguished theo * Bibliotheca Sacra , Andover , April , 1858 , p. 287. // logian of the Presbyterian Church , who has been conspicuous in denouncing a departure from even the punctuation and chapter-headings - why not the spelling also ? - of King James 's translators , holds the following language - " We can understand how a man can regard the Bible as a mere human composition ; we can understand how he can regard inspiration as a mere elevation of the religious consciousness ; but how any one can hold that the sacred writers were inspired as to their thoughts , but not as to their language , is to us perfectly incomprehensible . The denial of verbal inspiration is , in our view , the denial of all inspiration , in the Scriptural sense of the doctrine . No man can have a wordless thought , any more than there can be a formless flower . By a law of our present constitution , we think in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is as impossible to infuse thoughts into the mind without words , as it is to bring men into the world without bodies . " Whether He with whom that is possible which is impossible with man , may not bring to pass more things than are dreamed of in our philosophy ; whether every doctrine which is incomprehensible is therefore false ; whether the verity of inspiration may not be assured to us , though the manner be hidden ; and other questions suggested by this quotation , - can not be now and here discussed . But we may observe , that whoever thinks thus of the words of the Bible assumes a fearful responsibility in coiisenting for a moment , unless under the restraint of an unconquerable necessity , that one of them should be obscured or misrepresented . To all such , as to every man who believes the Bible to be verily a Divine gift , we commend the solemn words of Mr. Ellicott - " If we are truly and heartily persuaded that there are errors and inaccuracies in our version ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most faithful translation the world has ever seen , it still shares the imperfections that belong to every human work , however noble and exalted ; if we feel and know that these imperfections are no less patent than remediable , - then surely it is our duty to Him who gave that blessed Word for the guidance of man , through evil report and through good report to labor by gentle counsels to supply what is lacking and correct what is amiss , to render what has been blessed with great measures of perfection yet more perfect , and to hand it down thus marked with our reverential love and solicitude , as the best and most blessed heritage we have to leave to them who shall follow us. // " It is in vain to cheat our own souls with the thought that these errors are either insignificant or imaginary . There are errors , there are inaccuracies , there are misconceptions , there are obscurities , not indeed so many in number or so grave in character as the forward spirits of our day would persuade us of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Ghost , and that man who , after being in any degree satisfied of this , permits himself to lean to the counsels of a timid or popular obstructiveness , or who , intellectually unable to test the truth of these allegations , nevertheless permits himself to denounce or deny them , will , if they be true , most surely , at the dread day of final account , have to sustain the tremendous charge of having deult deceitfully with the inviolable Word of God . " - On the Pastoral Epistles , Pref. , p. xii . Detailed proof of those imperfections in our version , on account of which a revision is called for , can not of course be offered within the limits of a review article . Specimens of them are given in the works of Dr. Trench and Professor Scholefield , and are wisely and temperately discussed . But if we may so far presume on the interest of our readers in this subject , we may be able to set the importance of the measure in a clearer light , by indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief specifications . In making these criticisms , we are not to be understood as censuring the translators . A part of the defects charged belong to their age , and not to themselves . Expressions which are now obsolete were then current , and they could not foresee nor provide against the changes of time . Some of their errors arose from the fact that they were not making a new version , but revising older ones , and their vigilance was sometimes intermitted . In other cases we have an advantage over them from the , progress that has since been made in the knowledge of Biblical philology and antiquities , for which we can afford to be thankful without being censorious . And if inadvertences appear for which we can not account , it will be time enough to indulge severity of judgment when we forget that we also are fallible men . But we can not so readily acquit ourselves , if , through mistaken reverence for them , we suffer their work to continue defaced , and subject to needless disparagement . Of imperfections which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are due to the changes of time , the occurrence of obsolete words , and of current words in obsolete senses , is among the most obvious . Thus we have " fray , " meaning to frighten ; " daysman , " an umpire ; " leasing , " lies ; " ear , " to till ; " to wit , " to know ; the last occurring in that very awkward expression , " we do you to wit , " for we make known to you . This class of words is not very numerous , but is enough so , taking into account the frequency of their occurrence , to constitute a noticeable blemish , and one easily removed . The errors occasioned by changes of signification in words are more serious . Instances that will readily occur to the discriminating reader are " conversation " in the sense of deportment , " honest " for decent , or becoming , " worship " for civil respect . Most readers probably understand that , when Christians are called " a peculiar people , " the phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked degree from that of worldly or irreligious men . It really expresses property or ownership , and is only another method of saying that they are " not their own . " " Vengeance , " as used by our translators , is generally equivalent to punitive justice . " Is God unrighteous that taketh vengeance who punishes ? " We must think it no unimportant matter that " the Judge of all the earth " is represented to common readers as awarding justice in a revengeful spirit . Here should be noticed obsolete grammatical forms , such as the confounding of " who " and " which , " and the use of " his " for " its , " - a word not current in the seventeenth century . In regard to words that offend by their grossness , it is difficult in this over-squeamish age to lay down any certain rule . But we suppose it will be generally admitted that our version of the Old Testament is disfigured by an unnecessary coarseness of expression , which impairs the pleasure of reading it , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy . The obscurity arising from inconsistency in the rendering of proper names , by which , for example , Elijah in the Old Testament becomes Elias in the New , Hosea becomes Osee , and Joshua is translated into Jesus , is sometimes perplexing , and in the last-named instance positively misleading , as in Hebrews iv . 8 . Of errors , or inconsistencies , in translation we can give but // a few examples . The treatment of idiomatic peculiarities by our translators is fruitful of embarrassment . Hebraisms are generally resolved into equivalent English expressions , but are sometimes literally translated . Thus the use of a dependent noun instead of an adjective is sometimes retained in the translation , oftener turned into idiomatic English . We have " his holy hill , " and " the mountain of his holiness , " the Hebrew being the same in both cases . When this usage is extended to the literal translation of such a phrase as " the right hand of my righteousness , " the sense is obscured . Sometimes a Hebraism is imagined where none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the glory of the children of God , " which is rendered " the glorious liberty , " without sufficient reason . The word " son , " which by a frequent Orientalism is used to express almost any relation of persons or things , generally gives place to the word or phrase that corresponds to it in English . " Son of the bow " is properly rendered " arrow , " and so in very numerous cases . But we have " son of Belial , " " son of peace , " " son of consolation , ** phrases nearly as unintelligible in themselves as those that are more rationally treated . To this category belong certain Hebraisms which are at once unintelligible and repulsive to us . The neglect of the definite article , sometimes omitting it where it is found in the Greek , and again inserting it without authority , weakens , and occasionally perverts , the meaning of the New Testament . An instance of omission occurs in Romans v. 15 : " For if through the offence of ( the ) one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace of God by ( the ) one man , Jesus Christ , hath abounded unto ( the ) many . " An instance of improper insertion is to be noticed in the same Epistle , ii . 14 : " For when ( the ) Gentiles , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , " &amp;c . The Apostle does not say that the Gentiles , as a whole , do this , but Gentiles , some of them . By their error in this respect , our translators have much obscured an important distinction . In the Gospels CHRIST is usually not a name , but a title , and has the article . In the Epistles it passes into a proper name , and is generally without the article . The reason is plain . Jesus claimed to be the Messiah , He who was to come . But // the Apostles assume it as demonstrated that he was the Messiah , and use the title thenceforth as a strictly personal appellation . Common readers are in danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " as equivalent to " What do you think of me ? " rather than , as it is , " What is your view of the Messiah ? " - what sort of a personage do you look for ? Negligence in the rendering of words on which the whole sense of some passage turns , though not very frequent , is sufficiently so to perplex the reader . In Romans , chapter iv. , Xo74*o*a&amp; occurs eleven times . It is twice rendered " count , " three times " reckon , " and six times " impute . " HOW much greater clearness would have been imparted to the reasoning by adhering to a single English word wherever the term occurs ! Dean Trench ( pp. 69-83 ) enumerates several striking examples *of this . We might add instances of error or obscurity arising from confusion in respect to the tenses of verbs and the force of prepositions ; but as the utmost that is possible within reasonable limits of space would afford only slight glimpses of a very extensive prospect , it may be wise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points is of small consequence ? If the reader merely gained by revision superior clearness of narrative , considering how much of the Scriptures consists of narrative , this would be of no small advantage . But the profit would be even more striking in those books which are doctrinal , whose verses are citadels for the possession of which whole armies of controversialists have almost literally fought . There is something more than a verbal difference between the expression ( Romans iii . 2* ) , " for the remission , " and the more correct " on account of the passing by " of past sins ; between " if one died for all , then were all dead , " ( 2 Cor. v. 14 , ) and the more literal " then all died . " In such cases we are reviewing ground trampled by polemic warfare and also watered with the tears of devotion , and is it of small import whether we go astray ? There are two points , not alluded to in any of the recent discussions of this subject that have fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place . Attention seems to have been given , in England , chiefly to the New Testa // ment . But we suppose it to be generally agreed among competent scholars , that our version is more accurate in the New Testament than in the Old . Greater advance has been made in Hebrew than iii Greek grammar and lexicography . The poetical parts of the Old Testament especially suffered loss in the hands of our translators , and need a more thorough revision . Of this any one may satisfy himself by examining , not the interpretations of German rationalists , but those of so conservative expositors as Dr. Alexander , for example , or Dr. Henderson ; or by comparing the common version of the book of Job with the excellent revised version published by the Bible Union . The labor required here must be very great , but the resulting benefit will more than repay it , if the Psalms and the Prophetic writings , those storehouses of devotional thought and language , are presented in a form that will do more ample justice to their divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost industry and skill . They are especially obscured by inattention to the force of the particles which indicate the transitions and connections of thought . It is no exaggeration to say , that there are passages in the Epistles of Paul which , as they appear to the mere English reader , are without any discernible connection or relation of parts . They are read in fragments , with no attempt , even , to trace the Apostle 's logic . Here , also , there is a wide and very difficult department of labor , in which the conscientious student is thankful for small gains at almost any sacrifice of toil . And this brings us to the alternative question , Granting that a revised version of the Scriptures is desirable in itself , is it practicable ? Can it be effected ? Can it , especially , be effected , without doing harm that would more than outweigh its benefits ? There is undoubtedly a very serious obstacle at the threshold of the undertaking . When the present translation was " authorized , " English Protestantism was externally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , but little actual separation from it . Each body of non-conformists , in breaking away from the national communion , took with them the authorized version . Now , with the spread of // Jan. the English race and of the English language upon other continents , the Church of England can speak with but a limited authority on this matter . She may revise her Scriptures for her own children , but her action may or may not be deferred to by those beyond her pale . And among ourselves , where all bodies of Christians are equal before the law , there is still greater difficulty in the way of arriving at any unanimity of action . There is room for almost any amount of jealousy and discord . But we do not think there is cause to despair of a practicable union , provided only there is a just recognition of the worth of the object . When timidity and prejudice give place to more elevated conceptions of the undertaking and a more earnest desire for its accomplishment , all obstacles to co-operation will melt away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing of the work when it is undertaken , is the unsettled state of the Greek text of the New Testament . Criticism has made encouraging progress , but her labors are far from being ended . The text from which our version was made will now be accepted by comparatively few well-informed persons as the basis of an improved translation , and there is as yet no agree . ment upon any other . The revisers of the American Bible Union adopt as a provisional basis the received text , with such variations from it as have the concurrence of critical editors for the last hundred years . This is hardly satisfactory , but would be a decided advance on the imperfect editions of the seventeenth century . It seems to us , however , that the most honest way of dealing with the reader , in those cases in which the variation affects the sense , is to translate the various readings and place them in the margin . The fear of " unsettling " men 's minds is unworthy of a Christian . Why should we hesitate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question remains , Are we competent to the undertaking ? Is there adequate scholarship to do the work , and to do it well ? This may justly be a matter of anxiety , when we see that it weighs so heavily on the minds of men who would be unanimously looked to as among the chiefs in classical , sacred , and English learning . " On the whole , " says Dean Trench , " I am persuaded that a revision ought to // come ; I am convinced that it will come . Not , however , I would trust , as yet ; for we are not as yet in any respect prepared for it ; the Greek and the English which should enable us to bring this to a successful end might , it is to be feared , be wanting alike . " And so Mr. Ellicott : " This only I will say , that it is my honest conviction that for any authoritative revision we are not yet mature , either in Biblical learning or Ilellenistic scholarship . " There are many to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , just able with the help of Robinson 's Lexicon to construe the Greek Testament , is not afraid to criticise the English version to the right and left , has no such doubts . The good men who contribute to Bible Unions , and wonder why the expected new version is so long in coming , can not understand them . For ourselves , while we regard with profound respect the sentiments of these eminent scholars , and would tremble to " rush in * where such men " fear to tread , " we venture to believe that their modesty aggravates their fears to an unnecessary pitch . It should be rei*embered , in the first place , that a perfect version is not to be expected . That measure of learning which is adequate to judge with so penetrating a discernment the merits and defects of the existing version , can not be altogether at fault in humbly and faithfully seeking its amendment . And especially it should be borne in mind , that we shall never succeed if we fear to make the attempt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . In one respect we must confess a want of sympathy with much that is written on this subject . The incomparable English of our version , it is said , can not be approached , and the only effect of revision would be to mar the composition . It would be no longer of a piece . Now , in no spirit of vaunting , we trust , nor in any sympathy with the vanity of " the age , " we express the conviction that in this very respect the present is a better time for undertaking a revision than could have been selected at any previous period . Dnring the last half of the seventeenth , and almost throughout the eighteenth century , a vitiated taste in literature caused the old English authors to be neglected . But for fifty years past they have been studied with more diligence and with a higher // appreciation . We have little doubt that there are to-day , in any one of the midland shires of England , more persons able to enjoy the great writers of the seventeenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred years ago . The limitations of the proposed work are also to be considered . If it were demanded that a new version should be composed throughout , to rival that which we have received , there would be reason to despair . But are we so straitened for good English , that we can not repair the rents of the old fabric and replace a stone here and there , - while we have for our quarry not only the vocabulary of the version itself , but the versions from which it was revised , with the wealth of the contemporary literature ? The very love and veneration with which the English Bible is viewed , and which cause so many to shrink from the risk of marring its sanctities , encourage the belief that it has fallen upon a fit time , and among men with whom it may be safely trusted for needed amendment . At least , let it be tried . As for the shock consequent on revision , which may be expected to unsettle men 's faith in the Scriptures , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaos , according to the expressed apprehensions of some , we have come to look on such threatened calamities with a good degree of resignation . We do not think so poorly of the Christianity of our time , in comparison with that of pasb ages , as to believe that men 's faith rests on words and syllables , especially on obsolete words , words which they would rather not read aloud , or words which convey to them either no meaning at all or a wrong one . We remember that the people of England met and survived the " shock " of six successive versions of the Bible before the present translation was made , and we trust that our own generation , both there and here , can accept some necessary corrections in their copies without being driven to apostasy . Considering especially that the revision can not be wrought in a day , and that the improved version is in no danger of coming upon us like lightning from the clear sky , it may be reasonably hoped that sufficient time will be given to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All effort in that direction for the present must be merely // tentative . In the existing temper of the public mind , any proposal for definite action looking toward a final result would doubtless be repelled . Dean Trench suggests , ( and the editor of Professor Scholefield 's Essay seems to be of the same opinion , ) that nothing in the way of revision should now be attempted . He would have a select body of scholars agree upon such corrections of the text as meet their mature approbation , and cause these to be published for the consideration of all interested . By degrees , he thinks , these may so commend themselves to general favor as to demand , and have accorded to them , a place in the current text . His suggestions incidentally illustrate one of the difficulties inherent in the undertaking , - that arising from the divided state of Chris-* tendom . He would have the Church of England take the initiative , and invite the co-operation of scholars from this country , and from some of the dissenting bodies in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should co-operate as scholars merely , - implying that the elect workmen of the national Church are to bear some other and higher character . He also makes two noticeable exceptions . " The so-called Baptists ' * are to be excluded , because they demand not only the translation , but the interpretation of a certain word ; those dissenters , also , who do not accord with the doctrinal articles of the Church of England , are to be left out of the account . As to the first of these exceptions , it will probably surprise the very reverend Dean to learn that in this country " the socalled B*ptists " in great numbers have repudiated the revision movement in the gross , and have particularly protested against any change of the version in respect to the terms descriptive of the rite of baptism . It might also , we should suppose , occur to his mind , that some of that sect , however inadmissible might be their demands touching one or two words , would be able to render service towards the better translation of sundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . Of one thing he may be assured , - that , should the enterprise ever become general in this country , there are " so-called Baptists " whose learning and skill could be dispensed with only to the serious loss of all parties concerned . Nor are we able to see that any doctrinal test would // be profitable . Unless the Church of England has made rapid strides towards unity within a very recent period , there are nearly as wide differences between those embraced within her communion , as there are between most of them and those who are unable to digest an ex animo subscription to her Articles . We can think of only one reasonable limit as to opinion , - that of an agreement in holding to the divine authority of the Bible as a rule of faith . But waiving discussion of this point , which is not immediately practical , it seems to us that the surest method of conciliating men to the undertaking , of removing prejudice and awakening sympathy , is to begin the work at once . Mr. Ellicott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step on the sure road to success . Deprecating as earnestly as Dr. Trench any present attempt at an authoritative revision , they propose that " bands of independent scholars " should undertake the task , and offer specimens of what may be accomplished with some select portions of Scripture . Such amended versions , coming into the hands of scholars for criticism , may perhaps also be welcomed to the study as aids in Scriptural interpretation , and to the closet as quickeners of devotion . It may be anticipated that by and by , through experience of their benefits , there will be a readiness to accept an improved version as a whole . We are convinced that a good revised text , thus put into circulation and placed beside the common text , would plead the cause of revision more effectually than whole libraries of discussion , and with more speedy effect than the best catalogues of corrections , though presented as invitingly as they are by Dean Trench himself . In this point of view we welcome the labors of the Five Clergymen , and trust that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same direction . Whatever else may be said of their productions , and very much might be said in their praise , - they are worthy of special commendation for the skill and delicacy which they have shown in dealing with the common version . Our only complaint against them in this regard is , that they are a little too much hampered by the fear of modernizing the style . Because the use of " his " for its , and of " which ' * for who , belongs to the admitted usages // of the language in the seventeenth century , they hold the retention of them to be necessary to the due preservation of the archaic English style . But we conceive that a distinction is to be made among archaisms . Some are beauties , and some are blemishes . An evident deformity is not to be cherished merely because it is old . In cases where antique modes of expression are not only superseded , but proscribed as incorrect and inelegant , by long-established usage , the retaining of such forms does nothing for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriptures . In this country scholars lack " independence " in more senses than one . Very few have the means and appliances for prosecuting such a work with success . Association in some form is necessary . Having spoken rather freely of the origin of the American Bible Union , justice requires that we should not dismiss it without some further notice . At the outset it suffered all the disadvantages , without the compensating helps , of a sectarian origin . That was against it in the eyes of the general public , while the sect with which it was popularly identified , for that very reason , was hostile to its designs . Its managers had the discretion to proclaim a non-sectarian position , and to invite the aid of scholars from all sections of Protestantism . A majority of its supporters are still , we presume , Baptists , but there is nothing exclusive in its constitution . It further suffered from the necessity , if it would attempt anything immediate , of employing revisers of inferior capacity . Some of their experimental revisions , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be attempted , have been turned to the discredit of the Union . But in securing the services of Professor Conant , whose revision of Job speaks better for him than any commendations of ours , and more recently of Professor Hackett , whose accomplishments as a Biblical scholar and expositor are universally recognized , with those of other eminent men on either side of the Atlantic , it has made a more effective appeal to public consideration . Its library of Biblical works is said to be unrivalled on this continent . We see no reason to doubt that it will yet entitle itself to a far greater measure of consideration than is now accorded to it . 18 // But whatever may be the result of particular measures , we have faith that the great object in view will ultimately be reached , and that the English Bible , not superseded , not disparaged , but arrayed in still higher beauty than it now boasts , will be handed down to a grateful and revering posterity .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
