RANDOLPH , PUBLISHER 1855 Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 1855 , BY J.A . BARTLEY , In the Clerk 's Office of the Eastern District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia . G.S . ALLEN &; CO. , PRINTERS , CHARLOTTESVILLE , VA . TO MY FATHER , THIS VOLUME IS INSCRIBED BY HIS SON , THE AUTHOR . PREFATORY LETTER TO THE PUBLIC . DEAR PUBLIC : These Poems were written with pleasure ; if they be read with pleasure , I shall be requited amply . How often the Guardian Angel of the Father of Virginia in surpassing loveliness rose before my imagining eyes ! Like the spirit of a dream , she glided through the foliage , verdant and shadowy . Enchanted myself , the desire to enchant others seized me . The " Poet 's Enchanted Life " is a gallery of poetic pictures of nature . Most of the minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If critics censure me unjustly or intemperately , I will fight them -- but I hope to find them , as well as you , dear Public , very kind friends of a loving Author . J.A . BARTLEY . POCAHONTAS . Where yonder moss-grown ruinA lonely stands , Which from the James , the Pilgrim may survey , Stretch alway forth its old , forsaken hands As if to beg some friend its fall to stay , And now the wild vine flaunts in greenness gay ; Erst rose a Castle , known to deathless fame , Though now the mournful rampart falls away , Hither Virginia 's hero-father came , To found a glorious state , and give these regions name . For , then , both far and near the forest wide , Stretched from the main unto the setting sun , And Bears and Panthers walked in fiercest pride , And slept at ease when their red feast was done , But here of white men there had ne'er walked one , But a fierce race of wild and savage hue , Their simple life from chase and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other slew , In bloody wars which dyed their soil with crimson dew . I ween it was a novel sight to see The white man landing in the vasty wild , Which each familiar creature seemed to flee , Where not a christian dwelling ever smiled , Nor e'er a well-known sound the ear beguiled , But all was wild and hideous -- and the heart , Mayhap , of stout man , trembled as a child ,  - -  And oft the exile 's tear would , gushing , start , That ever he was lured from Albion 's coast to part . But there was one , the chieftain , of that band , Whose soul no dread , however great , could chill , His was the towering mind , the mighty hand , On which , his feeble followers resting , still Would fear no peril from approaching ill . With him the strangers built their rugged home , And turned the soil , and eat , and drank their fill ; Glad that to this fair Eden they had come , And reconciled became to their adopted home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little space by yonder river 's side , But now arose the wail of keen distress , Gaunt Famine , with his murderous eye , they spied , Stalk round the walls of those who wept and sighed , And when their venturous chieftain wandered forth , Ill hap betrayed him to the savage pride , The death-club rose , his head upon the earth , To perish there and thus , that man of kingly worth . Not yet ! before that last sad deed be done , An Indian maiden springs beneath the blow , And says her virgin blood shall freely run , For him , extended on the ground below , See ! how , her face upturned , her tears do flow , See Love and anguish painted in her eyes , That , like a Seraph 's , in their pity , glow , And surely Angels , looking from the skies Claimed this poor savage girl a sister in disguise . Those eyes , those tears prevent the falling stroke , For Powhatan could not withstand her tears , His favorite child , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her dawning years , The wondering white man now he kindly rears , And bids his menials haste the Indian 's fare For him whom now his daughter 's love endears , And lo ! within the Lion 's horrid lair , The Dove has brought her mate , and sees him unhurt there . Oh Love ! how powerful o'er all thou art , In dusky breasts or breasts of whiter hue , To thy delicious touch the human heart Throbs with respondent transport ever true . On Love 's swift wings , this Indian virgin flew , To snatch from hateful death the lovely chief , Love drew her tears , like showers of pearly dew , Love filled her passionate breast with tender grief And love still drinks her soul , and naught can give relief . She decks her long , black hair with gayest flowers And tries each girlish art to warm his breast , And , straying oft , among the leafy bowers , Whilst Luna 's silvery smiles upon them rest , And Earth sleeps deeply , in that beauty drest , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she is not blest , But hopes and doubts , and dares to hope again , That Smith may love , and ne'er is free from love 's soft pain . And fair was she , the dim wood 's lustrous child , Though born amid a race of uncouth men , And gentle as the fawn , which , through the wild , Trembled with timorous haste , and fled , and when She stood within the rude and silent glen , Of deepest forests , she appear 'd more bright , Than other nymphs who roamed these regions then , And now -- for o'er her form and sylph-like waist , A native modesty entranced the most fastidious taste . He whom she loved to all these charms was cold , Though well he saw her bosom 's gentle fire , Stern is the soul that worships fame or gold , To all that softer ecstacies inspire . A stony heart these tyrants e'er require , Brave Smith ne'er thought of Pocahontas ' love , But only that his name would glitter higher In coming centuries , others ' names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To cheat her pining soul of this dear dream , They told a dreary tale that he had died , While to her father 's hut , like some fair gleam Of sunlight , with some heavenly thought , she hied , And now both day and night , how sorely sighed , And inly groaned the poor bereaved maid , Nor could restrain strong nature 's gushing tide , That in the dark , cold grave , her love was laid ;  --  Disconsolate , she moved along the leafy glade . Pausing beside her Smith 's imagined tomb , Weeping , by moonlight pale , she strewed fair flowers , To wither o'er him , emblems of his bloom So soon departed from these lovely bowers . Once plucked , these buds will never bless the showers , Sweet charities , by wearing wonted charms , But lose for aye their balm for summer hours ; So all her showery grief him no more charms , To spring and rest a joy in her exulting arms . She deems he sleeps within the envious ground , Which stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more her brow with wild flower wreaths is bound , And all her ornaments , neglected , rest ; Since fled is now the dreamy hope which blest Her artless soul , she loathes her glance to fling On corals , braids , and flowers , and royal vest , And slowly wanders like some moon-struck thing , Through gloomy cypress groves , and by yon haunted spring . But time must soothe the most exquisite smart Of love , when wounded by the dart of death ; For life would flee , should not such woe depart , Too deeply weighing on the heart beneath . Fair Pocahontas breathes the wonted breath Of tranquil life , a creature darkly bright , Decking her hair again with many a wreath , Walking amid the high wood 's gentle night , Charming her wild , old Father 's heart with strange delight . Yet nought could make her cease to view with love , The tender memory of the mournful past ; And once when warring clouds grew black above , The shrieking Earth with awful night o'ercast , And long foiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with irksome steps she stole , O'er deep morass , through tangled brake , and cast The boon of life to each devoted soul , Who slept within that Castle 's frail and weak control . Oh ! we might marvel that her savage heart , Would show such love to her loved father 's foes ; But love like this , will act no selfish part ; Over drear earth , diffusing joy , it goes , Its breath the fragrance of the earliest rose , Its voice the sound of an unearthly thing , Its form an Angel 's , and as pure as those , Who come to gladdened man on shining wing , Which scatters round the sweets of an immortal spring . Now when the dogwood gemmed with blossoms white , The gorgeous grove where oak and stately pine , Upthrew their gnarled arms of massy might , And thus a leafy canopy did twine , This dusky Dryad would with grace recline , Along the mossy bank of crystal stream , In whose smooth glass her angel beauties shine , Beside brave Rolfe , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and taught her love 's true dream . Beneath the silver moon , resplendent queen , With simple rites , these mingling souls were wed ; The happy stars looked down , with brighter sheen , To view love 's wretched fears for ever fled ; The wild flowers trembled in their dewy bed , And up a most enchanting fragrance sent ; The blissful Hours , unnoticed , onward sped ; And , with their gentle music sweetly blent , The breathing winds and waters murmured their content . Ah me ! what deep , celestial transports thrill 'd These beating bosoms , in so sweet a scene : What tears of tender joy their visions filled , Scanning each other 's soul-absorbing mien And , in that bower of paradisal green , Happy , they sighed , in accents fond and warm , That thus enclosed Earth 's primal pair had been , Where oft they spied bright Seraph 's glorious form , And rose on high afar the grove 's eternal charm . There oft the mocking bird , a songster gay , Would soothe their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying Day , As fade his smiles the darkening glades along ; And when the frowns of night more thickly throng , The amorous firefly led them at that hour , O'er wooded hills , and marshes deep and long , To their sweet rest , which sank , with grateful power , Along their wearied nerves , in their wild , oaken bower . As flows the stream , with calm , unruffled wave , O'er shining sands , to kiss the glassy main , So flowed the life their gracious Maker gave , Nor felt the obstructive power of obvious pain ; So deep o'er them was Passion 's rapturous reign , That mid their bower 's delicious solitude , They dreamed their hearts might never sigh again ; By love their gentle spirits were subdued , To the deep rapture of a heavenly seeming mood . Alas ! the race of Pocahontas flow , As waves , away , which can return no more ; No more o'er plain and peak they bear the bow , Or shove the skiff from yonder curving shore ; Their reign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insults their sires ' indignant bones ; The very land disowns its look of yore ; Vast cities rise , and hark ! I hear the tones Of many mingling Tongues ; and boundless labour groans . And paler nymphs are sweetly wooed and won , Upon this soil , and they are happy too , But of these fairer English damsels , none Have shown devotion more divinely true , Than thou , untutor 'd maid of dusky hue ; Nor shall thy tribes from memory vanish quite , While beauteous deeds as angels ofttimes do , Still sway the generous mind with heavenly might , For thine would snatch even worse from Time 's oblivious night . The tallest fir , that decks the blooming grove , Decays the first , the most abounding rose , By worms is first consumed ; the pearl we love Is stolen first , the star that brightest glows To gild the gloom , is first that sets , and those Whose lovely lives on earth we prized the most , And most assuaged the pangs of thronging woes , Which -- oh how oft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ever mourned , " the loved and early lost . " So Rolfe 's dear spouse was early snatched away ,  --  But left one pledge of her undying love --  ( Perchance her happy spirit oft would stray Round their dear footsteps wheresoe'er they rove ) And Europe 's turf grow green her heart above . No more could grief or joy disturb her breast . Soft by her tomb let musing Fancy move ! Let not a sound of thoughtlessness molest The melancholy spot of her eternal rest ! Her fair form sank low in the gloomy earth --  Her spirit soared and found a brighter home , Where now with sun-bright smiles , she wanders forth , Beneath the glories of a heavenly dome ; Where Seraphs o'er bright fields forever roam , And flowers aloft Life 's never dying tree , Whither no evil thing can ever come ; Where now she blends her heart and harp to sing A ceaseless song of praise to her Eternal King . But oft the eye which scans yon ruin old , Where Jamestown erst in simple grandeur rose , Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to him of heroes ' woes , Felt erewhile whence this river gently flows ,  --  And sprang this famous , Hero-bearing State ;  --  And while with pride his patriot bosom glows , His heart her gentle history will relate , And warmly laud her deeds , and mourn her early fate . Footnote A : Jamestown . Footnote B : Whip-poor-will . A SONG . Amid the tempest , wild and dark , Upon Life 's troubled sea ; One only star illumes the scene , With heavenly brilliancy . Oh ! sweetly o'er the howling deeps , Its venturing beam shines out ; And bright , relieves my weeping eye , And calms my soul from doubt . That star is pure Religion 's light . A pole star , calm but blest , It guides my lost and trembling bark , To Heaven 's sweet port of rest . ELFINDALE . PART FIRST . Sweet Frankie lives in Elfindale ; Where all the flowers are fair , and frail ( Like her fair self , ) a slender fairy , And like a zephyr , playsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , since I saw her full , bright eyes , And heard her tongue 's rich melodies , Solace the evening air , Sweet Elfindale , e'er loved of yore , Has grown more fair , beloved more , A part of some fay-walked shore , A haunt of beauties rare . The gay dawn smells more fragrant there , ( When youthful May , new , fresh and fair , Comes , bird-like through the laughing air , ) Than it was even of old ; And Evening throws a richer dress , ( O'er Elfindale 's mild loveliness , ) Of fading pink and gold . The moonlight nights are lovelier now , On silent Elfindale ; More pure the beams , more soft the glow , That sleeps upon the vale : So much of beauty God hath given To sweetest Frankie -- gracious Heaven ! She spares so much to beautify , Fair Elfindale to my charm 'd eye ,  --  And yet she loses none at all Of that which holds my soul in thrall . Now , if my harp shall echo well , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , her beauty 's power That flourished as a springtime flower , I shall be richer , happier far Than one should own a round , bright star . And what if the fair maid should smile , To hear my warbled strain ? Ah ! that would all my grief beguile , Undo the life of Pain . I one time saw a laughing mirth Leap in the maiden 's eyes , And thought the too aspiring earth Had robbed the jewelled skies , Of one bright angel , even her : She made my very being stir . I ne'er saw sweet Frankie 's mother , What I had glowed to see , Yet think no mortal earth 's another , Bore child so fair as she . I ween that mother was a queen In royal qualities , And in her lofty eyes and mien , Lurked lovely majesties . I ne'er saw sweet Frankie 's mother , What I had glowed to see ; But can not , long-lost mother ! smother The love that swells for thee . When Frankie came into this world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves lay curled , Beneath the moonlight pale : The cold stars twinkled far above , And danced , with their bright eyes of love ; The gleaming waters did rejoice , And breathed a soft , enamored voice ; The sleeping zephyr on his flowers , Awaked to bless the gliding hours Which gave this tiny being , birth , A bliss , a Blessing to the earth . She was , in truth , a beauteous child : At three years old her eyes were wild With something of a playfulness ; And then she had the softest tress Of auburn tint , that fell and flew About her neck of damask hue . To watch throughout the Summer day , The butterfly 's capricious play , Or humming bird 's bright , rainbow wings , And all gay , joyous , natural things . To hear the poets of the grove , Sing forth their little lays of love ; Or to survey the stars come forth , Or dancing rainbows hug the earth : These were the pastime and the play , That whiled her infant hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fair within its pale . That was a bland and holy morn , Like one , on very purpose , born , A gray godmother stood , Before the chancel 's sacred place , With Frankie 's sweet and artless grace , And heard the preacher good . And as the bright baptism fell , Upon her fallen tresses well , And o'er her bosom 's chastened swell , The beauteous maiden smiled : She looked a wingless cherub then --  My inmost spirit fluttered , when I said , O wondrous child ! I thought a troop of angels stood Amid that lofty fane , And ( I in that ecstatic mood ) They sped to bliss again . That , whole bright day , I wandered wide , O'er sunny hill and vale , And thought no day of brighter pride E'er lay on Elfindale ; I thought , that day dear Frankie love , Had been new-linked with those above ; And henceforth angels would attend The maiden , to her journey 's end . Fair Frankie grew in attributes That harmonized like golden flutes , Or harps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With every year 's advancing flow ;  --  She was the Death of Pain ! The dwellers in green Elfindale , Were happier all for her , The very flowers she loved to trail , With pleasure 's thrill , would stir . She loved both man and brute that dwelt Within that vale of Good ; And they , as bettered beings , felt New virtue -- as they should . And thus a shining , golden chain , Of many links of love , Knit Frankie to the peopled plain , And to the good above . Affection 's wreathed rings of beauty , Bound round a globe of gold ; It is my verse 's pleasing duty , To say to all , behold , Sweet Frank that central globe of worth ; That gems , with pride , this spot of earth , This flower-engirdled , blissful vale , This heart-delighting Elfindale . And now when lovely Frankie stood , In the dear pride of womanhood , The queen of Elfindale ; One sought her for her loveliness --  A joy -- a heaven of happiness --  An earth-born angel meant to bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail . She sat hid in a garden bower , Watching the first , sweet star , That crowns the lovely twilight hour , And glows to earth from far . A sad sweet dream oppressed her thought , And tinged her calm , white face ; Her eyes fixed fast , their radiance fraught , With melancholy grace . I stole unto her close retreat , As winds creep on a vale ; And , standing , gazed upon the sweet , Sweet queen of Elfindale . She turned her head , she faintly smiled , She bent her gaze on me ; It made my very spirit wild , With thrilling ecstacy . I caught and clasped , her to my heart , Yet never spoke a word ;  --  But the twin-vow that could not part , By Love in Heaven was heard . PART SECOND . Again unto the lofty fane , Sweet Frankie lightly went ; With smiling joy and same of pair Upon her features blent . Again , as on that sunny morn , When white-winged angels stood , To see her , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again within the chancel 's gloom , She sweetly , gently stands ; With marriage hymn , with rich perfume , With Hymen 's happy bands ; With wild-rose wreaths , with gayest bloom , And wreathed maiden 's hands . But , now she stands with me even there , With sweetly downcast eyes , So purely white , so passing fair , Like one of Paradise . The preacher speaks the solemn words , Yet fraught with deepest bliss ; We twain in one are bound by chords , With sob -- with clasp -- with kiss . Returning from that sacred place , All earth and sky rejoiced , And all the winds and waters ' race Their compliments then voiced . The birds sang sweetly on the spray , As they ne'er sang before ; And love lay o'er the world away , A robe of golden ore . And now , we live in Elfindale , Dear Frank and I together ; And there is light on this sweet dale , In calm , or stormy weather . A fairy daughter leaps between Our nightly moving paces ; Upon whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We dwell , we dwell , in Elfindale --  I -- child -- and happy mother ; And , if earth holds a sweeter vale , We can not wish another . Life has been arched with bluer skies , By curved rainbows brighter ; And nature -- ah ! what wondrous dyes , Now lavishly bedight her . Love has become a glorious robe , With thickest gold o'erladen ; And now we dwell upon a globe Which is , indeed , an Aidenn . I dwell with fixed eyes upon My wife and cherub maiden , I feel the light of that fire-sun , That broadly shines on Aidenn ,  --  And all our days that brightly run , Are heavily joy-laden --  And now we know our grief is done , And that we dwell in Aidenn . OF A SKYLARK . At dawn I rose from silent sleep , And heard a sky-lark singing , Amid the azure far and deep , Till all the arch was ringing . And now , as deeper , deeper still His form sank into heaven , Me-seemed his heart 's concentered thrill , To his loved Lord was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would soar and sing to heaven , Till my freed soul from sordid things , Should thus be widely riven . THE PRINCESS OF PERU . RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED TO MISS MARY T. ROBERTSON OF ABINGDON , VA . Far to the wilds of rich Peru , Gonzalo came -- of pallid hue , Strange in these Western lands of night , Where nought , save woman 's eyes , are bright . But these have all that outward beam , Reflected from their glances ' gleam Of light and fire , that kindle bliss ; Or sink to gloom in Death 's abyss . Gonzalo came , a son of Spain , That land which gleams beyond the main , And sent its children to these lands , To gather gold with reckless hands . And , he , Gonzalo , stood a tower , In sturdy grace , and manly power ; No Indian 's weapon was to him , More than a sea-reed , slight and slim ; And yet to brown Iola 's eye , He seemed the lord of lady 's sigh . Gonzalo seen , her thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She deemed that orb of glorious fire , To which her country 's souls aspire , That crimson god whose glowing face Illumines all the mortal race : She deemed his glory , only , vied With brave Gonzalo 's matchless pride . And down along the green , fresh earth , Where sin not yet had known its birth ; She knelt , and cast her hands and eyes , To the bright God of those bright skies ; And worshipped him whose blessed beams , Had given Gonzalo to her dreams . Iola , princess of Peru , Most fair ( though of a dusky hue , ) Like this new , unpolluted clime , Unknown to hate , unknown to crime , Where all that dwell know but to love , ( The gentleness which marks the dove . ) And like that rich , unguarded shore , She knew to be , and seem no more ; And like that land so rich in bloom , Its branches wrought at noon a gloom ; Her form was bright with beauty 's hues , Which each propitious year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasures which mocked the sun 's bright ray ; In her rich soul shone wealth to shame , That tropic sun 's meridian flame . She stood a lovely being fraught , With that most dear to human thought , The power to love , to force the bliss Of heaven , to such a world as this . Iola , dearest maiden , threw A wondrous charm o'er all who knew Her loveliness ; her menial train Adored her even to anxious pain . And to her father 's rapturous eyes , She shone a rainbow -- whose bright dyes Illumed his aged spirit 's night ; A thing of loveliness and light . And in and out the Inca 's hall She went , returned to his known call . She seemed a sunbeam sent from heaven , To make his troubled spirit even ; For , if his soul , oppressed with grief , In aught of earthly , sought relief ; Iola 's image quickly seen , His soul grew peaceful and serene . In his tried spirits ' darkest mood , She was an omen still of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But soul and eyes like midday light , Whose beauty shed a sparkling spell , O'er Peru 's plain and shadowy dell ;  --  Who mid the rugged Andes stood , The charm of polished womanhood , And many a stranger wondered where , She caught that grace and beauty 's air . " Iola ! " said Gonzalo , " far Where shines yon lovely evening star , Sings many a gay and loving maid , Beneath the cooling olive shade . Their brows are whiter , too , than thine , But yet none to me are so divine , As thine , fair maid of dark Peru , With heart like its Volcanoes too . E'er since I landed on those shores , Of endless spring , and brightest ores , I have not thought of ought but thee , Ne'er can my bosom now be free . List ! sweet Iola ! am I vain ? I deem thou lovest we well again ; For , when I sought thy downcast eyes , They met mine with a glad surprise ; And when I spake to thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow , So softly sweet , so lulling , too , It bathed my soul in rapture 's dew . Iola ! sure I love thee well , And if thou wilt thy father tell , I deem he will not eye me ill , Whose love is with his daughter still . " Iola raised her glance to heaven , Then to Gonzalo , darting , even Her soul , into his own , and said ; " This soil with blood was never red ; And , sure , my father would not slay , Those men for whom his child will pray . But why thinkest thou of blood ? the thought , With wretched fear is ever fraught . Think , think of love , and gentle peace , Gonzalo ! let these bodings cease . Think , think of love -- here on my heart , Repose , and even Death 's stern dart , By Love conjured , will turn away , Some unloved thing of earth to slay . " " Angel of good ! " Gonzalo cried , " A thousand joys are at thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With calm , and pure , and heavenly ray . I feel thou art a spirit sent , From heaven 's snow-white battlement , To lead me through these stranger wilds , With voice and actions like a child 's , So guiltless in thy love -- so dear , I bless thy goodness with a tear . Oh ! like thy climate 's deathless spring , Succeeding days and years shall bring , Living affection to my heart , Till we no more on earth can part . " " Then , dear Gonzalo ! let us meet , As oft as evening airs are sweet , In yonder bower -- my own -- my dove , And I will be thy gentle love . That bower my Inca-father reared , For good such thing to him appeared , Where his Iola might be lone , To dream of fancies all her own . Yes ! oft as evening shades came down , On giant Andes ' glittering crown Of endless snow , that shines afar Next to the radiant zenith star ; Then throw their dark and sombre lines , Upon the mountain 's lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will speak , Sweet thrilling words , and on my cheek , Thy lip shall feed till we expire , In glowing love 's consuming fire . " " Yes , I will come , maid of Peru ! Though Fate , yon soaring Andes threw , Between my wish and thee my love , That lofty barrier I 'd remove ; And press to thee with Condor 's flight , To thee , to love , to life 's delight . N'er since these eyes beheld the day , Have they seen aught , whose potent sway , Could bend my will , as thou , dear maid ! Sweet star , amid my spirit 's shade . Not all the wealth that gleams around Within thy country 's magic bound , And fills my world with loudest fame , Of this new world 's most wondrous name , Sways more with me than idle dream , Or transient bubbles on a stream , Compared , Iola ! with thy power ;  --  And I will come to thy sweet bower . " * * * * * " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most dear , appointed hour ? On fleetest pinions I have come , To meet thee mid this richest bloom , Thy Inca father 's garden flowers , Whose odors fall like balmy showers ; But , of them all , thou art the flower Who hast the most delightful power , And of the wondrous birds that sing Amid this garden 's blooming spring ; Thou art the loveliest ; and thy voice Most meet to bid my soul rejoice . " Iola spoke not in reply ; But gazed on him with vacant eye : Still was she silent as the grave , O'er those we love but could not save ; And she seemed calm as tropic sea , When its hushed waves from winds are free . Gonzalo wondered ; why no word , Came from that lip that mocked the bird Of her own land , in melody , When warbling from his cocoa tree . But why , O gem of rich Peru , Thy silence strange , thy aspect new ? What envious power has bound thy voice , Which erst could bid my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realms of most infernal night , Has taken thy angel voice away ;  --  But speak , Iola , speak , I pray ! Her tears gushed forth like tropic rain , That widely floods the blooming plain ; And thus began , " Gonzalo ! thou Deceived'st me -- but I know thee now . Ask me not how I know it sooth ; Enough , I know the bitter truth . I felt forebodings of this hour ; It did my happiest thoughts o'er power , With a dark weight ; but then I thought , ' T was by my foolish fancy wrought . ' T was like the omen which precedes The earthquake when the summer reeds Are strangely still , until the shock The central earth shall wildly rock . Thou dost not love me , child of Spain ! Thy heart can love no thing but gain ; The paltry dust I tread above , To thee , is more than woman 's love . My love is vain , and life is less Since lost my hope of happiness Look from this garden ;  - -  far below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on high , the icy chill Of winter glitters , glitters still : I am that lonely verdure -- thou That mountain 's cold , unchanging brow . I 'll ne'er upbraid thee -- no -- oh no ! For love is kind , in deepest woe , I love thee still , and will till Death , Shall win my love with living breath . This even , farewell -- yes , yes , adieu ! No years our meeting can renew . Would that when round these royal bowers , I played in childhood 's happy hours , The Condor bird had borne me high , On his huge pinions through the sky , Upon yon mountain 's snowy crest , To hush his high and hungry nest . Farewell , Gonzalo ! fly with speed , Leave shade and silence to my need . " * * * * * There was a cry of terror in the hall Of Peru 's monarch , and a startling call ; But no reply -- Iola sure was gone ; Yet none knew why or whither she had flown . Her Inca-father put his crown aside , And filled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair And blooming realm ; heaven wore a dim despair . She ne'er was found ; but how or when she died None knew ; by her own hand ; or if she cried , Vainly , in wild beasts ' clutch ;  - -  but ne'er before Din wail so wild resound along the shore Of fair Peru ; her father lived not long , After this chord was snapped in his life 's song . THE HOLY LADY . Oh , Heaven hath given to earth some souls , Of rarest loveliness , Whose being 's constant current rolls , The wretched still to bless . Well wishing Heaven hath given to earth , Some hearts of purest fire , To renovate our sinful birth , And raise our low desire . The Holy Lady did not go Afar , by sea or land , But ministered to sighing wo , And suffering near at hand . ' T was sweet to see the Lady fair , Each blessed sabbath morn , Wear such a sweetly solemn air , Of bright devotion , born . ' T was sweet to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To pray , and sadly , sweetly grieve , For man 's perversity . But sure were we that city fine , Wherein this Lady dwelt , Was bettered by a power divine , And heavenly prompting felt . When she was old , her heart not cold , A youthful beauty lay , A light most wondrous to behold ! Upon her tresses gray . The charm of goodness does not fade , Like natural beauty 's flower , But blooms in glory undecayed , And death-defying power . TIME AND ETERNITY . The darkness falls on wood and field , On lofty peak , on silent sea , The infant Moon and Planets yield A faint and feeble brilliancy . Cans't thou behold the look and shape Of mount and main , of wold and wood ? The morrow 's sun , o'er sea and cape , Will show them out , both plain and good . Time darkens all to mortal eyes Save what faint reason 's stars illume : But when Eternity shall rise , All shall their shapes and hues assume . YEMEN . My soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloe and myrrh ; Where the breezes that blow from the ocean , Brought feelings of heaven to her . In the joy-giving vallies of Yemen , On its mountains that blush with their bloom ; My soul has been wandering but lately , To hide from the weight of her gloom . My Soul , like the fleet horse of Yemen , Flew chainless o'er mountain and plain , Till she paused by the flower-scented ocean , Then returned on her pinions , again . In that beautiful world , in that Yemen , My Soul lately wandered in bliss ; Till she found there a glorious maiden , She vainly had sighed for , in this . Then my Soul walked far with this maiden --  In this beautiful region of gold , And died on the love-burdened accents , From the fount of her bosom that rolled . Oh Yemen ! whose name is the Happy , Whose mountains are fragrant with bloom --  My Soul met her Consort there lately --  And now she says nothing of gloom . LILLY : A POEM .

We look across the landscape wide , Where spring bemocks the thought of pain , And scatters charms with lavish pride ;  --  The vernal joy is all in vain : Sweet Lilly , come again , Sweet Lilly , come again . The summer breezes lightly lift The clustered flowers oppressed with rain , Which fleecy cloud-sieves downward sift ,  --  It falls on Lilly 's form in vain : Sweet Lilly , come again , Sweet Lilly , come again . Oh ! can the glory of the year , The Spring that decks the widening plain , Thus strive to make the maid appear , But yield the hopeless task in vain : Sweet Lilly , come again ; Sweet Lilly , come again .

Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adieu to thee , Emory ! adieu to thee now ! There is grief in my spirit , there 's gloom on my brow , I have left the sweet scenes where I knelt at thy shrine , O Learning ! thy wreath with my name to entwine . Adieu to the scenes where , when study was o'er , And the toil of the mind was remembered no more ; I roamed o'er the mountains , forgetful , afar , ' Neath the light of the beautiful Evening Star . Like the light of that star -- like a splendor on high --  Like a Heavenly Dream that was born in the sky --  Bright Poesy burst on my pathway even there , And a rainbow of Beauty encircled the air . Ah ! she shone with a brilliance more dazzling and strong , Than e'er to a child of the earth could belong ; And her pinions that waved through the rose-scented air , Had a tint that was brighter than thought can declare . Yet adieu to thee , Emory , thy scenes I regret ; In a far distant scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may roam o'er thy mountains again , And love them as freshly and warmly as then . Yet , the tears gush unbidden , when breathing adieu ,  --  With the change of our years , our hearts are changed too ! And , haply , the world , with its coldness , will chill My feelings at length , as bleak winter the rill . Adieu to thy scenes , adieu to thee now ! There is grief in my spirit -- there is gloom on my brow --  Though Fancy may paint all thy beauty once more , The days that have flitted , she can not restore . VIRGINIA . Thy soil , Virginia ! is all hallowed ground , Made such by steps of patriots ; thy high fame , Alway unto our ears , a glorious sound , Kindles , in all high hearts , heroic flame . I walk beneath thy forests , high and lone , I hear a voice that sinks into my heart , The voice of fetterless Liberty ; the tone Which bids the flame of patriotism start . Greece was the land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory Of martyred virtue , which on Death could smile , At Marathon and proud Thermopylae : Gray Rome shall never lose the magic charm , That valor 's fire can pour along a land ; That charm shall bid the hearts of mankind warm , Long after her last stone hath ceased to stand : Yet , thou , Virginia ! art a prouder land , For when thy hills become red shrines to Right ; Thy plains become the spots , where , smiling , stand , The angels , gentle Peace and true Delight . And now , how fair thy homes ! on every hand , Thy cities and thy country domes arise , From mountains vast , to ocean 's shelly strand , And bring a pride into our gazing eyes ! How brave thy polished sons ! their hearts how free ! How far above the plotting of the mean ! How they contemn all base chicanery , And proudly move , as men , through every scene ! And when thy daughters , an angelic train , Roam mid thy flowery walks , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a strain , That wander 'd from a blissful clime above ! Immortal land ! my soul is proud , to think I yet can walk upon thy mother soil , And , willing that her mouldering frame may sink , Back to thy breast , after its lifetime toil . WATOGA . Oh , think not that the polished breast , Only , can feel the fire of love , Pure as the flames that brightly rest In bosoms of the realms above . Yes ! often in the rudest form , A heart may be , more clear and bright Than ever lent the loveliest charm To goddess of the Festal light . Come , hear a story of the time , When this wide land was one green bower , The roving Red man 's Eden-chine , Where bloomed the wildest flower . The great ships brought a wondrous race , One evening o'er the ocean beach ; Strange was the pallor of their face , Strange was the softness of their speech . ' T was evening , and the sunset threw A gorgeous brilliance o'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue , But ocean rivalled all its sheen . The painted red men came to view , With marvel , what the winds had brought ,  --  For , surely , those proud vessels flew , As if their force from Heaven they caught . But who is yonder slender youth , With smoothest brow and smoother cheek , And eyes so full of boyhood 's truth , And mouth , which closed , yet seems to speak ? " Ah , sure , that lovely youth 's from Heaven ! " A dark-eyed maiden of the wood Sighed out upon the breath of even , As in the mellowed light she stood . And , ever from that fatal hour , This white youth 's image , slight and pale , Would haunt the maiden 's leafy bower , And wake her spirit 's wail . In that high heart that fiercely hates , Love is as fierce and wild ; And so the love is wild , that waits To mount its height in this poor child : This poor , frail child who born beneath A roof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear a bridal wreath For youth of snowy gleam . Watoga ! sure some demon lied , To thee , when wrapt amid thy sleep , To make thee his forlornest bride , Beneath the moaning deep . That youth who floats an Angel through , Thy night , thy daily dream --  He loves a maid whose eyes are blue , And cheek like yon full moon 's white beam . The simple ornaments which thou Hast taken thy form to deck , The wild flower wreath that binds thy brow , The shells that gem thy neck ; Each ornament shall deck a bride To wed the Demon Death , Beneath the ocean 's sluggish tide , A thousand feet beneath ! The fair youth who hath warped thy mind , He loves a snow-white maid ! Then know'st it !  - -  now not long confined , Thou'lt fly the greenwood shade . ' T is night on lone Atlantic 's deep , And summer o'er that placid sea , The stars watch Earth 's scarce-breathing sleep --  Oh ! she sleeps deeply -- tenderly . What figure o'er yon bluff that scowls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freezing howl ? It is the forest 's daughter . One moment ,  - -  and the hollow moan Of billows sings her funeral song ;  --  In sooth , it was a dreadful tone , And it will haunt us long . This is the brief and mournful tale Of one who loved in vain ;  --  She slept not in the flowery vale , But in the deep , deep main , They tell she was a demon 's bride , But now a wondrous wail , Each night swells o'er the peaceful tide , And through the loudest gale . Watoga was her Indian name , The white men called her yellow-flower ;  --  And evil fire , a poisonous flame , Blasted her heart 's sweet bower . Failing to be the youth 's dear bride , Adorned in colors gay , She went to a Demon 's pride , Under the Sea , they say . And I have grieved to think of her , And , if in these degenerate years , There 's feeling , her most mad despair , Would melt a stone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid the ancient wood , Ye will perceive the lordly oak o'erspread The slender shrubs , and shield them from the storm . If ye will look upon a thrifty hive Of honey-loving bees , ye will remark A Sovereign rules this small but populous State ; And , if she live , they live , and fill with life The sunny air around -- but if she die , They quickly die , and then their precious sweet , Becomes a dainty dish for vilest worms . If ye will scan the custom of those birds , That seek the boreal lakes , when spring unfolds --  Soaring far up amid the azure heaven , Ye will note one who leads them in their flight , As Chief his army to the embattled fight , And , oft he shouts far back to them to cheer Their fainting hearts , and flagging pinions on , To trace the long , long course to far off lands . If ye will note the noblest of a flock , Ye will observe the weaker follow him . And thus if ye will wisely look on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To every work ; for this is nature 's law , And whoso breaks it , breaks it to his hurt . Fair France once drooped beneath the feeble rule , A blighting reign , of many a Bourbon fool , Until Napoleon rose , her natural king , And crushed the Bourbon , as an abscess thing . Great Heaven decrees , that Greater still must reign , Or else the weaker must exist in vain . Fair France seemed conscious of this grand design , And hailed Napoleon as a man divine --  Bedecked his path for many a flowery mile , And claimed her monarch with a beaming smile . Thus came Napoleon -- and , on every hand , Fair Joys prepared to hover o'er the land . Then , France ! thy glorious age was nigh begun , When rose upon thee such a glorious sun ; Soon had thy bliss and praises been complete , And Earth had , falling , worshipped at thy feet . Beneath this monarch 's rule -- who loved the best --  Thy meanest subject had been very blest . And thou had'st antidated our high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , ever , Envy views , with murderous eye , Those souls who strive to make their station high . When France was weak , her sister realms were kind --  When France grew strong , in hellish league combined , They sought to crush her to the sordid earth --  Lest she should grow -- and they should pine in dearth . Go beat the spaniel , if he rouse thine ire , His servile nature may no more aspire --  But leave the lion in his lordly lair , Or he thine entrails in his rage will tear . Go , rob the linnet 's unprotected nest , And rend her offspring , from her little breast ; But leave the Eagle in his eyrie high , Or thy torn flesh shall hush his eaglet 's cry . Fair France 's lion was Napoleon ! he Roamed o'er the land , a monarch proud and free : And when the Nations , in their pigmy might , Provoked the Lion to engage in fight , With gory jaw , he rent their legions strong , And left them bleaching the wide earth along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thro ' her sky , a monarch proud and free : And when the boy-like kingdoms thought to bring The glorious soarer down with bleeding wing , With swift , fierce swoop , he darted from on high , And the rent pigmies , shrieked with mighty cry . Vain were their wishes , all their envy vain , They could not bring the soarer to the plain ;  --  Till Fate 's fell arrow -- surer than the rest --  Winged the far flight , and pierced his glorious breast . Then fell Napoleon , Eagle of his clime , By Fate 's fell shaft , from yon proud heaven sublime : And when he fell , France knew no keener woe , Then the deep piercing of that mortal blow . The sweet land drooped , and sickened in her grief --  That hope so happy , had given truth so brief --  That Fate 's fell shaft her glorious Bird had slain , No more o'er conquered earth to soar again . But not at once Napoleon breathes his last --  More woes must come -- if now the worst be past . Napoleon 's star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him not a place to die . That he must hie him to an alien shore , And see his France , and blue-eyed boy no more . The noble Lion must be chained at length , By Fate 's strong force , though not by man 's weak strength . But , harmless now , that meaner things shall prey On whom they fled from , in his Glory 's day . Oh ! when the Chieftain turned to wave adieu To lovely France , across the waters blue , The iron man who never quailed in war , Where Death 's conspiring darts flew fast and far --  If peering Envy marked no gushing tear --  Wept , wept to leave the land that was so dear --  And if that woe was mute -- it was more deep , As deepest floods , in silent caverns sleep . But who are they to whose exalted name , He turns for friendship in his fall 's deep shame ? What flattered enemy may gladly prove , A fallen Hater yet may know her love ? Britannia ! in this latest deep distress , Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatness to a fallen foe , And make thy fame sublime o'er all below . Lo ! on yon dreary isle , yon desolate rock , That quails beneath old ocean 's ceaseless shock --  Where flaming suns and sudden ruins combine , Fo waste and wreck the human form divine --  Where man cut off from all most dear to man , Makes hopeless exile , happy if he can :  --  Then say ; Britannia ! that thy nobleness Deigns thy asylum to thy foe 's distress ? Say , this the Glory which thou lov'st to boast , O'er meaner dwellers of each neighboring coast ? Contracted nation ! thy contracted home , A sterile rock round which the billows foam ! How well consorts it with thy dwarfish soul , That owns no noble feeling 's high control . What glorious record holds the past of thee , What single page from foul disgrace is free ; Bend , weeping Mary , Scotland 's lovely Queen , With noblest grace , and sad , yet royal mien , Bend from yon dome of pure , celestial blue , Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bosom , did she live -- or die --  Unheard -- uncared for , her last lingering sigh ? On yon bleak isle , behold the Eagle razed , Who lately soaring , down on Europe gazed . See now a jackal move about his gate , Gloat o'er his grief , and mock his fallen State --  Howl round his nobler prisoner every hour , How brave ! to mock him now , deprived of power ! Behold , on yon lone rock the Lion bound , Who once o'er prostrate Europe looked around ; See now , a Spaniel , yelping at the gate Of his strong dungeon , mock his altered State . Methinks , when dying on that lonely isle , The sad abode of his most sad exile ; If , haply , he had touched the mournful lyre , It breathed this " Farewell "  - -  ere he did expire . " I die not on this hideous rock , As common men would die ; The world will weep above my grave , Despite a dismal lie . I well endure the fiercest pangs That myriads give to one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , To leave thee so undone . My towering aim , to see thy fame O'er all beneath the sky --  So much -- at last -- is now achieved , And , half content , I die . The woes my foes decree me here , Ne'er wake my faintest sigh --  But when I view my country 's woes , Not yet I wish to die . But lo ! the Future opens now , Before my glazing eyes , And shapes of new and coming things , Before my vision rise . I see the Bourbon hurled at last , From France 's tottering throne , A proud Napoleon reigning there , France , smiling , points her own ! ' Earth yet adores my mighty name --  And , late , laments my doom , Nor longer wrongs the gliding ghost That loathes its island tomb .

SCENE I. -- A WOODED MOUNTAIN IN BLOOM -- TIME SUNRISE -- ENTER LOVER SOLUS . This is my fair resort , the Summer Sun Is rising there , the ocean gleams like gold , On which his rolling chariot burns like fire . Ten thousand birds are up in branch and air , To hail this coronation , every day Repeated from the first to last of time . It is a glorious sight , and worthy all That has been said or sung of it in verse . But yet ' t is dim to me , Odora 's eyes Have cast that glory in a dull eclipse , Oh ! sweet Odora !

Upon this mountain 's green and glittering brow , Where now I stand and gaze down earth and main , O'er which that God 's all gladdening glory soars . Come , sweet Odora ! thine eyes outshine that God . Thy speech 's music so transcends these birds , They 'll pine for grief and die . Oh sweet , come , come . ENTER ODORA IN THE DRESS OF A WOODNYMPH . Transcendant vision ! Even now I thought of thee , My mind , o'erheated , called -- and thou art here . What blissful fate hath brought thee ? Dost thou roam The scented hills at morn , to gather flowers ; To gaze into the fountain 's glassy mirror , Or list the sweet birds sigh on every bough , Thou art a woodnymph , speaks thy fair attire . Sweet fancy of a sweeter maidenhood , That thou dost walk at dawn a woodnymph wild . Here will I seal upon thy foam-white brow My flame again , which burns like yonder orb . Odora ! speak to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a ship-wrecked soul . SCENE II.  - -  LOVER IN A GORGEOUS SALOON IN A GREAT CITY -- EVENING -- ENTER ODORA -- LOVER SPEAKS . Again I meet my love .

Like yonder moon , at times , she disappears ;  --  But still the virtue of her visit stays , Till she returns , with moon-like certainty . Come , my Odora come ! sing , ODORA SINGS . When winds are cold , and winter strips , The Oak and ghostly Pine ; And fastens every streamlet 's lips , And cold icicles shine : Still fair amid the scene so bleak , The daisy flower is seen ; So truest love will comfort speak , And make life 's winter green . That strain would charm an adder even to tears , So sweet a song , from mouth so full of grace . Before I saw thee , my Odora ! ne'er I thought this world could ever grow so fair To me . Love throws a rosy , sparkling tissue On mountain , hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love sweetens every note of nature seven fold . But sing again . Thy voice is like a harp . ODORA SINGS . When winds are bleak , and snows are deep , And waters frozen dumb ; And voiceless insects snugly sleep , Where beam can never come : The daisy blooms beneath some tree , That screens her form from harm ;  --  So , love ! I nestle near to thee , And live beneath thy arm . Oh ! angel ! thou dost sing a meaning lay , And teachest wisdom , in sweet poetry . But whence , my fair philosopher , thy lore , Hath God bestowed such deep laid knowledge on A light and playsome girl , whose pranks and wiles Have quite bewitched my would-be firmer soul . Methinks thou singest well to-night ; adieu , And may pure angels bring thee radiant dreams . SCENE III . AN EVENING IN SUMMER . A GARDEN.  - -  LOVER ALONE , AND READING A BOOK . A tale of happy love ! ' T is like my fate . Two youthful beings , yearning each for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks , Beneath the evening star -- the star of love . Their souls fled to each other suddenly : So that they felt they were ordained of old , To twain be one , one flesh , one bone , one soul . They loved , and dwelt among the grassy hills , By lakes that mirrored all their trees and flowers . A happy life , and curly-headed boys Were round their steps , their walks , their cottage door , Filling the air with laughter , silvery sweet . Gay spring , bright summer , autumn , winter passed , And found and left them happy , So time flew , Till both were old , their hearts yet light and gay . Then , they slept sweetly , side by side , near by A favorite stream they oft had gazed upon , Meek christians said they hoped that love so rare Had full fruition found , in brighter worlds . It is a happy story , and my eyes , Have poured their pearl upon these pages here , That tell so dear a tale . Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and me . I will go seek Odora , and return To talk with her amid this fragrant bower , Of what a book has charmed my sighing soul . I found it here . Perchance she read it first . How that one thought which doth fill up the mind , Will color outward objects , circumstance , And accident , with tincture of itself . He goes -- then Odora and he re-enter the garden . LOVER SPEAKS.  - -  I here have found , Odora , love , this book , Which tells a strange , sweet tale of happy love , How two young beings found a heaven on earth , Cans't tell me , whence it came , if fact or dream ? ODORA SPEAKS.  - -  It is a happy story . In my father 's room Of precious volumes late I fell on this ; And read it in this garden ; sweet romance , It brought the love-beats to my heart , drops to mine eyes .

Sure , earth now seems no place of graves . A wide Gay , blooming Paradise ! With moistened face , She smiles , like God , upon this joyous world . A new , wild burst of various harmony , Salutes that Bow of charm -- that orb of Glory . Thou art the sun and rainbow to my heart , And , as they fade from sight -- but do not die --  But come to-morrow with their wonted charms , Thou shalt not die -- but gleam o'er me in heaven , With none of all thy beauty , lost or less . Can'st thou not sing a song , love , ere it fades ? SHE SINGS . The Sun gave birth to yonder bow That trembles in the sky That life-bestowing sun art thou --  That trembling bow am I. When he withdraws his beaming face , The rainbow disappears ; And , if those frown on me but once , I melt away in tears . I thank thee for that song . Oh ! thou art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thy thoughts fall down on me , like drops of gold . SCENE V. THE BANKS OF A ROMANTIC RIVER , FLOWING AMONG MOUNTAINS , AND VIEWED BY MOONLIGHT . How wild this scene , among the mountains lit By moonbeams . Ivied bluff and cedared bank , And river rippling o'er its gravelly floor . The cool and silence , and the holy night , Remember me of fairies , those strange forms , That ever revelled underneath green trees , And danced upon the velvet , verdant sward . Here will I sit upon this grassy knoll , And hear the song of this sweet water 's flow , And gaze upon yon moon , who nears her noon . How beautiful to me , are moonlight shores . Here will I sing of loved Odora 's charms , What time she lies locked in sleep 's rosy arm . No bird was ever fairer in its nest . No bud e'er sweeter in its unoped cup ; No jewel brighter in the chrystal sea ; No diamond richer in the caves of earth . LOVER SINGS .

Angels of Earth ! they soothe and bless The troubled soul of man , Bestow the most of happiness , They can . Angels of Earth -- they are but few , Sustained by Heavenly grace , To raise again , and to renew , Our race . Predestined thus they do retain That image earliest given , To Adam , yet unknowing pain , From heaven .

Or , to the thrush 's full , rich song That gushes from her breast , And hushes all wild Passion 's throng To rest ? Could I compare the sight of her , To glorious angel spring --  To whose sweet breath -- all lands -- seas -- stir , And sing . Oh fair Harmonia ! God is love , Who gave thee to our earth , To renovate and lift above Our birth . Harmonia dwelt within a vale Of wildest loveliness , Where sweetest odors fill 'd the gale To bless .

Oh ne'er thought we , a vale of earth , With morn , and noon , and even , Could seem to own the very worth Of heaven . Such is the valley of the spring , Our sweet Harmonia 's home , Where beauty sheds , with liberal wing , Her bloom . Meek Eva is another soul , Ordained to soothe and bless , And charm to joy , with soft control , Distress .

In ancient days , in old , immortal Rome , Where virtues , surnamed Roman , had their home ; When Virtue triumphed over Vice , and threw Across their annals , a more lovely hue ; When every citizen was proud to be The state 's fast friend , and venal bribes would flee ; When manhood wrote upon each lofty brow That glorious seal which makes the meaner bow ; When Industry , Art , Science , Learning cast That light o'er Rome which gilds her to the last ; The Roman minstrel caught the sacred flame , And made that age the chosen child of fame : The Golden Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first , sweet bower .

Mankind sustains thee with a noble rage : All , all unite to gild thee with some rays Of gathered light -- themselves with shining praise .

Ye love-charmed bowers of Spain ! your Houris ' eyes Are rayless now -- for brighter lustre vies ! Ye , boundless plains , and giant hills , that rise In craggy pride , and prop Columbia 's skies , Ye view your maddened sons , with guilty haste , Roll from your shores and tempt the watery waste --  Forgotten every claim that Virtue knows , Despised the scenes , where early childhood rose , Swift to the land of gold , they , joyful , flee , Nor care the sacred joys of home again to see .

And how uncertain is the hold on life , In those sad lands of gold and constant strife . Fiends strike by day ; by night they ever lurk , By wood or cottage , swift to do Death 's work ; Till even when none are near to deal the blow , Imagination sees a hidden foe , Behind each tree , and by the little cot , Till gloomy Apprehension shades each spot . Lo ! in yon bower of honeysuckle where A thousand bees intone the summer air ; And humming birds , a fairy birth of springs , Hover to suck the sweet on quivering wings ; There , at the morning 's sweet and balmy prime , A clasping couple blame the swift-wing 'd Time . Each morn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply bless its fair and fragrant flower , Which shadows o'er so much of wildest bliss --  The burning glance -- the long and honied kiss --  The broken sigh -- the murmured , tender word , Whose thrilling tone the inmost heart hath stirred --  The matchless joy which makes us hold as nought , All pangs that Fate may bring , or ever brought . The lover hears that far amid the West , Gold gleams within each river 's crystal breast --  That , wide and far , the gorgeous vision smiles , And laps the spirit in delicious wiles . He quits -- he flies -- he will behold the strand , Where Wealth lies gasping for his tardy hand . He will return -- an edifice shall rise In stately grandeur to the curving skies ; In their own land , his lovely bride and he , Will move a lord and lady of degree .

He sees the land -- before his gaze unfold The mighty , gorgeous realms of guilt and gold . How swells his bursting heart with evil pride ! Cursed pride , for which so many souls have died . Accursed pride of Lucre -- loathsome Dame Of every sin on earth that hath a name . In fancy now he sees his palace soar A fairy work ! upon his childhood 's shore ; In fancy sees his smiling , loving bride , A queen amid her menial train preside ; And quite forgets that she his wiser wife , Would love some cot , wherein to pass their life :  --  Till Fate , vindictive , lays her lover low Far from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dies -- his spirit 's latest groan By her unheard -- his latest wish unknown .

Enticed by gorgeous dreams that haunt his sleep , Her age 's pillar wanders o'er the deep --  Deserts his aged , widowed , trembling dame --  Ah thus will gain destroy the sense of shame ! There on those barren hills and burning plains , His insane fancy gloats on glittering gains . Until , at last , avenging fever lays , His form on earth , through dark , delirious days , Without a mother 's soothing care to ease His dying throes , beyond those distant seas . Yet , when , in that brief space which comes before , The spirit flies , to visit earth no more , A transient light breads on his wildest brain , His bosom speaks in this lamenting strain !

" Far mid yon vastest woods , behold a swain . If small his joy , small is his spirit 's pain . He tills the soil , for him the wild flowers bloom , And lovely daisies shed their meek perfume . His happy wife , relieves his every care , And bliss is double when enjoyed with her . His flocks supply his little household dear , With decent garments , and salubrious fare . Glad he beholds the smiling god of day , Walk from the East upon his radiant way , Gild all the fields -- the lengthy plains -- the peaks Of giant mountains , with vermillion streaks --  While all his farm spreads out beneath his eyes , His heart 's sweet home -- his little paradise . How better far this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strife . How glad he views his prosperous projects smile , What guiltless joys his long , long life beguile . With joy he sees his offspring rise around , His body 's scions , with sweet virtue crowned . And , when , at last , his form succumbs to time , He sees that offspring strangers yet to crime ; And , inly joys to think his drooping age They will sustain , and all his pains assuage , Till , like an apple mellowed , ripe , and sound , He falls , and slumbers in his own good ground . THE PROPHECY OF COLUMBIA . The sun descends along the glowing west , His bright rays quivering o'er Potomac 's breast --  And still he flashes , with his parting smile , And gilds the top of yonder mighty pileC --  Which Heroes children bade arise to heaven --  In this new paradise ( though later given . ) He sets ! that glorious orb ! and now is gone --  And night 's dark wings are slowly moving on ;  --  But see ! the moon , full-orbed , ascends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on high --  Pours her soft light -- a sea of silvery beams , On that proud pile -- as on the sleeping streams ; As if indignant that the Night would hide , With her black wing , a nation 's central pride --  That towering dome , beheld from o'er the sea , To crown the clime of all who now are free . As there I wandered , when the day was o'er --  Near that proud pile -- along the silent shore --  And , fondly lingering o'er the magic scene , Marked each blest spot , where Freedom 's feet had been ,  --  The Present fled -- the Future rose to light --  Columbia 's Genius stood revealed to sight . Her Phantom form uprose and touched the sky --  Her mighty realm lay stretched beneath her eye . An awful light -- yet gentle -- yet serene --  Shone from those eyes , and from her god-like mien ; At first , cold fear ran through my shivering frame , And dread forebodings o'er my spirit came . But soon she spoke -- though not in warlike tone , But mild as zephyr when his breath hath blown . A smile of kind , parental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " O son ! well-pleased , I mark thy patriot fire , Nor wholly scorn thy yet unpracticed lyre . Behold yon structure whose lone , silent height Meek Luna gilds with her celestial light . See how it soars ! and leaves the darker plain --  So high -- that none will soar , as that again --  Until the Monument that God will rear On sin 's dark grave -- as Tyranny 's is here . Yes ! view that Capitol ;  - -  its lofty dome O'erlooks the clime thou lovest to call thy home . Just , just the joy thou feelest -- it o'er views , The happiest land that quaffs the sun 's bright hues . But think thou not that , this , my chosen land Has reached its borders -- they shall yet expand --  Until yon heap , on which the moonbeams play , O'erlooks a hemisphere that owns my sway . There boundless tracts of evershining snow , There -- flowery isles that in the tropics glow --  There sea-like pampas , waving to the main , There -- thousand cities dotting o'er the plain --  There -- noble James -- there Hudson 's fairy tide --  There -- Susquehanna -- e'er with Song allied --  Here -- broad Potomac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the skies .

And yon dusk hillD , amid the moon 's pale light , In nation 's eyes , shall soar a prouder height --  Till from each shore where man has learned to dwell --  The eyes shall strain , and feel the mighty spell --  For there repose the bones of Washington --  Upon that hill -- earth 's noblest , earthly one . But this Columbia 's fairest praise shall be , Her Sons shall kneel beneath their chosen tree --  At prayer -- as fades the daylight into even --  And , lift -- unblamed -- their hearts to smiling Heaven . Here Learning , too , shall rear unnumbered domes , Here **25;2974;TOOLONG more happy homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace , A sacred charm shall give to many a place .

And when I waked , the day had now unfurled His rosy banners o'er the laughing world , And while the glorious prospect charmed my view , I felt Columbia 's prophecy was true . Footnote C : The National Capital at Washington . Footnote D : The Tomb of Washington , at Mount Vernon . LOVE . Of woman was I born , and man I am . I come to teach the greatest , yet the most meek Of all true lessons which man e'er can learn --  God 's man was made to love , and nought to hate , Except the Ill which God and angels hate . Oh ! this grand lore hath fallen on my heart Like smiling sunlight on a gloomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love Vibrating through the universe of worlds , Through every grain of matter , through the hearts That live and swarm beneath the eye of God . Oft standing mid the holy calm of night , The surf of love came rolling on my soul From off the farthest verge of God 's great realms , As rolls the surf of ocean on a beach , For ever and for ever , and for ever . Love was the Cause of all things , and the End ; For God is Love and ever will be Love : And those who feel most love are most like God --  As seraphs , cherubs , saints and righteous men ; And those who feel least love , are least like God , As Satan , Moloch , Belial , and bad men . Once man , and all that live and move on earth , In sea , and sky , were bound by links of love To God and angels , in one perfect chain --  And God and angels came and talked with man Full often , in the shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down together , All in the happy shade of Eden 's trees . Oft have I watched the myriad lovely flowers , In spring and summer , in the woods and meads , And thought they clasped their tiny hands in love , Then all bowed low their painted heads in love , To the great lord of light who smiled on them . Oft have I watched the myriad forest leaves , Trembling as if with some sweet thought of love , Till love 's sweet incense went up from all these , To the bright orb who smiled bright love on them : And then a thousand birds began to sing One song of love to that bright God above . Oft I have heard that larks , in England 's realm , Fly from the earth , at morning 's golden blush , And fill the whole bright arch with golden songs ? And I have reasoned they sung only love , Which teaches them that strangest melody , Which they soar nearest heaven to warble out . Oft have I seen the beams that leave the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a splendid arch in earth and heaven , Which shines eternal covenant of Love --  Toward which our hearts forever mount and sing , As skylarks mount and sing to morning 's flash . Oft have I seen the sparkling water-drops , Cohere in love , and make a crystal lake --  A gulf -- a sea -- an ocean 's mighty mirror . Oft have I thought that all the system worlds , A few of which we watch , at holy night , Far up amid those deep , blue fields of night --  Are hung by Love , and wheel forever round The Central Point , in circles swift but true ; And in their orbits flying thus for ever , Sing forth a choral song of burning love , To that Creator who loves them again . Oft have I thought , the law which Newton named The Law of Gravitation , is the Law Of Love , which God had called the Law of Love . And if a world could ever hate the rest , ' T would rush forever to the abysm of gloom , And dreariest part of chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nought to hate Only the Ill which God and Angels hate . Ah ! happy spirits were they all in heaven , And all loved God , and one another loved --  And all moved round the Triune God enthroned --  In blissful circles -- nearing him for aye , Yet not approaching ever -- till that Foul And Hateful One fell off from love and then Fell down into his dark , eternal den , Where love 's sweet beam can never , never reach . THE LOVERS . Two lovers in the strength of life , Had built a beauteous home , Where tall , ancestral oaks uprose , O'ershadowing their high dome . He was a tall and manly form , With ringlets dark like night ; But she was like the lily 's stem , With eyes of moon-like light . Six happy years they chronicled Within their nest of bliss ; To taste each day some sweetest joy , They could not go amiss . Three little images of them , Two boys and one a maid , Beneath those high , ancestral oaks , With silver laughter , played . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ; The wife bowed low her head and heart , To sorrow 's strong control . The lady drooped -- as droops a flower Without the sun or rain ; And now at twilight 's hectic flush , She sang a wild , low strain : " He 's gone , I can not smile as when I saw him at my side ! Ah me ! the memory of that hour When I was his new bride . " Our two young hearts were joined in love , As two bright lamps of flame , Cut off from him , life is to me A mockery and a name . " God help my helpless little ones , And keep them for his own . My heart is breaking -- husband ! long Thou shalt not be alone . " When faded all the autumn flowers The lady surely died --  Broken the bands that bound her life To him -- his wife and bride . Love was the Cause of all things , and the End , For God is Love , and ever will be Love . God 's grey-beard prophets sang a future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , And the first Eden be rebuilt on earth ; That lions and all lambs should play together , On the long grass of Eden 's greenest lawns . That man should yet behold that happy scene , When one loud jubilate of worship -- love --  Should climb the heavens from each lone shore of earth . SONG . Oh ! Love 's the sweetest joy of earth , Love 's keenest pang is bliss , And , like a wild , delirious bee , We hang upon a kiss : With lip to lip and heart and heart , We live in that sweet death , And feel the breeze of paradise , Upon a loved one 's breath . We lean upon a beating breast , As on a throne of gold ; And , like a monarch , thence , look out , On love-hued sea and wold . We dwell upon a loved one 's song , As on a strain of heaven , And think it charms the throbbing stars That throng the halls of Even . Oh ! Love is like a river-flood , That rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forever . This is the lore I come to teach the world --  That Love formed all of matter , all of spirit ; That Love keeps all things , lest they fall to chaos ; That Love 's pulse vibrates throughout all God 's works , Whose beat is harmony like angels ' songs --  And man is most like God and least like Devil , When he most loves all things which God hath made . HOURS WITH NATURE . When smiling spring , an angel fair ! Walks o'er the verdant plain , And breathes a soft and balmy air , From isles beyond the main : When robins sing , and waters play , And lambs skip o'er the mead , And forest birds , with music gay , Their callow offspring feed : When May-flowers shine by every stream , And fragrants showers come down , While sun-rays o'er the mountains gleam , And form a dazzling crown :  --  Oh ! then ' t is sweet to be with thee , Dear Nature ever fair , To roam thy walks of song and glee , Thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , thou seem'st divine , With ever smiling brow : No sin-created gloom is thine , Nought dims thy beauty now . Wide earth , stream , river , lake and sea , Shine forth an angel land , Where spirits , robed in purity , Roam , love-linked , hand in hand . Now June , like full-blown womanhood , Succeeds the maiden spring , And broods upon the solitude , With broad and bird-like wing . The air re-echoes forth a song Of full and perfect bliss , Where happy lovers roam along , And melt into a kiss . But Summer bursts upon the world , With views of waving grain , Beneath the sweating sickle hurled , Upon the fragrant plain . The warm , long day calls forth at length , The storm 's electric fire , That shatters the oak 's imperial strength , And bids the shrubs expire . The cloud rolls off -- and see ! what pride ! A many colored bow , Hangs on the cloud 's retreating side , And o'er the fields below . Then , glorious summer flies away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crowned with shocks of hay , Appears in joy again . Old , jolly Autumn ! happy man ! Wild tumbling on the meads ; We 'll love thee , Autumn , as we can , Thy glory is our needs . Thou heapest our barns with plenty -- thou Art , sure our faithful friend ; And , in the aspect of thy brow , Lovely and useful blend . Thy golden hues recede at length , And seem to sigh decay , Till , thou , despoiled of life and strength , Art borne , a corpse , away . Wild , bleak , and blustering Winter wild , Assumes the icy throne ; Deep snows upon the earth are piled , And hushed is every tone . The trees stand bare , bleak skeletons , Of bodies once so fair , And dirges , dirges , woeful ones , Resound amid the air . Bleak , winter wild ! thy dreary scenes , Have yet one modest flower ; The daisy finds some little greens , Whereby she builds her bower . The daisy is a preacher wise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetly tries , A loving word to say . " Oh ! man , amid thy darkest woe , Some humble bliss remains ;  --  Then , let thy murmurings cease to flow , And hush thy doleful strains . " It is the dawn . Faint crimson streaks The dewy , orient sky , Like virtue 's blush , on maiden cheeks , Ah ! sweet and peerless dye . At last -- the sun , an Eastern king , Comes forth in rested pride ; And soars , with bright and burning wing , Above the hill and tide . Above yon Blue Ridge , towering piles , Uptorn by Nature 's throe --  He speeds , he speeds , through myriad miles , To his meridian glow . The birds sink down , amid the copse , And sing a feeble song ; At last , each sound , on sudden , stops , And Silence holds the throng . But Evening , comes , a sober maid , With one bright , starry eye ; And throws her mantle -- star-inlaid --  Upon the silent sky . It is night 's noon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; A shadow o'er the earth is cast , That wakes the spirit 's fears How death-like hushed ! all life seems dead , Does Nature live at all ? Ah , truest symbol ! it has said , " The hush -- the gloom -- the Pall ! " Day is the varying life of Man ,  --  Some sunshine -- clouds again --  Night is his death -- which erst began When Sin began to reign . Dark , spectral Night ! I sing of thee ; For , thou art lovely , too --  And Death will wake the melody Of him whose life was true . To walk upon the azure sea , It is a thing of bliss ; When skies are bright , and sails are free And smiling wavelets kiss . How grandly leans the ship , a queen , Above the sparkling tide --  With joy she walks the watery scene , A thing of fear and pride . To scale the crown of vast Blue Ridge , And eye the world below --  **25;3001;TOOLONG bridge --  And soaring crane and crow --  And misty woods -- and fields afar --  Neat villages and towns --  Blest herds and flocks no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! that is , sure , a pleasant thing , And bathes the soul in joy ; And many a grief-worn man ' t would bring , To be once more a boy . ' T is sweet to rove , at twilight dim , Beside an aldered stream , To list thy lady 's evening hymn , ' Neath starlight 's trembling gleam . ' T is sweet to sit within a bower , Inwrought with flower and vine , What time along yon mountain tower , The shades of eve decline . ' T is sweet to hear the nightingale , O'erflow the forest shade , With harmony which might avail , To win a Dis-stole maid . ' T were sweet to cleave the snowy foam , With ship and spirit free , Where tropic spices ever roam , The Caribbean sea .

Nature ! thou art far above , The painter 's , Poet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavenly bride . YORKTOWN . Here met three nations , panoplied for fight , Moving before the vision gorgeously ; Then shamed with Battle 's gloom the paling Night , Upon the land and sea . Earth quailed beneath the cannon 's burrowing roar , Beneath three Armies ' slow and ominous tread ; And Ocean who the portioned conflict bore , Shuddered with pain and dread . But when the morning rolled the double shroud Of Night and Battle from the land and sea , The Sun looked forth through no obstructing cloud , And saw a Nation FREE . POET 'S ENCHANTED LIFE . THE ANGEL-CHILD . A fairy land of grass and flowers , And of the greenest trees A land of singing brooks and springs , A land of singing breeze . A land of bright but mellowed hues , Beneath the western skies , The lady bore a beauteous child , In this sweet paradise . An auburn head -- an olive face --  An eye of azure light --  A perfect beauty seemed the child , To my enchanted sight . I loved him for his loveliness , This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would leap When e'er the infant smiled , And when upon her warming breast , She watched his closing eyes , His lips would smile , as if he saw The angels in the skies . And truth to say , she ofttimes thought , The angels were near by , So strange a gleam was on his hair , So bright his cherub eye . He was so meek and gentle-souled , So free from evil stain , Ah ! well I knew , ' t were toil to find So lovely child again . It was a antique , white-walled cot , Beneath the western skies , This lady dwelt with this sweet child , In this sweet paradise . The mother loved her beauteous child ; Oft gazing on his sleep , The joy that smoothed her matron brow , Was beautiful and deep . The summer flower hath hasty growth --  The sweet child grew apace , And lo ! a brighter loveliness , Was born upon his face . So fair -- so fair -- and oh ! so dear ! Alas ! a mother 's love May be too strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now alone the mother was In all this world so wide , For ere the child had lisped his name Her stricken husband died . Alone in all this world so wide , Alone the mother was ; If this were true -- God wot ' t was false , Our hearts should sigh alas . The child -- the child -- transformed ! come down , On rainbow-colored wings , Whose flashing , o'er the mother 's path , A mystic glory flings . He set gay flowers of heavenly pride Amid this cursed clime --  Ah ! brilliant flowers -- ah ! brighter flowers , Than bloomed in Eden 's prime . He softly led her on the way , And sang to her charm 'd soul , A sweet , low strain that men heard not , And fiends could not control . At last the mother went with him To dwell on Heaven 's wide plain , Where father , mother , cherub now , Sing forth a glorious strain . SUNSET . The Summer 's sunset throws a tender spell , Along the hills , o'er ocean 's softened swell ; The God of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on perfumed pinions by . Oh ! who can gaze upon this gorgeous sight , Nor feel his bosom chain 'd by deep delight , This hour when beauty wears her richest dye , And love o'erflows charmed ocean , earth and sky ; Till fancy , dreaming in her lovely bower , Hears far off strains of deep , o'erwhelming power , And , lifting up her pensive orbs above , Spies Angels winging through yon vault of love , And says that " they are wafting souls forgiven On their bright pinions , to yon nameless Heaven . " On such an eve , so peaceful and so bright , Two loved ones flee beyond yon failing light , No more to droop within this gloomy world , Their angel pinions next God 's throne were furled ; There now -- for aye forgot this earthly night --  They lave those bright wings in eternal light . IMAGINATION . Now fir 'd imagination soars on high , and shows Magnific scenes . The first -- a summer 's dawn --  A sky of purest blue -- a golden sea Beneath -- earth bright with lovely hues like Heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , burns like a throne in Heaven . His foaming , flashing radiance , floods earth -- sky --  And throbbing sea , till each lies bathed in glory , Which seems the break of a celestial morn . That scene has passed . Another charms The gaze . The mighty orb of blazing flame , Has run a curve of brightness o'er the sky , And presently will cut the Western main , With its bright rim . We stand upon an isle , One of the Hesperian , in the unknown seas , Toward the setting sun . The waves which gush , And softly splash against the rocky shores , Are dyed by richest , ever varying tints , Like those , we fancy , tinge that sea that flows , Around the throne of God , and , in whose billows , The seraphs , as wing 'd birds , embathe their breasts --  Whilst heaven becomes another sea like that --  And all is bright waves dashing o'er our hearts , And making music sweeter than the songs Of those we loved in youth , ere hatred grew . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more ambitious flight . But , soon restored , with native , heavenly might , She soars beyond the sun high thron 'd at noon --  And , with her hand that flows with gold and gems , Flings wide Heaven 's gates that flame with living beams . And lo ! the scene of Heaven ! Oh ! brighter far , Than aught earth shows of beautiful or fair , Is that bright heaven of our hopes and dreams . Yet even imagination 's piercing eye Receives into its scope but humble part Of all the glory that o'erflows that heaven . A boundless sea of love -- all hued like love , Gleams round the throne of Triune God , which seems To rise from out that placid depth , built of Its water , crystallized to gold and pearl , Wherein joy 's beauteous light forever plays . Over that sea rings set beyond vast rings Of burning seraph , saint , and cherub , stand With starry crowns ; and , with unceasing songs , Struck from their lyres that burn as morning suns , And born in hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet more sweet Than all the sweetest strains e'er heard on earth , Fill Heaven with light and song ineffable , Along the bright flow of eternity . Then swift in flight as saint and seraph there , She passes back through those vast gates of fire , And slowly drops upon some flowery peak , Or ocean isle , upon this mundane sphere ; Then sleeps soft in the folds of some fair flower , Or , in the crystal bosom of a dewdrop . MILLY . A fairy thing was Milly when She blest my wondering sight ; I ne'er shall meet her match again --  A maid so gaily bright . Her ringlets flowed about her neck --  A neck that mocked the snow ! A sunny robe her bosom decked , That proudly heaved below . Sometimes she roamed the leas at morn , And sang like a sweet bird --  Until a melody was born On each outgushing word . Sometimes amid her cottage home , She touched the breathing lyre , And then her quivering lips were dumb , Her soaring soul on fire . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crave That she with us might be delayed , And never reach the grave . One twilight when a star came forth , She clapped her hands and smil 'd , And said that star within the North Would take an earthly child . Did some near , viewless angel speak That word unto the maid , That thus with sweet , unblanched cheek , That awful word she said ? But thus it was ; when autumn told The yellow leaves to fall , The maid no more could we behold , No more she knew our call . And now I watch that cold , high star , Amid the leaden North , And think she looks on me afar , Forlorn upon this earth . THE WINTRY DAYS . The wintry days have come once more , The birds are still , the sweet flowers dead , And faint winds sigh a wailing song O'er leaves heaped high within their bed . The neighboring stream that lately leapt , And laughed , and played adown the glen , Is now as hushed and mute as though It ne'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky , And falls upon the gazer 's soul , And down the sympathizing cheek , The watery teardrops silent roll . The beauty of the peaks and plains , The loveliness of earth and sky , Have passed away , and , passing , said , " Ye mortals frail ! ye too must die . " So has the beauty of my hopes Withered beneath woe 's wintry touch ,  --  My heart has yielded to despair , Though lingering long and weeping much . But oh ! bright Hope , mid bleak Despair , Sprang , cheerly speaking to my heart , Sweet , smiling spring shall yet return , And joyless winter must depart . And Mercy throned beyond the sun , Whose breath thy living soul hath given , Will lead thee to a deathless spring Within the glorious gates of heaven . Ah ! deeply do I bless that word ! It drives my gloomy fears away ;  --  I kneel upon the dreary snow , And bid my God be praised for aye . SPRING . Now , Mary fair , the Spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to breathe perfume , The breeze blows sweet and bland ; The gay , green groves are ringing clear , The crystal waters shine ; Now , Mary sweet , the scene is dear , The moments are divine . And , Mary , hearken how the birds Are courting in the grove , Oh ! listen how their music words Speak tender things of love . Let us be happy , Mary fair , We waste these heavenly hours , Let 's rove where fragrance fills the air , Among the opening flowers . Yes , Mary dear , let 's quit the throng , And from the tumult flee , The birds these living bowers among , Shall sweetly sing for thee ; And happy zephyr wave his wing , And streams make melody , And loveliest flowers gaily spring Thy matchless face to see . Dear Mary , why , why should we stay , While Nature calls us forth ? See ! love and pleasure , smiling , stray , O'er all the gladsome earth ! While all around is mirth and song , Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathered throng , Our vows of love renew . AN INCIDENT . The sighs of summer night , were sweet without , As the breath of spirits , on the folded roses , The sweet moon , like a young and timid bride , Came softly trembling through the eastward oaks --  Where I espied a Glorious Beauty standing , Glowing and bright , in a portico vine-wreathed . Shaken by wrestling Hope and Doubt within , I quickly slid unto her side ; and she Wore no dark frown -- but smiled -- she smiled on me ! Her white brows shone amid her darkest hair , Like that moon 's beams amid the opening gloom : And her slight , delicate shape would shame the limbs Of fairies tripping on the moonlit green . And she did smile on me -- that Glorious Beauty ! And I stood there , and clasped her lily hands ! And I did peer into her lustrous eyes ! And they gave back my ardent gaze of love ! She spake -- the tremulous accents of her voice Was like a sweet stream breaking upon rocks ; And when the music of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bosom , And felt that we could part no more on earth . THE LETTER . Amid a flower-strown cottage room , The Lady sat at even , Beneath the peerless evening star , Just peeping out in heaven ; And , in her hands , as lilies , white , She held a billet-doux , Which , round upon the tranquil air , A grateful fragrance threw . And now she bends her beauteous head , To read the written lines --  Her white hand starts -- a crystal tear Upon the paper shines ; Her startled bosom gently heaves , Like billows capped with snow , And quickly o'er her lovely face , Her blushes come and go . Those glowing words have waked within Her soul , the flame of love , Which blends her woman nature with The natures of above :  --  A fire whose rays will change to light Her lover 's darkest gloom , Till he beholds it beam again , On Heaven 's undying bloom . THE LOST PLEIAD . No more with thy bright sisters of the sky , Who warble ever , Wilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ever . No more the bright , innumerable train , Who move in Heaven , Will know thy face upon the etherial plain , At rosy even . The night will mourn thine absence ever more , With dewy tears , And , the bright day , will , dimmer now , deplore , The darkened years . Our wandering eyes will search for thee in vain , And we shall sigh That thy high beauty could not conquer pain , The doom to die . Earth scarce had mourned some lesser beauty -- thou , Celestial maid ! Mid all didst wear a so unearthly brow , And thou -- decayed ! The beauteous thought of thee which , ray-like , slept , In our pure love , Became a memory which we have kept To grieve above . Gone , like the withered pride of early Spring --  Like sweet songs , o'er --  Ah ! thou hast turned from us thine angel wing , To come no more . Struck from thy high and glittering sapphire throne , In upper light , Say , did thy loveliness go , hopeless , down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate to fall , Bright maid divine ! Sublime amid the Eternal 's flaming Hall , Dost thou e'er shine ? THE SLEEPER . The sleeper lies , with closed eyes , And softly moving breath , So soft , so still , her life 's sweet thrill , ' T is only more than death . Her dark , dark hair , reposing there , Upon her pillow 's snow , And sweeping down her cheek 's faint brown , And bosom 's spotless glow . She wakes at last , her sleep has past , Her eyes on me are thrown ; My sleeping love -- my heavenly dove --  Has been in realms unknown . DWELLING IN HEAVEN . They do not -- nay , they can not die ; They go to dwell in Heaven ; Where God a free and full supply Of purest joys hath given . They do not -- nay , they can not die : Because we see them not Do objects cease -- oh ! brothers ! why This lesson now forgot ? They die not -- nay , they can not die : In joy 's serene , calm air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet as fair . Their tones yet breathe as sweet a strain , Their hearts are still as true , And still their wonted love retain , My friend , for me and you . Oh no ! they do not , can not die , They live far up in Heaven , Beyond where flame yon portals high , At still and silent even . They dwell -- they dwell eternally , Where roll no winds -- no storm , And , if we seek them , we shall see , Each bright and happy form . THE FACE I SEE IN DREAMS . Strangely sweet , and softly clear , With pure and starry beams , Reposing there , and moving here ; The face I see in dreams . Oh ! lovely is that wild , sweet face , Which thus and ever gleams , And smiles , with a seraphic grace , Upon my heart 's deep streams . Oft at pale midnight 's holy calm , Beside imagined streams , I recognize the soothing balm , The face I see in dreams . And , even at noon 's wideseeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face appears , as strangely fair , That face I see in dreams . The sum of universal charms , The sun of beauty-beams , Appear to deck that form of forms , And face I see in dreams . TO ELOQUENCE . Ah Eloquence ! thou God-like power ; That swayest the human heart , We still must call thee , rarest dower , In the high gift of Art ; And still thou shalt be styled a queen , To brighten earth 's grief-shaded green . When thou dost falter sorrow 's tale , With trembling accents low , The plaintive breezes of the vale , With mingled pathos , flow ; The melting eye is bathed in tears , And grief , in every face , appears . When thou dost stand in mortal 's view , And breathe thy thoughts of flame , The conscious soul , conceives them , too , And breathes and burns the same ;  --  And when , in fancy , thou dost soar , ' T is like Niag'ra 's thundering roar . When thou dost tell of living joys Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , Is like the Voice of Love --  The entranced spirit flits away To bathe in seas of whitest day . NEAR YONDER BANKS AT EVEN . Near yonder banks at even , We whispered words most dear , Till love 's sweet star in Heaven , Was shining , bright and clear . We saw the river glancing Beneath the planet 's light , Its ripples seemed , while dancing , To mock the gloom of night . But soon the star in Heaven , By rising mists was hid , And , by us , dark and even , The river 's current slid . So shone our love 's sweet river Beneath Hope 's radiant star ; But soon , in darkness , ever , It swept , in silence , far . AN HYMN . To him whose soul is locked and bolted fast , By lust and guilt against the entrance there , Of heavenly light ; whose soul is over-cast By mists of sin and fogs of black despair ; The meaning of these worlds , not understood , Becomes a dark and cabalistic book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , And that , His love was writ in every nook . Dark , dark his every view of actual things , The diamond shines with faint , unmeaning ray ; What use or beauty hath the bird 's gay wings ? What glory , worlds that sweep through space away ? His ear is barred against the glorious song , Which Nature chants , ne'er wearying , to her God ; The planetary paeans , borne along Through God 's high vault , descend upon a clod . Oh fool of fools , and wretched man is he , Who breathes his life in this untutored state ; And , in that world to come , how dread will be His startled soul 's at last awakened fate . But , unto him , whose scales have fallen away , Whose deafness has been healed by Love Divine ; A flood of music gushes in foraye , And all God 's works , with deathless lustre , shine . The diamond hath a beam that , conquering , vies ; The bird 's gay wings assume yet gayer hues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening and the morning dews . Sweeter the choral song of groves and founts , Grander the anthem of the starry spheres ; From God 's vast universe , forever , mounts A strain that charms his own and seraphs ' ears . Undaunted , he surveys the ocean rage , With placid face , he feels the earthquake 's shock , He knows his Lord the fury will assuage , His soul is safe , though earth 's foundations rock . The Omnipotent yet liveth ! He will bear The humble soul , on His parental breast ; And , when the last great throe the sky shall tear , This soul upon His arm shall surely rest . TO P.S. WHITE . What is the gilded chaplet worth , That decks a conqueror 's brow ? There is no conqueror on earth Of nobler kind , than thou , For bloodless victories are thine , Whose splendor never shall decline . The thanks of men redeemed from shame , The smiles of womanhood , The praise of great ones wed to fame , And of the humble good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming ages , unto thee . MONTPELIER , ORANGE COUNTY , VA . Where'er the great have lived or died , A charm pervades the very air ; And generous spirits , pausing , oft Will pour the heart 's deep homage there . Thus , thou , sequestered , simple spot ! Where dwelt a mighty one of yore , Becomest a shrine , where pilgrims kneel , From earth 's remotest , every shore . Whose fame , where'er a patriot breathes A thought of freedom , has been heard ; And fallen on tyrant 's startled souls , Like coming fate 's prophetic word . Yet , shame upon this senseless age , Which blindly worships guilty gold , No votive marble shows the tomb , Whose vault received his ashes cold . Alas ! that this should be our shame ! For which even yet our eyes shall weep ; Nought points the world 's admiring eye , To where its friend 's sad relics sleep . THE HEAVENLY FLOWER . Now the final stroke is over ! And the heart hath ceased its beat ; And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet . She has pass 'd the gloomy portal , She has reached the realm of light ;  --  And there is a heavy silence , While we sit and muse to-night . She was a flower , fading quickly , From before our wistful eyes , Giving back her spirit fragrance , Early to the eager skies . But she parted all so lovely , Growing brighter day by day , That our souls could scarce regret her , Passing , like a dream , away . Now that frail and beauteous flower , Which scarce opened here below , Scattering round a heavenly sweetness , On the hearts which bled with woe ; By a death which maketh living , Changed into a lovelier flower , Gives a fragrance far more lovely , Round about a deathless bower . Oh ! weep not for this , fond parents ! Though your earthly eyes be dim --  Yet -- she blooms in fadeless beauty , Where the Seraphs chant their hymn ; Where a heaven , serenely glorious , Bends above a paradise , Clad in tints of gayer splendor , Than our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deathless beauty , In that brighter world than ours ; Where the happy saints and angels , Gleam her glorious sister flowers ; Where no frost , no killing tempest , E'er shall fall , or fiercely blow , But mild zephyrs , waked on roses , Round her softly come and go . There she yet is pure and lovely As she was with us below --  And our hearts should cease to mourn her , When her God hath bade us know --  That , within that peaceful heaven , She is happier than before , And that we should strive to meet her , When , like hers , our toil is o'er . LILLY MAY . The fairest of our village maids , Was blue-eyed Lilly May ; Her brow was decked with golden curls , Her laugh was wild and gay : And spotless as a ray of heaven , Young love within her lay . The rose which decked the fairy vale , Near by our rural town , Showed not a deeper tint of blood , Than dyed her cheeks of down , And innocence like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown . Oh Lilly May ! Oh ! Lilly May ! My heart was all thine own , Earth ne'er gave me a sweeter sound , Than thy low , loving tone ; For we each other 's first loves were , And each heard each alone ! Oh Lilly May ! I curse the day That tempted me to part ! And ever haunting , strange regret To my sad soul thou art ; I fear that I have deeply sinned , And broken thy true heart . TO ELEANOR . When Hesper shows his rosiate lamp of love , High in yon lofty arch of dewy blue ; When gentle dews distilling from above , Sparkle upon the spreading grass and groves of yew --  When sinks to rest the faintly murmuring breeze , And dim and indistinct the landscape view --  Lonely I stray among the poplar trees And muse , dear Eleanor , dear love , on you . When Luna looks upon yon mountains brown , And gilds the winding stream with silvery hue , And Silence , like a fall of whitest down , Falls where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ivy green ; And human forms lie bathed in sleep 's soft dew --  Silent I stray along the fairy scene , And muse , dear Eleanor , dear love , on you . When golden streaks along the East appear , Spreading and flashing o'er that sea of blue ; And springs at length with aspect bright and clear , Great Sol upon the glittering world of dew --  The wakened Hours commence their wonted race , And Nature strikes her living harp anew --  Smiling I scan Creation 's glorious face , And muse , dear Eleanor , dear love , on you . THE VOW OF LOVE . ' T was evening 's hour of magic power , The sun went brightly down , And shadows fell as with a spell , Along the mountains brown . On high the sky , with gorgeous dye , Then glittered bright and wide , And westward far , the evening star , Came trembling like a bride . The birds did chime their drowsy rhyme , As day was getting o'er , The rippling wave , did sweetly lave The winding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair Holston 's lovely stream , My lady bright , at soft twilight , In beauty 's matchless gleam . And I did walk and softly talk Unto her beauty there , And deemed that she more fair must be , Than Goddess , wrought of air . Her hand in mine --  " Oh ! be thou mine , Nor scorn my pleading sigh . " " Yes "  - -  still I cried , " be thou my bride , My own , until we die ! " Now as that tide doth onward glide To reach the glittering sea , With sparkling glow , our souls will flow , To bright eternity . DISAPPOINTMENT . Last eve ere sleep had closed mine eyes , To me there came a dream , That when the saffron morn should rise O'er lovely hill and stream ; I should behold a vision move By yonder crystal spring --  A vision of an earthly dove , With pure and blessed wing . I thought the days of old romance , Would now return to earth ; And , in that soft and placid trance , So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through shadowy groves of myrtle --  And Nereides their glances hiding , And Venus with her turtle . Alas ! our brightest dreams deceive ! The morning rises , bright and sweet , And every thing in nature waits Thy fairy face and form to greet ; But they , alas ! will wait in vain , As I , with aching heart , Whilst wrapt in other joy or pain , In other scenes , thou art . Thus ever from our path below , Some vision lovelier far , Than Eden 's bird , or glittering gem , Or beam of Beauty 's star --  Glides swiftly by -- and we are left To mourn the fleeting bliss , That mocks us , as we sadly thread , So dark a scene as this . THE DREAM OF LOVE . I dreamed last night , my lady-love , A dear , delicious dream ; ' T was not in bower or blooming grove , Nor by the sylvan stream . ' T was in thy father 's noble hall , In dreams I saw thee , lady love ! Yet ' t was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a sacred , simple scene , Thy smiling sisters gathered round , With kindly air , and gentle mien , And spoke -- a magic , home-born sound ! Then thou and I , sweet lady-love ! Roved out amid the garden green , Whilst Day and Night together strove , Along the soft , romantic scene . And then I praised the charming view --  The lofty peaks and rosiate skies --  The vallies , in their vernal hue --  The sky 's still brightening , crimson dyes . And oh ! I saw thy angel smile , It smiled its lovelight all on me ! My heart was heaving high the while , And still my eyes saw nought but thee . I took thy trembling hand in mine , Then clasped thee to my happy breast , And then those honeylips of thine My forehead with their kisses blest . Last night I dreamed , sweet lady-love ! This dear , delicious dream ; Oh ! could I waking pleasures prove So sweet as those that seem . SABBATH . The Sabbath morn ! How beautiful , How peaceful and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary world to rest . Hark ! how the churchbell 's music steals From yonder sacred fane ; Then echoes , like a heavenly sound , O'er neighboring hill and plain . And see ! along each different way , To yonder temple fair , With soft , slow step , and solemn mien , The village folk repair . And now , great Nature sends on high Her orison of prayer , And wears upon her sacred face A smile divinely fair . THE THUNDER STORM . ' T was a cloudless night in August , and the earth all silent lay , With hills , and glittering rivers and mountains far away , And angels then seemed bending through the whiteness of the beams , Whispering to weary mortals soft and sorrow-soothing dreams . Oh ! surely , eye of mortal never gazed on fairer scene , Than there lay sweetly dreaming in that loveliness and sheen :  --  But what is darkening yonder ? and hark ! that distant sound , That comes like ghostly mutters faintly o'er the echoing ground . And now that lightning flashes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come rushing o'er the far off wood and fell . That cloud grows quickly larger , and the lightning flashing more --  Hark ! Earth and Heaven are rocking in a consentaneous roar ! And heavily the deluge floods the hills , the vales , the streams , And beasts howl out for terror and men start up from dreams . Oh ! ' t is a dreadful scene to-night , the dreadest e'er we saw , The hardest heart that beateth now , in watery fear will thaw . But lo ! ' t was but a moment , like a wayward Beauty 's wrath , And the moon resumes in heaven , see ! her all serener path --  And the clouds receding slowly rest upon the horizon round , And the katydids and waters make the only living sound . ' T is yet a night of loveliness , and fondly we may deem , That Heaven and Earth are resting in the beauty of a Dream . THE LIFE-LAND . Oh yes , there 's a land , far away , out of sight , Where the fairest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never die --  And bright rivers of crystal forever roll by . ' T is the clime of the Christian -- the home of the blest --  Where the wretched are happy -- the weary at rest . ' Neath its bowers in bloom , by its waters so still , The righteous shall walk , free from anguish and ill ;  --  And they never shall pass from its portals again , For their pleasures forever and aye shall remain . TO MISS  - -   - -   . The flowers you gave , dear girl , will fade , Nor shun the common lot , to die ; The thoughts they spoke , still undecayed , Shall bloom immortal as the sky . Beneath the sun 's meridian ray , They 'll fade and leave no trace behind : The love they woke shall ne'er decay , But be immortal like the Mind . THE WIFE TO THE ABSENT HUSBAND . Come back to me , my absent friend ! Since thou wast far away , The vernal flowers have lost some charms , Less bright the vernal day . The wild , sweet voices of the fields ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the wood , With dreamy melody ; Sound not so sweet -- and shine less bright , Unto my pensive soul , Since thou wentest forth , O dearest friend , To brook the world 's control . Come back to me ! come back to me ! Let not the dream of fame , Too long allure thy lingering feet To worship at a name . Yet , I would have thee nobly strive To win that glorious meed , But still , of Woman 's saving love , Hast thou not urgent need ? Come back to me ! come back to me ! Thou never yet hast known , How lone and desolate I feel When left , by thee , alone . The dove without her loving mate , Repeats a song like mine --  Thus seems , o'er sad , neglected love , To murmur and repine . Come back to me -- oh ! quickly come ! The joy that I shall know Will more than pay for all this depth Of dark and bitter woe , Which thou hast doomed my heart to feel Through many a weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In lingering thus away . OH , BLUE-EYED MAID , I SIGH FOR THEE . Oh ! blue-eyed maid , I sigh for thee , A gentle twilight 's close , When music dies upon the lea , And dew drops wet the rose . I look on tranquil nature round , And list to music 's fall , And think but half their charms are found , Since thou art far from all . Oh , blue-eyed maid ! the gorgeous beams That light a monarch 's hall , The glittering wealth of golden streams , To me were darkness all ; Unless thy light of loveliness , Adorned the regal scene , And thou bedecked in royal dress , Shouldst reign my loving Queen . TO MARY . Oh , Mary , when afar from thee , And mountains rise between , And I am wandering pensively Through many a varied scene ; It soothes to bid my fancy stray , On freest wings , to thee , And cherish all the memories So very dear to me . I view again thy face , thy form , Thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic words , That all my soul beguile . I sit beside thy chair , and gaze , Upon thy willing face , And there behold the speaking glow Of that mysterious grace , Which binds my constant soul to thee , And makes , through all life 's years , All that can make thy heart rejoice , Or bathe thy cheek with tears , Awake in me the thrill of joy , Or bow my soul in grief ; And makes me strive to make thee blest , Or yield thy pangs relief . Yes , Mary , I will love but thee , Of all thy lovely race ; Our hearts shall find in life one home , In death one resting place . And , if I linger now afar , ' T is fortune 's hard decree --  Oh ! were the dove 's swift pinions mine , How would I fly to thee . Those charms , with memory 's feeble light On me would cease to beam ; Their rays , with present , perfect warmth , Upon my heart would gleam . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass my life ; To press thy gentle hand in mine , And call thee my sweet wife . If Adam lost his happiness , Bewailed with ceaseless sighs , With thee , my Eve , I scarce could wish Another Paradise . THOUGH THOU WAST PASSING FAIR . Though thou wast passing fair , And wondrous beauty crown 'd thee , And Fancy 's robe most rare , Forever brightly bound thee : I could not teach my heart , To bow in love before thee , Nor bid the death depart , Which now hangs darkly o'er thee . I know a hectic flush On thy sweet cheek is burning , That thou dost stilly hush Thy wrung heart 's deepest yearning . I know that in thy breast , A serpent closely lurking , Forbids thee e'er to rest , Thy utter ruin working . When , in the chilly ground , Thy lovely form lies sleeping , Where vi'lets spring around , And purest dews are weeping : Thy sinless soul ascending Above this dreary sod , Shall feel its being blending In deathless love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am beloved by him , And sweet it is , to think , That life no more will be so dim , To make my spirit sink . Ah ! now I am beloved by him ; The secret I will keep ; In silence to the mantling brim , I 'll quaff this cup so deep . Beloved by him ! beloved by him ! How dear the tender thought ! My eyes in happy tears do swim , My heart with bliss is fraught . Beloved by him -- that noble youth ! With proud yet gentle mien , Who speaks the guileless words of truth , And yet is not so " green . " Beloved by him -- ah ! I shall own A husband very soon ; And he shall kneel before my throne , With many a costly boon , The plate , the gold , the proud array Of horses , charioteers ;  --  And when comes round the paying day , I 'll kiss him in arrears ! LOVE WITHOUT HOPE . I can not cease to love thee , Coldest fair ! Though pleading can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was diviner , Than the summer moon , And thou didst outshine her , At her noon . Thy brow was like the silver On the star-lit sea ; Thy bright eyes did bewilder All , as me . Thy motions were the motions Of a charmed bird , As , poised o'er dream-world oceans , His sweet voice is heard . Thou wast queenlier far Than the queenliest flower , More glorious than a star In a fairy bower . But it can not move thee , My mad prayer ! Though I must ever love thee , Coldest fair ! TO MARY . Dear Mary , if my heart has hushed awhile , Its loving voice within my breast -- yet there , Thine image was enshrined the dearest thing , Which now remains to me in this sad world . Thou bad'st me sing a song of thee , and said'st , That I should make thee to my dreamy thought , Whoe'er I would , and I will make thee be , A fair and gentle friend -- a lovely one --  Ah yes , the nearest , tenderest of all friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who will be all in all to me on earth , Sheathing my soul against the edge of pain , Even till I seem to dwell in paradise , With thee my Eve , and we may need no fall . See , fairy spring hath walked upon the hills , Where her foot-prints are green and flowers appear ; The turtle coos within our pleasant land . Oh ! now I throb to be by thy sweet side , To sun me in the sweet spring of that smile Which warms the beauties of my mind to birth . Thus , Mary , when afar from thee , amid The unloving and unloved I muse of thee , And sing and love thee still , and can not wish The thought of thee a moment from my soul . Thou art the friend whom I would ever have Dwell by my soul in absence and when nigh . Thou art the friend whom I would have be still , The loved and guardian angel of my path , Amid the mazes of a treacherous world . Thou art the friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the not dreadful tomb . And now , adieu , sweet Mary ! I must cease My strain ; but , as a wind-strain sleeps Upon a bed of roses ; so the echo Of this my strain , will find its rest with thee . WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM . As stainless thought my hand should write , Upon this page of spotless white ; Nor would I that thy falling tear Should blot the wish recorded here . Oh , like the rose which opens here , The earliest of the vernal year , May Mary 's bloom enchant the day , And bless the Minstrel 's votive lay . But when the envious , Boreal wind , Shall leave his Northern cave behind , And seek to sieze thy beauteous bloom To deck his dark and dreary tomb : May some kind angel swiftly fly , And leave the region of the sky , Transplant thee to a clime where ne'er Sad winter mars the blooming year . THE DEAD EAGLE . No more through the regions of glorious day , Shall thy wings waft thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit that heard , And saw thee , high mounting , O proud , mighty bird : For thy form lies with beasts on the filth of the plain , And it never shall soar from its slumber again . How strong was thy wing , and how fierce was thine eye --  Which vanquished the storm -- and the sun throned on high --  How far was thy flight mid thy path through the blue , As thou sankest away from our wandering view ;  --  But thy form rottens now with the beasts of the plain , And it never shall soar from its slumber again . We will mourn , we will mourn for thee , proud bird of heaven , Whose loftiest walks to thy footsteps were given ; For thy form rots with beasts on the reed-sighing plain , And it never shall soar from that slumber again . LAMENT . My soul is sad -- oh ! dark to-night , ' T is wrapt in midnight 's gloom ; Wild minstrel ! seize thy harp and sing , As o'er the victor tomb . For thoughts , more beautiful than dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glorious tints From heaven , at even-tide . Wild minstrel ! seize thy harp , I pray , And let a dirge arise In frantic woe -- then faintly die Amid the nightwind 's sighs . The **25;3028;TOOLONG strain Should wail such visions o'er ; Within the mournful Past entombed , To be awaked no more . OH , LOVE ! THE DEW LIES ON THE FLOWER . Oh , love ! the dew lies on the flower , And the stars gleam on the sea ; It is the charm 'd , the silent hour , When I should roam with thee . The day dies out within the West , The shadows gather near ; And now sweet fancies fill my breast , And thou art strangely dear . Behold ! as yonder heavenly moon , Breaks through the dark-blue sky , And through night 's deepest , stillest noon , That brightness will supply --  Thy smile thus sheds its heavenly light Athwart life 's deepest gloom ,  --  Thus brightly gilds the spirit 's night Its gentle beams illume . RED ROSE . Sweet rose ! ere Ellen gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival her sweet cheek , Thou wast a floral gem . But when I think her snow-white hands , Did pluck thee , rose ! for me , The brightest gems of earth or sky , Are naught compared with thee . How fondly even for hours I gaze Upon thy charms so rare , Thy tint of richest , purest red , Thy fragrant petals fair . Sweet rose ! my Ellen 's pledge of love , Thou fairest thing of earth , Save darling Ellen 's angel self ,  --  Words can not speak thy worth . To token faintly to her soul , How prized by me thou art , My trembling hand has placed thee here Beside my throbbing heart . ELLEN . Ellen , my heart is not yet thine , And still I can but sigh , Whene'er I view thy semblance shine In Memory 's mirror nigh .

A holy light Hung o'er the hill and wood , O'er wooded stream , and lofty height , And mighty solitude . All Nature lay in bright repose , And from her silent lips arose , In mystic accents through the air , The voice of worship , praise , and prayer . I gazed into the bright , blue sky , Then bent my eyes to view , The earth which lay so sweetly by In robes of summer hue ; I dreamed that blessed ones might deign , To leave their radiant seats again , Nor weep to yield their home in heaven , For the bright ones that Earth had given . On morn , so holy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whose braided hair was dark as night , And wrought with maiden care --  Forth issue from her father 's door , Walking with sweet mien evermore , As if blest spirits led her there , And she beheld their forms in air . Hark ! how it thrills the holy air --  The choir 's high song of praise , Which many voices mingling there In sweetest concert , raise , And oh ! how warmly , fervently Those words of prayer ascend the sky , And joined with that loud strain of praise Blend with the song that Seraphs raise . And sits that lovely lady there , Uniting in the strain ? And does she bend her form so fair , When silence comes again ? Yes ! she was there , and lovelier there , Than she this hour could be elsewhere ; Though few beneath yon heavenly sky Might with her erring beauty vie . TO  - -   - -   .

Where is he , Ye late saw smiling here , I look in vain his face to see To catch his tones so clear . Where is my brother ? Can it be , That we shall never more Behold his form upon the earth , As oft , so oft , before . Ah ! till we meet before the bar At Time 's last , awful day , We shall not see his face again , Although we mourn alway .

Star of Rest ! thy silvery lustre , Brightly streams from heaven above , Ere each sweet and glittering cluster Ope on earth their eyes of love . Star of Rest ! how gently closeth Every bud beneath thy brow , And the wearied frame reposeth From its daily labor now . Star of Rest ! thy streaming splendor , Lends the proud and queenly moon , Till a glorious host attend her Through her deep and silent noon . Star of Rest ! we bless thy beaming , From that vault so calm and blue , For thou bringest sweetest dreaming , And thou fillest the heart with dew . Love of Heaven -- oh ! brightly shining , Gleam above our dying bed , When the Day of life declining , Tells us that its toil has sped . MELANCHOLY . There comes a time for flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a time for mortal bliss to know a certain doom . Sometimes I feel that I have reached that hour , and I have felt , When pondering o'er the dreary change , my spirit in me melt . The joyful trust , the bounding hopes , that laughed at scorned defeat , The feeling , like pure rock-born streams , as strong , as deep , and sweet ; The soul that thrilled with transport wild , at Beauty 's magic name ; Ah ! all have strangely altered now ,  - -  I am no more the same . And now I feel alone and sad amid an ocean wide , I care not much to what strange coast my single plank may ride , I am alone -- what matters it where my bowed frame may be , Since now my heart is never more by land or rolling sea . I feel that as yon Night now throws its mantle o'er the earth , Till ghostly shapes and ghostly sounds , go dimly walking forth --  That soon the night of Death may throw its mantle over me , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would I hope , when such shall come , to dwell not with pain , But walk , with a triumphant song , o'er heaven 's unshadowed plain --  Where Youth and Hope , and Love and Joy , ( the angels , ) ever smile , And evermore the aching heart from woe and grief beguile . FOR MARY . Oh ! may the brightest smiles of heaven That beam on men below , Still shine upon sweet Mary 's path , Wherever she may go . May Angels , like herself ! still guard Her steps from every ill , Until she walks in robes of white , O'er God 's high , happy hill . And , when , in that celestial clime , She beams a spirit bright --  How sweet to think she 'll love me then Where nought our love can blight . LINES .

Had I a lovely home amid Some valley green and fair --  The flowers -- sweet flowers -- should ever gleam , In star-like beauty there . THE ENCHANTED REALM OF JOY . Oh ! I am sick of the ennui that comes of the earth , All tasteless its landscapes -- and charmless its mirth .

TO MISS M.T.R. Whate'er may be my unknown fate Upon this dark , terrestrial sphere , Wilt smile to hear that I am blest , And o'er my anguish shed thy tear ? Methinks it were a happy lot , That thou would'st grieve or smile with me ; And though all others prove most false , I ne'er should find untruth in thee . Yes ! thou wouldst seem some heavenly one If such thy friendship followed me , Nor would I cease , through every change , To crave of Heaven its love for thee . BENEATH THOSE STARS OF SUMMER .

And now when years have glided , As silver waves depart , I feel that thou did'st utter The truth from out thy heart : For thou hast never pained me , Through all these happy years , But still hast fondly loved me , And charmed me even to tears . Thou hast been such a blessing , Thy virtues so much worth ; ' T were not profane to call thee An angel upon earth .

The other day I took a stroll , Just when the sun grew low , A down the Row of Quality , That gay and charming row . I had been dreaming all the day Of bright , poetic forms Moving through silent fairyland , Bedecked with glorious charms . As down the row , I slowly walked , First came proud Majesty ; Love shone in all her queenly looks , Command was in her eye . Then gentle Grace came smiling next , Without the aid of art , And , with a soft and pleasing bliss , She past into my heart . Then Beauty came supreme o'er all , A Heaven-anointed queen ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mien .

On Monticello 's classic brow , I stood and gazed around on earth ; And feelings of no common glow , Within my bosom had their birth . The glorious memory of the past , When valor , single-handed , won , The brightest boon for man at last , Freedom for every sire and son . I thought how strangely , wildly rung That dictum in the world 's dull ear , Breathed with a firm , unfaltering tongue , " No tyrant 's pride shall flourish here .

Virginia ! oh ! retrieve thy name , No longer scorn thy source of pride ; Pay double tribute to their fame , Whose shades so long in vain have sighed .

See the dark-rushing showers exultingly come Down , down to the earth from their high , cloudy home ! How the countless drops twinkle , and dance , and rejoice , Then creep to the ground with a tremulous voice ! Oh the water , the water , it shineth so bright !

BLANNERHASSETT 'S ISLAND . On beautiful Ohio when you sail , And view its banks , forever green and fair , And feel the falling sunlight , and the gale That freshly stirs that wild and western air ; You may observe a lovely island there , A greenery spot , enclosed by waters bright , A spot of beauty , and a spot most rare ; There the fair summer moon sheds softest light , And summer stars look down from heaven 's cerulean height . Around that isle , a mournful story clings , That ever wakes a soft and sad regret , In those who feel the sorrow which it brings , All swift and fresh upon the memory yet , Of those who sail beyond it , brightly set , An emerald within that crystal flood ; Its sad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bosoms meek and good , And leaves the thoughtful sprite in no ungrateful mood . Here BlannerhassetE dwelt ; a blest recluse , In this green Eden of the leafy West ; And felt sweet Peace her softest balm infuse , Into his once too world-disturbed breast : There did he find a deep and quiet rest : The mockbird sang his vespers , while the star Shone sweetly o'er the rippling river 's crest ; There no rude sound the halcyon calm did mar , And Grief was absent still , and Hate was banished far . So Blannerhasset with his partner , dwelt , In kind connubial tenderness , in this Most gay and blooming scene ; here , here they felt That feeling which if earth hath aught like bliss , Is bliss ! the tender look ! the touch ! the kiss ! And , often mid this sylvan scene was heard , ( Where no vile Envy gave its serpent hiss , ) The voice of love , the only , joyous , word Which blended with the notes of wind , and rill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of life , possest , Wealth , love , refinement , learning , genius , birth ; Bright , blooming offspring , virtuous , good and blest Charming their hearts , with that young , pangless mirth ; And , when at evening mild , they saunter 'd forth , Beneath the rosy sky , they looked toward heaven , And wondered why this was so bright an earth , And why that God whose gifts to man are even , This wondrous happiness to them alone had given . Then came a dark-soul 'd man , with magic eye , And glozing tongue , and Blannerhasset 's mind , Became his slave , he could not now deny His devilish spell , a villian , smooth refin 'd , Whose mighty arts his thoughtless victim bind , In fearful chains : Burr was this Satan 's name , Who crept into this Eden unconfin 'd , And drove this erring pair of later fame , Like that of old , to roam and sigh o'er earth the same . " Come , go with me , " said Burr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riches , and a deathless name , " And Blannerhasset thought the villian kind , Who fed his soul , on novel dreams of fame , While Burr aspir 'd to breathe a sinful flame , Through Blannerhasset 's sweet and guiltless wife , But she his artful cozening overcame , And brav 'd the demon with victorious strife , And sacredly maintained the whiteness of her life . But they were ruin 'd , this sequester 'd pair , Who shunn 'd the world 's alluring charms to crime , Soon they were driven forth in dark despair , Like the sad consorts of that earlier time . A grief fell on that island 's blooming prime . They pass 'd away , and never saw again , Their island home amid that pleasant clime . Awhile they roamed o'er earth 's most desolate plain , But soon securely slept from life 's wild woe and pain . This is real history of that isle , That ever draws the weary traveller 's eye , He sees its fairy greenness brightly smile , Amid that river ; as he passeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , While he recalls that mournful history ; And he may ask , with sudden sorrow , why , The dream of rapture doth so early flee And souls so meek and good , the prey of fiends should be . That isle is now as lovely as of yore , Gay Nature smiles as sweetly , the wild air Is resonant with music ; the green shore Exhales a constant fragrance , sweet and rare , But those who made its borders still more fair , Have slept the sleep of death , long years ago , Yet is their memory fresh , and ever there The pilgrim 's heart will feel the thought of woe , His eye will blend a tear with yon fair river 's flow .

Hark ! the deep-toned , solemn peal ! Again it strikes the air ! My trembling accents steal To join the anthem there . I strive to lift my mind To God 's most holy throne ; And , with my thought refined , To think on Heaven alone .

What hallows thus the hills of Greece , And flings that light o'er Rome , Which when her very fragments cease , Still crowns her history 's dome ? ' T is truth 's great warfare bravely fought , That hallows in the core , A mount -- a plain -- a barren spot --  With fame which dies no more .

My brow is broad , my eye is black , And quickly changes with my feeling , And to your own , it flashes back , The thought their glance was just revealing . Some gentle blood runs through my veins , And I suppose you truly know it , And then , to crown my boastful strains , The world has sworn I am a poet . I 'd like to wed and with you dwell , Within some happy rural valley , Where zephyrs round the lily 's bell , In summer sigh , and faint , and dally . Now Lizzie !

When summer 's rosy twilight fell , Upon yon river 's gentle swell , Leading the spirit by its song , As through the land it sweeps along ; We watched the stars , those worlds of love , That swim yon azure seas above --  We heard each other 's heart-pulse beat , In unison divinely sweet .

I ceased to shed such happy tears , I whisper 'd comfort in your ears , I press 'd you closer to my heart , Till mine no more could throb apart . But then we smiled , we laughed to feel The heaven which deep love can reveal ; We laughed that Love had ever bound , His golden bands our souls around ! Do you not know the boundless bliss Which follows true love 's lightning kiss ; For , in that hour with heaven above , Your cheeks , your mouth received my love . And when that deep , blest trance was o'er , And we could clasp and kiss no more ; Love 's dear confessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid ; When Angels ' pens had writ the vow Which nothing can dissever now ; Our hearts return 'd to Nature 's face , To planets , and the waters ' race . All , all was calm ; all , all was bright ; The moon was climbing to yon height , Of Heaven 's blue cone , rough round with stars , With Venus -- but no angry Mars . THE SONG OF THE SLAIN AT THE BATTLE OF TICONDEROGA . Farewell to the land which we sought o'er the wave ; We made it our home ; it will now be our grave : Farewell , ye proud mountains , and valleys uneven , And thou , bright shining Glory , now setting in heaven . Farewell to our hearthstones , our cherished ones there , Our wives and our children , now reft of our care : Farewell , everloved of our souls -- nevermore , Shall we look on your faces -- our lifetime is o'er . We march to the field -- 'twill be red with our blood , Which shall make of its soil there a horrible mud ; Where our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be torn , and be whiten 'd by tempest and rain . We march to the field -- and our comrades in war , Shall shout to the heavens their triumph afar --  And Victory shall perch on our banners on high And Tyrants fore'er from our country shall fly ; Yet never shall we view that glorious sight --  We sink , with yon sun , in the deathgloom of night ; Farewell to our homes and our country for aye , We go to our graves , with the setting of day . Farewell , yes , farewell , Earth , Heavens and all Which here in the last hour of life we recall : Farewell ! we are doomed to the night of the grave ,  --  But our mem'ry shall live with the names of the brave . TO MY COPY OF SHAKSPEARE WHICH HAD BEEN LOST . Hast thou come back , my Shakspeare ! bard , Who didst dethrone and drive away those others , From cold Parnassus , fate that seem 'd too hard , To be inflicted on thy gentle brothers . Thou didst spare one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scio , hoary Homer , So that of all the harpers first and last , To call him king , is not a base misnomer . There on those far and ever whiten 'd rocks , You two sit monarchs of a rich dominion ; But I forgot dark Milton 's sacred locks , Serenely resting from his seraph pinion ! Hast thou come back , great bard , to charm and bless My heart with many a grand , illusive vision , And show those gorgeous fields of happiness , With vistas and with rivers all Elysian ? Stay now with me ; no more through all the years , Wilt thou and I , O glorious friend ! be parted ; Or , if e'er so , my overflowing tears , Will prove that I am grieved , or broken-hearted . Yes stay , and I shall haste to thy converse , With full delight , at rosiate morn , calm even , And I shall dream of rich and golden verse From angel lyres within the bowers of Heaven . I LOVE THEE . I love thee -- oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thy beauty 's charm most strangely , My spirit hath beguiled . I love thee -- oh ! I love thee , The Spring 's first , freshest flower , Comes not across my spirit , With such a holy power . I love thee -- oh ! I love thee , The fibres of my heart Are closely twined about thee , As if by magic art . I see thee -- oh ! I see thee , In the sunbeam , in the bud , In all that 's fair in nature , In all that 's bright and good . I hear thee -- oh ! I hear thee , In the melting music-words , That swell , at joyous morning , From the woodland choir of birds . I crave thee -- oh ! I crave thee , Thou angel sent from God ! To beautify the pathway , Which must by me be trod . I love thee -- oh ! I love thee ! And , dearest , I implore , That bliss may still await thee , On Heaven 's far brighter shore .

The old mill-wheel , it turns , it turns Throughout the livelong day , And flings the current of the stream , Abroad in glist'ning spray : That old , black wheel has turn 'd for years , Beside the mossy mill , That stands , like some old , sacred thing , Beneath the clay-red hill . The old mill-wheel , it turns , it turns Like time 's unresting one , Which day and night , and night and day , Hath never ceased to run : The old mill-wheel , an emblem true , Of Time that ne'er stands still , I love to see it turning so , Beside the mossy mill .

List oh ! list . The firefly lights the night , A moment and then dies ; The lilacs pine for light , With sweet and odorous sighs : So Hope 's deceitful beam , Illumines my despair , While I still sigh and dream , With many a sobbing prayer , Lady , lady , list ! List and smile ! Lo ! now the clouds break off , And heaven once more is free ; The mounts their garments doff , The mists rise from the sea ; From yonder casement high She looks , she looks , oh see ! She bends on me her eye Of heavenly brilliancy : Lady , lady , dear ; Lady dear ! VIRGINIA HOME OF HONOR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaming o'er the sea , The eye still turns , the heart still yearns , O dearest home , for thee . When ranged around the social board , We bid our sorrows flee , We own a pride that we are sons , O dearest home , of thee . If earth retains one single draught Of pure and tranquil joy , Within whose sweet and sparkling wave , Is mixt no sad alloy ; ' T is here we taste it while we sit , Beneath our natal tree , ' T is here it glads our heart of hearts , O dearest home , with thee . When we are cast on foreign shores , Beyond the dark-blue sea , Sad memory oft returns to weep , O dearest home , with thee , And when the knell of death shall come , And set our spirits free , Our hearts shall find their sweetest rest , O dearest home , with thee . HYMN TO THE FATHER . Heavenly father , God of mercy , Look upon a sinful soul ; For , the waves of sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my crimes are dark and grievous , The huge burthen hard to bear ; All the day and night I 'm sighing Whelm 'd in grief and dark despair . Ah ! how deeply I have fallen From my high and happy state , Where , enrob 'd in thy dear image , Once , in tranquil peace , I sate . Black with sores , a loathsome leper , Lo ! I wait before Thy throne ; Cans't thou , Maker , wilt thou heal me , Make me whole and all thine own ? Oh ! Thy grace is freely gushing , Boundless is Thy wondrous Love ; And for all Thy erring children , Lord , Thy tender bowels move . Hail ! Supreme , Exhaustless Mercy , Christ hath freed my soul from sin ; And a holy calm comes o'er me , And a heavenly peace within . O BIRDIE ! SPEAK TO ME .

O Birdie ! then my soul In peace shall hence depart . TO ONE . I love thee , and my trembling lyre Will learn no other strain ; I marvel if thy gentle heart Will ever cease disdain ; I marvel if our future lives , Will mingle into one , And glitter like a happy stream , In an unclouded sun . I see that mid a wooing throng , Thou art a central star , And vying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from far : I only think the smiles thou giv'st , So freely unto them , If given to me , would bless me more , Than thrones or diadem .

I feel that I must know thy love , Or all of life will be One long , deep wail , one throb of pain , One speechless agony . THE WANDERER . With none to share my ship with me , A wand'rer o'er life 's stormy sea , One brilliant star , like lamp of love , Smiles calmly from its throne above . Oh ! brightly o'er the surging wave , That lustre shines to bless and save ; And on through billows thund'ring roll , Conducts me to my heavenly goal . That star by gracious Love was placed , To look , in beauty uneffaced , Over the wildest wrath of storms , And scatter round its glittering charms : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands alway : It beams with beauty so divine , The wand'rer smiles to see it shine . Hail , one bright star on all life 's main ; Though surf roll high , and cordage strain ; And cowards , ship ! may quake for thee ; Thou walk'st victorious o'er the sea . Oh ! proudly , as an ocean-queen , Thy frame , majestic still is seen --  Until thou rest in heaven at last , Thy sailing done , thy anchor cast . TO BETTIE . Why , beauteous Bettie , longer shed Pearly showers of causeless grief , Why bend down that lovely head , Like the autumn 's rain-wash 'd leaf ? Though in weeping , sad distress , Thy dear charms have lovelier grown , As drench 'd Nature o'er her dress , Wears the rainbow 's splendid zone . Yet why shed those beaded pearls From those eyes of softest blue , And why loose those auburn curls O'er that sweet neck 's damask hue ? Every liquid , falling gem , Flashing like the diamond 's ray , In an eastern diadem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out this stormy gloom , Thy dear smile shall brightly steal ; O'er my heart 's enliven 'd bloom , O'er the joy thy thoughts reveal . Why , beauteous Bettie ! longer shed , Showers of pearls so bright to see ? Bid dark doubt be quickly sped , I am faithful still to thee . BABY SONG . Rock 'd on Mamma 's heaving breast , Heaving like the pearly deep , Hugg 'd to that sweet , honey rest , Sleep , little baby , sleep , Baby sleep . White like the new moon 's falling beams , O'er the wooded , westward steeps , Falls the white throng of her dreams , While my baby sleeps , Oh , she sleeps . Closed her soft and sparkling eyes , Oped her mouth like a tulip 's cup , In a starry trance she lies , Like a bud at night shut up ; Baby sleeps . Around her scarcely parted lips , Now a smile -- a laughter !  - -  creeps , Losing all their sad eclipse --  Angels near ! while baby sleeps Deeply sleeps . Rock 'd upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeps , Joy hath brought Mamma sweet rest , While our baby sleeps , Softly sleeps . MY OLD VIRGINIA HOME . Around my old Virginia home , My heart forever clings ; Whene'er I hear its name pronounced , I think a thousand things . I think how once a little band , Came to these forest lands ; And struggling long , built this fair home , And left it to our hands . I think how our forefathers fought , To keep it free from chains , How they rejoic 'd at vict'ry won , With loud , triumphal strains . My cherish 'd old Virginia home , Tears , tears come to my eyes , When thinking on thee , loveliest land , Beneath the boundless skies ! TAKE THOSE PLEDGES BACK . Take back those pledges , dearest maid , Which once I warmly gave , For then I dreamed I would be free , And nevermore thy slave . Yes ! take them back once more , for love Hath made me only thine ; And I should give these gems away , Whose heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart can often love , But that can never be ; Though I have bow 'd at other shrines , I never loved but thee . I feel that thou art dearer far Than aught this world can give , And come what may , come grief or joy , For only thee I live . Yes ! take those pledges back , dear maid , And let them fondly speak , The deathless flame that will not fail , In spring , or winter bleak : For they have told an honest tale , That I shall change no more , Till I shall clasp thy form again On Heaven 's eternal shore . SONG.  - -  UNDYING AFFECTION . I loved thee in my happy youth , When I was free from guile , And I have kept that early truth , And wear as fond a smile : I 've look 'd to thee , through every storm That lower 'd upon my way , Thou say'st my fair and fairy form Hath made thy rainbow 's ray . I loved thee in that early time , Life 's best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's prime , My changing smiles and tears : And now when evening shades come o'er The length'ning path of life , And we must think of love no more , I am thy faithful wife . FREEDOM 'S HOME . O freedom 's home ! thy banner streams , A meteor on the gale ; And I behold the haughty flags Of Europe fade and pale . And , crowding on the surging sea , They cleave the billows bright ; They come to rest beneath its folds , Attracted by its light . O freedom 's home ! forevermore We 'll join our hearts and hands , To make thee bright with peaceful wealth , The gem of richest strands : But , if a tyrant e'er should threat , This Eden of the free , Dear home of freedom , we will bleed , And yield our life for thee . NATIVE MOUNTAINS . Native Mountains ! on your summits , Stream the gleaming floods of day , While a thousand silver cascades , Leap within the early ray ; There amid your flowery valleys , Stands the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summits , I behold it from above . Native Mountains ! how my bosom Swells with happiness and pride , When I gaze upon ye soaring O'er your vales so green and wide . All my wishes , all my pleasures , Still are closely , sweetly bound , To ye , lofty native Mountains , With your valleys blooming round . THE TRAIN IS COMING . The train is coming , coming , It whistles , do n't you hear ? I saw the smoking engine , And soon they will be here . The train is coming , coming , It is already here , I think that handsome Willie , I 'm sure , he 'll soon appear . I 've waited long to see him , And thought the train was slow ; But now I see it stopping , And Willie 's come , I know . I got , on Sunday morning , The sweetest billet-doux , It had a white envelope , And his initials , too . I read it , then I started , To hear the sermon through , But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do . For it said that he was coming , Without mistake to-day , That he was growing weary Of things and folks away . But list ! the bell is ringing , And here is Willie 's card ; I 'll meet him in the parlor , For I am quite prepar 'd , To answer any questions That Willie now may ask , And then to serve and love him , Will be my daily task . LINES . Far hath lovely Fanny flown , O'er the mountains , o'er the sea ; All our peace with her hath gone , We are wed to misery . As the rainbow fades away , As the short-lived spring departs , Shone she brightly o'er our way , Fled from our repining hearts . Yet the rainbow will return , And the Spring will come once more ; But the fair whose flight we mourn , Walks on Death 's Elysian shore . LOVE SONG . My heart is newly gushing , With love for thee , with love for thee , With thoughts as wild and wasteful , As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my soul is wretched With longing pain , with longing pain , It gives a ceaseless moaning , Like yonder main , like yonder main . Thy strange and matchless beauty , Is like the sea , is like the sea ; Thy face in love or anger , Is sweet to me , is sweet to me . Thy maiden soul is precious As yonder deep , as yonder deep , Within its glassy clearness , Bright jewels sleep , bright jewels sleep . Thy sinless mind resembles Yon deep , blue sea , yon deep , blue sea ; The glorious things of heaven Are seen in thee , are seen in thee . Oh main ! as some poor sailor Is lost in thee , is lost in thee , My soul is lost in sighing , No hope for me , no hope for me . PARTING SONG . We meet with smiles , we part in tears ; This is our earthly lot , We can not find a place on earth , Where friends have parted not . And oh ! it is the saddest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may see their face no more , Whose friendship was so sweet . We meet with smiles , we part in tears , But Mem'ry long will bring , Their image in our waking thoughts , A blest and sacred thing : And we shall pause amid the crowds , Where we are strangers now ; And deeply think of what has been , Till grief will shade our brow . Till grief will shade our aching brow , And tears will freely flow , Till we shall weep , as we have wept , O'er friends now sleeping low ; For , who may tell , if e'er again , Those friends shall meet our gaze ; Who 've wander 'd forth from all our love , Where Death 's dark angel strays ? THE SONG OF MAY . To mountains hoar and russet plain , A joyous sprite , I come again ; With many a sweet and joyous strain , And break grim winter 's icy chain . From yon blue chambers far above , On brilliant wings , I lightly move ; I come , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the grove . To leafy wild , and city 's hum , The queen of joy , I come , I come ; The little rills no more are dumb ; But hail me , as I come , I come . With breath that glads both land and main , I come again , I come again ! On hillside , bank , and level plain , The flowers appear , in beauteous train . To blooming land and azure main , Each year I duly come again ; A stranger from yon heavenly plain Of light and bliss ; as poets feign . TO MY LYRE . O harp , with whom my childhood played , Within that verdant dell , O'erbower 'd by boughs of grateful shade , I go -- Farewell ! farewell ! If I have durst to raise thy tone To sing a theme too high , Thou , thou must bear the sin alone , O harp , not I , not I. For , thou had'st witch 'd me with a love Where reason had no part ; I felt that thou would'st e'en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath ended . Silence falls Round the enchanted dell ; Awhile I heed no more thy calls , Sweet harp ! farewell ! farewell ! YOU ASK WHY I AM LONELY NOW . You ask why I am lonely now , In all this brilliant scene , And why I look on beauty 's charms , With cold , unalter 'd mien . You say that , many a loving heart , Would joy to be my own , That none of all the human race , Should ever live alone . I 'll tell you why I 'm lonely now , If grief will let me speak , And why I glance on woman 's charms With cold , unalter 'd cheek . ' T was in my boyhood 's happy days , I loved a blue-eyed maid ; The light of heaven o'er that young cheek , In changeful feeling stray 'd ! I loved her with a love as true , As ever dwelt on earth ; Oh sure my worship was too deep , Even at that shrine of worth . She loved me not , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! I am too fondly weak ? Is this a teardrop bright ? You asked why I am lonely now , And I the tale have told : And I shall yet be lonely , till The grave my heart shall hold . OLD HOMESTEAD . Old homestead ! old homestead ! what feelings arise ! As now the old homestead greets kindly our eyes ; Old homestead , where oft we were merry or sad ; Each day as it fled , still some witchery had . The homestead ! how dear is its old , friendly look , Its dun rolling hills , and its slow running brook ; Its time-worn , old gables , and cornice so plain , Its roof that grew mossy from shadow and rain . Old homestead ! some dwelt with us , loved with us here ; Some smiled at our smile , and they wept at our tear : Of those some have gone to a far distant land ; And some -- where yon cedars like pale mourners stand . Oh ! memories most thrilling , most holy , most dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou hast a deep magic that never can die , ' Till ' neath the green valley , we endlessly lie . LOVE SONG . I love thee , oh ! I love thee , As the sweet bee loves the flower , As the swallow loves the summer , As the humming bird the bower ; As the petrel loves the ocean , As the nightingale the night ; I love , I love thee , dearest ! Thou being good and bright . I love thee , oh ! I love thee , There 's nothing on this earth , Can feel a deeper fondness , A flame of purer worth ; The eagle loves its offspring , Most faithful is the dove ; But thou ! thy smallest ringlet , Has more from me than love . SUSIE . A gentle maid , a dove-like soul , An eye that knows no ill ; I met her from her rural walk , Upon yon grassy hill . Her apron filled with early flowers , And some were lightly bound Into a wreath that sweetly lay Her snowy temples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , At twilight 's magic hour , My spirit felt her loveliness And own 'd her magic power . And since our meeting on that hill , I still have fondly thought , Of what a store of pleasant dreams , That eve to me hath brought . LINES ON PARTING WITH  - -   - -   . Since Fate 's tyrannical decree , Sweet friend , dissevers you and me , Now memory shall vanquish fate , And yield the bliss we knew so late . Yes , she a mournful devotee , From scenes of busy strife shall flee ; To kneel beneath that cherish 'd shrine , Whose every offering is thine . Oh ! sometimes in the lonely hour , My heart shall own a deeper power , And tears shall tell , upon my cheek , The grief that words could never speak . BLUE-EYED ELLA . Oh blue-eyed Ella 's face is fair , And beautiful her braided hair , As fair the feelings that do speak Upon her pure and placid cheek . Oh ! blue-eyed Ella 's heart is kind With warm desires by Heav'n refin 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks serene and sinless still . Oh ! blue-eyed Ella ! keep for me , A thought from scorn and coldness free ; I fain would ask , I fain would find A memory in so blest a mind . ACROSTIC . Far hath beauteous Fanny flown , And sad Nature 's drooping eye , Now declares her pleasure gone , Newly weeping from the sky . Yet , when she shall seek again , Mildest maid ! these haunts she loved , In that hour , will Nature 's pain , ( Caus 'd by her ) be all remov 'd . Here sad Nature shall regain Increase of the joy she proved , Ere you fled the flowery plain . TO THE MUSE . L'ENVOI . Dear maid , with whom I , happy , wander 'd back , To roam o'er that now sacred , hallow 'd ground , Where Smith who trod old ocean 's stormy track , The noble state of chivalry did found . Delightful hours thou mad'st them all , when I Went musing there with thee , my spirit guide , I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ val'rous comrades , by his side . I saw the doubtful scene ; the hard assay , The daring crown 'd with victory at last ; I saw the ancient forest fall away , I saw the little empire spreading fast . And , on through other realms in charmed life , I follow 'd , by thy silver accents led , So sweet , the summer air with bliss seem 'd rife , And harping angels hover 'd o'er my head . But yet -- farewell ! with sadden 'd , sinking heart , I turn from all the joys I late have known , Where from the rushing crowd I oft shall start , To find myself dejected and alone . Yet , sometimes thou return , and with those eyes Bright as an angel 's , look on me again , So I shall feel the wonted raptures rise , And I shall lose the deaden 'd sense of pain ! J.W.
