// qwq show of resistance surrendered . Demolishing all the forts but one , Mansvelt laid a bridge over the channel to an adjacent isle , and soon became master of that also . Leaving a hundred men here he re-embarked , intending to plunder the coast of Costa Rica as far north as Nata . But finding that the Governor of Panama had been informed of his approach , and was prepared to give him a warm reception , he turned back with his fleet to St. Catherine 's . The Sieur Simon , whom he had left as Governor , having during his absence put the main island in a good state of defense , and begun to cover the smaller one with fertile plantations , Mansvelt determined to keep possession of it . To carry out this plan he went to Jamaica with proposals to the Governor for its retention . Being met with a refusal , and knowing he could not hold it against the Spanish force in those seas , he retired to Tortuga , where he suddenly died . Morgan succeeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retain St. Catherine 's ; but the Spaniards , during his absence , made a sudden descent upon it and took it . He then resolved to collect a large force in some of the ports of Cuba ; and in two months ' time he succeeded in assembling twelve vessels and 700 men . It was first proposed to plunder Havana , but fearing that his force was insufficient , he resolved to attack Puerto del Principe . Maying arrived abreast of the place in the night , he waited for daylight to land and surprise it . But a Spanish prisoner aboard one of the vessels contrived to escape unobserved , and swimming ashore alarmed the town . The news spread consternation through the place ; and the inhabitants , aroused from their slumbers by the cry , " The pirates have come ! " swarmed through the streets in aifright , bearing bags of gold and other valuables , and fled-men and women and children-into the surrounding forest . Soon every house was empty ; and nothing was heard save the steady tramp of 800 soldiers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay some distance off . Halting where the road was narrow , they cut down trees and made barricades , behind which they were stationed by the Governor , and awaited the approach of the pirates . Morgan , finding the high-road to the town thus defended , landed his men some distance off , and taking a circuitous march through the woods , at length emerged on the open plain in front of the place . As the troops defiled from the forest and formed into line , they saw the Governor with a large body of horse drawn up in order of battle . Morgan had scarcely time to throw his men into the form of a half moon when the Spanish bugles sounded the charge , and the horse came gallantly on . The pirates , reserving their fire till the enemy were within close range , took deadly aim , and emptied nearly a hundred saddles at the first discharge . The Spaniards wheeled and charged again and again , but were unable to break the firm formation , while the deadly volleys mowed them down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morgan then marched on the town , but was met at the entrance by the foot-soldiers , who defended it for a long time with determined bravery . The pirates , made desperate by this protracted resistance , dashed with a loud yell so fiercely on the gate-way that they bore back all opposition , and poured through the street . The Spaniards then retired to their houses , from whence they continued to fire on their assailants until the latter threatened to fire the town , when they surrendered . After the surrender some were locked up in the houses and burned to death ; others underwent the most dreadful tortures to make them confess where they had hidden away their riches ; *heir cries and groans mingling in with the shouts and laughter of those who , in the mean time , grew merry over the deep potations of liquor which the inhabitants had left behind . Having tried every other means in vain , Morgan told them if they did not pay a handsome ransom he would take them all to Jamaica and sell them as slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the required contribution . These brought back word that they could not find any of their own party , but that they would raise the money in fifteen days . This was granted , and the pirates gave themselves over to reveling and pleasure . In a few days , however , a negro was caught with letters on his person from the Governor of Santiago to the chief officers of the town urging them to detain the pirates as long as they could , for he would soon be there with a large force to their assistance . Morgan immediately ordered all the booty he had collected to be sent aboard his vessel , and demanded that the ransom should be paid next day . This being declared impossible , he directed them to send him immediately five hundred beeves , with salt enough to cure them . This being done , he liberated the prisoners and set sail for an uninhabited island to divide the plunder . The French becoming dissatisfied with Morgan 's conduct , suddenly left him ; but instead of being discouraged at this abandonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his followers , they unanimously resolved to follow wherever he would lead . Being joined by another pirate from Campeachy , he proposed to sail for Puerto Velo , at that time considered one of the richest places among the Spanish West India possessions . It was situated in ten degrees north latitude , and fourteen leagues from the Gulf of Darien . The officers at first hesitated about the propriety of attacking so strong a place with their force ; but the prospect of large booty overcame their objections . The city was defended by two strong castles and a garrison of three hundred men . The place contained only some four hundred inhabitants ; the merchants through whom the business was done not remaining here for any length of time , on account of the unhealthiness of the climate . Morgan , who knew the coast well , arrived off // the river on which the place was situated in the evening , and proceeded up several miles with his ships ; he then cast anchor , and ordering the troops into canoes kept noiselessly on till midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advance-guard before he could give the alarm , Morgan questioned him closely about the castle , a mile distant ; and noticing his answers , ordered him to be shot if it was found that he had given them false information . The pirates then advanced in dead silence , and surrounded the walls before the garrison were aware of their presence . Morgan at once ordered them to surrender , but the only response was a heavy volley into his ranks . He then summoned his followers to mount , sword in hand ; and with a wild shout they poured impetuously over the walls and carried the castle by storm . The troops were immediately put to the sword ; all except the officers , who were confined together in one room . The magazine of the castle was then fired by a slow match , and they and it were blown heayenward together . The tremendous explosion which shook the earth around caused such consternation to the inhabitants of the city that the Governor could not make them face the enemy , and so retired to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pirates , elated with their success , moved up in front of this castle also . *I1the garrison immediately opened a deadly fire on them , and when the tropical sun broke over the landscape its rays could scarce penetrate the cloud of smoke that hung over the com*tants . Now here , now there , encouraged by their officers , the Buccaneers made desperat* efforts to effect an entrance , but were met at every turn by the steady courage of the Governor . Again and again , shouting madly , they rushed on thewalls , and , with their swords in their teeth , strove to climb to the top , but were as often beaten back . The fight lasted till noon , when Morgan ordered hand-grenades to be flung into the place . The Governor replied with fire-pots and huge stones hurled down on the assailants . Repelled at every point , Morgan at length drew off his men disheartened . While he stood pondering what course he had best adopt under the circumstances , he heard a shout in the distance , and looking up saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another castle returning , showing by their loud saizuza OF THE SENTINEL . // huzzas that they had been victorious . He at once determined to take the castle , cost what it would ; and ordered ladders to be made wide enough for four men to mount abreast . After a sufficient number were made he commanded the monks and priests and nuns that he had taken out of the cloisters to place these against the walls . It was pitiful to hear the prayers and supplications of these poor wretches as they advanced , that the Governor would spare their lives . Like a true soldier he turned a deaf ear to them , and the moment they came within range opened a deadly fire upon them , and mowed down priest and nun alike . At the first discharge they shrieked in dismay ; but knowing it was certain death to return , the survivors ran through the fire and placed the ladders against the walls . The pirates , with a shout , then rushed forward , and rapidly mounted to the top . For a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore down all opposition by their undaunted bravery . Having won the walls the pirates hurled hand-grenades and fire-pots so rapidly down among the inhabitants that they cried for quarter . The iron-hearted old Governor , however , refused to surrender , despite the entreaties of his wife and children , and stood like a tig8r at hay till , pierced by half a dozen bullets , he fell with his face to the foe . Then followed a scene that beggars description . Wives were violated in presence of their husbands ; daughters before their mothers . Lust and debauchery of every kind ran riot through the place . Some were inhumanly tortured to make them discover their riches . To repay themselves for this hard fight the pirates remained here fifteen days , abandoning themselves to all kinds of intemperance and dehauchery . The news of this raid soon reached the ears of the President of Panama , and he began to raise a force to march against the pirates . Morgan , hearing of it , demanded at once of the surviving inhabitants a ransom of a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advance of the troops of the Governor of Panama had arrived near the place . Morgan , drawingthese into an ambush , completely routed them , which so discouraged the Governor that he retreated , leaving the people to negotiate for their ransom as they best could . Surprised that four hundred men could perform such astonishing exploits , he sent to Morgan to inquire what kind / / DEATH OF TUE GOvERNOR . // of arms he used . The latter returned by the messenger a pistol with a few small bullets , and bade him say to his master that these were the arms by which he had taken the city ; and that if the latter would keep them a twelvemouth he himself would come and get them again . The Governor replied that he need not put himself to the trouble of coming to Panama , for he would not succeed so *ve1l there as at Puerto Velo . Having got on board all of his booty , consisting of two hundred and eighty thousand dollars , besides silks , linen , cloths , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spoils was made . The crew then returned to their old rendezvous in Jamaica , and spent the whole in debaucheries of every description . The reputation of Morgan soon drew about him various piratical vessels that were operating on a smaller scale , and he began to make preparations for another expedition , and gave out as a place of rendezvous , Cow Island , south of Hispaniola . There was a large English vessel at Jamaica , carrying thirty-six guns , which was ordered to join him immediately . This gave an air of respectability and legality to his movements . There was , however , at the same time a French ship in port , of thirty-six guns , which he wished to appropriate . This vessel had some time previously met an English ship at sea , and forced from her provisions without paying for them . Morgan immediately resolved to make this a pretext for confiscating her ; so , inviting THE ExPLOsION . // qwq iards discovered the deception that had been practiced on them , but too late to prevent its success ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position the boats had passed the point of greatest danger , and were soon safely out to sea . Morgan sent seven shot against the castle by way of a parting salute , and then steered for Jamaica , where his men soon squandered their immense gains in the old way . The freebooter 's name had now become so notorious that he had no difficulty in organizing another expedition . Men came flocking to him from every quarter , and he soon had a fleet of thirty-seven ships and 2000 men at his command . With these he set sail toward the Isthmus of Darien , determined to seize the rich city of Pana ma , and redeem his promise given the year before to the Governor . Landing at St. Catharine 's he captured the forts and garrison of the place . Remaining here with the great part of his fleet , he sent four ships , with 400 men , to take a castle at Chagres , where he proposed to land his troops and march across the Isthmus to Panama . Captain Brodely had command of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived before the place . The castle which he was sent to take was built on a high hill at the mouth of the river , and surrounded by strong palisades filled with earth , and had only one entrance , which was by a draw-bridge over a natural ditch thirty feet deep . As soon as the pirates came within shot the THE MAXOH I*ROUGH THE FORz5T. // castle , and the fort at the base of the hill on which the former stood , opened their fire . The Captain was much perplexed at the unexpected obstacles that opposed his passage ; but saw at once that the only hope of success lay on the land side . So , early in the morning , he lauded his little baud of four hundred , and began his toilsome march through the woods . Now climbing up the precipitous rocks , and now cutting their way through the tangled woods , they toiled courageously forward , but did not reach the castle till two o'clock in the afternoon . Here they found the difficulties far greater even than they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their return they would have abandoned the attempt . At length , after much hesitation and opposite counsel , they resolved to make the assault , cost what it would . With their drawn swords in one hand and fire-balls in the other , they , with loud shciuts , rushed on the palisades . The garrison immediately opened a brisk fire upon them , and cried out , " Come on , you English dogs ; and those you left behind come too ! You wo n't get to Panama this bout ! " The pirates , unable to force an entrance , fell back into the woods , and waited till night should render them less conspicuous targets for the Spaniards . After dark they attempted to burn the palisades , and thus open an entrance ; but could make no progress , and were about to retire disheartened , when one of them was pierced with an arrow , which went in at the back , and passing clean through his body , protruded at the breast . The man , maddened with pain , seized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in cotton , and rammed it down his musket and fired it back . The powder ignited the cotton , and the arrow falling on the dry palm leaves used in covering the houses set them on fire . The Spaniards , wholly absorbed in the fight , did not observe this catastrophe until several houses were in flames . A desperate attempt to arrest the conflagration was then made ; but , fed by the combustible material in the castle , it rapidly spread , until the fire reached a barrel of powder , when a tremendous explosion followed , knocking down walls and blowing many of the garrison into the air . The pirates , finding that the Spaniards had their bands full in arresting the flames , set fire to the palisades . Part of the garrison then turned to protect these , but the flames rendering them conspicuous marks , they fell rapidly before the muskets of the assailants . By daylight the palisades were burned down , and the castle had fallen in , exposing the garrison to a murderous fire , which was kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the assault . Charging furiously on the few but gallant defenders , they drove them over the walls of the castle into the river below . The Governor , with a mere handful of followers , refusing to accept quarter , fought desperately to the last , and fell sword in hand . Of the two hundred and fourteen men that composed the garrison only thirty remained alive , and two-thirds of these were wounded . Not an officer escaped THE AEROW-SHOT. // MOaGAN I3OaNE IN TaIUMPa. death . This desperate affair cost the pirates dearly , for out of the four hundred that made the attack , all but two hundmd and forty were killed or wounded . The women taken prisoners were carried into the church , which was turned into a place of prostitution ; and these widows , borne down by the death of their husbands , were subjected to the foulest indignities . Hearing of the capture of the fort , Morgan set sail from St. Catherine ; and when the fleet came in sight of the castle and saw the English flag flying from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cannon answered cannon in joyful salute . Morgan was carried up the hill into the castle amidst deafening hurrabs ; and in reply to the shouts of the victors complimented them highly for their courage and success . Having repaired the fort and replaced the palisades , he left five hundred men to garrison it , and a hundred and fifty more in the ships , and with twelve hundred started across the country for Panama . Having heard from Indians that the Spaniards lay in ambush at various points on the route , he did not burden his men with provision , because he expected to find plenty in their camps . With five boats to carry the artillery , and thirty-two canoes loaded to the gunwales with troops , he proceeded slowly up the Chagres River . After having advanced some six leagues they landed , and visited the neighboring plantations for food . The owners had fled , taking all their provisions with them . Morgan had not anticipated this , and here , on the first day 's journey , they began to suffer from want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hunger by smoking tobacco . The next day they continued to ascend the river , pushing their heavily-laden boats against the cnrrent , oppressed by a tropical sun , and langnishing for want of food . The stream was low from a long drought ; and at evening they concluded to leave the boats and strike through the forest . They lay off shore all night to prevent surprise by the Indians , and early next morning disembarked . Morgan left one hundred and sixty men in charge of the boats , with strict injunctions never to leave them unguarded for a single instant , and with Indians as guides to show the way , endeavored to push his way through the woods along the shore . The trees , however , were so matted with vines , and the spaces so filled with undergrowth , that he could make but little progress , and he resolved to carry some of the boats still farther up . He therefore re-embarked his men , and by shoving the heaviest boats over the shallow places , was able to keep the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry night for the if they could catch an Indian they would eat pirates , for three days had now passed without him . qwq ping it in water . After the strips had become sufficiently flexible , they scraped off the hair with their knives , and then broiled them on the embers . When well roasted they cut them into small morsels , which they put in their mouths and washed them down with huge gulps of water . Those who lay down supperless watched the progress of this repast with longing eyes . The next day they continued their march , still keeping the bank of the river . A few of the lighter canoes had kept abreast with them , carrying a portion of the party . Many had now given out , and refused to move a step farther . Morgan therefore directed those in canoes to get out , and put the helpless ones in their places . He began to fear the total destruction of his band , when , on this the fifth day , about noon , they came to some plantations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been apparently removed they found , after a long search , a small cave in which was some wheat meal . This Morgan distributed with great care among the famished soldiers , who devoured it with the voracity of wild animals . It however refreshed them , and when the bugle summoned them to their ranks againthey moved with more alacrity than they had since the first day they set out . At night they came to another plantation , but , like the rest , swept of every vestige of food . The next day famine began again to tell on them , and the way becoming more rocky and tangled many sunk on the ground , others fainted away , and Morgan had to order a halt almost every hour to let them rest . The poor wretches would pluck the leaves of trees and the grass at their feet , and strove with them to allay the pangs of hunger . Morgan scanned his staggering ranks with an anxious eye , and began to hesitate what course he should pursue . At this rate it was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be with mere skeletons for soldiers , who would be worthless against even a moderate force intrenched in a city . He attempted to cheer them up as usual , but it was plain that the men were becoming desperate . The bright visions of gold and fame had all faded before the gaunt image of famine , and now only one thought filled their minds , but one object possessed any value to them , and that was food . To the great relief of Morgan , and the unbounded joy of all , they came at noon to a plantation on which they discovered a barn full of corn . In an instant all order was lost , the soldiers broke their ranks , and with loud shouts rushed on the building , wrenched the doors from their hinges , and seizing the yellow ears devoured them fiercely . After eating till they were satisfied , they loaded themselves down with the remainder and pushed cheerfully forward , shouting- " To Paaarna . ' " About an hour after it was announced that the enemy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one accord they threw away their corn , supposing that they would find abundance of provisions ahead . But they found neither . On the other side of the river , however , were assembled a hundred of them , whom the pirates endeavored to get at by fording the river . But the Indians let fly a shower of arrows into their midst , and then tauntingly shouting , " Go to the plains , you dogs ! go to the plains ! " vanished in the surrounding forest . Four of the buccaneers fell , pierced by arrows , and were borne lifeless to the shore , while several others were wounded . At sunset they buried their dead comrades there on the banks of the river , and encamped for the night . The men were now getting weaiy of these fruitless marches , and the camp was filled with murmurings of discontent and curses on Morgan , who had persuaded them by false representations to come into these savage solitudes where nothing but famine awaited them . Others laughed at the croakers , declaring that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . The next morning , ascertainingfrom the guides that they might expect to have some fighting before night , the men drew the balls from their pistols and muskets , and fired them off to test their condition . They then crossed the river , and kept on till they reached a village at the head of navigation . As they approached it the soldiers saw columns of smoke rising from the chimneys , and shouting " Hurrah ! they are roasting a dinner for us ! " rushed forward . But when they entered the place , staggering from fatigue and panting with the heat , they found it empty of inhabitants and cattle , and every house , except the King 's store-house and stables , on fire . The men , who were clamorous for meat , roamed up and down to discover some animals , but found nothing except a few cats and dogs , which they immediately killed and devoured . They , however , came across ten jars of Peru wine , which were soon emptied . For a little while it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirth made the surrounding forests echo . But their stomachs being disordered by fasting and the vile trash they had been compelled to eat , the wine made them deadly sick . Their joy was instantly turned into mortal fcar ; for they supposed that the wine had been poisoned on purpose to destroy them , and that they were all dead men . Morgan , seeing the condition of his troops , encamped there for the night . This being the last place to which boats or canoes could come , he landed his sick and weak , and sent all but one boat back to those he had left farther down the river . He retained this one , thinking that he might need it to dispatch a message to the others . On the morningof the 8th the whole body set out for Panama , only eight leagues distant . Two hundred and twenty men moved in advance to clear the way of any parties in ambush . Only ten or twelve could march abreast in the road they were following , and they pressed cautiously but rapidly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped noiselessly in their midst , killing several and bringing the whole band to a sudden halt . They looked on every side , but could see no foe . The shower ceased as suddenly // as it came , and the order to march was again passed along the ranks . It was supposed that the arrows came from behind a high ledge of rocks under which they were passing . A little farther on they entered a wood , in which they caught sight of some Indians in full flight . Still advancing , they came upon a body of savages who resolutely opposed their passage . They were led on by a gallant chief , and fought bravely till he fell . Though severely wounded he re-. fused to ask for quarter , and making a last desperate effort , partly rose on his knees and struck his javelin into a pirate ; but before he could repeat the blow fell pierced by a dozen balls . In this affray the buccaneers had eight killed and ten wounded . Pushing on through the forest , they emerged into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halted , and sending fifty men forward to disperse a body of Indians that he saw on the top of a mountain which overhung the road , he had the ten wounded soldiers cared for and the slain buried . Resuming his march he pushed cautiously forward , scattering the Indians as he went by his scouting parties , and cheering his men by promising to show them Panama the next day . The sky , which had been unclouded during the day , leaving the tropical sun to pour its full heat on the weary buccaneers , now became suddenly clouded . The air grew dark , the trees swayed and roared in the rising blast , and there was every appearance of a sudden and furious storm . The increasing gloom brought on night before the sun had set , and the men began to look anxiously around for a place of shelter ; but the Indians had burned every dwelling as they retreated . At length the cloud opened , and the rain fell in a perfect deluge to the earth . The buccaneers now became seriously alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual good luck did not desert him here ; for in a few moments one of the parties that had been sent out in search of shelter returned with the intelligence that they had discovered a few deserted huts , used by shepherds when they grazed their cattle in that region . Into these their arms and powder , with a few men to guard them , were hastily crowded , and the remainder sat down on the bare earth and endured the pelting rain . More than a thousand of them , they huddled together , and with bowed heads gloomily sat out the night , while it rained as it rains nowhere except in a tropical country . At first some DEATH OF THE OHIEF. // were inclined to joke ) declaring it a refreshing bath after the hot journey of the day ; but as the water continued to fall , hour after hour , almost in solid masses , these jokes gave place to muttered curses . They had escaped one misfortune , they said , only to fall into another . Hungry , tired , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they wished themselves back again aboard their own ships . At length the long-looked-for morning dawned andthe storm passed away . As the sun mounted the heavens Morgan immediately ordered the bugles to sound , and th*soaked and famished adventurers , without a mouthful to eat , fell into marching order and set forward . Soon after sunrise they discovered twenty Spaniards reconnoitering them . A small party was sent out to capture some of them , if possible ; for Morgan began to be seriously concerned that he could obtain no information whatever of the number of the troops at Panama or of the strength of the place . The Spaniards , however , avoided them , dispersing as they approached , and disappearing mysteriously among the rocks and in caves , the locality of which was known only to themselves . Arriving at the base of an abrupt bill the weary baud began the toilsome ascent . The clouds had till now hung in heavy masses on the sky ; but as the sun continued to mount higher and higher , they broke and floated away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full power on the little army . The steam arose from the drenched column as it struggled upward , while the tropical foliage , as the wind began to freshen , sent down a second shower upon their heads . At length the summit was reached , and there lay , spread out below them , Panama and the blue ocean beyond . They gazed for a moment on the glittering spires and magnificent houses , on the sails of departing vessels and the blue water beyond ; then burst into a loud huzza . Some swung their caps around their heads , and flung them into the air , shouting ; others ran and leaped , while the trumpets blew a loud and joyous blast , as if the city was already in their power . The sight of the sea , and the scattered sails here and there upon it , was a welcome sight to these rovers , whose home it was , and they forgot for the moment their empty stomachs and the perils before them . With laughter and songs they rattled down the farther side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of woods , struck an open plain covered with lowing herds of cattle . At this unexpected and joyful sight the famished buccaneers broke their ranks , and fell with knives and swords and muskets upon the astonished herd , and soon the ground was covered with the carcasses of cows , bulls , horses , and asses . Some commenced flayingthem , others collected wood and made fires . As soon as the skin was off an animal huge pieces were cut away and flung into the flames ; these would be scarcely heated through before they were plucked away and devoured with ravenous fury . Some were sitting , some standing , all scattered around among the mutilated animals ; while the blood soaking their huge beards and dropping off upon their breasts , they presented altogether a most wild and savage appearance . Morgan waited till they had gorged themselves , and then ordered the drums to beat , and the bloody , besmeared troop took up again its line of march . Just at evening they saw , over the tree-tops , glittering in the sunset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning was here renewed , and all the drums and trumpets in the army were beaten and sounded , making such an uproar and clatter that the astonished inhabitants began to think an immediate assault was intended . Fifty horsemen issued forth to reconnoitre , and came at an easy gallop toward where Morgan had halted his men . A bugler rode behind the leader playing a trumpet of wonderful power and richness of tone , the martial notes echoing far away in the twilight , and dying in softened cadences in the surrounding forest . When nearly within musket-shot they came to a halt , the trumpeter ceased , and the dashing cavaliers shook their swords at the pirates and shouted , " Come on dogs , we 'll meet you ! " then wheeling , galloped away to the sound of music , and re-entered the city . A few minutes after the earth shook with the heavy explosion of cannon as the Spaniards opened with their artillery on the camp . All night long the fields and woods were aflame with the ceaseless firing of the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but having placed their sentinels , sat down , and , opening their knapsacks , took out the pieces of meat which they had stowed away in the morning , and quietly ate their suppers . The next morning Morgan arrayed his men , and ordering the drums and trumpets to sound , marched straight for the city . He had not proceeded far before one of the guides told him that the road was lined with batteries for some distance from the city , and was so enfiladed that he could not force an entrance in that direction ; and pointed another way , more difficult and intricate , but far safer . Wheeling into this , they entered a piece of wood , and soon came to the foot of a hill , the ascent of which was steep and difficult . In the mean time scouts had informed the Spaniards of the new route which the buccaneers had taken . This was unexpected and disheartening news to them ; for they never dreamed that the enemy would attempt any but the common highway , and hence had concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once that he could not rely on his batteries , but must meet the enen*j* in the open field , and gave orders to have the troops drawn up in the plain outside the city . They had scarcely formed when the buccaneers appeared on the summit of the hill . The latter were amazed and dispirited at the spectacle that met their gaze . On the plain stood nearly 3000 men in battle array , besides a vast multitude of Indians with wild bulls in the leash ready to be driven on the advancing ranks . Of these // 00 were cavalry . The ardor of the night and morning suddenly vanished , and they wished themselves back over the mountains . After a short consultation it was decided that to retreat was certain destruction , and that their only hope , faint as it appeared , lay in advancing . Morgan then divided his force into three battalions , and moving amidst the ranks , revived their drooping hearts with words of encouragement , saying that he had often been in a worse strait ; had fought against far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now if they would stand firm . Pointing to the city , he told them it was full of booty and beauty ; asked if it was not worth an effort . Riches were before them , death behind . One bold effort , and the prize was theirs , and all their toils would be rewarded . Would they stand by him ! They shouted " Yes , to the last drop of our blood Two hundred picked marksmen were then sent forward to open the battle . The drums and bugles struck up an exciting march , and , with a loud hurrah , the three battalions descended to the plain . The Spaniards stood in compact order until they had approached almost within musketshot , when the shout " Viva el Req ! " rolled along the line . The bugles immediately sounded the charge , and the cavalry dashed forward . The 200 marksmen , dropping on one knee , took deliberate aim and waited till the squadron had come within close range , when " Fire ! " ran along the line . Saddles were emptied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole formation was broken into fragments . The shattered column attempted to wheel and re-form ; but the ground was soft and the horses were mired , which protracted the movement so that the pirates had time to re-load and pour in another murderous volley before they got beyond range . Riderless horses went galloping wildly over the plain , while cheer after cheer arose from the buccaneers . The infantry instantly advanced to support the cavalry , when Morgan moved up his other battalions to meet them , and the battle became general . The Indians let loose the wild bulls , and drove them with furious shouts toward the buccaneers . A few broke bellowing through the ranks ; but the unerring shot dropped most of them while charging . Maddened with wounds , frightened and confused by the uproar and smoke of battle , the remainder plunged hither and thither in every direction . For two hours neither army retired a step , but stood and fired into each other 's faces . At length the cavalry being nearly all killed , the few survivors wheeled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their muskets to lighten their loads . The buccaneers were too feeble to pursue , and so gratified their revenge by murdering all the wounded that fell into their hands . Six hundred lay dead on the field . The buccaneers also had suffered severely , which so enraged Morgan that he ordered some priests and monks who had been taken prisoners to be shot . They knelt and cried for mercy , but their prayers were hushed by the crack of the pistol , and their bodies were VOL . XIX. - No. 109. -C left to rot where they fell . One captive was spared , in order to obtain information fiom him respecting the force in the city and the strength of the place . Having ascertained that a battery of eight guns commanded the main entrance , Morgan made a detour and approached the city in a different direction . As he advanced , however , cannon , loaded with fragments of iron and musketballs , opened on his column with deadly effect . But moving unscathed amidst the shot , he cheered on his men , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scoffing at death , kept fiercely on , stormed the batteries , and fighting their way inch by inch , steadily gained on the enemy . The little force was rapidly thinning ; but it was victory or total ruin with them . For three hours the Spaniards fought bravely for their homes , their wives , and daughters ; but nothing could resist the headlong fury and deadly markmanship of the pirates ; and they finally broke and fled . With loud shouts the victors dashed on , and in a short time swept every street of the enemy . Morgan then sounded the recall ; and as his band gathered around him , forbade every one , under fearful penalties , drinking any wine , saying that it had been poisoned . This was not true ; but he was afraid that his troops , in the first flush of victory , would drink themselves into stupidity , and then fall an easy prey to the Spaniards . Much of the gold had been removed or hid ; but they found many warehouses filled with valuable goods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed guards at various quarters to prevent surprise ; for an army equal to his own he knew was scattered in the surrounding forest . He then directed twenty-five men to launch a barge boat that lay on the shore , and push out into the bay to capture any vessels afloat , lest they might be carrying away gold and jewels . Cruising about , they found and seized several boats , in some of which were women . Capturing one boat with seven sailors in her , who had been ashore for water and were returning to their ship  --  a galleon lying some three miles off-they learned from them that she was feebly armed , and had aboard of her all the nuns of the place , who had taken with them the ornaments and wealth of the church , and all the plate and jewels , on their way to the King of Spain , together with the wealth of some of the richest merchants of Panama . This rich prize , worth more than all that remained behind on shore , could have been easily taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bay they passed the whole night in the vilest debauchery , and came to their senses in time only to find that this valuable prize had escaped from their hands , and to receive the curses of their commander and the scoffs of their comrades for their beastliness and folly . Morgan set fire to a part of the city , though for what purpose no one knew . Panama , at this time , was built entirely of cedar , some of the houses being curiously carved and most magnifi // cently adorned , especially with hangings and paintings . It contained two splendid churches and eight monasteries . All the rich plate , altarpieces , and other wealth of these the priests had hidden so that the pirates could not find them . As a punishment for this , Morgan directcd all the churches but one to be hurried . This he spared solely because he needed it for a hospital for the wounded , of which he had a large number . These , together with a party he had sent back to Chagres with the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he exercised constant vigilance to prevent a surprise . He tinily sent out parties to scour the country for prisoners . He also dispatched boats to the neighboring islands of Taboga and Tabogilla , which took several valuable prizes . Soon after , the party he had sent to Chagres returned with the news that those left behind had entrapped and taken a Spanish vessel laden with provisions . The daily marauding expeditions sent out were very successful , both in obtaining gold and prisoners in great numbers . These , especially the priests , were put to the rack to make them disclose the places where they had concealed the ornaments and gold of the churches . Tortures were practiced of such a painful nature and so protracted that many died under them . Morgan 's success in thus obtaining gold only made him the more relentless , and the arrival of every new batch of prisoners was the signal for new cruelties , and that once peaceful city rang with the shrieks of the suffering . One of the expeditions to Taboga had capturcd SaAUGHTEB OF TilE raizsrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was absent on a voyage to Peru . She was possessed of rare beauty of person and of most winning manners . Au atmosphere of purity seemed to surround her , which , while it attracted , awed the beholder . The moment Morgan saw her he loomed her to his pleasures ; but there was something about her before which even this bold marauder quailed . He felt abashed and uneasy in her presence , and powerless to play the brute to her . Disguising his motives , he had her placed in an elegant apartment , attended by a maid , and supplied with food from his own table . After a t'ew days , finding he could make no progress in overcoming her repugnance to him , he boldly demanded that she should yield to his lusts . Instead of being roused into despair and anger by the insult , she talked so like an angel to him-sentiments of such purity and beauty dropped from her lips-that he felt abashed and humbled in her presence . He then offered her gold , and pearls , and jewels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but resolutely refused to accept any present from him . Stung by this evidence of her utter loathing , he flew into a passion and swore he would wring a consent from her by the rack before he had done with her . She replied , " Sir , my life is in your hands ; but as to my body , my soul shall sooner be separated from it through the violence of your arms than I shall condescend to your request . " Mortified , yet enraged , he strode out of her apartment , and ordered his servants to strip off her best apparel and imprison her in a dark cellar , amidst putrid remains . Here she spent her time in devotion ; and the passer-by would pause as he heard her sweet and thrilling voice imploring the protection of Heaven in her behalf . The companions of the buccaneer were at length moved , and Morgan began to feel uneasy at the contemptuous expressions of his conduct that were from time to time repeated to him , and attempted to justify his severity by the unblushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he had been in Panama three weeks Morgan began to think of returning to his ships with his spoils . He therefore ordered each company to gather together as many cattle as would be necessary to transport the booty across the mountains to his boats . In the mean time a conspiracy had been formed among the buccaneers to seize a vessel in port and escape , and cruise in the South seas for their own benefit . Morgan , ever watchful and vigilant , discovered this on the very eve of its being put into execution . Too politic to arraign the ringleaders and awaken hostility by punishing them , he quietly ordered every vessel and boat in the bay to be set on fire . This effectually killed the conspiracy , and he turned his attention again to the preparations for departure . Sending the Spaniards under escorts into the fields and woods to find money with which to ransom themselves , hs* spiked all the cannon of the place , and sent out parties to reconnoitre and see if the report was true that the Governor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his retu* route with ambus M*RGAN AND HIS PRISONER . // cades . Finding it false , and that the way was clear , he on the 24th of February drew up his little band outside the city . First came an advance-guard to open up the road , then the main body , followed by six hundred captives - men and women  --  and one hundred and seventy-five beasts of burden , loaded down with the spoils : the last protected by a strong rear-guard . As they passed along the most doleful lamentations and piteous cries filled the air . The unhappy wretches , supposing they were to be transported to the far-off haunts of the pirates , and doomed to perpetual slavery , and that of the most loathsome , revolting character , could not restrain their anguish . The women , when they halted at night , gathered around Morgan , and on their knees besought him , in the most pleading tones , to let them return and live with their husbands , even in huts of straw , amidst the ashes of their former homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that he " wanted money , not tears and groans ; " and , if they wished freedom , they had better spend their time in hunting up that which would procure it , instead of lamenting their fate ; for , unless it was forthcoming , he certainly would carry them to places they would little relish . They encamped at night in an open l ) lain , with the prisoners by themselves , surrounded by a strong guard . * Next morning at dawn the bugle summoned both sleepers and watchers to their places ; and soon the camp-fires were cheerfully blazing . But the poor captives were too much occupied with their own sorrqws to eat ; and when the march recommenced they rent the air anew with their cries . Every mile that increased the distance between them and their home lessened the hopes of delivery and carried them nearer to the dwelling-places of their captors . Morgan had ordered the beautiful lady of Taboga to be kept apart from the crowd of prisoners and march between two pirates . Seeing herself about to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air with cries . She told the pirates that she had sent two priests for the money to ransom her , and that , having obtained it , they had applied it to ransom some of their own friends . The pirates immediately in charge of her were moved to pity by her touching appeals . Her gentle manners , her surpassing beauty , combined with that nameless charm that surrounds angelic purity , finally enlisted them in her behalf , and they presented her case to Morgan . Governed by policy rather than feeling , he ordered the priests to be brought before him , and demanded if they had appropriated this lady 's money to their own purposes . Finding that the proof against them was clear , they confessed that they had taken it , but only as a temporary loan , designing to return it soon . Morgan then ordered the lady to be set at liberty and escorted out of the camp . With a heart fluttering with unutterable joy she flew like a bird set free back to the sea .. shore , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it held dear . How long she tarried amidst the ashes of Panama with the fugitives that gathered there to rebuild their homes ; how many weary days she sought the I N K TUE PEISONEltS PaEAniS4e. // ( lesolate shore , scanning with that pleading eye the blue horizon beyond to catch the first gleam of a white sail ; how , when it came at last , it bore to her faithful , loving arms the husband of her heart , naught is known . This living poem , revealing woman 's purity and constancy , is only one among the many that remain unwritten and unsung amidst the solitudes of Darien . Continuing his march , Morgan at length reached the Chagres River , where he had left the one boat . Sending down for other boats , he halted here three days . On his first arrival he called the prisoners together and told them that he would grant three days for them to effect their ransom ; if in that time it did not arrive , they would be carried into hopeless bondage . A. few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , at the end of three days , were carried forward ; and whether they perished under the hardships that a portion of this band afterward endured , or whether they were reserved for a worse fate , and wasted away under the cruelties which Spaniards and buccaneers alike inflicted on their slaves under the first Spanish rule , is also locked up with the untold , inconceivable tragedies that made those West India isles-by nature the Hesperides of the earthunder the first Spanish rule an Aceldama . When part way down the river Morgan ordered every man to be searched to ascertain if any one , in violation of the original articles of agreement , had concealed jewels or gold about his person . This caused a good deal of murmuring among the French portion of the expedition , but they were compelled to submit . Arriving at Chagres , the spoils were divided . Great was the astonishment of the soldiers when they found that their portion amounted only to two hundred dollars apiece . They declared that this was a niggardly remuneration for all the toils they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was worse , it was not a fair proportion of the vast spoils they had brought across the Isthmus . At first this dissatisfaction expressed itself only in innuendoes and murmurs . But it soon ripened into open accusations against Morgan , that he had appropriated the greater part of the spoils to himself . Seeing that this growing discontent would soon break out in opeti revolt , he removed the cannon of the castle aboard his own ship , set fire to what would burn within the works , and secretly embarking , set sail for Jamaicit . Only three vessels-supposed to be partners with him in his ill-gotten gains-followed him . The remaining buccaneers were left to get back as they best could in the miserable craft that remained behind . The most suffered great hardships ; and those who finally reached the West Indies found themselves as poor as when they left on this ill-starred expedition .
