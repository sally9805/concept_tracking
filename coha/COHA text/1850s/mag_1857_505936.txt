THE SIEGE OF FORT ATKINSON . I. NEXT to Kit Carson , unquestionably the two most notorious characters in all the region of the Far West , at the present time , are Bill Bent and Yellow Bear , war-chief of the Arrapaho Indians . The name of Bent is too well known to require a card of introduction to the public .. Yellow Bearhas ever been Bent 's warmest friend , and has saved that old trader 's life for him time and time again . His influence is probably greater than that of any individual chief among all the Indian tribes , and it is due chiefly to him that Uncle Sam has been enabled to keep the peace for so many years with two of the most powerful nations of the plains  --  the Cheyennes and the Arrapahoes . In Yellow Bear , Cooper might have found his beast ideal of the red child of the forest ; for , physically a man in the highest sense of the word , his intellectual capacity is all that could be expected from a mind without culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the council , of profound sagacity and unshaken purpose , together with a rare modesty , . a kindly disposition , and a magnanimous contempt of insult , his friends and allies worship him , while foes respect but fear him . * * Beneath the shadow of the Rocky Mountains , or along the banks of many a prairie creek and river , the wilderness has been the silent witness of scenes of strife and carnage that would curdle the blood and blanch the cheek ; of which , betimes , some brief recital is borne eastward to shock incredulous cars . There is a startling history connected with the protracted siege of Bent 's Fort during the winter just past , of which some half-distorted faets have been doled out in meagre parcels to readers of newspaper literature. ; and a moral , too , which if duly considered by those who have in charge the management of our Indian affairs , might be of practical benefit in the future . So , also , there is in every such event-which calls loudly for an amendment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tritely-told incidents are fraught with illustrations bearing upon this paint , and with this view are now for the first time recorded on the printed page . It is some five years since the startling intelligence was brought from the Plains , by way of Independence , Missouri , that Fort Atkinson on the Arkansas River had been captured by the Indians , and its garrison massacred ; and that Bent 's and King 's wagon-trains had also been intercepted , and everyone of the party murdered . Fortunately the report afterward proved untrue , though it was by no means - without foundation . It was in the month of July , 1852 , the time for the distribation of the annuities and presents to the allied tribes of the Kiowas and Comanches , that the Indians of the aforesaid tribes were assembled in vast numbers in the vicinity of Fort Atkinson , impatiently awaiting the arrival of Charles Fitzpatrick , the nient for the Comanches , who , already behind time , was daily expected with the presents . There could not have been less than 10,000 in all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fort ; though the " big village " was some ten miles farther up the river , where the pasturage was better , and fire-wood more easily obtained . The scarcity of fuel and grass is the chief inconvenience experienced by this fort , though in other respects it is by no means agreeably situated-its location having been chosen solely with a view to the accommodation of the neighboring Indian tribes and the protection of the Santa F* trade . The Arkansas River flows within a few rods of its walls , having a depth of three or four feet at certain seasons of the year ; but in summer , like most of the prairie streams , its bed is generally nearly dry . The surrounding country is a barren waste , without vegetation , save a few shrub bushes and the crispy buffalo grass , diversified only by innumerable sand hills . No wood is to be had within thirteen miles ; and " buffalo chips , " the dernier resort for fuel , once found in great abundance , are now quite scarce , the ' buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is of adobe , or sundried brick , roofed with canvas , containing fair accommodations for the garrison , and defended by a few small field-pieces and the usual armament . It has also a large corral on one side , five feet in height , for the protection of the animals . A garrison of ninety men ( infantry , 6th regiment ) and twenty B dragoons comprised the entire force at the date of our narrativesurprisingly deficient for so important a post . Two weeks had nearly elapsed since the time appointed for the distribution of presents , but no agent yet made his appearance . The Indians had thus far borne the unwarrantable delay with remarkable patience , considering their naturally restless and irritable disposition , and the by-no-means-pleasing consciousness that they were , day by day , half-starving their horses on the sparse and abominable pasturage , and rapidly eating themselves out of all kinds of provisions-most of them , too , having traveled hundreds of miles to meet the agent at the time appointed . To this was added the suspicion of the red men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be cheated of their annuities . Thus , as day after day passed by , and still no agent came , they became more and more uneasy , and soon began to manifest unmistakable evidences of hostility . Indeed , the proposition was warmly espoused by many of the younger men that their treaty with the United States should be at once annulled , the annuities rejected ,  --  and an exterminating war declared ; but the plan received little favor with the head men . They began now to gather around the fort in great numbers , threatening to annihilate the garrison if the presents were not speedily forthcoming , and occasionally endeavoring to force their way inside the gate . In vain the officers expostulated . They knew , // they said , that " the Big Chief at Washington intended to cheat them out of their just dues . They were a heap mad ; and if the presents did not arrive within ten days , they would not only take toll ' from the first wagon train they met , but would wipe out every United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any thing to do with the Government . " Such was the ferment excited by the single error of delay . " Delays are dangerous . " Never were they more so than in the case instanced . The most serious consequences often result from the most trifling and needless mistakes . Charles Fitzpatrick , veteran trader and mountaineer that he was , and well versed in Indian character knew well the difficulties to be apprehended from procrastination ; but he could do nothing . The fault lay with the Government , though its sins were likely to be visited upon the head of its agent , who was thus placed in a most trying and uncomfortable position , liable to be instantly sacrificed to the frenzy of the enraged and abused Indians , who would not pause to discriminate between persons . This might have been the first step in an open and protracted war ; the next the massacre of the garrison ; and afterward , the end would not be until thousands of lives had been lost and millions of money expended . But fortunately no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sown by this and other like abuses , have already germinated , and prove no insignificant tares to be uprooted from the fallow field of Indian diplomacy . The startling events of the past fully prove it . But to return to the fort . In the present emergency , an attack being momentarily expected , and the garrison in the greatest excitement , it was determined to send to the States for aid . But instead of dispatching one of the common soldiers , the commanding officer imprudently undertook the commission himself , leaving the fort in charge of Second Lieutenant 5- and Sergeant R , valiant men , but inadequate to the arduous and delicate duties assigned them . These now used every means in their power to keep the Indians quiet , and prevent them getting possession of the fort . Sentries were stationed at regular intervals near the gateway , with orders to shoot down any Indian that might attempt to pass ; and every possible precaution was taken to guard against a sudden attack . Fortunately , however , for the present , matters did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following day that the first direct attempt was made , when a gigantic Kiowa , six feet three in his moccasins , approached one of the sentries as he was patrolling his beat , and demanded permission to enter the fort . He was evidently the champion of several hundred Kiowas gathered in groups of twenties and fifties a few rods distant , who had deputized him to make the demand , and now stood eagerly awaiting the result . The soldier , a diminutive Celt , stood trembling as he re- ' garded with no little apprehension the muscu lar form and threatening attitude of the savage confronting him ; but putting as bold a face as possible upon the matter , he straightened himself up , and informed him in a tone decidedly military , that he " could not come in . The savage persisted . The sentry resisted , and presented his bayonet , whereupon the other deliberately knocked him down , and walked quietly toward the fort the rest of the . Indians following in a body . Of the remaining sentries , some fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done , while the others stood motionless and dumbfounded , and permitted the Indians to pass in without opposing the least resistance . Aside from this single act of violence the Indians seemed quite peaceable , and offered no injury to any of the troops , though they refrained from nothing by way of gesture , words , or supercilious bearing , to manifest their boldness and their supreme contempt , their object being apparently to show what they could do if disposed . There were altogether three or four hundred inside the fort , walking about the premises , and satisfying their curiosity by examining the barracks , officers ' quarters , armory , and defenses , but taking nothing of value , being probably restrained by Ter-hausen ( Little Mountain ) their chief ; with whom the officers were well acquainted . These , now recovering from their first alarm , and finding the Indians disposed to be peaceable , took especial pains to show them all the defenses of the fort , hoping thereby to intimidate them from making any subsequent attack . All this extra attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifesting no surprise , but emitting a guttural " ugh " from time to time , expressive of their approbation or indifference , as the case might be . So , for the greater part of the day the fort remained thronged with these unwelcome visitors , causing the garrison no little anxiety ; and when , at evening , the last of them withdrew his swarthy form from the place , and the gate was closed , a pleasurable sensation of relief came to each soldier as he exchanged congratulations with his fellow , thankful that they had been spared a tragedy like that which , years ago , made old Fort Mann a depopulated waste of ruins. * II . No more trouble came that day or night ; but the thin blue smoke curled silently and pleasingly from a myriad fires as the squaws prepared their evening meal , while the low drone of the camp , and the yelping and barking of a thousand gaunt and half-starved curs , were the only sounds that fell upon the ears of the distracted soldiers . Nevertheless , the garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated some twen. ty miles from Fort Atkinson , was attacked one night by an immense war-party of Pawnees , who stealthily scaled the walls while the guard slept , and put the inhabitants to death , sacking and burning the place . A confesed mass of ruins now mark the spot , affording a startling memento of ens of the many fearful tragedies enacted on this " Dark and Bloody Ground . " // the whole night under arms . The next morning every thing was quiet and orderly , and comparatively few Indians were seen near the fort , the greater part of them having moved a few miles up the river , near the " big village . " In this improved and gratifying state of affairs the confidence of the commanding officer partially returned , and he grew more and more courageous in proportion as the danger diminished . Remembering with shame and indignation the outrage committed upon one of his soldiers the day before by the audacious Kiowa , involving as it did a gross indignity upon the authority and honor of the United States Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offender arrested at once , and properly punished , as an example to the rest . He would give them to understand that such outrages were not to be perpetrated with impunity ! Accordingly he mustered his entire available force , and taking two pieces of artillery , marched up the river , leaving only six men in charge of the fort , to defend it , if need be , against the five hundred Indians who were prowling about . Most of these , however , followed in the trail of the troops , like a crowd of loafers in a large city at the tail of a procession , anticipating some fun or excitement . In his zeal to bring the offender to justice , no thought of the danger and difficulties that attended the execution of his plans occurred to the valorous Lieutenant . lie had not the least doubt that he could march up and take the Indian from his friends and his tribe without opposition on their part . He had only to state his demands , and the offender would be immediately surrendered ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his numerous force could not fail to effect what mere words would be unable to do . Awed by his imposing appearance , the red-skins would , no doubt , come to terms at once . It did occur to him , however , that it might have been better to have demanded the Indian of Ter-hausen the day before , when both were within the walls of the fort , instead of allowing the affair temporarily to blow over , and giving the offender an opportunity to escape ; besides having now to contend with ten thousand Indians , instead of only four hundred , as would have been the case the day before . No sooner had the troops formed in line outside the fort , preparatory to marching , than the Indians above were informed of their intentions , and prepared to receive them . The viilage turned out en masse , and when the troops came up , they at once surrounded them , so that they were completely flanked on either side , with the river in their rear . However , they made their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their approach , the Indians meanwhile gallopingaround them in vast numbers , hooting , and yelling , and brandishing their weapons . In this dilemma the courage and ardor of the troops considerably abated , as they now expected nothing less than an attack ; but the savages refrained from any act of violence . Arrived at the Council lodge , the Lieutenant immediately stated his demands , and the reasons therefor ; having received which , the chiefs held a few moments ' consultation . There were present , besidesTer-hausen the Kiowa chief , and Shaved-head , chief of the Comanches , and other minor chiefs of the two tribes , several Cheyenne chiefs , and Yellow Bear , the Arrapaho - all having considerable influence with the allies . These latter being friendly to the whites , earnestly dissuaded the others from molesting the troops , as any such act would bring upon them the vengeance of the United States Government , besides precluding every chance of their obtaining the presents they were so impatiently expecting . This well-timed advice had the effect to pacify them to a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented the total annihilation of the troops . Nevertheless , the combined influence of the chiefs did not suffice to hold completely in check the passions of the excited braves , who now crowded close upon the soldiers , threatening to trample them beneath their horses ' hoofs . After a short consultation the delinquent Kiowa was brought forward , led between two Kiowa braves , ned surrounded by a host of his friends , who conducted him to the Lieutenant , and in a sarcastic manner told him , " Here is the rascal-take him The Indians now thronged so closely upon the party within the little circle as to render it almost impossible to move , while the continual shouting and jeering rendered it difficult to hear a word that was said . It was evident to the Lieutenant that it was farthest from their intentions to give up tbe man , and that they had only employed this feint as a provocation to a fight , after the fashion of some " shoulderhitters ' in placing a chip upon a man 's shoulder and daring another to knock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were drawn up in line , with the two field-pieces in front , bearing directly upon the densest body of the Indians , so that their first discharge , together with that of the musketry , could not fail to make dreadful havoc among them ; but it required no great foresight to perceive that a resort to arms would be the height of folly , and that at the first onset they would be immediately overpowered and slaughtered to a man . To retreat was hazardous , for the Indians , perceiving their fear , would be encouraged to att ck them ; while , if they attempted to take the offender , they would , of course , be resisted . In this dilemma th*officers looked despairingly at each other . They had evidently " caught a Tartar . " At length the Lieutenant , with more wit than valor , approached Ter-hausen , and extending his hand , graciously informed him that he was satisfied with his willingness to give up the culprit , and to have him properly punished ; but he was confident that more good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own way , rather than to have that unpleasant duty to perform himself . He would not , therefore , // press the matter farther , but trust to them to have justice done . So saying , he shook hands with the chiefs , and affectin* an air of nonchalance , turned to his men and gave the order to march .. But no sooner had he done this than the savages raised a triumphant shout , and charging upon the troops with deafening yells , forced them bodily down the gentle slope toward the river , but without using their weapons or attempting any greater violence ; so that before the soldiers recovered from their first surprise sufficiently to comprehend the difficulty , they found themselves waist-deep in the river , with their guns and ' powder rendered useless by the water . Here the Indians jeered them to their hearts ' content , and then suffered them to go on their way . Not a musket was fired by the troops , and no one attempted the least resistance . Indeed , all were so terribly frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than their arms . However , the Lieutenant at length succeeded in forming them in tolerable marching order , when they . made good time to the fort , the Indians following them to the very gate , throwing sand and dirt at them , and using all manner of taunting epithets . It was not until the next day that the officers learned the full extent of the danger to which they had been exposed . Not only had the Indians invested them in front and on either side , but a party of not less than five hundred warriors lay secreted upon a reedy island in the river , ready to attack them on their rear . Thus if the Indians had been disposed , they might have not only destroyed them to a man , but also taken and plundered the fort , burned it , and returned to their own country before a single white man had been apprised of the fearful tragedy . Mangled corpses , smoking ruins , and utter devastation alone would have told the story to the first astounded traveler who passed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts of Yellow Bear and his few compatriots were unquestionably all ' that saved this country from a pron*acted Indian war . HI . A week subsequent to the occurrence above related , a train of fourteen white-tilted Conostoga wagons , to which were add d a couple of light traveling-carriages  --  a rare phenomenon upon the prairies-were slowly rumbling along the bank of the Arkansas toward the fort , and distant about fourteen miles . The greater part of the wagons were drawn by mules , though to five of them oxen were attached , there being six to each wagon . These latter comprised the wagon-train of the notorious Bill Bent , who was now on his way from the States to St. Vram 's Fort on the South Platte , whither he had transferred his trading-post , some years before , having burned and dismantled old Fort William ( better known as Bent 's Fort ) , it is said , to prevent its falling into the hands of the 0overnment . This post was one of the best built and most eligibly situated in the whole Territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military station-who offered Bent a considerable sum for its purchase , but not sufficient in the old trader 's estimation . The eccentric old fello'v , in a sudden freak of resentment , or from some inexplicable cause , accordingly demolished it . The remaining wagons of the train , as also the two carriages , belonged to Mr. King 's party , which was composed chiefly of young adv&amp;nturers and valetmtdinarians , who had chosen this route of summer travel in preference to those more generally selected by fashionables and **25;588;TOOLONG to run the risk of being eased of their money and valuables by the feather-bedizened and copper-colored thieves of the plains , rather than the civilized amid more accomplished light-fingered gentry of the East . Fitzwilliam had also joined company , and was along with his men-all the camp-equipage and accoutrements of his party being secured upon the backs of pack-mules , hunter fashion . But by no means the least notable personage in the cavalcade was Yellow Bear , who had been waiting for Bent at Fort Atkinson , having agreed to meet him there ; but being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join him , fearful lest he should be attacked and massacred by the Comanches , as his was the first train along since the troubles commenced . All those men not attached to the wagons were mounted on fine horses , and galloped along , rifle in hand , in front and rear and on either side , keeping a sharp look-out for Indians , and carefully guarding the pack animals and loose horses , of which there were some seventy in all . Altogether the train numbered about fifty persons ; so that they presented quite an imposing appearance , as well as a formidable foe to Indian assailants . Up to this time no Indians had been seen ; but they had progressed but a short distance farther when a few stragglers were met . As they continued to advance , more were seen ; and these gradually increased in number , until there were several hundred hi the vicinity of the train , while reinforcements were continually arriving from above . It now became evident that the whole camp was apprised of their approach , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . However , no attempts were yet made to molest them , and they kept steadily on their way , but redoubling their precautions for safety . Bent 's wagons were placed in front , and the animals between them and the remaining wagons , with a horse-guard on either side . As there were several women and children in the party , Bent also having his family with him , it was deemed advisable for their safety to send them on to the fort in advance , under the escort of Yellow near , as the object of the Indians now seemed to be plunder mere ly . Accordingly Bent , with his five wagons , the carriages , and a sufficient force for their protection , hastened forward with all possible speed , leaving the remaining wagons in charge of some sixteen men . // But no sooner were they fairly out of sight than the Indians gathered around the others in swarms , and commenced a series of xnancouvies , endeavoring , in every manner imaginable , to stampede the animals or to confuse and separate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling and rattling their spears against their leathern shields , and making the most hideous din , they would charge suddenly upon the wagons , endeavoring to drive their horses between the men , and thus divide their ranks , when both men and wagons would at once become an easy prey . But most of the party were old teamsters and hunters , well versed in Indian strategy , and did not suffer themselves to be at all disconcerted by these proceedings . Moving in line , they always presented a bristling front of rifle-bores to their assailants , so that all their attempts to gain their purpose by such means proved quite ineffectual. * The Indians now essayed other expedients . Spurring furiously toward the now frightened animals , shaking their buffalo robes , hallooing loudly to each other , then suddenly rushing together in wild confusion , jabbering and gesticulating violently , as if eugaged in most exciting conversation ; then again breaking up with deafening yells , and riding furiously up and down the line , they strove to drive the frantic steeds outside the guard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty manfully , and rendered all their attempts of no avail . In this way the train advanced slowly until within eight miles of the fort , the constantly increasing numbers of the Indians rendering their situation momentarily more precarious . At length it became evident that , without speedy assistance , they must soon be overpowered , in spite of all their vigilance and untiring effort . There remained no alternative but to send to the fort for help , dangerous as the expedient was , and offering but a bare possibility of success ; for the courier had a feanful gauntlet to run through such a multitude of savages , who , at once divining his intent , would attempt to cut him off . Nevertheless , a volunteer was sin*nediately found in Tom Smith , a veteran trapper , who rode a noble mustang of the finest mettle . " I 'll risk it , " he said . " Thar 's good grit in old Lightfoot ' yet , and she 's seen red skin afore ; eh , old gal ? " and bending forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salutation she returned with a low hinney of pleasure . Then drawing up the reins , he trotted her easily a few rods ; then striking his spurs into her flanks , dashed on toward the fort with lightning speed . She was a noble beast . Many a time had she saved him from the venge anco of the savages , and now she bore him safely to the fort , distancing the few who attempted to pursue . Bent 's wagons had but just arrived as rrom came up , having experienced but little trouble from the Indians , owing , no doubt , to the presence of Yellow Bear , who proved an excellent passport to the whites whom he befriended . Bent was busy unhitchiug the teams when the intelligence was brought . Muttering an angry oath , he dropped the yoke he held in his hand , and flinging himself upon the back of " Pigeon-toe , " his favorite steed , drove his spurs to the rowels , and dashed headlong down the river , with oaths and threats of vengeance hissing on his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of his men shot out from the fort one by one , and followed desperately after their leader . The Lieutenant , too , immediately ordered out his twenty dragoons , to send them after those already on their way to the scene of action . Hundreds of Comanches , instantly divining the difficulty , raised the *var-cry from point to point , and dashed on in the headlong chase . All was excitement at the fort , and none doubted that , by this time , the scalps of the luckless teamsters were dangling from the spears of the victorious savages . Meanwhile the beleaguered party down the river were struggling bravely on their way . But the Indians perceiving that they were gradually slipping through their fingers , became more courageous . A large party now came up , and lassoed a buffalo calf which the teamsters had with them , saying , " the whites had no right to such meat ; it belonged to the Indians . " This was only a ruse to divert attention from the horses and mules ; and while it partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the teamsters , instantly recovering their self-possession , at once formed the wagons into a corral ( made by driving them together in an elliptical form , resembling a horse-shoe ) , and surrounding the loose animals , drove them into it , excepting a few which the Indians succeeded in csipluring ; then taking their position behind this hastily-constructed but most effectual barricade , they stood with their rifles to their shoulders , ready to defend themselves to the last gasp . But now a shout most fierce and loud came borne upon the wind ; then a succession of stentorian whoops and yells , more fierce than the fiercest of Indian *var-whoops , which caused them to turn suddenly in the direction of the sounds . The Indians heard it , too , and hastily drew off a little , in some degree of confusion . Glancing up the prairie , they descried the welcome form of the redoubtable Bent tearing down toward them at a furious rate , brandishing Isis rifle high over his head , and yelling loud threats of vengeance upon the audacious savages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith and Yellow Bear , streaking it over the turf , while close at their heels followed another of the subsidiaty party ; then another and another * The Indian knows full well that the trigger of a hunters rifle is seldom pulled in vain , and is exceedingly careful not to expose his body as a target to its aim , or to provoke the emptying of Its contents ; hence , a single man may often keep a host at bay , so long as his loaded rifle covers ito mark . // at short intervals  --  the long and sinuous train stretching far away in the distance to where the last of the gallant fellows brought up the rear of the impetuous force . The Indians , who seemed to regard Bent with a certain degree of awe , now fell back in a body , keeping a short distance behind . Bent was a terrible fellow when exasperated , and the Indians knew it . To them the fame of his might and deeds of daring was as wide as the prairie , and proud would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his scalp ! No doubt it was this superstitious dread of their invincible foe that forced from them such circumspection , and caused them to refrain from their attack upon the wagons ; though their odds were sufficient to have vanquished a force twenty times greater . As the old trader reined up his foaming steed , his rage could hardly find vent in words . One language would not suffice ; but in a mingled jargon of Indian , English , French , and Spanish , he poured out his wrath upon the cowardly miscreants before him , swearing great oaths , alternately shaking his fist and his rifle , and daring them to the fight ! Such was Bent when " a heap mad ; " at other times a model of equanimity and calm decorum . The whole of the relief party having now come in , with the exception of the dragoons , Bent presently gave the word to " put out . ' Once more the wagons were formed in the line of march , and the mules whipped into a brisk trot . Tom Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van ; eighteen more rode abreast behind the wagons , to guard their rear ; while the remaining horsemen galloped along side . Thus they moved on for a couple of miles , the Indians following close behind , hut not yet venturing an attack . But as they neared the fort , which now loomed up in the distance , and the chances of escape increased , they once more rallied to the onset , and forming in dense platoons , bristling with spears , came charging down upon the rear of the train with hideous yells . " Hough-ough-ough-gh-gh . " rang the deafening war-cry as they clattered over the ground-emitted in a series of prolonged yells which terminated with a whoop as abrupt as the halt they made when within fair pistol-shot of the wagons . " Come on , you sneakin ' varmints , if you 're after har ! " shouts old Bent , shaking his fist at the savages he could not see for the clouds of dust that now rose like a wall between him and them . " Come on , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game as that on this child-for he 's seen such doings afore , he has . " Then turning away with an oath , he would hurry on the wagons , and they would speedily emerge from the region of dust . Again and again did the Indians attempt to disconcert the little party by similar feints-dashing furiously upon them , as if to crush them under their horses ' feet , but always halting suddenly when within a few rods of them . At last old " Shaved-head " himself headed the onslaught . On they came , more furiously than before ; but this time they slightly overmeas*tred their distance , and so impetuous was the charge , that the chief , who rode a mettlesome but tough-bitted steed , was unable to stop until he found himself in the very midst of his foes . Quick as thought sprang Bent and Yellow Bear together , and grasped the bridle of his horse , and he was at once made prisoner . A shout from the whites greeted their success . Confounded at this sudden and unexpected misfortune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians at once became remarkably peaceable , and followed quietly behind , manifesting the greatest . anxiety and uneasiness , and heedless of Bent 's sarcastic banter , which he took no pains to spare . Bent and the Bear rode one on either side of their captive , each holding a rein in his handBent all the while shaking his fist in the Indian 's face , and venting his spleen in great oaths and abusive language ; while in marked contrast was the conduct of the dignified Yellow Bear , who cantered quietly along , saying nothing , but occasionally glancing into his captive 's face with a calm , triumphant smile , singularly expressive , though scarcely noticeable . The rascals whom Bent so woefully berated were quite beneath his notice . Not once did the Comanches attempt to retake their chief , fearing the ready knife of the angry trader , which they knew he would not hesitate to use upon him if they attempted violence , as he had taken special pains to inform them . Thus , holding the key which kept securely locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way to the fort . Modern policemen are said to be always on hand when the danger is over . In like manner , the train had arrived within two miles of its destination , when ominous sounds attracted their attention , and they beheld the dragoons clattering over the prairie , on their way to render them the desired assistance-full two hours having elapsed since the first intimation of peril was received by the garrison ! As they came up formed in regular military order , with their full panoplyofjingling sabres , rattling trappings , and showy uniform , they really looked as though they might have done good service for Uncle Sam-always taking it for granted that they were not two hours behind time . But in the present instance they might as well have remained in their barracks , and left the teamsters to be massacred , as would have unquestionably been the case but for Bent 's timely arrival . The only cause assigned for such unwarrantable delay was , that but nineteen horses could be procured-one having been disabled the previous night . Their military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complement of men , and therefore they were forced to wait until they could send out and purchase an animal from the Indians . They seemed quite surprised to find all the men safe and arrived so soon , and-it may be well to addheartily // congratulated them upon theirfortanate escape . So much for military tactics . Absurdly ridiculous as the foregoing may appear , it is but one of a thousand similar cases which might be cited , explaining satisfactorily the causes of numerous failures and disasters apparently unaccountable to those unacquainted with the circumstances that occasioned them . It is an axiom which must sooner or later become perfectly lucid in the eyes of Congress , that methodical tactics , and armies of regulars ever so large , may frighten , but never subdue Indians . Put an experienced old " mouutain-man , " like Kit Carson or Bill Bent , at the head of thirty others like him , , and they will accomplish more than a regiment of troops-especially in those cases where ambuscades and the wiles and cunning of the Indian are to be combated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Indians will never meet an enemy in open fight except with tremendous odds in their favor . Nowadays they are almost invariably mounted when on the war-trail or a thieving expedition . Of course infantry can do nothing , and are next to useless . If too numerous , the Indians will take good care to keep out of rifle-range ; if too few , their fate is certain . Mounted men alone can effect any thing . Dragoons are better than infantry . If they can not conquer their foe , they can at least escape by running away . But of what possible use can even dragoons be if all their movements are to be regulated by such tactical machinery as requires them to move and act with an automatic precision which , in nine cases out often , prevents them from taking advantage of auspicious circumstances to strike an effective blow ; allows the enemy to slip through their fingers unscathed ; or , forsooth , permits a massacre of their own countrymen almost within hail of their voices ? The United States furnishes her cavalry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know their business , and competent officers to command , could soon run the Indians out of the country , or punish them into good behavior and a proper regard for human life and the laws of meum and teem . Let the Ranger system , then , be adopted in place of the old discipline-a system in which each man , acting in concert with his fellow , yet fights on his own hook ; a system which would not prevent nineteen men from saving a massacre because a twentieth could not aid in the action-and government has found the true remedy for one of her greatest ills . Iv . For two days succeeding Bent 's arrival at the fort the Indians remained remarkably quiet , and s*iowed no signs of hostility . But still the delinquent agent came not to relieve the Indians of their suspicions , or the whites of their anxiety , and affairs once more grew dark and ominous . King 's party still remained within the fort , but Bent had camped a quarter of a mile up the river , partly for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " put out " in a day or two , being in haste to reach St. Vram 's , his destination . Knowing that he had goods to dispose of , the Indians were anxious to trade , and continually came into camp . At first they behaved with propriety , but soon became insolent and troublesome . Small parties were observed moving stealthily about , and Bent 's suspicions were fully aroused . During the morning , signals were frequently interchanged between parties stationed on the neighboring eminence , and thin spiral columns of smoke curled upward from various points . All these ominous signs were duly noted . At length it was perceived that among the crowd that thronged the camp were many with their faces blackened , an indication that their intentions were by no means peaceable , which was evident enough from their insolent bearing and abusive language . Large parties were continually arriving upon the ground , all with faces blackened , and kept up a most hideous din , yelling and shouting , and rattling their spears against their shields , and galloping hither and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but so dense as to conceal from view those not in the immediate vicinity , so that it was quite impossible to judge of their numbers . Several of the chiefs now came up , and demanded something " on the prairie " ( free gift ) , and even attempted to seize sundry blankets and loose articles lying about . This last act of impudence was too much for the old trader 's equanimity , and he fumed and swore desperately . He fully comprehended the danger of his situation , knowing , well enough that the least concessions on his part would only make the Indians bolder , instead of pacifying them or inducing them to leave the camp . In reply , therefore , to their importunate demands , he told them distinctly that he would see them in a much warmer climate before he would give them a thing . The Indians , incensed at his obstinate refusal , pronounced him " wah keitcha " ( bad medicine ) , murmured because he did not freely " open his hand , " and ceased a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers . Petty annoyances soon grew into open assaults , and t*iee did a daring brave attempt to snatch the very trinkets from Bent 's hand , deterred only by the ever ready pistol , which was each time intruded between his eyes . Matters had now so nearly approached a crisis that it became evident that help must be obtained from the fort ; but this seemed utterly impossible , as the least attempt in that direction would be immediately intercepted by their wary foes , who were now momentarily becoming more determined and excited . What , then , could be done ? Matters could not continue long as they were , for already were the Indians heard conversing in their own language , and inciting each other to strike the first blow . At the same time they were vigorously plying the old trader to give them presents . Meanwhile Bent 's old favorite , Yellow Bear , // sat upon his blanket near one of the wagons , quietly playing with his knife , thrusting it into the ground , or spearing the little hummocks of grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , in reality , listening most attentively to all that was said . He knew the peril of his friend , and was prepared to aid him to the best of his ability ; but he had not yet observed such indications of immediate danger as would warrant the risk of conveying intelligence to the fort . But now a sound , low and ominous , like the distant sighing of the wind presaging a storm , was heard passing from group to group of the assembled braves . Commencing at first with those most remote , it came gradually nearer and nearer , as each grim warrior took up the warning note ; and , like a pestilential infection , soon seized those around and in the camp . They , too , joined in the dread precurse . All else was painfully still-no shouting , no clash of arms , nought but the neverceasing , doleful murmur that thrilled the hearts of those who knew its dread import . The Bear now quietly rose , and , without deigning a word or look to either friend or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly from the camp . So noiseless and unaffected was his departure that but few noticed him , and these gave him only a passing glance , allowing him to pass on unheeded . ButBent 's eye , ever-watchful , twinkled brightly for an instant , and the anxious expression of his face was succeeded by a momentary flush of pleasure , for lze knew why the Bear had so suddenly left him . But now the murmur , at first so faintly heard , gradually increased in volume and in tone , and a doleful , measured chant succeeded . The sea of red-skinned warriors surged heavily to and fro , while the snorting of their mettled steeds , and the dull , leaden tramp of hoofs upon the yielding turf mingled with the sound . On every side , far and near , the monotonous " hi-ya , hi-ya , hi-ya , hi-ya ! " kept up its unceasing cadence . It was the ar-song of the Comanches ! Louder it grew every moment , and more threatening , swellin , like the voice of the rising storm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one last resort which could save his scalp and hold the Indians in check until the Bear returned with hdp . He had a keg of sugar in his wagon . Obtaining this , and knocking out its head with a single blow , he stepped upon a box beside him , and notified the chiefs that he wished to have a " talk , " at the same time directing their attention to the saccharine consoler at his side . Instantly the chiefs and headmen of the braves gathered aaound him ; and while he talked to them in " honeyed accents , " with an iron spoon he titillated their palates with the sugar , doling out a spoonful to each of the big-mouthed savages as they came up in turn , with jaws agape , like yearling infants , anxious to be fed . In this way , soothing and sweetening , talking continually , but sparing not the sugar , he eked out a long half hour ; still no help came . But while his hopes and the sugar rapidly grew less , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war-song had once more given place to a fullmeasured chant , a mounted Comanche darted suddenly out of the dim pall of dust , and came dashing into the midst of the throng , with the news that the troops and teamsters were coming up from the fort , and were close at hand . Indeed , the quick tramp of their horses ' feet could now be distinctly heard . The intelligence spread like wild-fire . The chanting suddenly ceased , and in a moment , with one piercing , parting yell , every Indian had " vamosed the ranche . " Thus was the camp again saved from the rankling vengeance of the savages . But the end was not yet , though the Comanches desisted from further hostilities during the remainder of the day . Night came on , and all was quiet within and without the fort . The guards were going their unceasing rounds , and their tramp alone was heard above the sighing of the *vinds ; for the wind blew fitfully , and the clouds were lowering , portentous of a storm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians prate not of their vicinage , even though thousands were prowling about in the gloom . Fitzwilhiam slept uneasily , and , like a weasel , with one eye open . As he lay stretched upon his mattress on the bottom of one of the Wagons , in a state of semi-consciousness , he was startled by the sound of stealthful footsteps at his side ; and presently a hand carefully drew aside the Osnaburg covering , a head was thrust warily in , and a tremulous voice whispered : " For God 's sake , Fitz , give us a gun ! We are gone beaver , ' sure  --  the whole'of us ! The Indians are inside the fort ! " " Nonsense , man ; that 's all in your eye , I reckon , " replied Fitzwilliam , quickly raising himself up , and handing a rifle to his companion , while he himself seized another , and thrust himself , feet foremost , out of the end of the wagon . " Show us your Injuns ! Where 's the guard ? " " Ilumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ai n't asleep , I should like to know . What else could you expect of such Greeks as them ? " " Well , where 's the red-skins ? Did you see *em inside , yourself ? " " No ; but they 're scaling the walls . Did n't I see a dozen tarred heads pop down the moment I showed my face ? I heard the varmints , too , afore I jumped up from my bunk . " While they were yet speaking sounds were distinctly heard at the other side of the fort , and presently the whole place was aroused . All was commotion . Men and women , soldiers and teamsters , all were rushing hither and thither , anxiously seeking the cause of the disturbance . Startled so suddenly from their slumbers as they were , their fears amounted almost to a panic . The drums beat to arms , // and the garrison was finally mustered ; but when noses were counted four of the soldiers were missing . Here was fresh cause for alarm . " Wiped out , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , you maybe sure the Injuns have fixed their flints for em , " rejoined the soldiers . " They are all murdered ! " chimed in the women , feeling their own heads mechanically to test the safety of their scalps . " They are murdered  --  the soldiers are killed ! But where are the Indians ? " " Sure enough , " replied some of the men , roused from a fit of abstraction , " where are the Injuns ? " But no Indians were to be found or seen . That they had been prowling about , however , was but too certain ; for they could be distinctly heard , as they galloped over the prairie , in the distance . A confused noise and loud sounds of voices were now heard in the direction of Bent 's camp , and it was evident that they , too , had been aroused from some cause as yet inexplicable . There was a mystery about the whole affair that baffled explanation . None doubted at first that the soldiers had been murdered ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters with the rest of the garrison was considered , this seemed impossible . Other reasons were therefore assigned for their absence . At length all became quiet again in the fort , and the inmates gradually recovered from their alarm . The garrison , however , was kept under arms the rest of the night . At length morning came , and brought welcome light to their eyes and joy to their hearts . The mystery was soon cleared up , though it brought a shudder to all , when they learned the danger they had so providentially escaped . A concerted plot had been laid by the Indians to attack the fort and Bent 's camp at the same time , and by a well-directed coup de main totally annihilate the whites to a man . They had been foiled , however , when just upon the point of carrying it into execution , by the camp 's being alarmed , together with the movements of the four soldiers , who , it appeared , had deserted , and while in the act of leaning the walls frightened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped a massacre ! From the disclosures afterward made it was learned that the question of desertion had been agitated by many of the soldiers for several days . They had become terribly alarmed , and saw not the slightest chance of eventual escape . They chose to run all risks rather than remain longer within the fort . More would undoubtedly have deserted had not their courage failed . Of those that escaped one made his way to Salt Lake , and the others to the States ; and these were they who brought the intelligence , which was very generally believed , that Fort Atkinson had been taken by the Indians and the garrison massacred . They alone had escaped to tell the tale ! Nothing of importance occurred that day until toward noon , when the whites observed a great commotion among the Indians . In the distance far up the river , and away to the right , the thin yellowish clouds of dust , which ever lingered above the Indian camp , and served to mark its site , now began to roll up in dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiftly it spread over the adjacent plain , rising here and there at irregular intervals , as if stirred by miniature whirlwinds , and speeding onward , borne on the wings of a tempest , until it covered the fort , and cast a vail over the sun , through which he looked with a dull red glare . Meanwhile all the hangers-on around the fort-every Indian in the neighborhood-had hastily gathered up their trappings and whatever movables they had , and galloped away up the river toward the " big village " with all possible speed . From time to time some half a dozen of the , stragglers , far down the river beyond the fort , came dashing swiftly past , all intent upon reaching the goal beyond . Anon , a single horseman , with spear bristling at his side , his body inclining forward , his hair and horse 's mane and tail streaming in the wind , would suddenly emerge from the dim cloud below , and flying swiftly past , visible for a moment only , as suddenly disappear in the thick pall beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession , while , betimes , great dogs and little curs , gaunt and starveling , individually and in packs , barking and yelping , ran streaking it after their flying masters . Thus , for the space of half an hour , a continuous phantasmagoria of Indian , dog , and horse was all that greeted the eyes of the astonished soldiers at the fort . Speculation speculated in vain to divine the cause of so sudden and unaccountable a movement . The whole vicinity was silent and deserted-not an Indian remained . Most potent must have been the influence that could have dispersed so great an army , and suspended siege operations in so short a time ! While they yet wondered , and in vain endeavored to solve the mystery , one of Bent 's men came in with the intelligence that the Comanches were breaking up camp ! This was news , joyful as unexpected , and brought relief to every mind . Instantly all who were not on duty set out for the village to witness so rare and interesting a spectacle ; and , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place . Every thing was in motion , and the greatest bustle and confusion prevailed . On all sides squaws were diligently removing their blankets , pots , and other utensils from the lodges , preparatory to taking them down . The men were busy with the horses-some hurriedly adjusting their bridles and saddle-blankets , while others secured and drove in the loose animals . Nude and semi-nude children wandered hither and thither-useful as other children in their place , but always out of place  --  and receiving constant reminders from the women , which sent them yelling and sprawling over the ground in // every direction . Papooses aqualung , dogs yelping , horses neighing , women scolding , men swearing and shouting , the tramp of hoofs and rush of feet , the clash of iron and ring of steel , added to the excitement of the scene , and afforded rich harmony to those who had no ear for music . At length all was ready for striking the lodges , and , at a given signal , down , with a crash and a squelch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinkling of an eye every one was flat . Where hut an instant before one thousand wigwams dotted the plum , now all was level as a floor . Now , with renewed activity , all set to work stripping off the hides and buffalo robes from the lodge-poles . The working horses were led up , ready to be harnessed into the trav*es . Lashing the poles of the lodges half of them on each side of a horse , with their ends trailing on the ground some fifteen feet behind , transversal bars were strapped upon them . Upon this frame-work the skins were secured so as to form a hammock-like bag , but raised so as not to strike the ground . These were the " trav*es "  --  a unique arrangement , by which the portable lodges were most conveniently carried , and at the same time converted into traveling-carriages for the party . Into these the squaws , papooses , children , small dogs , pots and kettles , were very expeditiously and unceremoniously tumbled together - the word was given , and away they started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diogenes , that stolid old stoic , split his sides for laughter . Away went the whole promiscuous posse , pellmell , helter-skelter , at full speed toward the river , stirring the dust into blinding and suffocating clouds , and creating such a din as made " confusion worse confounded . " The lash of countless whips mingled with the cries and yells of the drivers , as they urged on the sluggish and overworked pack-horses ; the clash of ringing metal ; the blended voices of women , dogs , and children ; and the incessant and grating crunch , crunch of the lodge-pole travies , as they jerked along with the rapid movement of the horsesall added strange dlscordance and excitement to a scene which already beggared description . Horses and mules were continually breaking from the guard , and the guard as continually running after them and bringing them in . From time to time , as they passed over uneven ground , the springy poles of the trav6es would send their heterogeneousburdens of animate and inanimate nondescripts up in the air with a bound , halfthrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but again and again , until a series of successive jolts and jars had deranged their original position beyond all recovery . Sometimes , froni lack of being properly secured , the horses would break from the trav6es , and at once leave their burdens behind them in a state of passive non sequitur ; or the fastenings of one side only would break , letting the whole concern fall to the ground , dragging by the other poles . This would frighten the horse , and off he would dash , with a succession of jumps and kicks , never failing , in the end , to extricate himself from the annoying apparatus dangling at his heels . Then followed a series of evolutions truly amusingfun , indeed , to all outsiders ; not pleasant otherwise . As squaws and brats , dogs and kettles , and all the contents of the trav6e went bouncing violently along together , in ridiculous confusion , threatening every moment to be thrown to the ground , the squaws clutched desperately at the poles , clinging to them with one hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while heroically retained their places ; but the rest of the furniture was jostled over the side , piece by piece-here a dog , and there a pot , blankets , trinkets , and what not , went flying out , one by one , strewing the ground for rods behind . At length the squaws themselves , by an extra kick and plunge of the horse , were fairly somerseted , and thrown into the dirt together , while the frightened animal , now relieved of his burden , went careering wildly on , until a lasso dexterously thrown by the nearest Indian brought him to a sudden stop . Then the strewn contents of the primitive vehicle were hastily gathered up , the travie readjusted , and the delayed family followed on at the tail of the posse . In this way the retreating Comanches proceeded until they reached the ford of the Arkansas . Then commenced a scene even more exciting than any before . With whip and spur and fiercest yells the frightened steeds were urged into the rushing wave , and went plunging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the muddy bed of the river into a caldrou of boiling chocolate , which went seething , and foaming , and whirling , and rippling for a quarter ef a mile below . Breastdeep was the water , yet easily crossed by the horsemen . With the trav*es the task was great er , and not without its perils ; for though these floated buoyantly upon the surface , yet they were liable to disaster from the swiftness of the tide . Being secured only at one end , they were easily swept around , and acting as a powerful lever , carried the struggling beasts with them , frequently taking them off their feet , and pl*nging them beneath the waves . This would , of course , upset the trav*e , and its contents would suddenly vanish from sight  --  the pots and similar utensils to rise no more , but the squaws to instantly reappear , clutching desperately their almost amphibious progeny , and striving to gain a footing on the bottom . Still grasping the lodge-poles , they would finally find their way across without assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bath . In this way the fording was accomplished at last . It was noon when they commenced to cross , and it was not until six o'clock that the last horse was over . In six hours ten thousand men , women , and children , with their horses , were safely landed on the opposite side . Now whipping up their steeds once more , the hindmost warriors galloped rapidly after the advance , amidst a tre // qwq to play the intelligent showman to poor , ignorant
