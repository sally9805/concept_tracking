Proudly does she stretch her long coast , indented with fine harbors , easterly into the broad ocean , and westerly into the very mouth of the Gulf of Mexico , as if intended by Nature to be the motherly protector of the Caribbees and of an immense extent of continental coast . The island is also extraordinarily rich in soil , and very equable and generally salubrious in climate , the sea-breeze springing up in the forenoon with great punctuality as soon as the freshness of the morning has departed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar rays . Months may elapse without a sprinkling of rain ; and yet there is an elasticity of atmosphere equal to that // of our October , while the heat can not be surpassed by the dog-days of our August . We may have been accustomed to regard the rainy season as most intolerably gloomy . But not so . It is very commonly spoken of as even pleasanter than the winter or dry season ; for though there is daily and very copious rain , it seldom continues more than an hour at a time , and though the soil of the island forms a soft mud , often a foot or two deep , yet the air is invigorating and vegetation most luxuriant . The three kinds of soil the black , the red , and the mulatto - are all of surpassing richness , and may all be seen by the traveller on the line of the railroads , and they have almost the softness of flour as tested by the thumb and finger . The red soil is as red as brick-dust , and at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fertile . But he can not fail to see the growth of palm , plantain , oranges , coffee , and cane which it nourishes , and he is provokingly convinced of its impalpable fineness by the way in which it penetrates even glossy starched linen and the pores of his flesh , and by finding himself completely reddened from head to foot , beyond easy relief by soap or scrubbing-brush . We quite laughed at the idea that we should redden our washing-water and our towels by it for many days after returning to our Havana lodgings ; but we found it even so . The soil , though thus fine , is not claycy ; but the black has all the appearance of an exceedingly rich loam , as have the red and mulatto also , except in point of color . It readily crumbles under the hoe , yet retains the moisture well , and is often of almost immeasurable depth . One may travel for miles over the extensive savannas , and not meet with a stone ; and then , on ascending a hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often as large and angular as paving-blocks of granite . We ascended to the summit of one such hill , perhaps a thousand feet above the surrounding plains , and feasted our eyes with a view that was perfectly enchanting . The principal features of the landscape were the cane-fields , often of hundreds of contiguous acres , the palm-trees , occasional lofty ceibas , the tall white chimneys of the sugar-houses , and the residences of the planters surrounded by the barracoons of the negroes. // And though the palms sometimes weary the eye with their identity of form , so strikingly contrasting with the infinite variety of our noble elms , yet they have a cleanness , luxuriance , and stateliness which can not be surpassed ; and the ceiba or cotton-tree rises to a height of a hundred feet or more , and then sends forth its horizontal branches covered with foliage and peculiarly fitted to shelter the earth from the parching rays of the tropical sun . Travellers have said that there is no more beautiful scenery on the island than in the neighborhood of Matanzas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most scrutinizing lovers of nature . The ride upon the Cumbre , a high ridge of land that lies between the city and the ocean , commanding a view of both , as also of the valley of the Yumuri and of the high mountain ranges that stretch back into the interior , affords to the stranger almost all varieties of scenery in the space of a few hours . It was in this lovely vicinity , on a plantation belonging to an American , that takes the name of Cumbre from its locality , that our late Vice-President sojourned while in Cuba , and it was there that he took the oath of office . The valley of the Yumuri is so surrounded by abrupt hills , that it is difficult to gain access to it except along the banks of its river . But the river is very beautiful , and the deep gorge in the rocks through which it passes as it emerges from the valley is wonderfully grand , in some parts scarcely wide enough to admit of a carriage-way beside the stream , and solemnly darkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct impression of society in Cuba without some description of the style of building in the cities and the character of the streets . Havana , the capital of Cuba , contains about one hundred and thirty-five thousand inhabitants , and with its suburbs not less than two hundred thousand . Its appearance is that of an Oriental city . As in the great emporiums of the East , the buildings are chiefly of stone and stucco , and the streets narrow , in order that they may be kept well shaded , - often so narrow that no room whatever is appropriated for sidewalks . Where sid*walks are constructed , they are of stone , sometimes but one foot and rarely three feet wide , while the carriage-way is a conglomeration // of limestone and cement very white and dazzling , and ground on the surface into a fine dust , exceedingly irritating to the eyes and gritty to the mouth . To prevent these annoyances , many of the principal streets are in the process of being paved with New England granite , which is imported at considerable expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the hills of the country , - generally of one , not uncommonly of two , but rarely of three stories . The principal rooms are often from fifteen to eighteen feet high . The windows are generally without glass , those on the ground floor being covered with a heavy iron grating to keep out intruders . It is hard to rid one 's self of the impression that he is in a city of jails , though the convicts certainly look remarkably well-dressed and happy . In the evening everybody within doors seems exposed to passers-by . It is said the ladies regard it as a compliment to be looked at , so that strangers and stragglers may stare as much as they please without incurring the charge of impudence or verdancy . The large double doors to the main entrance of the Havana dwelling admits the volante , horse and all , or , what is rarely used , the carriage and pair . The vehicles are kept just within the entrance when not in use , and the horses , it may chance , under some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so clean that the custom is no nuisance . What strikes one strangely in Havana is , that there is no Beacon Street or Fifth Avenue , no aristocratic row . A most palace-like house will be found opposite or adjoining a mean and filthy hut , and indeed it is customary for a rich man to buy out his neighbor 's right to build a second story , in order to have the more " extensive** view and the purer air . Women wear veils , but no bonnets , and those of the higher classes are rarely seen on the streets , except in volantes or other carriages . The population may be divided into several classes , the Spaniards , the Creoles , the free-colored , the slaves , and the foreigners . Of these , the natives of old Spain are the most aristocratic , holding all important offices of government , often possessing titles of nobility , and including in their number the most wealthy of the merchants and planters . They regard the Cre // 113 oles , though entirely of Spanish extraction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingle with them and employ them in business , they have very little social affinity with them . There is , however , no such thing in Cuba as a rank high enough to cut one off from attendance upon the bull-fights and cock-fights , or from participation in the lottery or even in the slave-trade . On all the railroads there are three classes of cars , in which the prices are nearly in the proportion of one , two , and three . The first class are rarely occupied except by the Castilians and foreigners , - not often by the latter , unless they are ignorant of the customs of the country . The Yankee , of course , thinks that he must ride in the first-class car , that is , ' must do as he would at home ; but respectability requires it no more in Cuba than in England , and his spirit of economy and his republican sentiments will chime in together to make him better contented even with the hard benches and rickety cars of the second or third class . These being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the olfactories , as with us , unless he sits to the leeward of fumigations of strong tobacco . Foreigners , judging from the obvious and public vices of the Cubans , are apt to paint their character in dark colors . According to the statistics of crime in the city of Havana for 1853 , two thousand seveii hundred and nine persons were imprisoned , of whom seventy-seven were convicted of murder , four hundred and seventy-nine of wounding with dangerous weapons , forty-five of rape , twenty-seven of abduction , two hundred and twenty-one of robbery , and seven hundred and ninety of minor offences . There were during the same year one hundred and sixty-three suicides. * The gambling propensity which is universally indulged must occasion some recklessness in other respects . The billiard-rooms and the cockpits , which are found everywhere , are of course accompanied by their correlatives , - dram-shops and still darker dens of depravity . In Cuba , but perhaps no more than elsewhere , these are places of intense attraction for the viciously disposed of * In Boston , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were committed , during the year 1853 , on the charge of murder , eight ; of rape , three ; of robbery , sixteen ; and there were fifteen cases of suicide . 10 // all classes , not excepting those whose means and education would procure for them the highest , purest , and most delightful employment . The women of all conditions engage in the lottery almost as freely as the men , and those of the middle and lower classes are addicted to smoking . We now recall with disagreeable vividness the remembrance of a white woman who smoked incessantly on the railway , in company with a colored man . In what relation the latter stood to her , we could not certify . It might have been the nearest ; for though the amalgamation of the races is forbidden by law , it is often practised under a pretence , on the white side , of a slight mixture of negro blood . Bat the ease with which the woman whiffed the cigar-smoke , the carelessness of habit with which she fingered off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusting . Yet she was doubtless one of the low-bred , in a country where there is a vast distinction between high and low breeding . Well is it that with us the use of tobacco by the gentler sex is confined to the old crone with her pipe in the chimney-corner . The boldness of young ladies in Cuba is a matter of common remark with all strangers . Very beautiful they are , if you will exclude from your definition of beauty the expression of intellect and animation ; and they have that comfortable consciousness of beauty , which courts admiration without repelling by haughtiness . It is certainly extraordinary , that with steady eye and unblushing cheek they can expose themselves , while riding on the paseo or sitting by their open windows , to the bold and free gaze of the young men . This boldness may be attributable to habit . But if it does not grow out of character , some peculiarities of character may arise from it . It does not strike a foreigner agreeably , whatever satisfaction he , from a fresh curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , concludes that the resources of the young people are of a frivolous character . One writer says , and we suppose with much truth - " The daily life of a Cuban lady is monotonous in the extreme . It is utterly devoid of intelligent exercise of mind or body , and , as a natural consequence , both deteriorate sadly . A host of nervous diseases attest the truth of this . Early rising is a virtue common to all ranks ; // but the manner in which they contrive to kill time without reading , household occupations , or , in fact , any employment , except , perhaps , a little embroidery , is indeed a mystery . " - Cuba and the Cubans , p. 147 . The indolence of women which unavoidably accompanies the system of slavery is doubtless unfavorable to morality , and there is a strict surveillance exercised over the Cuban women which quickens one 's suspicions almost into conviction . Either because of prudishness , or from sad experience , society threatens the good reputation of a lady who ventures to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobility there is said to be oftentimes a reckless extravagance altogether disproportioned to their means . Rank demands that all the display of a grand establishment shall be sustained , no matter in how ruinous a condition the fortune may be . " The full payment of debts is avoided by assembling the creditors ( some of whom are of the family or fictitious ) , and agreeing upon yearly instalments by a vote of the majority , while the extravagant living of the family is regarded as necessary expenditure . The poor creditor is forced into compliance , and must take all his satisfaction in seeing the renewed extravagance of the marquis 's or count 's family , and the successful applications of numerous poor relatives and dependants . " - Cuba and the Cubans , p. 140 . The native of Old Spain , from the high-titled count to the meanest soldier , feels a superiority over the Creole and treats him with contempt , though he would meet a foreigner with marked civility . The native of Cuba is rarely admitted to any office , civil , ecclesiastical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred those who are sent froni the mother country to rule over him and enrich themselves by his gains . He often becomes wealthy on the plantation or in the counting-room ; but all his property is at the mercy of those who have few interests in common with him , and with whom cruelty seems to be a natural characteristic . The Creole 's hatred of the Castilians , and consequently of the government to which he feels constrained to submit , is nourished from early childhood , and he is constantly reminded of his inferiority , or his supposed inferiority , to the very end of his days . That the government fears this Class of the popula // tion there can be no doubt , and yet it has wonderfully succeeded in keeping them ignorant , cowering , and pusillanimous . To retain the masses in ignorance is the policy of a despotic government as well as of the Romish Church , and Spain has always looked with jealousy upon any attempt to enlighten the lower classes . Where they have been instructed , it has been by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to increase political power , - ends to be desired where the people are their own rulers , but much hazarding public peace where the people are to be kept under by arbitrary force . Cuba can never make all its resources known , till its agriculture and commerce are under the control of an enlightened and energetic , because free , people . An interesting portion of the inhabitants of Cuba , to us of these United States who have an eye towards that island in anticipation of its annexation , is the colored population . According to the census of 1846 , upwards of four hundred and seventy thousand were blacks and mulattoes , about one third of whom were free ; while the whole number of whites was four hundred and twenty-five thousand . The number of free blacks is surprising , and must be attributable to some cause which does not operate in our Southern States . The truth is , that the blacks become free by their own efforts , favored by the laws of the country . The master is compelled to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such amount as he may have paid towards his liberty , provided that payment reach the sum of one hundred dollars ; and he must also let him have all his time , if he wishes it , at the rate of a rial or twelve and a half cents per day for each hundred dollars of the balance of his value remaining unpaid . It is rare for the slaves on plantations to purchase their freedom , though common field hands are hired at the rate of from twenty-three to twenty-five dollars per month besides their food and clothing . The slaves in the city , who work upon the wharves , or in the streets and market-places , have much better opportunities of liberating themselves . One means of emancipation , oftener of course unfortunate than successful , is the lottery . Instances have occurred , however , of slaves suddenly coming to wealth by this means , and these rare // cases are the only argument we ever heard in defence of the morality of the lottery system. * The laws permit slaves who belong to different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sell , so that the parties can live together . Yet , as elsewhere where slavery exists , there is little regard for the marriage vows , and so severely are slaves overworked , and so little cared for are they by their masters , that the loss by death exceeds the natural increase . A sugar plantation during the dry season ( at which time only can sugar be manufactured ) presents a busy scene . The cane in the fields often far exceeds what the mills can possibly grind , if it be not more than can be cut and carted by all the hands the planter can spare or procure for the purpose ; and then it is that every contraction of the negro 's muscles affords additional clear profit to the master , and every moment cut from the hours of sleep or meals is so much gain . Then it is that every crack of the mayoral 's whip , driving the negro up to the extent of his ability , is counted as a piece of gold . And the poor menial works all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast and supper as best he can , in the sugar-house or the field ; and as if that were not enough for flesh and blood , he must labor half the night also . The steam must be kept up , and the mills must continue in operation , incessantly , till some lucky day when the boilers need cleansing or the engine must be repaired ; and only then does the slave have a respite from his sixteen or seventeen hours of daily work . Many years ago , before the introduction of the steam-engine , the annual loss by death was said to be fully ten per cent . No doubt it is much less now ; but a comparison of the census taken in the years 1841 and 1846 will show that it is still very great , especially when we consider that the annual importation of blacks from Africa is estimated at about * The only lottery allowed on the island is public property , - the profits going towards the support of the government or the emolument of its officers . Its highest prize is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five dollars , and divided into halves and quarters , are distributed all over the island , offered at the corners of the streets , in the public houses , and along the line of the railroads , and often thrust in one 's face as our daily papers are . Many are also pui7chased by shipmasters and others for inhabitants of the United States . // two thousand . In 1817 there were 225,131 slaves ; in 1827 , 286,942 ; in 1841 , 436,495 ; in 1846 , 323,779 . The rate of increase during the first ten years was 27 per cent. ; during the next fourteen years , 52 per cent. ; but during the five years frm 1841 to 1846 , there was a decrease of 26 per cent . The constant increase of slaves up to some period between the years 1827 and 1841 , and their subsequent decrease , strikingly show the efficiency of the measures that have been taken by the European powers and the United States for the suppression of the slave-trade , while at the same time the mortality among this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philanthropist . Although the slaves during the grinding season are allowed not more than five or six hours ' sleep out of the twenty-four , and although the statistics of mortality tell a sad story , that ought to be heeded by the master ; yet at the end of the season they appear so healthy and strong , that one can hardly believe that they have accomplished any extraordinary amount of labor . It is not very uncommon for the negroes to escape to the woods , and lead a wild life , in preference to the hard work and harsh treatment of the plantations . Dr. Abbot gives an account of one belonging to an estate of a friend of his , who for some serious offence had been trammelled with irons . " He watched his opportunity , and escaped into the woods , and though soon pursued , he had rid himself of his clanking chains , by which he might be traced . With lime-juice and his hatchet he had sawed off his irons ; and one piece , too large to yield suddenly to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some gentlemen , some time after , who were in pursuit of other negroes , came by surprise on this man . He was hunting a hutia , a kind of tree woodchuck , and so intense in his watch of the animal on the tree , that he easily fell into the hands of the hunters , who restored him to his master . " - Abbot 's Letters from Cuba , pp. 58 , 59 . Many of the slaves commit suicide ,  --  so many , that this is to be reckoned among the serious causes of their diminished numbers . They have a strong conviction that by death they shall return to their native country , and this they often regard as far preferable to their present life of toil . It is related that // on one estate eight were found hanging in company , in one night . In Cuba , if a slave is dissatisfied with his master because of maltreatment , he can compel the master to sell him at a valuation determined by referees ; but the slaves have no voice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The referees are selected , one by the master and the others by an officer of government , the Sindico Procurador general . There are also unenforced laws respecting the religious instruction of the slaves , and every one is reminded of these by the evening bell ( the oracion ) which rings daily on every estate to call the slaves to prayer ; but the call is in general either utterly unheeded , or observed by a mere genuflexion , or the hasty crossing of one 's self . The religious condition of a people can hardly be spoken of with fitness apart from the social life , unless , as in Cuba , religion has so much degenerated into formalism , that its real essence is not to be discovered in the common relations of man with man . Perhaps there is no country in Christendom or heathendom , where it is less understood what it is to " worship God in the beauty of holiness . " Indeed , we can not believe that there is any country where the outward ceremonies of devotion are abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service now-a-days is a brief mass , performed generally in a careless and irreverent manner , and witnessed by a very small portion of the people . In the immense cathedral at Havana , there were less than a hundred worshippers , all told , on a Sabbath on which we were present . There was no music , - no sermon , - no instruction of any kind ; for the mutterings of the priest must have been quite unintelligible , even to those who were well acquainted with the language in which they were uttered . On one occasion , we found the Church of the Holy Spirit crowded . It was a military mass , and the chief attractions might have been of a martial character ; for with a full band , and in perfect military order , the soldiers marched to and from the church . Instead of chants or anthems was heard the real music of the opera , from a large and well-appointed orchestra . The ceremonies of the priest were utterly disregarded by the soldiery , except , // perhaps , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross themselves . They are , indeed , little else than automatons at any time , and the universal wooden face presents a striking contrast to the intelligent expression of the energetic , ingenious , and independent Yankee militiaman . Leaving the church more demure than devout , they were doubtless ready to engage in military tactics just as demurely and as devoutly . The rest of the congregation was of all classes , colors , and styles of dress ; and though much has been said , and with much justice , of the impartial character of the Romish service , admitting the poor to an equality of privilege with the rich , yet it was evident that there were higher and lower seats , and the corresponding sentiments of precedence and inferiority . Very showily dressed ladies were seated on very rich mats or chairs ; their servants behind or near them , kneeling or prostrating themselves upon the bare floor of marble or cement . When the ladies arose to depart , the servants arose also , and carried out their seats . Both priest and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bull-fight or cock-pit . The priests enjoy large livings , are often extravagant in their habits , and generally indulge in luxuries and vices . Their vow of chastity is perpetually broken . They not only visit the gambling-houses , but are themselves gamblers . The author of Cuba and the Cubans truly says : " They are not respected ; on the contrary , they are despised ; and as their conduct belies the dochines they have sworn to propagate , they set themselves quietly down to enjoy the bodily comforts of this life , without troubling themselves about their own or their flock 's spiritual welfare . " The Romanists in the United States are ashamed of those of their own communion in Cuba . It is said that the Church and its officials have greatly degenerated ; but Abbot wrote , as long ago as 1828 , that there was a fearless violation of one , at least , of the ecclesiastical laws . " A very singular fact in a Catholic country , holding the celibacy of the clergy as indispensable , is , that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bashful on the subject , or think it necessary to speak of their housekeeper as a sister or cousin , or of the children that play about the house as nephews and nieces . They even go further , // and will sometimes reason on the subject , and defend habits contrary to the ecclesiastical authority , upon principles of nature and common sense . Certainly an unnatural and unscriptural imposition , which is so unblushingly evaded , should not be attempted to be enforced ; but should be revoked . The fearless violation of one law of a community weakens the authority of the whole statute-book. " - Abbot 's Letters from Cuba , p. 15 . The same writer says of the habit of gambling among the priests - " Some have been known to delay mass to see the end of a cockfight , and to pit their own cock against the cock of any slave in the circle , who has an ounce or a rial to lay on his head The influence of the clergy is on the wane , and from the habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the character of its professors , and especially of its ministers , it brings Christianity , heaven-born and spotless as it is , into suspicion , and exposes it to desertion by the young and unreflecting. " - Ibid. , pp. 15 , 16 . It was then , in 1828 , confidently believed that infidelity was becoming common in the island , and certainly the present indifference even to the outward forms of religion shows that belief to have been well founded . According to law , all , whether blacks or whites , must be baptized ; but the neglect of this rite is winked at . The priests , however , occasionally visit the plantations , and baptize all those for whom the service has not previously been performed . Something may always be inferred , concerning the religious and social condition of a people , from their cemeteries and their manner of burying the dead . The Campos Santos , the only burial-ground of Matanzas , a city of more than twenty thousand inhabitants , contains , perhaps , four acres . it is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or architectural designs . So small a space is made to answer so great a purpose by constant disinterments , which often take place before the flesh is eaten from the bones ; and frequently , for lack of room , the bodies are scarcely covered with earth . Such customs must be peculiarly offensive , unhealthy , and unpardonable in a hot climate . We can give no account from personal observation of the cemetery of Havana ; but the writer of " Notes on Cuba , " published in 1844 , describes it as // " a level square , divided into four equal parts by two transverse , flagged walks . " " Each quarter was , moreover , inclosed by a low , neat iron railing , and had in one corner a receptacle for the bones disinterred in digging new graves . They were all more than filled , the pile of bleached skulls and other bones being heaped up above the top of the walls of each ; while , to soothe the friends of the deceased for the liberty thus taken with their remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having inscribed on them the comfortable assurance , Exultabunt ossa humiliata . ' About forty tall pines of the country , resembling cedars , threw a partial shade over the walks , while the ground , bare of shrubbery , was covered by a luxurious growth of grass . At the extremity of the middle walk was a small , neat chapel , containing a few fresco paintings , and a chaste altar in the form of a sarcophagus , supporting a small image of our Lord on the cross . Within and over the door and porch without , suitable inscriptions in Latin referred to the final resurrection , and the happiness of those who die the death of the righteous. " - Notes on Cuba , pp. 28 , 29 . This writer 's account of interments confirms what we have said of the cemetery at Matanzas - " At the other end of the square , two negroes were busily employed in digging new graves , breaking up the stiff clay with pickaxes , and throwing out with each spadeful of earth numerous bones , some of which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions of clothes and shoes . This cemetery contains only four or five acres , and from ten to twelve bodies being daily interred in it , this deficiency is greatly felt , and quick-lime is often thrown into the graves to hasten their decomposition , while the contents of the four charnel-houses are burnt to ashes , as soon as they become filled . " - b*d. , pp. 29 , 80 . It is almost universally the custom , to this day , to use a coffin only for the purpose of carrying the body to the grave , so that the same coffin may answer for a hundred in dividuals . Several bodies are often thrown in together , without regard to kindred , rank , or race . The burial service is said to be as cold and heartless as the Church mass . The priests have too little sympathy for the people , and too imperfectly acquire their confidence , to afford them any effective consolation . We believe justice permits no more favorable account than // we have given of the religious condition of Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1843 to 1848 , suppressed the organization of Sunday schools , " lest , through the little children , a faint glimmer of light might awaken their parents from the dark night of their ignorance and superstition . " If we may believe the reports of travellers , a great change has come over Cuba . It is said that , twenty-five years ago , one would be sure , in a respectable Cuban family , to meet with religious feelings and practices " which even to a foreigner of a different creed appeared cheering and grateful . At the hour of twilight , a church bell rung through the city would create everywhere a sudden and simultaneous excitement . It was the Angelus , ' and at its sound all persons of all classes would at once rise to say their evening prayers ; children and servants would , at its conclusion , ask a blessing from their parents or masters ; while every carriage and passenger would pause in the street , every workman would suspend his toil , and a general manifestation of religious reverence would be exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The change in these respects is doubtless owing to a corrupt political government more than to all other causes . The government takes the Church into its own charge , and appoints to its offices its own creatures . " The very members of the Chapter of the Cathedral of havana are now named at Madrid , in disregard of the canonical proposals from the board according to law . Day after day and year after year have been suffered to pass without an appointment to fill the long vacant bishopric of Havana , and thirty years have elapsed since the sacrament of Confirmation , as it is termed by the Roman Catholics , has been administered in the several districts of the diocese , which should be regularly visited once a year . " - ibid. , p. 157 . In 1589 , nearly a century after Cuba was discovered , the first Captain-General was appointed , and the government took substantially the same form which it still retains . Ever since , it has been the policy of the mother country to appoint governors , with very arbitrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that in the period of two centuries and a half there have been no less than fifty-seven chief magistrates . These men , with very few exceptions , have returned to the // July , mother country with great fortunes . This alone is a significant and discouraging fact to the poor Creole , who has no prospect of ever attaining to that or any other high office . Valdez , appointed in lS4l , is said to have been a remarkable exception to the general style of character . He was liberal towards the Cubans , and endeavored to abide faithfully by the treaties respecting the African slave-trade ; but he was not the man to suit the home government , and was soon dismissed . Having entered the palace poor , he left it no less so , making room for a man who exhibited the opposite extreme of tyranny and narrow-mindedness . This man , General O'Donnell , was in authority at the time of the negro insurrection . A little incident is related as characteristic of his family : " At the close of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baker who had supplied the entertainment , to come at 8 o'clock , A. NI . to take back the loaves not used ! The baker refused , saying that he could not sell them except as stale bread , at a very reduced price . To this she replied , that she had sent for him at so early an hour , that he might have the chance of mixing it with the fresh bread he was to send around to his customers that morning . She was engaged in all kinds of profitable undertakings , of the most obscure and common pursuits in life ; monopolies of the most repugnant character were introduced for her advantage , based on the unbounded authority of a provincial tyrant . The cleansing of the sewers , and the locality fixed for the reception of the manure and dirt of the city , were among the many sources of wealth which she did not scruple to turn to her advantage . But nothing was so fruitful to this family of dealers as the slave-trade , which , it was publicly asserted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Cuba and the Cubans , p. 4*5 . It has been well known for many years , that the CaptainGeneral has received hush-money for the slaves clandestinely imported from Africa . This must be true of Canedo , who has just returned to Spain , after an administration of only a year and a half , if in that time , as is reported , he has amassed over a million of dollars . The writer of " Cuba and the Cubans* ' says , ( on what authority we know not , ) that the amount paid to the Captain-General was formerly half an ounce of gold for every bag of charcoal ( that is , in the language of slavers , every slave brought over from Africa ) , but that it has now risen to the large sum of three doubloons . // As we were walking the streets of Matanzas , our landlord pointed out to us the governor of the city , overseeing an excavation in the side of a hill . The work was done by convicts in chains , and the profits were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were told , was known within a few years to have invested some fifty thousand dollars in the slave-trade . When reported to the Captain-General , he was arrested and imprisoned by way of form , to keep up appearances before the British government ; but he was soon released , and reinstated in office , the Captain-General having been well compensated for the shrewd operation . Some ten years ago , a Southern writer , by no means disposed to palliate the evils of slavery , or to exaggerate the slave-trade , estimated the number of slaves imported at two thousand a year . The number is probably much greater , notwithstanding the vigilance of British cruisers . While the English know that the traffic is carried on , they can not prevent it without the assistance of the local government . But , as we have already seen , the officers are interested parties , and pretend to show that the slaves are imported from Brazil . This is very absurd , as these fresh-imported slaves know nothing of the Spanish , or of any other language than their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general fact , and one planter boasted in our hearing that all his slaves , to the number of several hundred , were native Africans . They were considered superior to the degenerate Creole blacks . But there are other modes by which the officers of government fill their own coffers . The import duties are very high . An impost of four dollars per barrel is levied on Spanish flour , of eight dollars on foreign flour , if imported in Cuban or Spanish vessels , and of ten and a half if imported in foreign vessels . But the colonial tariff may best be judged of by the following summary : - On 824 articles , there is a duty of 33j per cent . " 13 " " 2to7j " 25 " " no duty . The United States as producers and Cuba as a consumer of course suffer severely by this oppressive tariff , the sole pur-11* // July , pose of which is to raise funds to support a military despotism , which the people of Cuba despise no less than we do . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own ends ; for the custom-house officers are very inadequately paid , and they combine in a perfect system of corruption , which is connived at by all the authorities . It is very well known by shipmasters and merchants , that no vessel can enter her whole cargo at the custom-house , without being subjected to extreme annoyance from the officers of the customs . But if half of the cargo is entered , and the officers are bribed with half duty for the remainder , all will go on smoothly . This fact is notorious , and is constantly proved to the people and the government by the splendid establishments that are supported in a city where living is very expensive , on salaries of from two to three hundred dollars . The fish and meat markets were monopolized by General Tacon , so that by his own report it appears that these commodities were raised at least thirty per cent . It is not very long since the trade in tobacco was monopolized . The citizen of these States , who is at liberty to travel throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyed by the Spanish passport regulations . He pays two dollars before he sails , to the Spanish Consul , - two when he arrives , for the privilege of going ashore , something more , for travelling into the interior ; and though it might appear from these exactions that his presence on the island is unwelcome , he finds that he must pay six or seven dollars for the privilege of leaving it . Salt is found in great abundance along the shore , and would pay handsomely for the labor of securing it , were it not for the immense duty upon it , of twenty-five dollars per hundredweight . It has been estimated that regular taxes to the amount of more than twenty millions of dollars are collected by the order of the Spanish government , the Captain-General , the lieutenant-governors , and the district judges of the interior . This immense revenue is for the support of the officers of government , the army of twenty thousand men , and the navy , and for remittances to the court . But besides these pecuniary oppressions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one can have in his house any company or amusements of any sort without a license . Every inhabitant must procure a license to go from the town or city of his residence . One can not be in the streets after ten o'clock in the evening without a lantern and leave of the watchmen he may meet . No one is permitted to lodge a foreigner in his house without giving information to the proper authorities . One can not remove his residence from one house to another without giving similar notice . The Cuban is constantly reminded of his degraded condition . Every palace and fortification , - every church and policeman , - the hoarse , hourly cry of the watch at night , - the soldiery guarding the gates of the city , or performing their daily tactics , - even the sweet evening music of the band upon the Plaza , - reminds him that the foot of the oppressor is upon his neck . There have been times when the government was much less rigorous than now . This was the case in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself was struggling for independence . In 1812 and in 1820 the constitution was proclaimed , the perpetual members of the municipalities were at once deprived of office , and their successors elected by the people . These changes were not without their effect upon Cuba . A goodly portion of the old Spaniards were anxious to retain constitutional forms in the island , when they were known to be losing ground in Spain . But when the old coun .. try returned to her despotic system , and Ferdinand was restored , it was more necessary than ever to establish sfringent regulations in the colonies . " In 1825 a royal order was issued establishing martial law in the island , and investing the Captain-General with thc whole extent of power which , by the royal ordinances , is granted to the governors of besieged towns unrestrictedly authorizing him to remove from the island alt persons , holding offices from government or not , whatever their occupation , rank , class , or situation in life may be , whose residence there he may believe prejudicial , or whose public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their stead faithful servants of his Majesty , who shall fully deserve his Exellency 's confidence . Also , to suspend the execution of whatever royal orders or general decrees , in all the different branches of the administration , or in // any part of them , his Excellency may think prejudicial to the royal service . " - Cuba and the Cubans , p. 55 . This power still remains vested in the Captain-General , and it is even said that the incumbent just appointed has some additional authority . If the laws are made more sfrmngent as fast as republican sentiments spread , the pent-up dissatisfaction must at length inevitably burst out in all the volcanic fury of a revolution . The Cubans seem reduced almost to the lowest exfreme of cowardice and servility . What shall come next ? We may not interpret accurately the signs of the times ; but they indicate that some change must take place before many years . Our slave-holding States are anxious for annexation , and , independently of the slave interest , the ruling spirit of our government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the far-off islands of the Pacific to our Union . Fillibustering expeditions are continually reported to be organizing in New York and New Orleans , and are continually expected in Cuba , while to stimulate them and the Cubans themselves , the Cuban Junta , or Committee of Exiles , has issued an address , which is said to have been circulated extensively in the island , in which they attempt to show , by the collation of assumed and admitted facts , that Spain is about to take measures for surrendering Cuba to the domination of enfranchised slaves ; and that the only way in which so disasfrous a result can be prevented is by a revolution which shall wrest the island from the Spanish power , and place its government in the hands of its own people . Again , it is falsely reported , no doubt for the purpose of exciting the annexationists to more hasty action , that the English are about to Africanize Cuba by negotiations with the Spanish government , that is , to infroduce African apprentices ; the effect of which measure might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render the acquisition of the island undesirable to Southerners , while it would initiate a system hardly less oppressive than slavery . Lord Howden denies all such intention on the part of England , while he states what is almost as significant , that , as British Ambassador at Madrid , he has made unceasing representations of the number of slaves // annually imported into the island , and complaints of the almost open manner in which the traffic is carried on under the very eye of the Captain-General ; that he has been making fruitless efforts to get the Spanish government to declare the abominable traffic in men piracy ; that he has successfully sought the liberation of the Emancipados , that is , men who have been fraudulently retained in bondage since 1817 ; and that he has endeavored to procure an abrogation of that intolerant and immoral law by which foreigners settling in Cuba are obliged to change their religion , on the somewhat startling principle ( not understood elsewhere ) , that becoming bad men is a satisfactory preliminary to becoming good subjects . To all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several thousand coolies from China at work successfully in the cities and plantations as apprentices , and that the merchants are continually importing more . The merchants receive for them about one hundred and fifty dollars at the outset , and the purchaser , or rather hirer , must give them wages at the rate of four dollars per month , for eight years , after which they are at liberty to let themselves as best they may . There are great objections to this system . The apprentices will not find adequate protection from the government , and will be almost as much at the mercy of their employers as the slaves now are . But this movement must essentially modify the system of slavery , and exercise an important influence upon the destiny of the island . The new Captain-Genera has issued a decree suppressing the slave-trade , and authorizing instead thereof the introduction of free East-Indian laborers . In connection with this decree , new regulations were published respecting the Emancipados or negroes carried to Cuba by British men-of-war . It appears that neither these nor the apprentices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the island , the Emancipados , like the apprentices , will be contracted for through the intervention of government , will be under the supervision of a Board of Protection to be composed partly of the syndics and corporation of Havana , and one fourth of their wages will be discounted for the benefit of the government . It may well be questioned whether this Board of Protection will secure justice to the apprentices , especially // as appeal to it will be exceedingly difficult for those who are upon plantations at a distance from Havana . But there is at least a show of mercy in some articles of the decree , whatever may be the obstacles in the way of its operation . One article provides for a change of service in behalf of those dissatisfied with their masters . As all contracts are to be made through this benevolent board , it will doubtless take ample heed for the government 's share of the wages . Perhaps it would as appropriately be called the Board of Compulsion . Doubtlt*ss its prot6g6s will be tempted to exclaim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree as this , leaving employers and laborers at the mercy of officials , instead of securing redress of grievances by courts of justice , will be likely to result in a relation little better than that of master and slave . Whatever difference may remain between the condition of apprentice and that of the slave , will tend to produce discontent . The terms will be sufficiently advantageous to excite the ambition of the slaves , and restricted enough to fret and chafe the new immigrants , if not also the Emancipados . It is by no means certain that this discontent will end in insurrection and victory on the part of the blacks , Africanizing Cuba ; but it can hardly fail to do something towards still further unsettling the already unstable condition of the island . Among the signs that have looked toward a change in the political condition of Cuba must be mentioned the insurrectionary movements in 1841 and the two succeeding years , and the cruel means adopted by the government to suppress them , which every traveller for a century to come will hear spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fifteenth century hardly exceeded that of the officials of Cuba in 1843 . Confessions were forced by the most cruel torture , and many a negro was put to death who was perfectly innocent . It seemed to be taken for granted that all were guilty of conspiracy . It is related that one of the officers , who was prosecuting attorney , judge , and executioner at the same time , namely , Don Ramon Gonzales , ordered his victims to be taken to a room which had been white-washed , and the walls of which were literally covered with blood and // small pieces of flesh , from the wretches who had preceded them . Here stood a bloody ladder , where the accused were tied , with their heads downward , and whether free or slaves , if they would not avow what the fiscal officer insinuated , they were whipped to death by two stout mulattoes selected for this purpose . They were scourged with leathern straps , having at the end a small destructive button , made of fine wire . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks , both free and colored , or the cruelty and rapacity of the officers . The story could hardly be exaggerated . Such an arbitrary mode of suppressing an insurrection could only produce hatred and tend towards revolution . And , indeed , it is only when a government fails to command the affection and respect of the people , that it is necessary to exercise such cruelty . Even the army sent from the old country shows occasional signs of discontent , and the soldiers are kept in subordination only by constantly shifting them , regiment by regiment , from one military station to another , that no such intimacy may spring up as to enable them to combine and conspire . The case of the steamer Black Warrior , which for some years has plied between New York and Mobile , touching at Havana , has produced great sensation in the community , and has proved a good test of the disposition of our present administration regarding Cuba . Doubtless the agents of the steamer violated a revenue law of the port of Havana , in representing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board , and they should have had it entered at the custom-house as in transit . A duty is required on the cargo of all vessels entering or leaving the port , even if no goods should be landed or received there . The agent 's excuse to the authorities , that , " as far as regards Havana , she is in ballast ; she neither brings cargo to Havana nor takes it away , - it matters not whether her ballast be bales of cotton or stone , " - is a poor subterfuge . The advantage of the twelve hours allowed by law to correct a manifest was claimed ; but was refused on the ground that the clearance visit had been applied for . Probably it would have been sufficient reason for a refusal , that the privilege was intended for the correction of uninten // tional errors only . The British steamers have always submitted to precisely what was required of the Black Warrior , entering all cargoes that were in transit . On the other hand , it is asserted that the Black Warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her manifest always representing her as " in ballast " ; that the steamers of the George Law and other lines have probably entered at least three hundred times and with similar manifests ; that this fact has been well known to the authorities ; and moreover , that full cargoes have been repeatedly transferred from one of these steamers to another , under the eye of the officers of government . Indeed , we are constrained to believe that the government can not plead ignorance of such violation of its laws , since officers have always been sent on board of the steamers upon their arrival , and kept there during their stay , for the prevention of contraband trade . The laws had been violated so long and so notoriously by the American steamers with impunity , that the owners of the Black Warrior had a right to expect , as a matter of courtesy at least , that due notice would be given before enforcing them . The authorities will probably attempt to show that such notice was given . Should they fail to do so , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly deprecate any efforts to use such an incivility as an occasion for war with Spain and for the capture of Cuba . It may be construed into an acknowledgment of fault , that a messenger was sent from Havana to the Spanish legation at Washington , with an offer to pay damages to the owners of the steamship . But this may only be an indication of a disinclination on the part of the Governor-General to get into trouble with the United States . On the other hand , it may be regarded as an acknowledgment of fault on the part of the owners of the Black Warrior , that they have consented to take back the vessel after having abandoned it , and to pay , though under protest , a fine of six thousand dollars . And the acknowledgment is the more clear , if , as is stated , they have petitioned the Queen , in supplicatory terms , to remit the fine . Our government has sent a special messenger to Mr. Soul6 , its Minister at the Court of Spain , to demand immediate satis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's message to the House of Representatives on this subject , and from the fact that France and England are now engaged in the European war , and therefore can not render aid against us , there seemed ground for apprehending , on the part of our government , injustice to Spain , if not measures of open hostility . Recent despatches from Madrid are , we regret , not adapted to remove such fears . We have introduced the Black Warrior affair as having an important ; bearing on the political relations between our own country and Cuba . There are indeed many indications of an approaching change in the condition of that island ; and in what direction shall that change be ? Cuba will perhaps become independent . Yet her people will hardly be able to sustain their independence , heterogeneous as they are , and unaccustomed to bear any part in church or state . England can not hold the island without coming into perpetual conflict with our government . Besides , England has too many colonies already for her navy , immense and powerful as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island to come , sooner or later , into the possession of the United States . There is one course of action by which a revolution may be anticipated , and that is by peaceable cession . No laws of morality will allow our nation to fight for it , though she might easily wrest it from poor , weak Spain ; nor must we permit any private expeditions ; but it might be to our advantage to purchase it , and it would be greatly to the advantage of the Cubans themselves . Ah ! but there is the question of slavery . Regarding this question in the abstract , it presents a great objection . We wish to have nothing to do with the institution . But looking at things as they are , it appears not improbable , notwithstanding the expectations of our Southern fellow-citizens to the contrary , that , iii case of annexation , slaves in large numbers would be transported from the States where their labor is now unprofitable , or comparatively so , to those rich and productive sugar estates , rendered far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and diminished restrictions of trade with other countries . Thus , such States as Virginia , Kentucky , and Delaware would the more speedily become free . // In reply to this , it may be said that it would be death to the Northern slaves to be transported to a warmer climate , and to be there subjected to unceasing labor . If such is likely to be the case , then we should utterly deprecate the annexation of Cuba as a slave State . Indeed , we doubt whether any considerations whatever could justify her admission to the Union except on the basis of freedom and equality of political rights for all her inhabitants . Yet we can not but hope that , sooner or later , the island will be offered to us on such conditions as we can conscientiously accept . But why should we want Cuba ? First of all , because Cuba needs a better government , - because she would be intrinsically of more value , and her people would be vastly more happy , under republican institutions . It would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to this , it may be said that our country will derive much direct benefit from improved modes of culture and manufacture on the Cuban plantations , and from the reduction of duties on their products . The inevitable result would be a great reduction in the price of sugars throughout the country ; for an export duty is imposed by the Spanish government , and a protection is granted in the United States for the culture and manufacture of sugar in Louisiana , where the cane must be planted once in three years , ( instead of once in ten or twenty years , as in Cuba , ) and never fully ripens on account of frost . In a commercial point of view , Cuba would be exceedingly important to whatever country may hold possession of her , but far more so to us than she could be to any other nation , for she could easily blockade all the ports of the Gulf of Mexico , and cut off our vessels on the route to the Isthmus . The Cuban coast is less than a hundred miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Florida , and stretches far eastward into the ocean . Cuba can be brought into direct telegraphic communication with every portion of the United States , and , by means of railroads and steamboats , within three or four days ' journey from Washington . The distance between Cape Sable in Florida and Jaruco in Cuba can readily be spanned by telegraph wires when there shall be occasion for it , and already the government of Spain are // establishing a thousand miles of telegraph upon the island , a portion of it being now in operation . It is well known that about two years ago England and France proposed a convention with the United States relative to Cuba . Our government was solicited to acquiesce in the following article : " The high contracting parties hereby severally and collectively disclaim , now and hereafter , all intention to obtain possession of the island of Cuba , and they respectively bind themselves to discountenance all attempts to that effect on the part of any power or individuals whatever . The high contracting parties declare severally and collectively , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forany one of themselves , any exclusive control over said island , nor assume nor exercise any dominion over the same . " In the admirable reply from the Department of State at Washington , Mr. Everett takes the position that the United States can not come to equal terms with France and England respecting Cuba . " The President , " he says , " does . not covet the acquisition of Cuba for the United States ; at the same time , he considers the condition of Cuba mainly as an American question . The proposed convention proceeds on a different principle . It assumes that the United States have no other or greater interest in the question than France or England ; whereas it is necessary only to cast one 's eye on the map to see how remote are the relations of Europe , and how intimate are those of the United States , with this island . " The United States feel no uneasiness at the acquisitions that England and France have already made ; but the transfer of Cuba to either of these powers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat the same light in which France and England would view the acquisition of some important island in the Mediterranean by the United States ; with this difference , it is true , - that the attempt of the United States to establish themselves in Europe would be a novelty , while the appearance of a European power in this part of the world is a familiar fact . But this difference in the two cases is merely historical , and would not diminish the anxiety which , on political grounds , would be caused by any great demonstration of European power in a new direction in America . " The objections to the convention were , - 1 . That it would not be viewed with favor by the Senate , // and its rejection by that body would leave the question of Cuba in a more unsettled position than before . 2 . It may be doubted whether the Constitution of the United States would allow the treaty-making power to impose a permanent disability on the American government for all coming time , and prevent it under any circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . Louisiana and Florida have been purchased . May not circumstances at some future period favor and justify the purchase of Cuba ? 3 . It has been the policy of our government to avoid entangling alliances with European powers . 4 . The island of Cuba is remote from Europe , but lies at our doors . It is in a position to control our commerce . If it guarded the entrance of the Thames or the Seine , instead of the Mississippi , and we should propose a convention like this to France and England , those powers would assuredly feel that the disability assumed by ourselves was far less serious than that which we asked them to assume . This document from the Secretary of State represents the vast increase of the territory of the United States , and the inevitable continuance of that increase , and adds - " Little less than half a million of the population of the Old World is annually pouring into the United States , to be incorporated into an industrious and prosperous community , in the bosom of which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bread . It is a fact that would defy belief , were it not the result of official inquiry , that the immigrants to the United States from Ireland alone , besides having subsisted themselves , have sent back to their kindred , for the last three years , nearly five millions of dollars annually . Such is the territorial development of the United States in the past century . Is it possible that Europe can contemplate it with an unfriendly or jealous eye ? What would have been her condition in these trying years , but for the outlet we have furnished for her starving millions ? " Mr. Everett argues that , as Great Britain has been benefited by the prosperous commerce that has resulted from the establishment of the independence of the United States , by the home that has been provided for the multitudes she could not or would not support , and the remittances her subjects have received from them , - so Spain , far from being injured by the // loss of this island , would , by peacefully transferring it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce that would spring up with her , favored above all other nations by ancient associations and common language and tastes , than from the best contrived system of colonial taxation . Cuba commands the sympathies of every friend of freedom . Shall she not be liberated from the despotic power of Spain ? When liberated , can she comfortably remain independent , with hungry John Bull on one side , and greedy Jonathan on the other ? Either country would propose a connection to the island far more advantageous for it than solitary independence . Surely we can afford to outbid England ; for even if we do not want it ourselves , we can not permit it to go into the possession of any other powerful nation . We watch with interest , not to say jealousy , every new development relating to this island , and trust that the time will be hastened when , if not ours , it shall become , by the introduction of such liberal institutions of government , of learning , and of religion as we enjoy , what Nature seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the garden of the world .
