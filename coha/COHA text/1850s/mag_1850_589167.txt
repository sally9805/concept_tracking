POLITICAL MISCELLANY . THE great speech of General Cass in the United States Senate , upon the California bill , is one of the most brilliant efforts of that gentleman . It occupies so fully the broad democratic ground of the right of self-government , and so clearly indicates the insidious means by which the old colonial policy of Lord North has been sought to be forced upon the Democratic party , under the form of " free-soil , " as to win the approbation of all true-hearted Americans . The late elections in Michigan show unmistakeably the fact , that free-soilism has been thoroughly repudiated by the people of that state , and that the resolutions of instructions passed by a fraudulent Free-Soil and Whig coalition , were con-. demned by the people . There is now the most conclusive indications that the attacks of certain fanatics and federal demagogues of the North upon the compromises of the Constitution , are endangering the peace of the country , and that as this fact becomes more apparent , the masses of the people are rallying for the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and British emissaries . Those latter have actually raised the standard of disunion , and the effect will be to concentrate the votes of the masses upon the man of the most undoubted national patriotism . The attempts of Federalism to perpetuate the serfdom of American citizens in territories , by denying them the right of self-government , is necessary to sustain the demand of the right of Congress to establish slavery there against the wishes of the people . General Cass , by adhering to the broad , inherent right of self-government , and a strict construction of the delegated powers of the Constitution , is guided by the principles of our fathers , which were the eternal principles of truth and justice , and , in adhering to which , our institutions and liberties can alone be preserved . The death of the Hon. James K. Polk , so soon after his retirement fi-om one of the , if not the most brilliant administration , that has yet occurred in our history , has called forth eulogistic orations from all sections of our common country ; among these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizens of Lynchburg , is full of patriotism , touching pathos , and sound statesmanship . We regret that we have not space in the present number to insert some passages we had marked as worthy of being placed upon record . ELECTiON OF THE GOVERNOR OF MAssAcHusETTs. - The Legislature , in consequence of the failure to elect a Governor and Lieutenant-Governor by the people , proceeded to the election of those officers . George N. Briggs and John IReed were declared by both branches of that body to be elected for the ensuing political year . MARYLAND AND THE WILMOT PRovIso. -A series of resolutions were introduced in the Maryland House of Delegates , on the 5th , by Mr. Merrick , ( whig , ) declaring that State , in feeling , position , and all the features of her constitution , and in her laws , essentially , fully , and unequivocally , a slave-holding and Southern State . They protest against the restriction of slavery or the slave trade in the District of Columbia ; as the State of Maryland never designed , nor did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplate using of the sovereignty over the District of Columbia , to the detriment of the local institutions of that State . MESSAGE OF GOVERNOR CRITTENDEN OF KENTTJCICY. - ThO message of Governor Crittenden to the Legislature of Kentucky , has come to hand . After viewing the financial condition of the State , and recommending a change in the code of practice of the State , he winds up with an incomprehensible hint at the slavery question , at the same time pronouncing a eulogy upon the blessings to Kentucky of the perpetuity of the Union . // NEW-JERSEY LEGISLATURE. - ThC Legislature of New-Jersey assembled at Trenton . Among the most prominent questions presented are , a general banking law ; a general railroad law ; a law repealing the exclusive privileges of the united canal and railroad companies ; a general plank road law ; a law allowing seven per cent . interest when specially contracted for ; the establishing of a freeschool system throughout the State ; general laws authorizing associations for insurance , for mining , and for voting by ballot in townships ; and a household ex. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for the whole of the able letter written by the Hon. A. C. FLAGO , in reply to the document put forth by the Hon S. B. HUGGLES , on the eve of the late New-York election , but we can do no less than insert the following extracts . The whole is published at the office of the NewYork Evening Post : " History of the Canal Policy of the State of New.Yorlc , in review of a Letter written by SAMUItL B. RUGGLES , to some Citizen . of Rochester . " A number of highly respectable citizens of Rochester , in a letter dated October 18 , 1849 , invited Samuel B. Ruggles , Esq. , to address the citizens of Rochester and its vicinity , ' on the subject of the Canal policy of the whigs of this state . ' " Although prevented by indispensable engagements from addressing the people of Rochester , Mr. Ruggles has addressed a letter to the committee , which is published in an extra of the New.York Courier and Enquirer , and fills about , nine columns of that sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and informing them that he was made an acting Canal Commissioner in 18a9 , by a political xnanceuvre , 1 and poorly prepared suddenly to assume so great a responsibility , ' he returns thanks for the advantage of their friendly advice and riper knowledge , and says , it will be no new thing , if now that the enemies of the work are once more in the field , we should even at this distance sit down and take counsel together . ' And he closes the introdu*ction to his history of parties , of finance , and of the public works , by the broad assertion , that the history of the canals for the last thirty years would constitute , in a good degree , the political history of the state . It deserves to be fairly and conscientiously written , and as one among the humblest actors in some of the scenes , I am willing to furnish a chapter . ' " Classification of Parties. - In commencing his ' chapter ' of political history , Mr. Ruggles gives what he calls the present division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he says , consist mainly of those , and the descendants of those who supported Mr. Clinton in his great achievement of commencing and completihg the Erie Canal . ' And after giving what he calls the creed of the whigs of New.York , and of the nation , ' he adds that its most distinguished leader in this state was De Witt Clinton . ' Here is an error at the very commencement of the chapter . ' Before the ' Adams and United States Bank party had determined to dast off the name of National Republican , ' and adopt that of Whig , ' Mr. Clinton had openly avowed his determi. nation to support General Jackson for President ; in January , 1828 , he wrote a letter to the committee in this city for celebrating the 8th of January , and he attended the celebration at Albany , and gave a toast highly complimentary to General Jackson ; and his most intimate friends have said , that if he had lived , he would have been made Secretary of State by General Jackson , in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the whigs , as that term has been understood in the division of parties for the last twenty years . " After classifying the democrats , and designating Colonel Young as the most prominent leader of that section which bears the ' terrific epithet of baralmrners , ' and Governor Marcy as the most eminent leader of those who bear the comfortable title of old hunkers ; ' and after denouncing the former as a sect opposed to improvement , preferring rather to go to the bottom than be saved by unconstitutional means ; ' and the latter as standing midway between the former class and the whigs , . believing in progress , ' but generally disguising this belief , in order to win the votes of the barn . burners-he sagely remarks that , with this division of our political world kept steadily in view , we may more clearly comprehend the past history , the present condition , and the ultimate prospects of our public works ' " Early Histor2 , of the Erie Canal-In commencing the history of the Erie Canal Mr. Roggles says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projectors had to encounter . ' In the city of New-York , Mr. Clinton stood almost // alone , and it was not until April , 1817 , after eight years ' struggle , in which he was aided mainly by clear-headed and far-sighted friends in Western New-York , that the law was passed . ' The city of New-York had found its occupation mainly on the ocean and in foreign commerce , and its leading men knew little and cared less for the great interior . ' " This does great injustice to the leading citizens of New-York ; and in a chapter ' of the history of the canal policy , professing to be fairly and conscientiously written , ' it was incumbent on the historian to make a careful examination of the recrds , and be well assured of his facts , before he ventured on the wholesale impeachment of the leading men ' of the city . " Judge Platt , in a letter to Dr. Hosack , says that Thomas Eddy had an interview with him at Albany , in 1810 , and that they designated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intending to balance the opposing political parties as near as possible ; ' and as De Witt Clinton was then a member of the Senate , possessing a powerful influence over the dominant democratic party in the state , it was considered by Mr. Eddy and myself , of pdmary importance to obtain his co-operation . ' It was obtained , and Judge Platt introduced his resolution of the 12th of March , 1810 , for exploring the route for a canal , which weB unanimously agreed to . Governor Lewis , Robert R. Livingston , Robert Fulton , and Gonverneur Morris , were named by Judge Platt , as active co-operators with him in 1811 . The war suspended operations , but soon after it ended , invitations were addressed to a hundred persons in the city of New-York , to meet at the City Hotel , and at this meeting , William Bayard was chairman , and John Pintard , secretary , and Judge Platt made an address , pointing out the advantages of the canal . De Witt Clinton , Thomas Eddy , Cadwallader D. Colden , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorial to the legislatore . This was drawn by Mr. Clinton , and evinced great ability , and a thorough and comprehensive examination of the whole subject . Dr. Hosack , at page 420 of his Memoir of Mr. Clinton , says : This memorial was signed by a great portion of the respectable citizens of New- York , and was secoaded by the corporation of that city . ' The memorial , it is believed , with the original signatures , may be seen in one of the volumes of petitions to the legislature , in the office of the Secretary of State . " There is no justice in the assertion of Mr. Ruggles , that the merchants and capitalists of the city of New-York afforded it the canal neither encouragement nor sympathy , and still less , pecuniary support . ' " During the winter of 1817 , the friends of Mr. Clinton were pressing him on the democratic members of the Legislature as a candidate for Governor , and he was nominated by a vote of 85 to4l . The New-York delegalion were opposed to his nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote against the canal bill , which he advocated . The National Advocate , the democratic organ in the city of New-York , opposed the canal , and also the nomination of Governor Clinton , and put in nomination General Peter B. Porter , who received about fifteen hundred votes for the whole state . " Alluding to the passage of the act for the commencement of the canals , and the opposition in New-York , Mr. Ruggles says : " It was during these struggles that the political parties which even yet agitate the state , found their origin and early organization . Mr. Silas Wright , jr. , since elected Governor , and Mr. Azariab C. Flagg , the late Comptroller , caine into public life the active opponents of Mr. Clinton . In the year 1824 , they were found in the State Legislature , one in the Senate , the other in the Assembly . ' " Events are here crowded together so as to make it appear to the casual reader , that the passage of the canal bill was the signal for organizing an opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above extract were contiected with that organization . Whereas , in the northern , middle and westarii section of the state , the opposition to Mr. Clinton was wholly unconnected with the canal policy ; and the same Legislature which nominated Mr. Clinton for governor on the 17th of March , passed the canal bill on the 15th of April following . In the Assembly which passed the canal bill there were 90 republicans and 36 federalists , as the parties were then classed . The Bucklails ' and High-minded ' Federalists oppose Mr. Clinton-On the closing of Mr. Clinton 's first term , in 1820 , that section of the republican party which the adherents of the governor denominated Bucktails , ' detsrmined to oppose Mr. Clinton , and support Vice-President Tompkins for Governor . In this campaign , the opponents of Governor Clinton had the co-operation of a considerable number of federalists . Some fifty of the most prominent men of the federal party published an address , in which they avowed their determination to act with the republican party , and to support Daniel D. Tompkins for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As one of the 8igners of the address is on the Rochester committee , whose object it now is to show that those who opposed Mr. Clinton were the enemies of internal improvements , it may be interesting to know the position occupied by one of Mr. Rug*gles ' correspondents , during the seven eventful years ' to which reference has been made . The address is dated April 14 , 1820 , and after asserting that lliefederalpart3 ' , a. sech , has no ground of principle to stand upon , ' and expressing their determination to unite with the republican party , it turns towards the then approaching contest for Governor , and says : " Our strenuous opposition to th 's re-election of De Witt Clinton , as ( bovernor of the state , is a necessary consequence of our union with the republican party . No truth can he more certain or more obvious , than that Mr. Clinton does not possess the confidence of the republicans of this state , or of the Union . Of the republican party of this state , most assuredly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that implied engagement which he contracted in accepting , at their hands , the nomination to his present office . He has betrayed their hopes , and now seeks to retain himself in power , in defiance of their wishes , and in opposition to their will . ' *With republicans , we entertain a deep rooted distrust of the views and character of Mr. Clinton , as a politician . We mean not to attack , nor draw into suspicion , his integrity or virtues in private life ; hut as a politician , in our deliberate judgment , he has no title to the support of frank and honorable men . His whole course has been marked with insincerity and duplicity . ' In justice , and on principle , we think that tbe republican party are fairly entitled to the efficient power of the state . We have confidence in the honesty of their intentions , and in the rectitude of their general views , and see ample reason , therefore , for nuiting with them , to give a full expression to the will of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them to be corrupt in its principles and practices , dangerous in its purposes , distracting to the energies of the state , and calculated to impair its just weight and influence in the federal conucils of the Union . ' " This address was signed by one of the editors of the Courier and 1*nquirer , who now publishes , in an extra , the correspondence , arraigning the opponents of Mr. Clinton , when Governor , as the antagonist of internal improvements . " Must , if not all , the persons now liviur , who signed this address in 1820 , are acting with the whig party ; which shows that Mr. Ruggles is mistaken , when he asserts that the whigs consist mainly of those who snpported Mr. Clinton in his great achievement of completing the Erie Canal . ' " Seventeen New Canals recommended-At the election in November , 185M , a majority was returned to the Assembly of what was called People 's men , ' and in his opening message , in January , 1825 , Mr. Clinton recommended routes for seventeen new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen routes . " Laws were passed at this session fur constructing the Oswego and Caynga and Seneca canals  --  the former by a unanimous vote in the Senate , where the republicans retained a majority , and the latter by a vote of 24 to 6 , Mr. Wright voting in favor of the bill . Of the six who voted in the negative , one is now a whi0 member of Conaress , another was a l ) romiisent friend of Mr. Clinton , and a uniform whig , since that designation was assumed as a party name , another is a distinguished whig , who was one of the state electors for General Harrison , and two others have acted with the whig party , leaving only one republican , a Senator from Ulster , out of the si*x negatives . This is another evidence that the whigs do riot consist mainly of those who supported Mr. Clinton 's canal policy . In October , 1825 , the canal celebration took place , and boats passed fro*i Buffalo to Sandy Hook . The election occurred in the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both branches of the Le*islature . In his message in January , 1826 , Mr. Clinton congratulated the Legislature on the completion of 420 miles of canal navigation , at an expense of $9,130,373 83 ; and after renewing his recommendation of the preceding session for seventeen canals , he recommended a state road from Lake Erie to the Hudson , and another along the borders of Lake Champlain to the Canada line . The surveys of the canal routes were referred to the canal committee , of which Mr. Wright was chairman , and he made a report on them generally , in which he said the state is now largely in debt for works of internal improvements , and an increase of the debt , at the present time , might be dangerous to its credit and hazardous to its citizens . ' In these surveys the cost of the Genesee Valley Canal was estimated at $875000 . There has already been expended in the construction of that canal $3,791,406-paid for interest $1,827,982 : Total $5,619,388 ; and this sum will be increased to six or seven millions when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about equal to the repairs of the finished part of the canal . This is the canal , in regard to which Mr. Wright made the report in 1827 , // which , Mr. Ruggles says , gave the signal for attack , and made war on the whole canal system2 " Organization of the Canal Board. - It was at this session of the Legislature , 1826 , that a law was passed establishing a canal board , to consist of the canal commission ers and the commissioner of the canal fund , and conferring on it the power to regulate the tolls to be collected , appoint canal officers , and make regulations for the government of the canals . At the election of state officers , who are commissioners of the canal fund , Win . L. Marcy was re-elected Comptroller , and A. C. Flagg was chosen Secretary of State . Both were therefore members of the canal hoard on its first organization ; and although Mr. Ruggles assigns different apartments to them in his division of our political world , ' yet in all matters relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the management of the canals , there was entire concurrence in their views . " Mr. Wright and Mr. Flagg in the Comptroller 's Qffice. - Mr . Wright was chosen Comptroller in 1829 , which office he held until he was sent to the Senate of the United States in 1833 ; and , as Mr. Ruggles says , in pursuance of the same policy which prompted his report in 1827 , recommended a tax . ' He bestowed vast labor in examining into the condition of the finances of the state for fifteen years , and in his report of 1830 he gave an abstract of the condition of the general find in each year from 1814 to 1830 , in which he demonstrated , that although there was a capital of $4,396,943 in 1814 , the revenues from it had not defrayed the expenses of the government in a single year , unless aided by a direct tax . The tax , commencing at two mill* in 1816 , reduced to one mill in 1819 , and half a mill in 1825 , bad been wholly discontinued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced in 1829 to $1,344,268 , To preserve the Treasury in a solvent condition , until the rich revenues taken from it to aid the canals could be constitutionally returned , a tax was the dictate of common sense , and the only remedy to preserve the finances in a sound condition . " Mr. Ruggles says- ' In 1834 Mr. Flagg became Comptroller , and remained in office until 1839 , and in his annual reports unceasingly continued the system commenced by Mr. Wright , of urging the Legislature to levy a tax . ' " In Mr. Flagg 's first report in 1834 , he recommended a settlement of the account between the canals and the general fund , similar to the arrangement made in the financial article of the constitution in 1846 . A law was reported in the Assembly to charge the canals with the amount advanced from the general fund , with five per cent . interest thereon , to be paid as soon as the canal fund should be extinguished . This would have provided a fund , on the credit of which money might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bill did not pass , and Mr. Flagg continued to recommend a tax for the support of the government , as preferable to borrowing and accumulating a debt for that purpose . He examined the laws in relation to the finances , and showed to the Legislature of 1834 , that numerous laws had been passed from 1778 to that time , for the assessment of taxes , but not a solitary law to borrow money and create a permanent debt for the ordinary support of government . " Enlargement of the Erie Canal. - Jn the letter of the committee , address edto Mr. Ruggles , it is asserted that the canal policy of the whigs of this state has recently been made the object of special and severe attack by their opponents . ' The attack here alluded to relates not to the public works , but to the whig policy of burrowing thirteen hundred thousand dollars , in violation of the constitution . In regard to the enlargement of the Erie Canal , Mr. Ruggles states that Governor Bouck was the very projector and founder of the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal eight feet deep and eighty feet wide . " The history of the enlargement is as follows : In 1834 , a law passed for doubling the locks from Albany to Syracuse , and measures were taken to procure lands and commence the work . This proceeding excited considerable solicitude in that portion of the state lying west of Syracuse , under an apprehension that the tendency of this improvement might be to favor the Oswego route to the Western states . In 1835 , the citizens of Utica presented a memorial to the Legislature , urging the state to construct a steamboat canal from Lake Ontario to the Hudson river , by improving the navigation of the Oswego and Oneida rivers , and the enlargement of a portion of the Erie Canal , ' as the most effectual mode of securing the Western trade against the competition and strenuous efforts then making for its diversion by Pennsylvania , Maryland , Virginia and Canada . This memorial was referred by the Assembly to the Canal Board , together with a resolution of the Common Council of the City of New-York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proposed to be eight feet in depth , and ninety in width . These papers were examined , and a report made to the Canal Board , by a committee of engineers , at the head of which was John B. Jervis . The results of this // examination were adverse to a steamboat or ship canal , and in favor of enlarging the Erie Canal . These documents were placed in the hands of Governor Bouck and Mr. Flagg , to prepare a report for the Legislature . In Hammond 's Life and Times of aS*ilas Wright , this report is said to have been written by Mr. Flagg . The facts are , that Governor Bouck prepared the report relating to the enlargement of the canal , and handed it to Mr. Flagg for examination , who added to it a paragraph , to which all the members of the Board assented , in the following words : " In urging upon the consideration of the Legislature the importance of authorizing , at the present session , such an enlargement of the Erie Canal as is conceived to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , the Canal Board desire to have it distinctly understood , that they do not recommend such an expenditure of money upon this work as will interfere with the arrangements now in progress for accumulating a sum sufficient to pay the Erie and Champlain Canal debt , and for restoring the auction and salt duties to the general fund . At the close of 1837 , . the auction and salt duties will be restored to the general fund , if the proposed amendment to the constitution should receive the sanction of the people . After the periodalluded to , the net proceeds of the canal tolls will be sufficient to meet the disbursements neceisaryfor improving and enlarging the canal , without ha ng recourse to new loans for that p rpore . ' " It has already been shown , that if this recommendation had been strictly carried out , it would have given about sixteen and a half millions of dollars to prosecute the enlargement from 1837 to 1847 . It was as favorable to that work as was compatible with the fulfilment of constitutional pledges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Legislature , however , did not grant to the canal all that was here recommended , but abstracted from the surplus tolls $300,000 annually for the support of government , in order to remove the necessity of a direct tax for that purpose , as recommended by the financial officers , and which Mr. Ruggles has not the charity to attribute to any worthier object than a desire to render the canals unpopultir . ' " This report was signed by Col. Young and Mr. Hoffman , and it was only in adhering to the financial part of it , that they differed from the advocates of the more speedy enlargement . ' Yet Mr. Ruggles , in his chapter ' of history , places them at the head of a party opposed to the enlargement of the Erie Canal . In fixing the size of the Canal , there was a difference of opinion in the Cannl Board ; and although it was finally determined at seven feet deep and seventy feet wide Gui . Young , Lieut . Gov . Tracy , Gen. Van Rensselaer , Gen. Dix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when a majority of the Board were in favor of a canal six feat deep and sixty feet in width . Mr. Hoffman had resigned , as Canal Commissioner , before this question was acted upon . The Measurer of 1842. - Tn alluding to the success of the democratic party , in reference to the Legislature of l84* , Mr. Ruggles says : " In the autumn of 1841 , the anti-improvement party , headed by Mr. Michael Hoffman , carried both branches of the state legislature . Mr. Hoffman had been a member of the preceding Assembly , in which he had made a report and numerous speeches , violently expatiating on the inability of the state to proceed with its public works  --  and the necessity of levying a direct tax . ' " And he adds , they could suspend or stop the public works , and could , if they saw fit , impose a direct tax , the great boon for which Mr. Flagg had for so many years contended . ' " Mr. Ruggles , and his whig associates , seem to be resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tax and the suspension of the public works , not from a conviction of the indispensable necessity of those measures , but from mere wantonness , and a reckless disregard of their own duties as public agents , and of the interests of the great mass of the people . A few facts will show that they , and the Legislature of 1842 , were not alone in the opinion , that there was a crisis in the affairs of the state which rendered it necessary to stop the public works , and levy a tax ; or to permit the good faith and honor of the state of New-York to be laid along side of the repudiating or non-paying states , and trampled iu the dust . " Mr. Gallatin , in December , 1841 , wrote to Mr. Flagg , as follows : I hope the Legislature will stop the farther increase of debt , which is the road to ruin . " ar better to lay equal taxes , than to borrow in time of peace . " There is at this moment what may be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of American stocks , in Europe as well as here . The most inconsiderable amount , of every species , without excepting those of the state of NewYork , thrown in the market , is sufficient dt once to sink its price . The re-action is , perhaps , still more exaggerated , than the former anticipations of the speculators had been . ' // He then goes on strongly to urge a cessation of loans . " Appended to Mr. Hoffman 's Report of 1842 , is a letter from Messrs . Gallatin , Newbold , Palmer , and Lawrence , which contains the following opinions and sugges .. tions : The six per cent . stock of the state was at par in the beginning of June last , and the Comptroller might , probably , have obtained , at that rate , the money he wanted for the service of the year . The principal causes of the subsequent depression , have been the pressure on the money market , caused by the unfavorable rate of foreign exchanges ; the irregular manner in which new issues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , been*thrown into the market ; the dishonest , voluntary repudiation of state debts , avowed in some quarters , and not sufficiently discountenanced in others ; above all , the apprehension of a continued and indefinite increase of the state debt . The remedy will be found-ist . In making efficient provision for the payment of the interest , and for the payment of the principal of the existing debt . 2d . In a guarantee that no farther debt shall be incurred , without providing at the same time adequate resources for the payment of both principal and interest , within a short period . ' It is evident that the provisions for restoring the credit of the state , must be1st . A direct tax , of one mill on the dollar valuation . 2d . An act pledging , exclu. sively , for the payment of interest and principal , the mill-tax , and the net proceeds of all the canal tolls . ' They give their opinion that it would be better to add half a mill to the tax , rather than to borrow beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rary loans . And they add : It is evident to us that no loans can be obtained on reasonable terms until the credit of the state shall have been restored ; and that this can . not be otherwise effected than by an ample and effective provision for the reduction of the existing debt , and by opposing a barrier against any subsequent increase , not accompanied by actual , instead of prospective , additional resources , for the payment of both principal and interest . ' " For carrying out these views in the act of 1842 , to pay the debt and preserve the credit of the state , ' Mr. Hoffman , Mr. Flagg , and the members of the Legislature who voted for the bill , had applied to them the terr*fic epithet of BARNBURNERS . ' " Mr. Ruggles states that the total sum due contractors on the enlargement , when the law of 1842 passed , and , including the amount paid for rescinding contracts , was $1,972,000 ; and he adds , that if the work on the lateral canals had been stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's long experience , he would have found any serious difficulty in raising the sum of $1,972,000 , above mentioned . When there is a will , there is a way . But the efforts and the policy of his party did not run in that direction . The friends of internal improvement must be put down , and kept down . The public works must be stopped , and stopped they were by the far-famed law of March 29 , 1842 , and the Erie Canal was strewed with the wreck , from Albany to Buffalo . ' " With the high credit established for the state , by the provisions of the very act which Mr. Ruggles condemns , it may seem clear enough to his fervid imagination , after a lapse of seven years , that money could have been raised to keep on with the public works . A recurrence , however , to the condition of the finances and the credit of the state , in February , 1842 , must satisfy every reflecting mind that it was impossible to progress with the public works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credit of the state was at the lowest point of depression ; the contractors on the public works had not been paid for months , in many cases , although there were said to be ten thousand laborers employed on the canals , and the amount of arrearages actually due to contractors , which the whigs reported at $600,000 , exceeded two millions and a half dollars , exclusive of $473,000 for land damages , and over $400,000 for breach of contracts , by the law of 1842 : ( Convention Doc . No. 47 , 4 . ) Besides this large and pressing debt , temporary loans had been made from banks , to the amount of a million and a half of dollars , the principal portion of which was due in March following ; the interest payable in March and April . on these temporary loans , and on the general canal debt , amounted to $246,000 more . The state had 700 miles of canals to be repaired and made ready for navigation by the 20th of April , at a cost , ascertained from actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which the means for the support of the govern . mont are drawn , had pressing claims against it for several hundred thousand dollars ; and , in the midst of these embarrassments , the debt of three millions of dollars , created by the loan of the credit of the state to the Erie Rail-road , was cast upon the treasury , addiiig $167,500 to its annual disbursements . To meet these immense liabilities , there was in the treasury , and in the hands of the Commissioners of the Canal // Fund , on the 7th of February , 1842 , on the coming in of the democratic state officers , less than two hundred thousand dollars . " In January , Mr Ruggles and his associates had made their report for borrowing more money ; and in the preceding December , after they knew that the power was soon to pass into other hands , the Canal Commissione*s continued to advertise for making large contracts , provided the next Legislature shall make an appropriation . ' The whig Fund Commissioners reported in January , that the surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , in the language of the report , will pay the interest upon an additional debt of ten millions of dollars ; ' whereas , before this report was printed and laid on the tables of the members , every dollar of this sum had been expended . From the 1st of January , 1841 , to the 29th of January , 1842 , the aggregate sum of $2,200,000 in state stocks had been issued to the Erie Rail-road Company , in parcels of one and two hundred thousand dollars per month , and sold at auction . And although $700,000 of this stock was sold , under the direction of the whig Comp. troller , after the result of the election was known , no money was reserved out of this vast sum to pay the April interest on the three millions , and thus aid in sustaining the credit of the state , which had been so liberally issued , and which , in the management of the sales , had so utterly prostrated the credit of the stocks of the state . " Of the cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavailable , and a large amount more became so soon after ; and out of the whole sum , only $200,000 could be realized to pay the interest on the state debt in April . " In the previous session , Mr. Hoffman , in a minority report , had distinctly set forth his remedy , which was to stop , and tax , and pay . Mr. Lawrence , of Queens , signed this report with Mr. Hoffman . Mr. Loomis , the other member from Herkimer , had also brought forward the people 's resolution , ' to guard against future indebtedness , and he again introduced it on the 10th of January , 1842 ; and he and Mr. Hoffman were diligent in their efforts to get a favorable expression on this resolution , before the tax law came up , and thus show , that those who deemed a tax then necessary , intended to guard again5t its recurrence , by avoiding that system of borrowing which had rendered a tax , in their judgment . indispensable . They were baffled . however in their efforts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid on the table , " Lu this state of things , and on the 15th of February , 1842 , Mr. Flagg presented to the Legislature a report , showing the condition of the finances in all the departments on the 7th of February , the day of his appointment . After showing the wants of the treasury to amount to millions , and that there was authority by law to make temporary loans to supply these wants , the report says : But at a moment when sixteen hundred thousand dollars of temporary loans are pressing upon the state , and no funds provided to meet them , and when the Commissioners of the Canal Fund are forced to ask an extension of these loans , is it wise to attempt to replenish the treasury by temporary loans , or by an issue of stock ? In the judgment of the Comptroller , the true remedy is , to pass an act for a mill tax ; and as soon as this is done , temporary loans may be made , based upon the tax . ' it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was applied to the cancelment of the debt , $107,000 more than the amount borrowed during the same period ; and that , during this twelve years , five of the lateral canals , 205 miles in extent , were constructed- ' thus showing that a sound system of finance is not unfriendly to the advancement of the public works , while it is indispensable to the credit of the public stocks . ' It showed , also , that from 1838 , under the influence of Mr. Ruggle 's Report , to February , 1842 , four years and five months , neaily seventeen millions of dollars were borrowed , and only $614,000 paid towards the state debt , leaving an excess of debt of more than sixteen millions of dollars . And the report added : It is not possible to uphold the character of state stock , so long as it is issued to such excess , to pay contractors , and is loaned to insolvent banks and needy rail-roads . Forced upon an overburdened market , through such channels , the credit of New-York is measured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two millions of dollars , but is brought down to the urgent necessities of a needy individual , or of a corporation on the brink of dissolution . ' After stating the assessed value of the real and personal estate at six hundred and fifty millions , the revenues at two and a half millions , and the annual products of agriculture , manufactures , &amp;c. , at two hundred and thirty-eight millions of dollars , the report says : If capitalists could be well assured that a resort to these vast resources could be had whenever it became necessary to pay the debts , or protect the credit of the state , could they desire better security ? And has not the time arrived , when it is absolutely necessary that we should discard all temporary cxpedients and financial contrivances , and call at once upon the people for that substantial aid , to enable the government to meet its obligations , which they alone can grant ? ' " Mr. Hoffman was averse to the issue of a seven per cent . stockD not wishing to place // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hands of business men , by offering a fraction more than the legal rate of interest ; and a law was passed to borrow $150,000 to complete the locks on the Chemnng Canal , at six per cent . Cet*tain banks which had loaned money to the contractors , undertook , early in March , to negotiate the loan , and on their ewn part offered to make the interest equivalent to twelve per cent . The law gave a pledge of payment out of the surplus tells of that year , and Mr. Flagg added a written assurance that $50,000 of the loan should be paid on the first of Augnst , $50,000 on the first of September , and $50,000 on the first of November . and yet the loan failed . " The tax law of 1842 , which suspended the public works , authorized money to be borrowed to the amount of more than five millions of dollars , at seven per cent. , to meet the engagements of the state . After the law passed , and in April , 1842 , Mr. Flagg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one million ; and although the law pledged a mill tax and all the canal revenue , for the reimbursement of the loan at the end of seven years , with seven per cent . per annum , payable quarterly , he could not obtain it . An institution in the city , having half a million of dollars on hand , and considering a seven per cent . investment very desirable , was deterred from making the loan from a fear that , if it became known that an investment of so large an amount had been made in state stocks , it would create alarm , and produce a run on the institution . Notice of two weeks was then given for a loan of a million payable at the rate of two hundred thousand dollars monthly , and only $35,000 was offered . And it was not until June that the loan was taken up , in sums of one thousand dollars and upwards . " This shows conclusively that the impulse given to the borrowing system by the report of 1838 , and the extravagant expenditures incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public credit , that money could not readily be borrowed , even on a legislative pledge to return to a sound system , and an uSer of the highest rate of interest . How preposterous , then , is it , for Mr. Ruggles to say , that without the aid of any of these guaranties , Mr. Flagg could have borrowed money to go on with the enlargement , if he had desired to do so ? " When the efforts of Governor Seward , at the extra session , to repeal the act of 1842 , were frustrated by the firmness of the Legislature , the public credit gradually improved , although the state paper , and that seztion of the whig party , denounced the tax , and all the provisions of the law for paying the debt , and preserving the credit of the state . In the city of New-York , a large portion of the tax-paying whigs approved of the tax and the law of 1842 . Ia about one year the six per cents . were above par , and in a few mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par . " Mr. Ruggles says , that under the whig policy , the locks of the Erie Canal would have been finished in 1844 ; and he figures up a loss of some eighteen millionswhich the people have sustained in interest on sums expended , and in the saving in the movement of boats , which might have been made by increasing their tonnage . This belongs to his works of imagination . ' The canals were never in a better condition than they were from 1842 to 1847 , and were so much improved by giving full four feet of water to them , that boats carrying 80 tons navigated them with the same ease as boats of fifty tons , when less attention was paid to bottoming out the canals , and less skill exhibited in constructing boats . Instead of mourning over this period as seven years of famine or folly , ' as Mr. Ruggles intimates , the people never had greater reason to rejoice for the rich returns of their industry , while the public revenue steadily increased , from two and a half to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Constitution of 1846. - In regard to the Constitution of 1846 , the letter considers that it has shorn the state government of some of its most useful and necessary powers . ' But these powers are not extinct , and can be called into action when required hy the whole mass . Whatever has been shorn from the government or the representative , is returned to the constituency , the safe depository of whatever concerns their own well-being . " Mr. Ruggles says , that Mr. Hoffman came into the Convention of 1846 , flushed with his triumph of 1842 , determined to engraft its whole spirit into our organic law . But he did not quite succeed . ' The truth is , that the financial article of the Constitution relieves the tax-payers from the payment of loans to rail-roads , equal to about seven millions of dollars , and pays this debt from the tolls . It also reimhurses to the treasury the sums advanced to the canal fund , which , with interest , amounts to eleven millions and a quarter . There are also other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the provisions of the constitution are more favorable to the general fund than was the law of 1842 , by about twentyeight millions of dollars . ( Compts . Report of 1847 , p. 92 . ) He alludes to the destructive propositions of Mr. Hoffman . ' The original proposition of Mr. Hoffman contemplated a canal sinking // fund of $1,500,000 , until the debt was paid . And he contemplated a fair surplus , to be applied to the enlargement , or that and other works , at the discretion of the Legislature . The section was so modified as to give $200,000 annually less to the sinking fund until 1855 , and $200,000 more after that period ; and secured the surplus to the enlarrement and the Black River and Genesee Valley canals . " The financial article of the Constitution is substantially the work of Michael Hoffman . Few men have had the opportunity , and fewer still the ability , to erect such a noble monument to their own memories . It secures to the people the means of preserving their independence , hy withholding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt . It furnishes a safe anchorage for the public faith against the insane spirit of speculation , and is an effectual guaranty against the infamy of repudiation . Five or six other states have already engrafted on their organic laws the principle , that debts shall not he contracted for the constituent to pay without his consent . This will in future shield our free institutions from the dishonor to which they have heretofore been exposed , hy the recklessness of legislation , in contracting debts beyond the means of the people to pay . " The tax-payers , who have already contributed nearly three millions in the whole state , of which moce than one million fails on this city , have reason to regret that Mr. Ruggles did not discover that direct taxes for internal improvements operate unequally , falling as heavily on the portion of the state not locally benefited by the public works , as upon the more fortunate districts that enjoy the whole of their advantages , ' before he made his report of 1838 , which caused expenditures involving the necessity of a tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus tolls to the public works , and the acts of the whig state officers in creating new debt to get money to spend , have been so fully discussed heretofore , that we shall notice but a single paragraph in Mr. Ruggles 's letter in relation to this matter . He says : " At the opening of the session of the Legislature in 1847 , Mr. Flagg announced the surplus tolls , then applicable to the public works , to he $117,000 , and in the course of the autumn , in view of the immense increase of the business of the canals of that season , he isiade some considerable additions to that amount . ' " In this view of the matter , the story is not half told , ' and Mr. Ituggles must , or as a conscientious historian , ought to have known it at the time he penned the paragraph . The facts are these : At page 8 , of the Annual Report of the Fund Commissioners , the estimated surplus for 1847 , was given at $361,500 00 " Add surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $479,120 37 " On the same page it was stated that there was on hand , belonging to the Canal Fund , $338,580 46 , subject to the appropriation of the Legislature . ' This made a total of $817,700 83 . " At the winter session of 1847 , the legislature appropriated $550,000 to the enlargement , $100,000 for the Black River , and $123,000 for the Genesee Valley Canal , exceeding the above sum . The tolls of 1847 greatly exceeded the anticipations of the state officers , and at the fall session the sum of $559000 was appropriated to the enlargement and the basins at Buffalo for lake vessels ; $50,000 for the Genesee Valley , and $50,000 for the Black River Canal , These sums , with $100,000 for the Oswego Canal , and $20,000 for the improvement of the Oneida River , make a total of about a million and a half appropriated to the public works in 1847 . Besides bringing all these sums to the notice of the Legislature , Mr. Flagg prepared all the laws appropriating the money and stocks . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that at the winter session he merely announced a surplus applicable to the canals , of only $117,000 ; and in the course of the autumn he made some considerable additions to the amount . ' " The correspondence between the whig gentlemen of Rochester and Mr. Ruggles , in its tone and the time of its appearance , evinces a settled purpose to pervert the public works to partisan uses . It was kept hack until a few days before the general election , and then was brought out , simultaneously , in all the principal cities of the state , and its publication was paid for as an advertisement in some of the neutral papers , accompanied by an appeal to the laboring men of the city . Mr. Roggles comes before the public , ostensibly to vindicate his report of 1838 , and to rehuke those who have assailed it , and this vindication was ushered forth on the eve of the election of 1849 , in the expectation , probably , that some partisan advantage may result to the whigs from its publication so near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except to vindicate the truth of history .
