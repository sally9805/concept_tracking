By the Author of " Margaret " and " Philo . " Boston : Phillips , Sampson &amp; Co. 1850. 1Sino . Pp. 468 . WHAT genius without the rules of art can achieve , in any department , may he best seen hy going hack to the earliest specimens of pictorial art . We shall find in them a minute finish of parts , without regard to general effect ; faces well chiselled , even to the smallest curl of the beard , looking at you with an expression of solemn repose that does not correspond with the ambulatory position of the legs and feet , which follow each other in profile through ignorance of the possibility of representing them in any other position by foreshortening . Perspective being not yet discovered , every group is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monarch in the same relief with the water-carrier , and on the same level , unless one of them , from economy of space , should happen to he suspended in mid air , or to stand on the other 's head . The colors may remain fresh while the world stands ; but they are laid on without shadow , and with no idea of the charm of harmony in variety , which painters of our day call keeping . When we see genius thus cramped by its very freedom from all rules , or hound down by superstition to the execution of prescribed anomalies , the petrifactions of old ideas , we almost doubt its existence . We feel the full value of those generally received principles of taste , which have been the slow growth of the culture of ages , and which rest on the general conviction , the common sense of mankind , and the everlasting truth of nature . Genius which spurns these trammels must still find itself judged hy them . It must lose much , and , with the fastidious judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its due . The author of Richard Edney is certainly a genius , but unhappily , he is no artist . His work is full of errors any schoolboy of regular training would be able to correct . The title makes one think of a voluhle hook-pedler recommending // his wares . " Richard Edney , or the Governor 's Family ; a Rus-Urban Tale , Simple and Popular , yet Cultured and Noble , of Morals , Sentiment , and Life , practically treated , and pleasantly illustrated . " We perceive that the writer must he an oddity ; hut as eccentricity is a frequent , though not a necessary , concomitant of genius , we go on , curious to see what sort of locality may be hinted at in the somewhat strangely constructed Latin adjective , and also to judge for ourselves of the appropriateness of the four English predicates . " Simple , " it may be , in singleness of purpose ; " popular , " we hope it will be , in the sense of " universally read ; " but we demur a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It seems more like a spontaneous and wildly luxuriant growth , wholly unpruned . As a critic , we look at it with admiring regret , just as a horticulturist might regard a vine , which , springing from a noble and vigorous root , has run wild , and stretched out long and awkward branches , overshadowing its fruit with the rank exuberance of its leaves . The impression produced by the book as a whole is not a faint one ; we feel that there is great power manifested , and long to see it more advantageously applied . There is much beauty , too ; but our sense of it is weakened and disturbed by constant shocks and distractions , occasioned by prevalent bad taste in style , and by many dramatic absurdities . We can not but wish some humble individual gifted with a keen sense of the ridiculous and the incongruous , were admitted into the author 's councils . A quick apprehension of the ridiculous is a very commonplace sort of instinct , far below the power of originating thought , or embodying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appears in many passages of this author 's works , might profit largely by the lessons which it is able to give , however distasteful at first might seem the suggestions of the teacher . The simple liberty of petition and remonstrance , which would detain a sentence or a chapter under protest long enough to afford time for impartial reconsideration , would , we are persuaded , finally have all necessary effect on the candid mind of the author of Margaret and Philo , and would not fail at last to convince him of sin against taste . He might smile at his friend 's officiousness , and , as he looked down on him from his position of determined independence , laugh outright at his presumption ; but once induced to dis // trust his own taste , as biased by some mental idiosyncrasy , he would , as far as his own perception of the right did not interfere , trust to another 's perception of the beautiful . There is a magnanimity in the character of Richard Edney , and a liberal tone infused into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its disregard of factitious honor , that must , one would think , be the characteristic temper of the author 's own mind ; so that any one who should merely aim to show him a higher excellence , and a higher point on which to stand , while attempting to bring elevating Christian influences to bear upon society , would be secure of his hearty good-will . If we are wrong in ascribing to him thus much of nobleness and manly good humor , we must still do our duty impartially , and uphold the authority , at least , of the most common rules of rhetoric . If no protest is entered against this motley style , this practice of introducing vulgar idioms and words coined at will into the " well of English undefiled " may find its imitators , who , like those of Carlyle , will perpetuate the eccentricities , with none of the excellences , of their model . The use of provincialisms , and the most homely colloquial diction , is not without precedent in the best writers of fiction . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under an assumed name and character , to which they are natural and appropriate . No respectable writer adopts them into his own proper vocabulary , and parades them in defiance of polite usage , whatever may be his theme or purpose . Or if , from poverty of resources , an expressive foreign or newly coined word is introduced , a sort of apology is offered by italics , or quotation marks , or a " so to speak " in parenthesis , showing a decent sense of shame for a violation of the purity of the English language . Such words as " crool , " " roiled , " " creep-mouse-catch em precedent , " " trapsed , " spelled in the sense of relieved , ** and others of the same class , would , perhaps , be very reluctantly sacrificed by the author , the surprise and diversion they excite by their saucy intrusion being easily mistaken for the sensation produced by wit . It is probable that the very metaphors and phrases , which are most objectionable in point of taste , are favorites of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations , which , like parental partiality , make him blind to their impertinence . // The introduction of uncouth and grotesque ideas , without ceremony , among those of a superior class , seems to tickle the author 's fancy , from the same arch defiance of propriety which transfers " Plumy Alicia " from the Governor 's kitchen to her final position among his children , with no intermediate culture , moral , mental , or social , that we hear of , during her somewhat indelicate and discreditable career , to prepare her for so marvellous a promotion . In a work of fiction , there should be probability enough to create an illusion , or truth enough to persuade the judgment to wink at the moinentary belief of the imagination in the real existence of the scenes and personages described . But we must be quite in dream-land before we can give ourselves up , without remembering the author biting the top of his quill and preparing a surprise for us , to his fantastic creations and gyrations , - to such leaps from the sublime to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more astonishing still ; to such alternations of high and far-reaching thought with vagaries of unmitigated silliness . There are in this book descriptions of nature , and delineations of the inner world also , having an excellence of their own , and a felicity of language which would place the author by the side of Irving and Hawthorne ; and there are death scenes of sentimental comedy and oddly profane tragedy , equally inimitable and exquisite in absurdity . There are constant flashes of genius , elicited as if by mere accident , in the headlong haste of composition . Many noble thoughts we dimly recognize , and strive to draw out from the whimsically colored drapery of words , which , like the language used by diplomnatists , conceals more than it reveals . There is a pervading spirit of brotherly feeling towards all men , and a truly inspiring piety , which makes itself felt equally by the most careless and the most critical reader ; and a warm feeling remains in the heart when we close the book , to excite which would give any right-minded person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could impart . We are the better for this book , and it seems almost an offence against our better nature to make its literary imperfections a subject of comment . The solemn vibrating tone of a deep chord , struck with a bold and firm hand , often outlasts the jar of a succeeding false note ; and we pass over an affectation in a very forgiving temper , when // our best feelings have been touched and refreshed by a thrilling melody . It even seems a species of ingratitude to find fault . A reviewer 's office is a thankless one , and so far as it is a censorship , it involves an exercise of conscientiousness , especially in the case of friends or favorites , for which it must look for no credit or reward from any quarter , until new things have become old , and the general judgment regarding them fixed . It requires no spirit of prophecy to see , that the author of " Margaret " will reach a much higher rank as a writer than he holds at present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should he write no more ; quotations are already making the best passages as familiar as household words ; and if the author should observe what gems have been thus generally selected , he will see what addresses itself most successfully to the heart , and is , at the same time , agreeable to the more discriminating judgment of the understanding . It is a rich vein which he is working , would he be more constantly at the trouble of separating the gold , or at least the ore , from the clinging soil . Richard Edney would be more effective with half the number of pages ; but as it is , we are sure it is more generally read and liked than " Margaret . " There are fewer dramatic inconsistencies in the story , and the excursions from it , in which the author seems to follow rather than guide his pen , are less frequent and less tedious . Those scenes in which Richard and his pursuing , rather than accompanying , reader are allowed to rest awhile , and " make themselves at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful . The style in these portions of the book is generally more playful than eccentric , and exactly suits the subject . There is little to disturb our conviction of the truth of the whole representation . The children are real beings to us , and Munk and Roxy excellent portraitures . The author has nowhere caricatured or distorted them , probably because they are subordinate personages , sketched lightly in the background of his village scenery . They are very unobtrusive , and perhaps commonplace , people , not dreaming of being famous in the world ; but we are sure every one of the future readers of the book will , whenever they appear , have a pleasant feeling of recognition and acquaintance , a belief of having met them somewhere before . // Among mothers , and other female admirers of Memmy and Bebby , they are commonly supposed to be " drawn from the life , " probably from the author 's own children . But we doubt the truth of this supposition . No mere daguerreotyping of fact can , like the conception of genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and always preserve them in change and motion . Let any artist attempt to draw a portrait of his own children ; we shall see a good likeness probably , but we need not expect them to walk out of the canvas . A full length portrait , especially , correctly done to the very shoe-string , is a very tame affair , at least to strangers , who have no associations which will help them to idealize it . A few well-cut outlines , - perhaps a sketch made in haste from memory or fancy , exciting rather than satisfying curiosity , and leaving just enough for the imagination to do in filling it up , is far more effective and delightful . Memory , to be sure , is the magazine of materials ; but we doubt if Mr. Judd , or any other writer of genius , is conscious where or when he gathered each particular item of the store . When we leave the threshold of Munk and Roxy , we leave consistency behind . From a heap of outlines , among which the shadows fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflector , the laboring imagination brings out figures much like those in Punch , with wonderfully big heads , making such speeches as were never concocted by any human brain , and uttering words the meaning and derivation of which not even a slang dictionary could expound . We admit that there is a great deal that is valuable and true in the mass ; but more that is only in the way , and ought to be out of it . We are grateful for the bridge , and the freshet , and the picturesque river , which we get a view of by snatches ; for the pond , and the water-party , and the stage-road , with its stage and driver ; and even for the saw-mill and the boom . Our conviction of their reality brings us back to the firm footing of probability , out of the tangled morass of conjecture . Clover , we are told at the close , is not merely a bad man , but a type of a bad thing . At one time , we thought him the representative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anon Richard employs physical superiority to overcome him , in a scene where they are brought into direct contrast . Again , selfishness seemed typified in the character ; but that // did not take in the braggadocio element , and the hideous impiety which we are made to swallow , as it were , whether we will or no . Finally , it seemed to represent a pseudorepublicanism , supposed to prevail among the profligate and unchristianized portion of our American population . The catastrophe , which borrows the thunderbolt as a special interposition of Divine vengeance upon this " embodiment of all horridness , " is revolting not merely to our taste , but to our religious reverence . A heathen poet might not offend us by representing Jupiter hurling a thunderbolt upon the head of the mortal who had defied him . But as Christians , though we believe that we shall not escape the punishment of our sins , either as a nation or as individuals , we also believe that punishment is the necessary consequence of the sin itself , and that no violation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We regret that our limits will not allow any remarks on the philanthropic theory advanced and illustrated in this work . The subject is too important to be despatched in a paragraph , with any justice to what may be considered the original views of the author . " Phumbics , " with his permission , we leave to the consideration of the printer , not that there is any cause which we can see , why the writer should hesitate to introduce a satire on political antagonism and proscription into a picture of a republican or " Rus-Urban " community , except that it is unintelligibly *rritten . We select the following specimen of the peculiarities of the author 's style , which will also introduce the two most delightful personages in the book . " Yes , Richard loved these children ; and loved to be with them , and to amuse them , and to be amused by them . After his nap , - for he had had no sleep since the night before , and many things had happened , in the mean time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came down into the kitchen , and sat by the stove . The children began their pranks , - they could not let them alone . Their mother was preparing for baking , and she could neither bear their pranks nor their presence ; so she sent them into the middle of the room . They could not stop at that , but went clear over to Uncle Richard 's knee , and rebounding thence , they fetched up with the other side of the room . They seemed to move together , as we imagine the Siamese twins to have done when they were children ; having one will and one // centre of gravitation , like boys in a boat , or leaves in a whirlwind . Then , again , it was evident they had separate wills , and sometimes a sharp individuality of will would show itself . Memmy was the oldest , and the strongest , and we should expect her to lead off . So she did ; hut not always . Bebby 's little individuality was mighty strong when it got roused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid weight . It was like a cat frightening a great dog by demonstration , - sheer demonstration . But Memmy generally went ahead ; and Bebby wanted to do what Memmy did . They climbed to the window , and entertained themselves with the frost that glittered on the glass . Memmy printed her hand in it ; holding it there till palm , thumb , and fin. gers melted their image into the glass ; and Bebby did the same . It was cold work , and Bebby 's fingers were red ; but she was persevering ; and when Memmy called to Uncle Richard to look at what she had done , Bebby did so too . Not that Bebby could speak a word ; but she bad a finger that was full of the energy of utterance ; and she had a scream , too , that needed no interpretation , and her lips quivered eloquence . And then , - as if she possessed neither finger , nor throat , nor lips , - there was her eye ; that told every thing . Poor piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her eye alone would have made way for her through the world , sans every thing else . " Memmy laid down to it , as we say , and applied her face to the window , and she produced chin , lips , nose , eye.brows thereon ; and turning to Uncle Richard , to show him what she had done , there glared , from the great ice.mountains which the frost creates on windows , this hideous ice-mask ; and did n't Uncle pretend to be frightened ? and did n't Memmy laugh ? But Bebby got up something as good , and more humorous ; for she laughed , herself , while she was making it ; and then her mouth was so pinched with the cold , she could hardly laugh , and tears streamed down through what she did laugh . " Memmy then took a slate-pencil , and Uncle had to fit Bebby a sharp stick , and they set to work , scratching figures in the frost . Memmy effected rude houses , and ruder rings for heads , and triangular skirts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls . Bebby scratched at random , straight lin es , and cross lines ; but it was all the same to her , and she meant it to be all the same to everybody else ; and she , in her way , called it boys and girls and houses , and her eyes sparkled , her lungs exploded , her frame vibrated all over , when she told it . " But we must come back of what we have written , a little ; we are overstating the case . We say Bebby could not talk ; people generally said so , and we incidentally fell into the common error . But it would not do to say this before Memmy ; she // would be instantly upon you . " Bebby can talk ; she can say Ma , Ma , ' and No , No , ' and dum , dum , ' and bye , bye , ' and there ! ' She has got teeth , now ! " It was an old idea of Memmy 's that Bebby could not talk because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her teeth all up , and the words , too . But the teeth came , - at least , two or three of them got out of their entanglement , - and then she could talk ; and she did talk . So declared Memmy ; and when the mother of the child and the father spoke of its defect and backwardness in this respect , Memmy always came forward with a stout demurrer . " We say this , that the children may have full justice ; and we say it for Richard 's sake , who took Memmy 's side in the controversy , and always defended the ground that Bebby could talk . " Uncle Richard was reading a newspaper , but - the selfish imps I - they would not tolerate that ; they would have no interference with their rights ; they were news enough for him ; accident and incident ; hair-breadth escapes ; wonderful discoveries ; they were foreign news and domestic news ; they had their poet ? s corner , and their page of romance . And they had some original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were crowded with pictorial advertisements of as many strange things as Barnum has in his Museum . " Bebby was more blond , and soft , and supple , than Memmy , or than Memmy ever had been . Memmy 's hair was darker , and lay smooth on her head ; but Bebby 's was all in a toss , and always in a toss ; it was not curly , but fiocculent , and had a pearly lustre , and it hung on her like the fringe of the smoke-tree , and looked like a ferment of snow , a little cloud of snow-dust flying about the room . " Memmy pulled off her shoes and stockings , - this was not allowed , but mother 's hack was turned , and Uncle looked as so smilingly , - and Bebby 's were off in a trice ; and they went pattering and tripping barefoot . Memmy got into the bed-room , and hid , and cooped ; and Bebby found her ; and there were great bursts of astonishment and pleasure . Then Bebby undertook to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her hidingplace , and then she frisked round trying to find herself , and this made them still more obstreperous . " Mother went out of the room a moment , leaving a bowl of Indian meal on the table . No sooner did Memmy spy this , and see the coast clear , than she pushed a chair alongside the table , and fell to dabbling in the meal . Bebby must follow suit ; she shoved a chair all the way across the room , and they both stood on the margin of the meal-bowl . This was rare sport ; it was something new for Bebby , - she never had got so far before , 43* // she had never thrust her hands into meal . Memmy had , - Memmy was used to it . But Bebby , she was awed , and she was enraptured ; she was on Pisgab 's top , and Canaan lay fairly before her , - only she was a little afraid of Jordan . Why should she crow so ? Why should she be so all in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But into it she dove both arms , to the elbows ; she lifled it with her hand , she crumpled it in her fist , she sifted it through her fingers ; she made piles of it , and scattered them . Then she looked at her fingers , and on her dress , and on the table ; and when she saw the meal spilled everywhere , she seemed half frightened . Had n't she a conscience , and was n't some fiery young Nemesis scourging her insides ? - Did she love the feeling of the soft powder ? had she a passion for dust ? would she wallow in the mire , if she had a chance ? Inexplicable little meal-stirrer ! Memmy sprinkled some on Bebby 's head , and Bebhy tried to reciprocate the favor . Mother came back . " Richard , " she screamed , " how could you let them do so ? " Richard had done nothing about the matter , except to look on . " Was n't that enough ? " said she ; " could n't you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Debby by the shoulder , she held the child square round , for Richard to look at . " Her tire , " she continued , " was span-clean this morning ; her hair is full of it ! 0 , I shall go off the handle ! Have you no heart , brother ? Could n't you feel , as well as see ? " " It is nothing very bad , I hope , " said Richard . " All covered with this dirty meal ! " exclaimed Roxy . " Your meal is not dirty , is it , sister ? " " Do n't joke , brother l It is a serious case ; the children are forming very bad habits ! " " Habits of what ? " asked Richard . " Habits of getting into things , " she replied . " That is not a bad habit , - is it ? " " Habits of getting dirty . And I always said , if ever I had a child , it should be kept clean . If there is any thing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The children are not disagreeable to me , " said Richard . " They are not to me , " rejoined his sister ; " but they are to other people . " " It seems to me , " added Richard , " I would not trouble myself much about other people , if I was satisfied myself . Other people ' are numerous ; and if the little ones are to be adjusted to their caprice , I fear they will have a hard time of it in life , and will wonder what they were born for . Besides , other people ' are a good ways off , and have really small concern in Memmy and Bebby. " pp. 82-87 . Our readers who may not have seen the book will thank us for extracting the following beautiful passage . // " However joyous or certain may be Immortality ; however undesirable , in any instance , may be the prolongation of this earthly existence ; however certified we are of the salvable condition of our friends ,  --  still , it is hard parting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of the Angel of Bliss , can prevent the bitterness of emotion . We weep from sympathy , and we weep from sorrow ; and sympathy makes the sorrow of many one . In a moment , as by electric communication , all hearts coalesce ; and Miss Eyre wept as purely , as deeply , as Barbara . " It is hard parting : the cessation , the giving over , the farewell , the last view ; the absence , the being gone ; nothing for the eye to look upon , or the hand to feel , or the tongue to speak to ; the withdrawal of the spirit , the burial of the body ; the silence , and the lonesomeness . " It is hard parting : the room is bereft , the table is bereft* old clothes and old utensils are bereft ; the trees are stripped , the landscape is lonely . There is a ceasing to talk , when the thought is full ; a ceasing to think when the heart is full ; a ceasing to inquire and to communicate ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The subject is gradually dropped from speech , and from letters ; dropped from the countenance and the manner ; it passes into an allusion , it withdraws from the world , it cloisters itself in the eternal sensations of the loving soul . " It is hard parting : - but it is not all parting , - there is a going , too ; there is an elevation of spirit , as well as depression of the flesh . The parting takes us along with it . It raises us from the limitable to the Illimitable . It gives to Faith its province , and to Hope its destiny . Beyond this vale of tears , our friends await us in the eternal Bloom ! " It is hard parting : - but there is a remaining , too . All does not go . There are blessed memories and sweet relics still in our hands , still sleeping on our bosoms , still sitting by the fireside , still coming in at the door . Beauty , Holiness , Love , are never sick ; for them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveries when we wish to be all alone with it ; an Ascended face , it shines on our despondency , and smiles on our love ; it peoples the solitude with a sacred invisibility ; it introduces us to the realm of the departed , to converse with spirits - to commune with saints . The medium between us and the dead is a purifying one . It cleanses the character ; we see nothing bad in what is gone ; there is no remembrance any more of sin ; we are rayished by virtues perhaps too late recognized ; we adore where we once hardly tolerated ; - a departed friend is always an image of pure crystal . " And the body , the transient tabernacle , the clayey tenement , has its wonderful mission . It hastens to repair the rent in our // hearts , by its look of angelic peace , in the forest ; as a prostrate tree hides its decay in a vesture of green moss , so the body endues the pain and the waste of sickness with an expression of health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the features of Violet resumed their wonted composure ; - beautifully on the pale cheek lay the long , silken eye-lashes ; on thin lips flickered a smile , as it were a shadow reflected from the ascending , beatified spirit . The Lady Caroline crossed over the silent breast the lily hands , and smoothed on the forehead the flaxen hair ; and the welldefined eyebrows were still that western cloud , floating between eyes that had set forever and the azure expanse of the forehead above . " pp. 231 - 233 . We copy also the following picture of a cold night in a saw-mill . " It was an extreme night , and the mercury fell to a great depth before morning . One man , who raised the largest cucumbers , and had the most satisfactory children , and drove the prettiest carryall , said his thermometer , at thirty-eight minutes after seven , stood at five and three-quarters below zero . At any rate , it was cold enough ; and Richard felt it , when he left the house , after supper . Its first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to cut , and sting , and flay , as if it would not only entrap but torture its victim . A delicate , thin , violet vapor , coming from we know not where , had clearly mistaken the time of the year , like birds arriving too early from a sunnier clime ; benumbed and bewildered by the cold , it lay on the western hills , still , calm , hard , and dry . The sky was very clear , as if the cold had driven out of it all those soft clouds , and gentle zephyrs , and spiritual mists , on which our better feelings float through the universe , and by which our souls are indefinitely expanded , and our sympathies connected with unseen orders of beings , and left it the impersonation of intellect , - sheer , naked intellect , - intellect without love , without tenderness ; awful , dismal intellect , in which the stars were so many iron , piercing , excruciating eyes - eyes which one did not wish to look at , but ducked his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , - if his fancy would have its way , in spite of the cold , - he would see the windows of heaven covered with frost , and the stars so many little crystalline sparkhag points ; and if he looked closely at Sirius , he would inevitably conclude it had been snowing there all winter ; and the icy , glittering radiance of that star he would attribute to the reflection of interminable hollows , and mountains of snow . There were no loafers about the mill to-night ; and no boys skating on the river , with their cheerful fires , and the bell-like // 505 ringing of their merry voices . The great doors on the sides of the mill , that open on horizontal hinges , and are hoisted by ropes , were dropped . The wind drifted freely through the building ; and the large , cylindrical , red-hot stoves , seemed to he an invitation to it to come in . Nor was it ceremonious , or hardly civil ; it crowded about the stoves , and seemed determined that nobody else should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human ever paralleled , as soon as one windy troop got warm , it made way for another , and so left no chance at all for the workmen . Green Mill was a large one , - two hundred feet long , and fifty wide ; and all the saws were running ; not that they always ran in winter , but these were pressing times . It was one immense hall , where the saws were , mounting to the ridge-pole , and broken only by the tie-beams , and the frames in which the saws moved ; and all the men might be seen , and their varied operations inspected , at a glance . It was a noisy , busy scene . Lamps hung on the fender-posts - lamps shaped like a coffeepot , with a heavy coil of wicking in the spout , and producing so large a flame the wind could not blow it out ; and the more it was attempted to be put down , the brighter it burned . But the lamp was provoking ; it affected great nonchalance ; it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to side ; it treated the wind as a rope-daacer might treat his worst enemy , by capering on a slack wire , and jingling a tambourine in his face ; it was as insulting as a runaway monkey , that makes grimaces at his master from a chimney-top . On one bed the men were butting ; on another , hauling up the slip ; on a third , dividing the logs by cross-cut saws ; the creak of files , and the clink of iron bars , could be heard . The up-anddown saws sweltered , trembled , gnashed , hissed , as they made their way through the huge trunks before them . There was the piteous shriek of the cutting-off saw , and the unearthly rumbling of the wheels in the pit below . The rag-wheels patiently ticked , as it were time-keepers of the whole concern . The entire building , ponderous as were its beams and firm its foundation , seemed to throb and reel . "                   @ @
