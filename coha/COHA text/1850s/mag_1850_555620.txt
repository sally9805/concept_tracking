txt ART . VI . - History of the Siege of Boston , and of the Battles of Lexington , Concord , and Bunker Hill ; also , an Account of the Bunker Hill Monument , with illustrative Documents . By RICHARD FROTHINGHAM , JR. , Author of a History of Charlestown . Boston : Little &amp; Brown . 1849 . Svo. pp. 420 . THE American Revolution is now an old story , and it has been often told . The names of the chief actors in it , and of the principal localities which it rendered memorable , together with some idea of its causes , progress , and issue , are as familiar to us as a nursery song . They were among the first teachings of our childhood , and have furnished ample food for the meditations of our riper years . But old as it is , the story has not yet become stale or wearisome , and we have thus far hardly spelt out a tithe of the instruction which it is able to afford . Passages of history require to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrated in them have exerted more or less influence upon the character and fortunes of posterity , according as this influence has been lasting or ephemeral , and broad or limited in its sphere of operation . The immediate aspect of these events in the eyes of those who were contemporaneous with them is comparatively of little moment . They may have dazzled or astonished the bystanders from the number of the actors who were // engaged in them ; they may have awakened for a few days the liveliest interest and anxiety in the hearts of millions of human beings . Yet they pass away and leave no sign , so that history hardly deigns to chronicle them . On the other hand , incidents which seemed trifling at the moment may draw after them a train of consequences stretching far and widely into the future , and affect the destinies of nations for centuries after the actors in them have mouldered in their graves . These form the appropriate study of the philosopher , the statesman , and the historian , who take no notice of the more dazzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the recent siege of Vera Cruz , the march of General Scott to the capital , and the capture of Mexico , are the most imposing and brilliant military events that have happened in our own day on this side of the Atlantic ; the number of troops engaged , the bravery which they manifested , the skill with which they were led , and the splendor of the victories which they gained , are enough to throw into the shade all previous achievements of an American army . But there was no great principle at issue , no important interest at stake , and no lasting results were obtained . The whole war was a mere trial of skill and strength between two neighboring countries , a sort of military game of chess , which being ended , the board remained just as it was for a renewal of the contest . The United States obtained , it is true , an accession of territory ; but they paid for it in hard dollars more than it was worth , they have been plagued by the possession of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a disruption of the Union . The running fight at Concord and Lexington , between eight hundred British troops and a few companies of minute-men and militia , who had no commander , who acted without concert , and showed no military skill whatever , will fill more space in the world 's history than all the victories of Scott and Taylor united . Volumes have been written upon it already , but its interest is not exhausted , and its story is not yet complete . We welcome , therefore , the appearance of every book which really adds any thing to our knowledge of the earlier scenes of the American Revolution , either by a more perfect digest and more elaborate consideration of the materials pre // viously published , or by adding newly discovered evidence to the store already in print . Mr. Frothingharn has performed a good work in both these respects . He has brought together , with great care and extensive research , all the documents relating to his subject that could be found , whether printed or manuscript , has labored to reconcile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their contents into one clear and circurnstantial narrative , which should gratify curiosity on every point in relation to which there is any information to be had , and should spare the future inquirer the necessity of referring to the original testimony . He has had extraordinary success in hunting up new manuscript materials , some of those which he has now published for the first time being of great importance to the history of the period , as they determine conclusively a few points which have long been controverted . Perhaps the most interesting of these newly discovered documents is a letter written by Col. Prescott about two months after the battle of Bunker Hill , and addressed to John Adams , who was then a delegate to Congress , and who had requested Prescott to give him a more particular account than he had yet received of the recent engagement . This letter was found among the papers of John Adams , and was comniunicated by the kindness of his grandson , Hon. C. F. Adams , to Mr. Frothingham , who has printed it entire from the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpietending account of the battle , written with great simplicity , and with no apparent consciousness of the importance of the affair , or of the value of the writer 's services . It proves incidentally , and therefore in the most unquestionable manner , that Prescott commanded in the redoubt throughout the action , without interference from either of the three general officers who were in the field . Considering this letter to be far the most important piece of contemporaneous evidence which has yet been published respecting the battle , we copy it entire . " Camp at Cambridge , August 25 , 1775 . " SIR - I have received a line from my brother , which informs me of your desire of a particular account of the action at Charles . town . It is not in my power , at present , to give so minute an account as I should choose , being ordered to decamp and march to another station . On the 16th of June , in the evening , I received orders to march // to Breed 's Hill in Charlestown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three hundred of my own regiment , Col. Bridge and Lieut . Brickett with a detachment of theirs , and two hundred Connecticut forces , commanded by Captain Knowlton . We arrived at the spot , the lines were drawn by the engineer , and we began the entrenchment about twelve o'clock ; and plying the work with all possible expedition till just before sun-rising , when the enemy began a very heavy cannonading and bombardment . In the interim , the engineer forsook me Having thrown up a small redoubt , found it necessary to draw a line about twenty rods in length from the fort northerly , under a very warm fire from the enemy 's artillery . About this time , the above field officers , being indisposed , could render me but little service , and the most of the men under their command deserted the party . The enemy continuing an incessant fire with their artillery , about two o'clock in the afternoon , on the seventeenth , the enemy began to land a northeasterly point from the fort , and I ordered the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Connecticut forces to support them ; but the train marched a different course , and I believe those sent to their support followed , I suppose to Bunker 's Hill . Another party of the enemy landed and fired the town . There was a party of Hampshire , in conjunction with some other forces , lined a fence at the distance of threescore rods back of the fort , partly to the north . About an hour after the enemy landed , they began to march to the attack in three columns . I commanded my Lieut. - Col . Robinson and Major Woods , each with a detachment , to flank the enemy , who , I have reason to think , behaved with prudence and courage . I was now left with perhaps one hundred and fifty men in the fort . The enemy advanced and fired very hotly on the fort , and meeting with a warm reception , there was a very smart firing on both sides . After a considerable time , finding our ammunition was almost spent , I commanded a cessation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave them such a hot fire that they were obliged to retire nearly one hundred and fifty yards before they could rally and come again to the attack . Our ammunition being nearly exhausted , could keep up only a scattering fire . The enemy being numerous , surrounded our little fort , began to mount our lines and enter the fort with their bayonets . We were obliged to retreat through them , while they kept up as hot a fire as it was possible for them to make . We , having very few bayonets , could make no resistance . We kept the fort about one hour and twenty minutes after the attack with small arms . This is nearly the state of facts , though imperfect and too general , which , if any ways satisfactory to you , will afford pleasure to your most obedient humble servant , WILLIA1*I PREscoTT . " To the Hon JoHN ADA*5 , Esq . " // Mr. Frothiugham has also published for the first time several other letters , written within a few weeks from the day of the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who describe with considerable minuteness all that they saw and heard . Their accounts harmonize very well with Colonel Prescott 's statement , and place in a clear light all the principal occurrences of the day , so that we can even see the cause of the chief discrepancies that have been detected in the other published narratives . Thus , there has been much dispute as to the conduct of Gen. Putnam in the affair , and the nature of the command which he exercised on the field . It now appears very satisfactorily , that he never interfered with the direction of the troops in the redoubt , who bore the brunt of the contest ; he left that entirely to Col. Prescott . What orders he did give were to the men stationed at the breastwork , which was a prolongation of the eastern face of the redoubt ; at the rail-fence , which ran nearly at a right angle with this breastwork , but farther westward , or more in the rear ; and at the slight defences erected along the line between the breastwork and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the works and the troops who were on the hill in the rear , urged on the reinforcements , endeavored to bring up more artillery , and to cause the entrenching tools , when no longer needed , to be carried to the rear ; in short , to use an expressive colloquial phrase , " he made himself generally useful . " He even rode as far as Cambridge , after the British had landed in Charlestown , in order to obtain reinforcements . During the first assault , it is fully proved that he was at the rail-fence , encouraging the men and directing them to hold their fire till the proper moment . But as he was seen at other times riding towards the hill in the rear , and even farther on the road towards Cambridge , and as he once carried off some entrenching tools in his hands , a few thought that he was leaving the ground from fear , and imputations were afterwards cast upon his bravery . These were not only groundless , but absurd ; for so far as we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insensibility to danger seems to have been a part of his physical temperament . He was the only American officer of rank who was present on horseback , so that he could move about with more ease and speed than the others ; and he acted generally as his // own aid-de-camp in carrying orders both to the front and rear . As he had no specific command , though most of the troops recognized his authority , he was occupied , during the intervals between the assaults , in urging the reinforcements forward , and providing for all the exigencies of the occasion ; in short , he was the only officer during the latter part of the day who appears to have concerned himself with any other duty than that of repelling the enemy at the lines . In this , as in every other respect , he showed himself not only a brave , but a provident and skilful commander , and to the arrangements made by him out of the redoubt may fairly be attributed in part the length and obstinacy of the resistance offered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lexington , and of the other incidents of the siege of Boston , is as minute and as carefully compiled as his narrative of the memorable conflict at Charlestown . Many new authorities , hitherto unpublished , are cited , and the very circumstantial history that is digested from these and other sources of information not only brings out in strong relief the leading events of the war , but shows the spirit in which it was waged , the feelings of the people , and the peculiar nature of the contest . As the American Revolution was the first great struggle in modern times for the combined objects of popular government and national independence , so it was broadly distinguished by many peculiar features from all those which came after it , and which were in some sense consequences of it , or imitations of it , upon the continent of Europe . It was a very different thing from the French Revolution , to which it gave the initial impulse , and from all the subsequent contests for popular rights which were created by the spirit of propagandism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences here alluded to is necessary for a true comprehension of the nature of our existing institutions , and for a proper measure of the sympathy which we ought to feel with those who have been , or are , engaged in contests that have been too rashly assumed to be perfectly analogous to our own national struggle for independence . This knowledge can be obtained only from careful study of the details , the minute incidents , of the earlier part of the American movement ; - the earlier part , we say , because the spirit and motives of the people are // then most apparent , when their efforts were spontaneous and made without concert , before the rebellion was systematized by the Declaration of Independence , by the acknowledgment of the authority of Congress , and by the organization of a regular army . Here in New England , before Washington assumed the command of the army , and more than a year before the Colonies formally declared their independence , those incidents occurred which determined the nature of the contest , and manifested the intentions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of July , 1776 , the movement was a wholly popular and spontaneous one , - an acknowledged rebellion against an illegitimate and unjustifiable assumption of authority by the British parliament . On that day , the contest was in fact decided , and the independence of America established ; the long struggle which followed was an ordinary war waged between two governments , the one fighting for the recovery of the dominion it had lost , the other for the preservation of the liberty it had gained . We are grateful , then , to Mr. Frothiugham for giving us this very minute and carefully elaborated history of a portion of the contest which has an interest and a unity of its own . Circumstantial as his narrative is , it is no more so than is needed by the careful student who wishes to have a full conception of the nature and causes of the insurrection , of the circumstances under which the people acted , and of the immediate objects that they had in view . He needs it , as we have said , before he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred in Europe , and gain a clear idea of the differences between them . He needs it before he can have a due sense of the gratitude which he owes to the men of that period for the services which they rendered to their posterity and to the world . Among other peculiarities of the early part of the contest , we are struck particularly by the hearty and spontaneous cooperation of the inhabitants of the larger and smaller towns throughout New England . The movement did not begin in a conspiracy first organized in the metropolis , and gradually diffused , by the action of a secret society , throughout the land . In fact , there was no secrecy , no conspiracy , in the case . The opposition to the offensive acts of parliament was // open and avowed from the first ; it was manifested with as much spirit in little villages , - in such places as Hingbam , Lincoln , Bedford , Sudbury , and Danvers , - as in Boston . The common people , the farmers and mechanics of these little communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate action they were accustomed , with their ow*n selectmen . They held town-meetings , public assemblies , in which they concerted measures of defence , and passed resolutions declaratory of their opinions and their rights , and expressing sympathy with the people of Boston . They organized themselves into companies of **inute-men , instructed each other in military discipline , provided ammunition and stores , and then waited patiently , with arms in their bands , for the first act of aggression on the part of the British . From the commencement of the difficulties , their attitude was strictly a defensive one ; they waited till the first blow should he struck by their opponents . They were not entirely unanimous ; in nearly all the towns , there were individuals who were known to favor the cause of the crown . But these persons were watched with great vigilance , and whenever their movements became suspicious , they were seized and placed in custody . On the whole , the people showed great forbearance towards them , and never manifested any thing like a vindictive or bloodthirsty spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pistol ; there were some popular outbreaks , but the mob did not seize obnoxious persons , and hang them up to a lamp-post , or to the next tree , and then make targets of their bodies . In a few instances , the houses of known Tories were roughly visited , and their furniture was injured or destroyed ; but the greatest violence ever done to their persons was to tar and feather them . And even these outrages were discountenanced or sharply reproved by the most influential patriots . There was great unanimity among the Whigs , both as to the objects in view , and as to the means or course of conduct by which these objects were to be attained . The inhabitants of the different towns acted with but little formal concert , and still they acted together . The machinery of popular agitation on a great scale had not then been invented ; the people consequently manifested but little enthusiasm , but they adhered to their purpose with a cool and dogged determination and an unflinching fortitude , which bore them triumphantly // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show courage on the field in maintenance of one 's rights ; many do that from sheer stupidity , because th*y have not imagination or sense enough to form a full conception of the danger , or because they are afraid to run away . But to persist in the endeavor through long and wearisome years , to stand one 's ground manfully against privations , hardships , discouragements , and defeats , - this it is which " tries men 's souls " ; and this was the quality of the early American patriots to an extent which can hardly be paralleled in the history of other nations . The feeling which sustained these men in their work was not the sympathetic and short-lived excitement that often pervades a vast multitude , every individual in which acts and is acted upon at the same instant , in turn originating , receiving , and transmitting the electric influence , till all are swayed to and fro in one body , like the ocean rocked by the winds . This is the characteristic action of the populace of a great metropolis ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the name . Though Boston had the same relative importance then as now among its sister towns , it was absolutely little more than a village , - a place of some sixteen or seventeen thousand inhabitants ; and during most of the period of which we now speak , Boston was actually hors de combat , being held in a state of siege , though garrisoned by a powerful British army , and watched by a considerable British fleet . The operation of the Port Bill was a severe blow to the prosperity of the town , which had depended almost entirely on its shipping ; all commerce , except a little retail traffic , ceased , and many of the laboring class were thrown out of employment . For their relief large contributions were made in the country by what we now call the agricultural interest , who felt as much sympathy for the suffering mechanics and sailors as if they had been engaged in the same occupations with themselves . There was no jealousy among the different classes of the population ; the whole community was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected the security , if not the immediate well-being , of the whole . Because town and country acted heartily together , neither absolutely taking the lead , neither being wholly dependent on the other , the occupation of Boston by 35* // the British was no greater detriment to the patriot cause , than if the troops had been stationed anywhere else in the colony . The object was to get rid of them altogether ; and in their measures for obtaining this end , the people were as careful to keep law and justice on their side , as to provide for defence against unprovoked aggression . The troops landed in Boston in June , 1774 , when the Port Bill went into operation , and the battle of Lexington was not fought till the next April . During the intervening months , the attitude of the whole people was calm and watchful ; they did not collect together in large bodies , they made no menacing demonstrations , but waited patiently till their opponents should commit the first overt act of hostility . It was the firing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm-bell of the Revolution , and the hitherto seemingly quiescent colony burst at once into a flame . This event took place at four o'clock in the morning ; and before noon , th' hills and roads were alive with minute-men , hurrying from all quarters to the scene of conflict . Each company , as it arrived , without waiting for orders , or stopping to concert action with those already on the field , took the best position it could find for annoying the enemy , and opened its fire . The woods and stone walls on either side of the road were lined with sharp-shooters , who availed themselves of every advantage of the ground as skilfully as if they had been under the direction of an able general . Never was efficient and barruonious cooperation of so large a body obtained with so little concert or unity of command . General Heath , indeed , had been empowered to take the direction whenever the minutemen should be called together in large numbers ; but he did not arrive on the ground till the afternoon , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their several positions , while fresh companies were constantly coming up , and the exigencies of the case were changing every few minutes , as the British continued their retreat , that it was neither desirable nor possible to give general orders with effect . He was wise enough not to interfere , and the affair continued as it had begun , each company , in truth , finding its own station and fighting on its own hook . The action ended only when the harassed king 's troops reached Charlestown , where they found safety under the guns of their shipping . // The manner in which this battle was fought was a type of the whole contest in New England , from the time when the tea was destroyed till Boston was evacuated . It is the most striking , perhaps the only complete , instance which all history affords , of the whole population of a country , self-moved and self-governed , acting together with great unanimity and vigor , yet acting patiently , prudently , and with even a punctilious regard for the laws , while their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful empire , and setting at nought an authority , which , when exercised within the bounds of justice , they and their fathers had always implicitly and even lovingly recognized . There were no ebullitions of passion while they were awaiting the contest , there was no failure of courage or persistency after it had begun . Factitious means were not used to keep up the excitement , and no unfair art was practised to hurry on the crisis , or to betray the unthinking into a course which would lead them farther than they had at first intended . The time for action had now arrived , and it soon appeared that the spirit which the people had shown at Lexington was no transient feeling . Within a few days , an army of at least sixteen thousand men was collected , which commenced the siege of Boston . This , again , was a spontaneous and unconcerted movement ; they came together before preparations were made for them , before a commander-in-chief had been appointed , or any plan of action formed . So little idea had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of unity of command , that Rhode Island and Connecticut retained the control of their own troops , and the care of providing them with arms and sustenance , merely instructing them to cooperate with the Massachusetts army . When experience showed the evils of this arrangement , or want of arrangement , they were instructed to obey General Ward . Still the relative rank of the officers was hut imperfectly determined , and there was so little concert and regularity in the ordering of the camp , that but for the excellent spirit of the men , the army would have been merely an armed mob . But the ranks were filled with steady farmers and mechanics , who were brought thither by their attachment to the cause , and who needed hut little discipline to keep them in order . Their good sense and sober habits supplied the want of a more perfect military organization . // John Adams , in a letter from which Mr. Frothingham has given an extract , describes very plainly the nature of this military assemblage , which was dignified with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a national army , for there was no nation . It was not an United States army , for there were no United States . It was not an army of the united colonies , for it could not be said in any sense that the colonies were united . The centre of their union , the Congress of Philadelphia , had not adopted nor acknowledged the army at Cambridge . It was not a New England army , for New England had not associated . New England had no legal legislature , nor any common executive authority , even upon the principles of original authority , or even of original power in the people . Massachusetts had her army , Connecticut her army , New Hampshire her army , and Rhode Island her army . These four armies met at Cambridge , and imprisoned the British army in Boston . But who was the sovereign of this united , or rather congregated , army , and who its commander.in.chief ? It had none . Putnam , Poor , and Greene were as independent of Ward , as Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which fought the battle of Bunker Hill , the best contested one of the whole war , and the accounts of which have hitherto appeared so confused because different bodies of the troops acted independently of each other , and it was not very apparent who had a right to command . And the army continued in this state till Washington was placed at its head , and regularly enlisted men gradually took the place of the volunteers . The first action of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress , after the battle of Lexington , was quite characteristic of the spirit of the times . They appointed a committee to take depositions of those who were present , in order to prove that the British fired Q*t ; and they drew up a narrative " of the massacre " to be transmitted to England . If they had been conducting a lawsuit about the title to a farm , they could not have been more anxious to collect testimony , and show that " the law ' was on their side . Yet the war had now certainly begun , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and to prepare the means for a bloody and protracted contest . But they also knew that the war was one of opinion and principle , and that the people had hitherto stood firm frotn a conviction of the justice of their cause , and // that they were maintaining their rights . Every thing must he done to secure and strengthen this conviction , both in the Colonies and the mother country . They did not acknowledge that they were commencing a rebellion ; they were fighting in defence of the laws , the Sharters , and the sacred liherties of British subjects . Most of the resolutions which they passed at this period were accompanied by formidable preambles , in which the justice and legality of the measure proposed were demonstrated at length , though often with more earnestness than logic . Our fathers held that there was great virtue in a " whereas . " Another peculiarity in the conduct of the New England people at this time was their firm adherence to their former customs and laws , to their established authorities and modes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain a pretence for immediately pulling down the whole fabric of their political and social organization , and attempting to erect a new form of polity upon the ruins of the old . They were no theorists , or political schemers ; they promulgated no novel plans for the reconstruction of society and government upon a broader and more equitable basis . On the contrary , they were fondly attached to their existing institutions , to vindicate which they were now in arms . Great Britain , they contended , was the innovator , in that the ministry and the parliament were attempting a new and unheard of exercise of authority over them , and were endeavoring to tax them without their consent . Against this usurpation they appealed to their charters and to immemorial prescription . They vindicated their long established right to choose the members of their own legislative assemblies , to make their own laws , and to tax themselves . When the royal governors and other officers of the crown witl ) drew , or refused to act with them any longer , the remaining portions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise their functions as if their organization were still complete . By a simple vote , the old " General Court " of Massachusetts resolved itself into a " Provincial Congress ; " but the name alone was changed ; it continued to pass laws as before , though it had no longer a Governor and Council to cooperate with it ; and the people continued to obey those laws and in every particular to respect its anthority. // Even this change of appellation did not suit the conservative instinct of the people , so fondly were they attached to their old customs and old names . In less than a year , the Congress again called itself a " General Court , " a Council was again chosen to cooperate with it , and the withdrawal of the shadow of royal authority , together with the severing of all connection with the mother country , left the body politic , in truth , just where it was before . The forfeiture of the old charter , and the establishment of a new one , in 1691 , was a far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Revolution . It was not till 1780 , four years after the Declaration of Independence , that the inconvenience occasioned by the want of a governor , and by some other gaps that the withdrawal of the crown officers had left in the organization of the State , induced the people of Massachusetts to form a convention for the purpose of remodelling the government . And the work accomplished even then was rather the amendment of the old constitution than the formation of a new one . Old titles , old offices , old methods , were preserved as far as possible ; and the new instrument was little more than the old one in a new draft , many things being reduced to writing which had hitherto existed only by prescription . It was the good fortune of Connecticut and Rhode Island , that the charters which they bad all along enjoyed were so republican in substance , that there was no necessity for amending or abrogating them when the union with England was dissolved . The people of these States preserved both the substance and the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . During the war , and after it , they continued just as before , to " admit freemen , choose officers , make laws and ordinances , array the martial force of the Colony for the common defence , and exercise other important powers and prerogatives . " Connecticut did not replace her old charter by a constitution till 1818 ; Rhode Island , not till 1843 . And the government went on meanwhile without check or confusion ; what was wanting in the written law was supplied by custom or general consent , by the peaceable *and orderly disposition of the people . It is the great characteristic and boast of the American Revolution , that it nowhere , and at no time , gave occasion or pretence for anarchy . // That the bonds of government were never loosed , and society was not reduced into chaos , was a result due to the moderation and self-restraint of the people , and to the good sense which they manifested in not troubling themselves about new forms of government or new organizations of society , till the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to continue subjects of the British crown . We put stress upon this point , for to the forbearance of the people in this respect we attribute in great part their success in the long and seemingly desperate struggle that followed . Had they began to squabble with each other , before the common foe was repulsed , about the form of government which was to he estahlished in place of their old polity , - had they hegun to discuss constitutions and to settle the rights of man before they had driven the British regiment from their shores , the " Siege of Boston* ' might have ended in the reestahlishment of General Gage 's authority throughout the Province . As it was , their attention was not diverted for a moment from the exigencies of the war . No other changes were made in the administration of affairs than those which were demonstrated to he necessary hy experience , and which consequently enlisted all in their support . Faction and party spirit hardly gained a foothold in the community till the great contest was decided , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon . The unanimity in the councils of New England throughout the early part of the Revolution was astonishing . There was no strife of political parties , no rivalry of contendin , candidates for popular applause . We do not attrihute this concord solely to the poverty of the commonwealth . It is true , that office has no ch*irms in the eyes of the selfish when the State is too poor adequately to reward its faithful servants . But men will contend fiercely against each other , not only when their interests , hut when their abstract opinions , are at stake . Had the renunciation of British authority rendered it necessary , in the view of the men of that period , to go to work at constructing society and government anew , parties would soon have been formed and arrayed against each other , differences of opinion would have been aggravated by discussion into personal disputes , and the common foe would at last have triumphed // over them , not through his own military power , but through their internal dissensions . As it was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dispute . The moderation of the patriots in another respect afforded an additional guaranty of their subsequent success . They were not animated by a spirit of propagandism ; they had no new theories to be preached to other nations , and no restless desire for extending the sphere and influence even of those opinions of the truth of which they were thoroughly convinced . It was deemed important , it is true , for military purposes , to get possession of Canada ; but the expedition sent out for this purpose was exclusively a military affair , not a republican crusade . The arms and munitions of war captured at Ticonderoga and Crown Point had been of material service to them ; and it was deemed of great importance to secure in addition the stores in a place so well furnished as Quebec , and thereby , also , to protect New England and New York against invasion from the north . It was an expedition to conquer , not convert , the French Canadians , although unquestionably some hopes were entertained that the inhabitants of a province so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the whole , to shake off their yoke , though they should not , by so doing , return to their former allegiance to France . The expedition failed because it was not actively supported by the Canadians , who had so long regarded the English colonists as their nearest and most dangerous enemies , that they could not now be brought to act in concert with them . With this exception , the leaders of the American Revolution maintained strictly a defensive warfare ; whatever their own opinions were , as to the fitness of the people to govern themselves without the aid of kings and nobles , they sought not to disseminate them . It was fortunate for them that they practised this reserve , as a different course would have excited the jealousy of other European governments , without whose cooperation the war might have been indefinitely protracted . Louis XVI . would not have been over anxious to support their cause , had he foreseen that the principles which they were defending were soon to cause the subversion of his own government , and bring his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professions of irreconcilable hostility to monarchical institutions that Dr. Franklin , Deane , // Lee , and others obtained at first secret aid , and afterwards treaties of open alliance from the courts of France , Holland , and Spain . If , in enumerating these characteristics of the American Revolution in its earliest stage , we seem to have dwelt in preference on those by which it is broadly distinguished from all the revolutions that have subsequently taken place in Europe , and which have nominally had the same object in view , that of vindicating the rights of the people against their oppressors , we answer , that none have been mentioned which were not evidently essential to the success of the movement , while they were at the same time highly honorable to the wisdom and the patriotism of the chief actors in it . If these remarks , then , tend to chill the ardor of our sympathy with the recent revolutionary attempts in Europe , they tend in the same degree to exalt our veneration for the memory , and our attachment to the principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and established our national institutions . We are too zealously attached to American republicanism , too proud of it , and too jealous of its spotless reputation , to be willing to see it confounded with any form of French Jacobinism , or with the Red Republican and Socialist theories which are now agitating all the great capitals of Europe , and menacing the whole continent with anarchy , if not with a return of barbarism . Thank God , our own great national crisis was not blotted with any of the excesses which have made the cause of republicanism in the Old World hopeless for at least a century to come ! Our cause was not stained with blood shed by the assassin , nor with any of the heart-sickening brutalities which always attend a contest waged in the streets of a great capital by one class of the population against another . The battEe was long and hotly contested ; but the ranks arrayed on either side were actuated in the main by noble and generous sentiments , and did not seek to increase the necessary horrors of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife were brandished in it , they were in the hands of the Indians who knew no other weapons , and of an alliance with whom both parties had the grace to be more than half ashamed , while they did all that was in their power to restrain their savage impulses . And the earlier scenes , of // which we now particularly speak , were not polluted by any gratuitous horrors . In spite of the embittered feelings which always grow out of a contest that partakes of the nature of a civil war , the combatants showed an evident desire to spare the needless effusion of blood , and to lighten the misfortunes of the vanquished . And the hostile feelings which had raged during the strife subsided entirely at its close . Some of the Tories returned to us ; all , we believe , might have done so with impunity . There was probably but one man - the Traitor- who could not safely have landed upon our shores after peace was declared . Edmund Burke was a consistent and steadfast friend to the Colonies throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rights , he eulogized their conduct , in some of the noblest of those speeches , which will live as long as the master-pieces of Greek and Roman oratory . But some fifteen years afterwards , when his wisdom was matured and his eloquence rendered more impressive by age , though he had lost nothing of his youthful enthusiasm and fervid admiration of freedom , he denounced with equal energy and still more thrilling effect the principles and the men of the first French Revolution . He had worshipped the true Goddess of Liberty , but he would not bow down before the blood-stained idol which the Parisians had set up . He could not sympathize with the destroyers of the Bastile after they had raised the guillotine in its place . He could not admire those who had opened the prison-doors for the victims of royal despotism , after they closed them again upon crowds of aged priests and helpless women , whom they subsequently butchered in cold blood . And who dares now accuse Burke of inconsistency for the opposite views which he took of the American and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrating sagacity which detected at so early a day the true character of the French imposture , and the prophetic wisdom which set forth the terrible effects that it was about to produce in Europe ? His reflections on the French Revolution are now often published in the same volume with his noble speeches on American Taxation and on Conciliation with America ; and the firmness and consistency of his political principles can not be duly appreciated if they are not studied together . // We need not here extend this comparison to the attempts which have been made during the last two years to carry out revolutionary principles in most of the countries of Europe . The end of these is not yet , and he must be a bold prophet who will venture to estimate all their probable consequences , whether for good or evil . But enough of their true character has already appeared to teach caution to those who are inclined to exult at every instance of rebellion against the established governments of Europe , and to award to the insurgents the glory of acting as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is not , whether the ancient monarchical institutions of the several states of Germany and Italy are deserving of our respect as the best which the people of those countries are capable of maintainino ; or whether they are administered , on the whole , as kindly and wisely as circumstances will permit . The answer to both these questions , we fear , must be decidedly in the negative . But a graver doubt arises , whether the rebellion against them proceeds from an enlightened love of freedom , or from an impatience of any law or wholesome restraint whatsoever ; whether the people of the whole country , of whatever class or locality , are engaged in it , or whether it is a revolt only of the dregs of the populace of a great city against the other classes in the state , and against the power which has hitherto curbed their licentious and savage inclinations ; whether the insurgents are likely , if successful , to establish a more wise and equitable government than that which they have destroyed , or whether , the single demon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anarchy and popular cruelty and licentiousness are not likely to enter in , and make the latter state of that nation worse than the first . We can not sympathize with every revolt against government and law , though it be dignified with the name of a revolution against monarchy ; - no , not even if a pope , a king , or a nobility be among its first victims . We first require some evidence , that the actors in it and the motives by which they were urged bear some resemblance to the characters and principles of the men who established our own independence and founded our national institutions . And it is on this account , among others , that we attribute so much importance to the study of the details , the minute // history , of the American Revolution , together with its causes and consequences . The Siege of Boston , as we have said , is now an old story , and it has been often told ; hut we have more reason to recur to it with attention and honest pride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buda-Pesth , Milan , Naples , and Rome have to rejoice in the history of their own renowned cities during the last eventful year of European Revolutions .
