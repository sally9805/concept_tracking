POLITICAL PORTRAITS WITH PEN AND PENCIL . JAMES A. SEDDON , OF VIRGINIA . JAMES A. SEDDON was born on the 3d of July , 1815 , at Falmouth , a emaIl town in the county of Stafford , Virginia ; the second son , and fourth child of a family of eight , the children of Thomas and Susan P. Seddon. his parents were both persons of great respectability and worth , and were held in very high esteem in the community where they lived for their virtues and their usefulness . They belonged respectfully to fami* lies that had been established in Virginia from an early period of its colonial settlement , and had been uniformly engaged in agriculture-the most honorable general pursuit in the state . Amid the mutations of estates and conditions so common in our country , it may not be unworthy of note , that the estate in Stafford county , originally settled at an early period after the discovery of Virginia by the first of Mr. Seddon 's ancestors on the father 's side , who emigrated from England , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained in the family . The boyhood of Mr. Seddon , until his thirteenth year , was passed mainly in the country , at the residence of an uncle , where he enjoyed the privilege of instruction from a private teacher , who , according to a custom freMuent among the gentlemen of Virginia , was retained for the tuition of the younger members of the family . About this time , his father having retired from the successful prosecution of his business as a merchant , removed to the town of Fredericksburg , where , from the confidence felt in his capacity and integrity , he was soon called to the head of one of the leading banks of the place . Mr. Seddon then returned to the family circle , and enjoyed the opportunities of higher instruction in both Eublish and classical knowledge , which were afforded by the excellent academies of Fredericksburg . His proficiency in his studies , both before and after his return home , was very creditable ; and it may be mentioned as indicative , both of the facility with which he acquired knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never received correction but on one or two occasions , and then only for pranks of boyish mischief , even the reproof of his teachers . In his sixteenth year , he was considered by his preceptors fully prepared to enter ona collegiate course , and he was , accordingly , sent by his parents to New-Haven , for the purpose of entering the Freshman Class at Yale College . Unfortunately , he found his elder brother , who , having passed with dLtinction through his collegiate course , ( receiving some of the highest honors of the college , was about to graduate with much credit , ) ' stricken down by disease , and he was compelled , after some weeks of anxious watching at his bedside , to return in attendance on him to their home , in a more genial clime . Griefs are said " to love a throng-they come not in single files , but in battalions , " and such provedthe sad experience of Mr. Seddon 's family . The seeds of disease had been too deeply implanted in his brother 's system by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been exposed , to be removed by all the tender sympathies and ministrations of home and friends . // He soon died , and his death was followed in quick succession by the decease of his father , scarce past the prime of vigorous manhood , and by two other members of his family . The constitution of young Seddon was frail and delicate , and the apprehensions of his surviving parent and other friends were so keenly awakened by these sad bereavements , that they would not heed his earnest desire to prosecute his collegiate course , either at Yale , or some more southern institution , nor allow him to go beyond the reach of their care and solicitude . Acquiescing , though with reluctance , in this claim of maternal effection , Mr. Seddon passed the next few years of his life at home in desultory reading , and in exercises of riding and hunting , to which he was partial , and which were recommended as likely to invigorate his delicate frame . Such was the confidence felt during this period by his friends in his judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had no guardian appointed of his person or property , but was left entirely master of himself , and constituted ; indeed , the head of his family and of his mother 's household . The duties incident to the position were fulfilled in such manner as to secure him in a high degree the respect of the whole community , and the esteem and affection of a wide circle of relatives and friends . During this period , Mr. Seddon commenced , under the auspices of a relative , Arthur A. Morson , Esq. , then a leading lawyer of the town , and now one of the most eminent members of the bar of Richmond , the study of the legal profession , and prosecuted it , though in a desultory manner , as his feeble health only allowed , for a year or two . When nineteen years old , partly for the improvement of health , and partly on a mission of business , Mr Seddon visited the great southeastern region of our country , and passed some six or eight months in the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grandeur and immense resources of the great Mississippi valley , and he would have established himself permanently in a region , giving such ample promise of future power and wealth , but for deference to the strong claims of his mother , and the younger members of his family , on his care and affection , and a disinclination to separate himself from his native state . His visit to Mississippi was at a time when the mania of speculation was well nigh universal , and the inflation of bank issues and the credit system had reached its highest point . His observation on the evils incident to such delusive appearances of prosperity , and their invariable tendencies to inflame and demoralize the public mind , . contributed greatly to the after formation of fixed opinions as to the impolicy of a United St* tes Bank , and of the superior wisdom and justice of the Democratic policy , that has ever sought to prevent or check expansions of the paper currency , and to restrain within reasonable limits the general credit system of the country . The health of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his return he was enabled to overcome maternal solicitude to such extent , as to allow him to carry out , partially , the desire he had not ceased to cherish , to avail himself of the privilege of collegiate instruction ; and in his twentieth , year , he entered , for the session , the University of Virginia , whose system allowed him to select such branches as he preferred , and to unite with the prosecution of his legal studies , the pursuit of scientific and classical knowledge . While at the university , besides giving strict attention to the duties of his classes , he became a member of the leading literary society of the institution , also of the moot courts connected with the Law School , and participated ac // tively in the debates and proceedings of both . His proficiency in his studies may be estimated by the fact , that neither in the daily examinations , nor in those more searching trials for graduation , was he ever at fault in giving satisfactory responses to every inquiry propounded to him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the session to be bestowed by the voice of the students themselves , subject to the approval and confirmation of the faculty . The appreciation entertained for Mr. Seddon , both by his fellow students and the professors , was signally evinced by his selection , notwithstanding the brief period during which he had been a student , with almost entire unanimity on the part of the former , and with the prompt confirmation of the latter , to the office of first orator , deemed the highest honor of the college . He discharged the duty so honorably assigned him , by the delivery , at the conclusion of the session , in the presence of the visitors , the faculty , and a crowded auditory , composed of the intelligence and beauty of the town and country around , an oration on the tendencies of the times , which , both from the able chairman of the faculty , whose duty it was to give it previous critical examination , and from the cultivated audience , elicited cordial approval and commendation . Having graduated with facility in the classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor of his collegiate duties , Mr. Seddon returned to his family circle , to be more than ever the object of their solicitude and affection . Being now of age , his thoughts turned with some anxiety on the place which he should select for permanent settlement , and he turned with longings to the wide field and high rewards afforded to intellectual energy and professional industry in the south-west . The motives which prevented his stay in the South again , proved preponderant , and he finally determined to establish himself in Richmond , the metropolis and leading city of his native state , where the obstacles to success were most formidable , in the number and talents of the bar , the inducements to exertion and the rewards of professional eminence were greatest . Before his removal , he determined to pass a year in travel and general study . About this period the struggles of parties ensuing on the eventful administration of Jackson , and the questions connected with the currency , were marked by great excitement and interest . The family of Mr. Seddon , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathies and votes to the federal national republican party , and his own early associations had naturally disposed him to regard them with some favor . His boyLh partialities had however been strongly enlisted by the patriotism , firmness and heroism of Jackson , and until the period of the nullification struggle , he not unfrequently excited the smiles of his elder friends , by the warmth with which he defended the old hero . All his youthful sympathies were however engaged by the fearless attitude and bold opinions maintained by the statesmen of South Carolina in that eventful struggle , and on impulse rather than conviction , youth as he was , he would have been prepared to go to any extent in defending her cause . The removal of the deposits had again , by the de ision and moral firmness it had evincedlin President Jackson , awakened his admiration , and disposed him to regard with more favorable construction , the policy of his administration on the currency qu&amp;tion . With such unsettled political predilections , Mr. S. thought it advisable before settling in life , to devote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the country , and to the principles which distinguished parties . The result was , after the best investigations and reflections he could give // to the subject , to settle his mind on the thorough conviction that the republican states-rights party of his native state had been right in their historical view of the formation and nature of our confederated republic , and most just and wise on the principles of constitutional construction and jealous limitation of the powers of the Federal government , on which they had always insisted . He became so entirely satisfied , that in the measures of policy which had ' divided the parties of the country , and especially in those relating to free trade and the currency , then specially involved in the party struggles of the day , the Democratic party were in the main more wise , just and enlightened , that from that time , and consistently ever since , Mr. Seddon 's political principles have been those of the republican states-rights school ; and as far as he has mingled in politics at all , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying out the leading measures of the Democratic policy . In the fall of 1837 , being then twenty-two years old , Mr. Seddon removed to and settled in the practice of his profession in Richmond ; with the exception of a few friends among the young men he had known at the University , he had scarce an acquaintance in the whole city , and for the successful prosecution of his profession , he had no auxiliary influences or facilities to expect , and was therefore dependent solely on his own energies , industry , and capacity . He was received with much kindness and courtesy , both by the bar , of which he became a member , and by such of the citizens as he was made acquainted with . Within a few months after his settlement , through the favorable recommendstion of a college friend who had established himself in practice the previous year , and from his own talents , as well as his previous acquaintance and deserved popularity with the business men of the city , had attained great success , Mr. S. became engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and battery , which , from the character of the parties , and the circumstances of the case , had attracted much public attention and interest . In this , his first appearance , Mr. S. made a very favorable impression , and was considered to have evinced an address , knowledge of his profession , and talent for speaking , which strongly recommended him to public favor , and insured his speedy success . lie very soon after , on the invitation of George W. Good , Esq. , the friend to whom reference has been made , became associated with him in the practice of the profession , and a sharer in the responsibilities and labors of a practice already large and rapidly increasing . To the duties of his profession for the next two years , Mr. S. gave himself up unremittingly , and the result was his own rapid advance to a leading position in the confidence of the public , in the estimation of the first bar of the state , and a large increase in the business and reputation of his firm . His course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy and liberality , and to his clients by zeal , fidelity and consideration ; and in consequence , notwithstanding his rapid success , he was singularly exempted from any display of invidiousness or a detracting spirit towards him . Not being a freeholder in the city , for the first two years of his residence , he was not called on to exercise the elective franchise . His attention was so exclusively devoted to his profession , that he scarcely expressed an opinion on , and mingled not at all in the politics of the day . To his friends , of course , his convictions were known , but the public were probably not even aware of his political preferences . The memorable political contest of 1840 admitted of no neutrality , nor indeed would the strong repugnance // entertained by Mr. S. to the new and undignified appliances for popular excitement resorted to by the whigs , as well as the deep conviction he had of the dangerous consequences of the policy which , under the disguises of popular humbugs , they were seeking to force on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or doubtful attitude . At the darkest hour of the contest , when the success of the whigs was deemed secure , and they were flushed with the sanguine hope of carrying even the state of Virginia itself , Mr. Seddon first publicly declared his political sentiments , and enrolled himself a member of the small but gallant minority , then and since distinguished in the political struggles of the state , as " the Spartan Band of Richmond . " He became an active and influential member of the Democratic association of Richmond , battled stoutly against the numbers and talents enlisted in the whig cause , and contributed essentially to rescue the state from their confident hopes . He spoke and wrote much in and for the association , and at its request went forth to participate as a speaker in the active popular canvass that agitated the state . In this contest he became known to and secured a place in the confidence and affection of the Democracy of the city and state . A sharer in their hopes , he participated with them in mortification at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found consolation in the proud assurance that they had triumphed iu their own special field of battle , saving the old states-rights citadel from its horde of assailants . After the temporary intermission caused by this canvass , Mr. S. returned with undiminished zeal and industry to the prosecution of his profession ; and it is creditable to the liberality of the citizens of Richmond , when the whig majority was overwhelming , as well as evincive of the favorable impression made by Mr. S. in the new arena where he had displayed his talents , that his practice and his professional reputation increased and extended . From this period , however , having become identified with the Democratic party , he took an active interest in the political movements of the day . He was selected as a member of the Democratic central committee of the state , and took an active part in its counsels and labors , the importance of which have ever been warmly appreciated in the state . His pen and his ready faculty of speech were often in requisition by the active minority who constituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestness and zeal , especially during the first dark days of Harrison 's term , and the storm that ensued on the memorable vetoes of President Tyler . While according to Mr. Tyler , and in common with the states-rights party of the South , high praise for the moral firmness and adherence to principles exhibited under the trying circumstances of his position , Mr. S. avoided all identity with the small party that supported his administration , and , indeed , was opposed to not a few of its measures , and especially to the principles and policy involved in the sweeping enactment of the bankrupt law . After the re-ascen*ncy of the Democratic party had apparently been secured by the Congressional and other elections that took place during the early years of Mr. Tyler 's administration , warm interest began to he felt , and serious divisions to arise in the party , as to who should be its candidate for the Presidency at the ensuing election . The confession of superior claims and ability was soon narrowed down to Mr. Van Buren and Mr. Calhoun . Between their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the Union , but more particularly in the South , keen and earnest . The admiration which Mr. S* // had always felt for the lofty , intellectual powers and pure character of the great Southern statesman , and his conviction of the eminent services which had been rendered to the states-rights party by its ablest champion , allowed no hesitancy in his mind as to his preference for Mr. Calhoun . His position at the metropolis , his reputation , and the zeal of his preference and advocacy of Mr. Calhoun , attracted to him the attention and confidence of his friends throughout the state , and Mr. S. became the organ of communication , and the centre of an organization among his supporters throughout the state . The result of this contest , it is believed , would not have been doubtful- for the people of Virginia had naturally stronger predilections for Mr. Calhoun than Mr. Van Buren-had not the great influence of the Richmond Enquirer , and of many leading politicians of the state , who had been identified with Mr. Van Buren 's administration , concurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inducing an opinion of his superior availability throughout the Union . As it was , the friends of Mr. Calhoun very nearly divided the Democratic state conventions that were held preliminary to organization for the canvass of 1844 ; and in the very earnest debates that ensued in relation to the address to be adopted , and the organization of the appr* ) aching general convention , Mr. S. was the selected chairman of his portion of the party , and encountered with credit some of the leading orators of the state . By the spring of 1844 , it had become apparent , that through the aid of the old party organization , and the preference of the North evinced for Mr. Van Buren , he would probably be the choice of the Democratic party of the state . The friends of Mr. Calhoun had taken decided ground against the contemplated organization of the national convention of the party , and its mode of ascertaining the sense of the people , and it was very doubtful whether they would not persist in running an independent candidate , even at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensue . It was well known that Mr. Clay would be the candidate of the whig party , which viewed the division of its opponents with exultation , and were flushed with the confident expectation of an easy triumph . The danger of such result , and of the establishment , throu * h the elevation of Mr. Clay , of that great system of measures for the consolidation of power in the Federal government , and its perpetuit.y by the influence of the large classes preferred and compelled by partial legislation , against which the states-rights party of the South had , from the first on in of the goveron ent , ever most battled , was most sensibly felt and deplored by th t portion of the party , when preference has been warmly enlisted in behalf of Mr. Calhoun . Considerations of principle and patriotism disposed them to forego for a time the ground of opposition entertah ed by them to the proposed organization of the national convention , and to re-unite with the other portion of the great Democratic party in opposition to the common opp*nent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ihoun , in effect withdrawing his name as a candidate of the party , and thus relieving his friends from all imputation of desertion in again co-operating with the rest of the party . This letter was received in Richmond a day or two before the meeting of a Democratic state convention , at which it had been expected a last severe struggle would occur between the two win , s of the party . Most of the leading friends of Mr. C* Ihoun in the state ere in attendance , and on its receipt met in conference to decide on the course they oaght in honor and in duty to pursue . The opinion and // advice of Mr. S. were promptly and decidedly given to forego , under the sense of the common danger , the minor points of difference that separated them from the rest of the Democratic party , and to adopt , without delay , measures for conciliation and re-union , in support of a common cause and a single candidate . In this view he had the satisfaction of being sustained by other leading supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting . The result was , that an able address , in the preparation of which Mr. S. participated with the most prominent member of his party , now a distinguished senator of the United States , was sent forth by the friends of Mr. Calhoun , in which they reviewed and sustained the course th ' t had been pursued by them , and fully exph med the grounds on which they had opposed the organization and mode of election to the proposed national convention ; but , after exhibiting the disastrous results which must ensue from the defeat of the Democratic party , and the establishment of the odious Federal system advocated by the Whigs , concluded , rather than hazard them , to lay aside temporarily all grounds of difference , and to unite in cordial co-operation with their brethren of the Democratic family against the whigs and their great leader . In consequence of this course , the proceedings of the state convention , instead of exhibiting discord and distraction , were marked by the utmost harmony and zeal . Immediately after : to enforce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends of Mr. Calhoun , and to induce a general concurrence in the recommendation of union and co-operation with the other wing of the party , Mr. S. , in conformity with the earnest wish of the leading friends of Mr. C. , visited many of the counties in the eastern part of the state , where his supporters were the most numerous , and addressed the people . To his exertions and influence was greatly due the very general acquiescence in the course which the friends of Mr. Calhoun had advised , and which at first had not been received in the counties without serious dissatisfacti* . About this time the great measure of the annexation of Texas , which had been originated by the administration of Mr. Tyler , began to engross public attention and interest . All Mr. Seddon 's predilections and principles led him to be an early and ardent advocate of this great acquisition , and in all the popular addresses delivered during his trip , he did not fail earnestly to enforce its great unportance , and the necessity of union on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it was not doubted that the opinions of Mr. Van Buren would be in favor of the annexation , and the whole Democratic party of the state eagerly embraced and committed themselves to it . A few weeks subsequently , the letters of Mr. Van Buren and Mr. Clay appeared almost simultaneously , taking ground against the proposed annexation . Indignation and dismay were doubly felt by the Democratic party of the state , and for a time great uncertainty and indecision prevailed as to the course to be pursued . They were thoroughly committed to the support of Mr. Van Buren , and had actually sent delegates to the Baltimore convention , under positive instructions to support him ; but could they consent to sacrifice , for mere personal preference , a great measure of national policy ? With Mr. S. there was neither hesitancy or misgiving ; he at once declared his own fixed purpose , and his belief that such also would be the action of the people of the state , to sustain no candidate for the Presidency who was not in favor of the annexation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other leading // *nembers of the Democratic party in the city . Conferences were held for several successive nights among the members of the Democratic central committee , and other leading gentlemen of the party , and at all Mr. S. was among the most earnest and influential advisers of decisive measures , and of a change in the position of the party with reference to Mr. Van Buren . It was finally determined , very much in consequence of his decisive ourse , that a series of resolutions , affirming the determination of the Democratic party to consider the annexation of Texas as a great me sure of its policy , and advising the people of the respective districts to release their delegates to the approaching National Convention from their instructions to vote for Mr. Van i3uren , should be offered by the senior editor of the Enquirer , whose influence was known to be potential in the Democratic association of the city , and go forth backed by the recommendation of a body whose zeal and ability had given them deserved influence with the party throughout the state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and being advocated by Mr. S. , were , after a brief debate , passed by a large majority , and with great enthusiasm . At the same time , an able address was published by the Democratic Central Committee , of which Mr. S. was an active member , enforcing the incalculable importance of the.acquisition of Texas , and sustaining the recommendation that the delegates to the National Convention should be released from their instructions to vote for Mr. Van Buren . The recommendation met the cordial approval of the party throughout the state , and was promptly acted upon . These manifestations of the sentiment of the party in the influential State of Virginia , came at a most critical time , when elements of opposition to Mr. Van Buren , in consequence of the position so universally assumed by him on the Texas question , were beginning to be developed in the political circles of Washington and elsewhere , and served to concentrate and give them preponderating force . As is well-known , the convention , which shortly afterwards assembled at Baltimore , disregarded the pretensions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d George M. DalLs , as the candidates of the party for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency . Mr. Seddon attended the meeting of the Convention , and while not a member , in consequence of the position taken by himself and . his friends in relation to its organization , by his exertions with the members of the delegations of his own and other states , actively contributed to the happy result of its deliberations . By the Democratic party , generally , but especially in Virginia , the nominations were received with enthusiasm and rejoicing . All dissensions and divisions in the party were at once healed , and every preparation made for an earnest and successful canvass . In the spring of 1845 , when the dust of the recent Presidential canvass was still upon him , Mr. Seddon was nominated as the Democratic candidate for the Twenty-Eighth Congress , by the convention of his political friends , for his , the Richmond district , ( the Hon. John Winston Jones , their former representative , and Speaker of the previous Congress , having declined a re-nomination . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominee of the whigs , who met him upon every stump , discussino* over again the great questions which had occupied the public mind of Virginia in the preceding Presidential struggle . The writer questions whether the political history of the Union presents another case , in which measures and principles were so thoroughly and ably discussed before the // people in a Congressional election  --  the candidates being both men of ' re* markable ability and energy , and the popular mind being , in that district , still under the strain of the excitement which swept over the country du ring the fall just passed . The contest resulted in the triumph of Mr. Seddon , who , contrary to the expectations of his most earnest and best informed friends , was elected by a handsome majority , in that decided federal district . Shortly after this election , Mr. S. was united in matrimony to Mis Sally , the daughter of the late James Bruce , Esq. , of halifax County , Va. , a young lady distinguished for her excellent sense and information and for pos*essing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginian lady so eminently a lady . On repairing to W*ishington to take his seat in the House of Representatives , Mr. S. soon became known as one of the ablest defenders of that states'rights school of politics , of which Mr. Calhoun is recognized as the great leader . He took an active part in the ordinary business of legislation , and at the first session delivered the speech upon the contest for the seat from Florida , between Messrs . Brokenborough and Cabell , upon which the writer believes the result to have turned ; the question having been settled in favor of Mr. B. , the friend of our subject . Ere that session ended , Mr. Seddon also delivered a very effective speech upon " the bill to protect American citizens in Oregon , " the question upon which the great Oregon debate transpired , in which he maintained with consummate ability the view of the Oregon ques* tion taken by those of his peculiar school of republicanism ; throwing his weight against giving the notice for the termination of the joint occupation to Britain , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill of 1546 , taking the free trade ground , and arguing with equal power against the constitutionality and the expediency of the principle of protection . At the ensuing session , on the resolution of Mr. Davis , calling on the President for information concerning the establishment temporarily , of a civil government in Mexico , Mr. Seddon also addressed the House in an elaborate speech , in which he defended the action of the administration in this connection with convincing force ; holding that the President had not overstepped the bounds of the legitimate authority over th conquered territory , which vested in him , under the laws of n tions , as the representative of the conquering government . The close of the Twenty-Ninth Congress , it will be remembered , found Mr. Calhoun and his friends arranged in some degree of hostility to the administration7 growing out of their difference upon the Oregon question mainly . Though Mr. S. was well known at home to coincide with Mr. Calhoun in this interruption of cordial relations with the late President , so great was his personal popularity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at tLe same time taking care to adopt a series of resolutions intended to intimate , that though preferring to adhere to him as their standard bearer , the Democracy of the district did not endorse his views wherein they conflicted with those of the mass of the party in Congret*s . On being notified of the action of the convention , Mr. Seddon promptly repaired before them , and delivered a speech of great power upon the points in issue between them , and announcing his sense of the obligations resting upon him , not to accept the nomination unless the convention would consent to re-consider their action upon the resolutions in question , which he regarded as leaving room for an implied censure upon his Congressional // course . As the feeling between the two wings of the party then ran very high in Virginia , the anti-Calhoun wing , which was as largely in the majority in the convention , as throughout the district and state , declined re-considering their course upon the points mooted ; which compelled Mr. Seddon to decline . Mr. Walter D. Leake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was beaten by Mr. Butts , by an overwhelming majority . During the term of this Congress , Jr . Seddon applied himself with renewed energy to the practice of his profession , tI ough he was compelled by declining health to repair to the more genial clime of Louisiana , where he remained for a season , returning much invigorated . Jn the last Presidential canvass he was found battling for the Democracy , wherever , in Virginia , the fight was hottest , and shortly after its close he was again called on to represent his party , and defend their principles in the ensuing Congressional canvass , having been nominated by the district convention without even the form of an opposition . Having in this struggle to contend against two opponents , the Hon. J. M. Butts , and Charles Carter Lee , Esq. , in place of one , he met them at various places , and discussed before the people , all the great questions dividing parties . Mr. Butts , it will be remembered , represented the Clay , or Ultra-Whig party , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This canvass ended in his election , by a majority over the vote for both his opponents combined , much to the surprise of the leaders of both parties in the state . Since the commencement of the present session , Mr. Seddon has only taken occasion to address the House once , in a speech on the action of the present executive in relation to California , in which he made what public men generally at Washington regard as the strongest are , ument as yet made in the House of Representatives , against the legality and propriety of the policy of the administration , with reference to the question of the . State Government formed in California . The writer regrets that the too great length to which this sketch is already drawn , precludes him from quoting copiously from this effort , so replete with sound conservative states-ri*. , hh doctrine-which should he inculcated into every American heart and mind , if we are destined still further to increase our territorial limits . As an orator , Mr. Seddon is as graceful and impressive in manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks the English language with as much good taste and purity as he writes it , which is an accomplishment rarely possessed by our public men , he is by no means wanting in that fervor of expression , which is a most attractive feature of American oratory . No other member enjoys more of the respect and confidence of the House , without which , the brightest talents are of little avail in the Congress of the United States , for the defence of measures of great or small importance . As , according to the Virginia custom , the competent and improving member is required to serve his district for many years , his character as a man , and a states-rights republican of the first order of ability , will probably secure to Mr. Seddon a long continuance in public life ; until , indeed , his reputation shall become as firmly established throughout the Union , as it is in his own state , where the standard , by which statesmen are tried , is proverbially high . // 369 FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL REVIEW . MONEY has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acive demand has sprung up , and the quantity of good paper offering has inGreas d . The " lines " of the chartered banks are full , but they discount freely their receipts . The supplies of specie , the aspoct of exchanges , with the general prospect abroad , are such as to encourage confidence and enterprise . Out of doors the supply of first-class paper is not large , but less known paper is abundant . The demand for the former is equal to the supply , very little 0oes better than 7 percent. ; short dates , 6a 8 percent. ; long 8 a 12 ; on stocks at call , 4 a 6 per cenL . The supply of Eastern corporation paper is large ; railroad acceptances 8 a 10 per cent . The exchange market was active and the remittances large , but the supply of bills very considerable , and the rates c1osed at a decline . The larger portion of the sales were at 8* a 8* , but good produce bills were had at 7 per cent. , while leading drawers asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S 32k ; guilders 39* a *39* ; rix dollars , 77* a 77* ; Mares Banco , 34* a 35 . The amount of stocks remitted has been quite large , and it is a feature of those remit ances that they go direct to the Continent in fulfilment of special orders for investment . The political clouds that begin again to gather , admonish the sagacious of safe investments . The amount of specie in the Assistant Treasury has reached 4,386,240 , but the amount in bank vaults does not diminish . At the Philadelphia mint gold certificate No. 585 is payable . All mines seem to be prolific . The amount of silver , in bars and coins , exported from Mexico last year , was $30,000,000 , most of which went to England , and was thence exported to the Continent  --  a veryconsiderable proportion going into the vaults of the Bank of France , swelling the reserve to an unusual amount . It is now two years since the gold productions of that wonderful country were first discovered , and about one since any considerable quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very high , and the wildest expectations were indulged as to the receipts and their probable effects upon this market . The lapse of a year has somewhat sobered the views of the most sanguine , although the first accounts of the abundance of the metals are not only confirmed but known to have been slightly under-estimated . It is a singular fact , however , that abundant as the gold undoubtedly is , that the hardships of obtaining it and the hazards of the climate which surround it , counteract in a very great degree the eagerness with which it is sought .
