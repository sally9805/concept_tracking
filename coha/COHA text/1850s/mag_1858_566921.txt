ART . VL-CALIFORNJA , ITS CHARACTERISTICS AND PROS PECTS . WHOEVER wishes , for health 's sake or for any other reason , to change the sceneries or the objects and associations of his life , should set off , not for Europe , but for California . And this the more certainly , if he is a loving and sharp observer of nature ; for nature meets us here in moods entirely new ; so that we have even to make her acquaintance over again ; going back , as it were , to be started in a fresh childhood . All our common , or previously formed impressions , calculations and weather-wisdoms are at fault . We find that we really understand nothing and have everything to learn . We begin to imagine , for example , that her way is to be thus , or thus ; or that her operations are to be solved in this , or that manner , but we very soon discover that it will not hold . Our guess must be given up and we must try again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of natural phenomena , will be held in a puzzle thus for whole months , and will nearly coinplete the cycle of the year , before he seems to himself to have come into any real understanding with the new world he is in ; just as if he were on a visit to Jupiter and wanted to sail round the sun with him , for at least once , and feel out his year , before he can be sure that he understands a single day . California being to this extent a new world , having its own combinations , characters , and colors , it is not to be supposed that we can make any reader ' acquainted with it . by words of description . The most we can hope to accomplish is , that by giving some notes on its physical and social characteristics , we may excite a more curious and possibly a more intelligent interest in California life , and the certainly great scenes preparing to be revealed in that far off , outside , isolated state of the Republic . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may offer will be verified by the experiments and exact observations of science , or by the tests of moral and economical statistics ; we only look on with // our mere eyes , giving our impressions , and venturing what guesses and possible explications may occur to us . The first and most difficult thing to apprehend respecting California is the climate , upon which , of course , depend the advantages of health and physical development , the growths and their conditions and kinds , and the modus operandi , or general cast , of the seasons . But this , again , is scarcely possible , without dismissing , first of all , the word climate , and substituting the plural , climates . For it can not be said of California , as of New England , or the Middle States , that it has a climate . On the contrary , it has a great multitude , curiously pitched together , at short distances , one from another , defying too , not seldom , our most accepted notions of the effects of latitude and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , therefore , is to dismiss generalities , cease to look for a climate , and find , if we can , by what process the combinations and varieties are made ; for when we get hold of the manner and going on of causes , all the varieties are easily reducible . To make this matter intelligible , conceive that middle California , the region of which we now speak , lying between the head waters of the two great rivers , and about four hundred and fifty or five hundred miles long from north to south , is divided lengthwise , parallel to the coast , into three strips , or ribands of about equal width . First , the coast-wise region , comprising two , three , and sometimes four parallel tiers of mountains from five hundred to four thousand , five thousand , or even ten thousand feet high . Next , advancing inward , we have a middle strip , from fifty to seventy miles wide , of almost dead plain , which is called the great valley ; down the scarcely perceptible slopes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north , run the two great rivers , the Sacramento and the San Joaquim , to join their waters at the middle of the basin and pass off to the sea . The third long strip , or riband , is the slope of the Sierra Nevada chain , which bounds the great valley on the east , and contains in its foot-hills , or rather in its lower half , all the gold mines . The upper half is , to a // great extent , bare granite rock , and is crowned , at the summit , with snow , about eight months of the year . Now the climate of these parallel strips will be different almost of course , and subordinate , local differences , quite as remarkable , will result from subordinate features in the local configurations , particularly of the seaward strip or portion . For all the varieties of climate , distinct as they become , are made by variations wrought in the rates of motion , the courses , the temperature , and the dryness of a single wind ; viz , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward all the time , only with much greater power during that part of the day when the rarefaction of the great central valley comes to its aid ; that is from about ten o'clock in the morning , to the setting of the sun . Conceive such a wind , chilled by the cold waters that have come down from the Northern Pacific , perhaps from Behring Straits , combing the tops and wheeling round through the valleys of the coastwise mountains , crossing the great valley at a much retarded rate , and growing hot and dry , fanning gently the foot-hills and sides of the Sierra , still more retarded by the piling necessary to break over into Utah , and the conditions of the California climate , or climates , will be understood with general accuracy . Greater simplicity in the matter of climate is unpossible , and greater variety is hardly to be imagined . For the whole dry season , viz , from May to November , this wind is in regular blast , day by day , only sometimes approaching a little more nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drop of rain , however thick and rain-like the clouds it sometimes drives before it . The cloud element , indeed , is always in it . Sometimes it is floated above , in the manner commonly designated by the term cloud . Sometimes , as in the early morning , when the wind is most quiet , it may be seen as a kind of fog bank resting on the sea-wall mountains , or rolling down laudward through the insterstices of their summits . When the wind begins to hurry and take on less composedly , the fog becomes blown fog , a kind of lead dust driven through the air , reducing it from a transparent to a semi-transparent or merely translucent state , so that if any // 1858 . California , its Characteristics and Pro8pects. one looks up the bay , from a point twenty or thirty miles south of San Francisco , in the afternoon , lie will commonly see , directly abreast of the Golden Gate where this wind drives in with its greatest power , a pencil of the lead dust shooting upwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the aim of the wind preparing to leap the second chain of mountains , the other side of the bay , ) and finally tapering off and vanishing , at a mid-air point eight or ten miles inland , where the increased heat of the atmosphei'e has taken up the moisture , and restored its complete transparency . This wind is so cold , that one who will sit upon the deck of the afternoon steamer passing up the Bay , will even require his heaviest winter clothing . And so rough are the waters of the Bay , land-locked and narrow as it is , that sea-sickness is a kind of regular experience , with such as are candidates for that kind of felicity . We return now to the middle strip of the great valley where the engine , or rather boiler power , that operates the coast wind in a great part of its velocity , is located . Here the heat , reverberated as in a forge , or oven ( whence Gali-fornia ) becomes , even in the early spring , so much raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining cold there is in it , to condense the clouds , and rain ceases . A little further on in the season , there is not cooling influence enough . left to allow even the phenomena of cloud , and for weeks together , not a cloud will be seen , unless , by chance , the skirt of one may just appear now and then , hanging over the summit of the western mountains . The sun rises , fixing his hot stare on the world , and stares through the day . Then he returns as in an orrery , and stares through another , in exactly the same way . The thermometer will go up , not seldom , to 1000 or even 1100 , and judging by what we know of effects here in New England , we should suppose that life would scarcely be supportable . And yet there is much less suffering from heat in this valley than with us , for the reason probably that the nights are uniformly cool . The thermometer goes down regularly with the sun , and one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This cooling of the night is probably determined by the fact that the cool sea wind , sweeping through the // upper air of the valley , from the coast mountains on one side , over the mountains and mountain passes of the Sierra on the other , is not able to get down to the ground of the valley during the day , because of the powerfully steaming column of heat that rises from it ; but as soon as the sun goes down , it drops immediately to the level of the plain , bathing it for the night with a kind of perpendicular sea breeze , that has l6st for the time a great part of its lateral motion . The consequence is that no one is greatly debilitated by the heat . On the contrary , it is the general testimony , that a man can do as much of mental or bodily labor in this climate , as in any other . And it is a good confirmation of this opinion , that horses will here maintain a wonderful energy , traveling greater distances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal better than with us . It is also to be noted that there is no special tendency to fevers in this hot region , except in what is called the tule bottom , a kind of giant bulrush region , along the most depressed and marshiest portions of the rivers . Passing now to the eastern strip or portion , the slope of the Nevada , the heat , except in those deep caiions where the reverberation makes it sometimes even insupportable , is qualified in degree , according to the altitude . A gentle west wind , heated in the lower parts or foothills by the heat of the valley , fans it all day . At points which are higher the wind is cooler . Here also , on the slope of the Nevada , the nights are always cool in summer , so cool that the late and early frosts leave too short a space for the ordinary summer crop to mature , even where the altitude is not more than 3,000 or 4,000 feet . Meantime , at the top of the Sierra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks over into Utah , travelers undertake to say that , in some of the passes it blows with such stress as even to polish the rocks , by the gravel and sand which it drives before it . The day is cloudless on the slope of the Sierra , as in the valley , but omi the top there is now and then , or once in a year or two , a moderate thunder shower . With this exception , as referring to a part uninhabitable , thunder is scarcely ever heard in California . The principal thunders of California are underground . // We return now to the coast-wise mountain region , where the multiplicity and confusion of climates is most remarkable . Their variety we shall find depends on the courses of the wind currents , turned hither and thither by the mountains ; partly also on the side any given place occupies of its valley or mountain ; and partly on the proximity of the sea . Sprinkled in among these mountains , and more or less inclosed by them , are valleys , large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in California means something more than a scoop , or depression . It means a rich land-lake , leveled between the mountains , with a sharply defined , picturesque shore , where it meets the sides and runs into the indentations of the mountains . What is called the Bay of San Francisco , is a large salt water lake in the middle of a much larger land-lake , sometimes called the San Jose valley . It extends south of the city forty miles , and northward among islands and mountains , about twenty-five more , if we include what is called the San Pablo Bay . Three beautiful valleys of agricultural country , the Petaluma , Sonoma , and Napa valleys , open into this larger valley of the Bay on the north end of it , between four mountain barriers , having each a short navigable creek or inlet . Still farther north is the Russian River valley , opening towards the sea , and the Clear Lake valley and region , which is the Switzerland of California . East of the San Jose valley , too , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are the large Amador and San Ramon valleys , also the little gem of the Suiiole . Now these valleys , which if we except the great valley of the two rivers , comprise the plow-land of middle California , have each a climate of its own , and productions ' that correspond . We have only to observe further , that the east side of any valley will commonly be much warmer than the west ; for the very paradoxical reason that the cold coast-wind always blows much harder on the side or steep slope even , of a mountain , opposite or away from the wind , than it does on the side towards it , reversing all our notions of the sheltering effects of mountain ridges . Nothing will so fatally puzzle a stranger as the observing of this fact ; for he will doubt a long time , first , whether it be a e // fact , and then , what possible account to make of it . Crossing the Golden Gate in a small steamer , for example , to Sancelito , whence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a quiet shelter to the little craft , apparently in danger of foundering , when it comes under the lee of that grand mountain wall that almost overhangs the water on the west . But he is surprised , when he arrives , to find the wind blowing straight down the face of it , harder even than elsewhere , gouging into the water by a visible depression , and actually raising caps of white within a single rod of the shore . In San Francisco itself , he will find the cold coast-wind pouring down over the western barrier with uncomfortable rawness , when returning from a ride at Point Lobos , on the very beach of the sea , where the air was comparatively soft and quiet . So , crossing the Sonoma valley , he will come out into it from the west , through a cold , windy gorge , to find orange trees growing in Gen. Yallejo 's garden , close under the eastern valley wall , as finely as in Cuba . In multitudes of places too on the eastward slopes of the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all , their growth in the coast-wind season , have their tops thrown over , like cock 's tails turned away from the wind . After he has been sufficiently perplexed , and stumbled by these facts , he will finally strike upon the reason , viz , that this cold , trade wind , being once lifted or driven over the seawall mountains , and being specifically heavier than the atmosphere into which it is going , no sooner passes the summit than it pitches down as a cold cataract , with the uniformly accelerated motion of falling bodies . Then , as a confirmation , it will occur to him perhaps , that he has been seeing it demonstrated all summer long , from his residence on the opposite , or eastern side of the Bay ; where , during all the fore part of the day , and sometimes for the whole afternoon , he has noticed a fog cap , or cloud rolling over the distant top of the western mountain , and driving more than half-way down the hither side of it , before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having gotten the understanding of this fact , many things are made plain . For example , in traveling down the western // side of the Bay from Sail Francisco to San Jose , and passing directly under the mountain range just referred to , he has found himself passing through as many as four or five distinct climates ; for , when abreast of some gap or depression in the western wall , the heavy wind has poured down with a chilling coldness , making even an overcoat desirable , though it be a clear , summer day ; and then , when he is abreast of some high summit , which the fog-wind sweeps by , and therefore need not pass over , a sweltering and burning heat is felt , in which the lightest snmmer clothing is more than enough . He has also observed that directly opposite the Golden Gate , at Oakland , and the Alameda point , where the central column of this wind might be supposed to press most uncomfortably , the land is covered with growths of evergreen oak , standing fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , scarcely a tree is to be seen for many miles ; a mystery that is now explained by the fact that the wind , driving here square against the Contra Costa or second range , is piled and gets no current , till it slides off north and south from the point of quiet here made ; which also is confirmed by the fact , that , in riding down from San Pablo on the north , he has the wind in his face , finds it slacken as he approaches Oakland , and passing on still southward to San Leandro , has it blowing at his back . The varieties , and even what appeared to be the incredible anomalies of the California climates , begin at last to be more intelligible . The remarkable contrast , for example , between the climates of Benicia and Martinez is clearly accounted for . These two places , only a mile and a half apart , on opposite sides of the straits of Carquinez , and connected by a ferry , like two points on a river , are yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charleston and Quebec . Thus the Golden Gate column , wheeling upon Oakland , as just now described , sweeps along the face of the Contra Costa chain in its northward course , setting the few tree tops of San Pablo aslant , as weather vanes stuck fast by rust , and drives its cold sea-dust full in the face of Benicia . Meantime , at Martinez , close under the end of the mountain which has // turned the wind directly by , and is itself cloven down here to let the straits of Carquinez pass through , the sun shines hot and with an almost dazzling clearness , and all the characters of the climate belong rather to the great valley caldron , whose rim it may be said is here . Equally plain now is the solution of those apparent inversions of latitude which , at first , perplex the stranger . In the region about Marysville , for example , he is overtaken by a fierce sweltering heat in April , and scarcely hears , perhaps , in the travel of a day , a single bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He descends by steamer to San Francisco , and thence to San Jose , making a distance in all of more than two hundred miles , where he finds a cool , spring-like freshness in the air , and hears the birds screaming with song even more vehemently than in New England . It is as if he had passed out of a tropical into a temperate climate ; when , in fact , he is due south of Marysville by the whole distance passed over . But the mystery is all removed by the discovery , that instead of keeping in the great valley , he broke out of it through the straits of Carquinez into the Bay valley , and the cold bath atmosphere of the coast-wise mountains ; that now he is in fact within twenty miles of the sea , separated from it only by a single wall , while at Marysville , he i*Tas more than a hundred miles from the sea , with four or five high mountain tiers between . Thus much for the summer cliniate of California . The winter climate is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snows of incredible depth at the top , and they extend even down to its foot , whitening also not seldom , the great valley , which is much colder , at this season , than the coast-mountain region . Temperature , in short , is inverted , just as the winds are . The temperature in San Francisco , for example ranges generally between 600 and 70* , as in the summer between 65* and 80* though the cold of experience will be scarcely greater in the winter than in the summer , because , in winter , the air is comparatively still , and in summer adds a cooling effect by its motion . Probably there is not a more even climate in the world . Now and tht*n the thermometer // will sink low enough , at night , to produce a thin scale of ice , but geraniums will be seen in full blossom , on the terraces of the gardens , throughout the winter . It is hardly necessary to say that this westward return of the trade winds brings the rainy season . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blows too with terrific violence and pours even cascades of rain for whole days together , producing immense floods ; though generally the whole amount of rain which it brings is much too small , for the supply of the springs and the due moistening of the soil for the year . It is not to be understood that what is called the rainy season is a season of continual rain . It is scarcely more rainy , if at all , than our three autumnal months . And at about the mid-point of the season , or in the month of February , there is commonly a suspension , which separates what may be called the early from the latter rain , as in Palestine . This month of February is , in fact , the most lovely and , in many respects , the most beautiful month of the year . The green of the landscape is then freshest , the air is soft , the sky clear , the roads neither wet nor dusty-all the conditions of comfort and beauty meet , to crown it as the June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have spent too much time on the winds and meteorologic phenomena of California , it is sufficient to answer , that while such an impression would be right if Kew England were the subject , it is not right when the subject is California . The winds of our Eastern shore are a confused mixture of which nothing can be predicated with certainty , except the uncertainty of the weather . The Pacific winds , on the other hand , are very nearly calculable quantities ; and by them are determined , to a great degree , the temperature of places , the rains , the seasons , the almost uniform salubrity of the country , ( for with all its varieties there is probably no healthier region on the globe , ) the growths also , as respects both their rates and kinds , and further still , the immense commercial advantages ; for California , as we shall by and by see , is elected for the great metropolitan centre of the commerce of the Pacific , quite as much by its winds , as by the magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the ships // fly in , as doves to their windows , from all the seas of the world . The gold of California , taken as a determining cause and physical endowment of its future , is not once to be coinpared with its winds . They are more necessary , by a thousand times , to the greatness of California than the mines . If any one judges , from our description , that they are too cold , or too strong , or too much laden with moisture , he will greatly mistake . If they were warmer , softer and more dry on the coast , even by a few degrees , it would greatly injure the country and might even be a fatal blight on its prospects . Indeed , if California has any prospects , it is just because the light baffling winds , or rather no winds of the coast below , are here displaced by such blasts as have power to drive across its whole width and fan it with their cooling breath . Otherwise its rich valleys and lowlands would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , and even its mining region too hot to be worked or even inhabited , in the summer months . Having gotten our advantage therefore , in a due understanding of the winds and the climate of California , our description may now proceed more rapidly . The scenery of California depends partly on the surfaces and partly on the seasons . It differs from our Eastern shore , in the fact that it is made up of concave or scooped surfaces , flowing into convex summits or rounded surfaces , only to a very limited extent ; all the valleys being plains , or land-lakes , with definite indented shores , like shores of water . It differs also from the western prairies and the plains of the south , where the horizon is sunk and the sky becomes a small inverted bowl , in the fact that every spot , even in the widest of the valleys , has a mountain wall and horizon visible in the distance , which props the sky and lifts the vault of it , giving a look of airiness and expansion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plain , plain and mountain , stretching generally coastwise in their figure , make up the rough calico of the surface . Sometimes the mountains are bare , or nearly so , showing a mottled look in the distance , where the sun , glancing down their sides , burnishes the points and casts a shade on the hollows . Here // the cattle on a thousand hills are no figure ; for the hills are pastures , covered many of them with a rich growth of grass and wild oats even to the top , and the cattle paths , beaten like shelve rows into their steep sides , just save them apparently from sliding off into the abysses , making every rod of pasture accessible and permitting them finally to emerge , as the triumph of their engineering instinct , on summits 2,000 , or even 3,000 feet high , where they are seen from below , in clean relief on the sky . Sometimes again the mountain sides are covered with a dense chapparal , appearing in the distance just as they would if darkened by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapparal is of a most intense , transparently green color , showing a summit that emerges into the sun , when surrounded by the driving clouds below , like a huge pile of emerald . Sometimes the distant summits are seen to be covered with a growth of redwoods , that stand posted there as giant sentinels , every trunk distinctly visible , and all together , 200 or 300 feet high , combing the sky in dark relief upon it , giving to the horizon thus a most peculiar look of spirit and majesty . The lower half of the Sierra Nevada , comprising the foothills and the whole mining region , is covered extensively with a timber growth of pines , cedars and other evergreens . The upper half is bald , ragged granite , the highest peaks of which are covered a great part of the year with snow . All the mountains differ from those of the east , in the fact that they are seamed or furrowed from the tops downward , every few rods , by a ravine or water course . These ravines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least frequently , displaying a green line of shrubbery and trees in their course , which makes them very conspicuous from a distance ; especially when the mountains are bare on their general surface . These ravines , too , are often cut miles deep into the hills , becoming immense chasms , cahons or gorges , out of which all the earth has been swept , to fill the rich valley bottom and make up the land-lake deposit of the plain . All the mountains accordingly are flanked by spurs with intervening gorges , and these again by spurs , and these again by the same ; so that , standing on the side of some grand amphitheatre , the spectator may sometimes // see that he is on the spur of a spur , even in the fifth degree ; all of which spurs are run together , like pig iron castings in a furnace , only with a more disorderly complication . Hence , too , the impossibility in California , as we may here remark in passing , that any railroad should ever get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along its sides till it has made the ascent ; for such a line would be cut by the side ca*mons , or gorges , from a hundred to a thousand or even two thousand feet deep , every half mile . There is no way but to follow up the bottom of some great caijon , or river gorge , till it becomes too steep , and escape by a tunnel ; or else to find some spur whose back can be ascended , and keep it to the top . From these general descriptions of the surface it will be naturally inferred that there is a great deal , both of beautiful and of grand scenery , in California . Few countries are richer in their varieties , and none more peculiar in all . here sleeps in quiet , earthly beauty the rich vale of Sonoma , backed in rough grandeur by the towering Diabolo , a picture in a frame . Here in the deep chasm or angle that foots the Yo Hamite Falls , a river is beheld pitching off a summit 2,400 feet high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it were , of heaven 's mercy pouring from the sky . Here on the other hand , at the Geysers , in the cracking , cannonading , whistling and roaring of steam , and the spouting of hot mud , and the brimstone fumes of the place , we look on a field , under which we may well enough imagine the infernals , sweltering and tearing , as it were , diabolically , to break loose . At the Big Trees , we enter a dell , quietly lapped in the mountains , where the majestic vegetable minarets are crowded , as in sonme city of pilgrimage ; there to look up , for the first time , in silent awe of the mere life principle . The scene of the city and bay , from the high background of the city , is one that any lover of nature might travel far to see . The same reversed , from the east side of the bay , at Clinton , is more remarkable . In the unalterable green foreground , are the oaks of Oakland and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armlet of water ; next comes the Bay , in the middle , with its picturesque islands ; beyond are the // city , and the open Gate showing the Farralone Islands far off at sea ; right and left , each side of the Gate , the grand sea-wall of mountains stretches north and south , for a background , at least fifty miles-it is not the bay of Naples , the dreamy softness and quiet luxury are not here , but with more severity , the scene unites a higher spirit and a beauty as much more impressive and brilliant . The Gate itself , cleaving down the mountains , to let the commerce of the Great Ocean of the world pass in , has a look of destiny in it strong enongh to be snblime . There is a little valley owned by a wealthy and respectable Spanish Californian , Mr. Suhole , which is commonly called by his name , and is occupied as a pasture ground or ranch for his herds . It lies over among the Contra Costa , or second range of mountains east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass some four hundred feet above the valley bottom , which comprises about a thousand acres . Through this valley bottom runs a clear , rapid stream , which , in the spring , would be called a river , and which , wheeling round to the northwest , cuts the monntain to its base , dashing through one of the wildest gorges that can be conceived , 1,500 feet deep , and hurrying off into the Bay . On the north rises a huge bare summit 2,000 feet high . On the southwest the Mission Peak , 2,500 feet high . On the southeast , across the narrow wooded-gorge , through which the river breaks into the valley , other fantastic peaks 3,000 feet high . On the east , the enclosure is made by a low , steep range of naked hills showing others , higher and still higher , behind them . A stranger , fresh arrived in May , at the Mission , takes his horse , for example , the next morning , and finding a road that turns into the narrow gorge , or opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little and find whither it leads . The steep , smoothfaced hills , or rather mountains , pile in with rounding fronts on either side , just leaving a passage between , and they are so lighted up by the sun brushing down their translucent surfaces of green , and tuned to such wild harmony by their many-colored flowers , that sight overflows , and he begins unwittingly to listen ; as if there must be something // audible , some hymn or note of Memnon in the scene . Passing a low summit the beautiful valley opens to view , and such a combination of colors no eastern man or European has ever seen or conceived . The green is not what we call a grass green . Neither is it the pale bluish green of England , but a soft yellow green , covering the whole landscape , the steeps even to their summits , all the roundings and hollows , as well as the rich floor of the valley bottom , like an immense carpet of plush spread over the scene ; which carpet is so matted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in groups , that we call it by this name without any effort of fancy-we can think of nothing else . No painter , practiced in our common styles of scenery , could manage at all such a picture , without much study , assisted probably by many failures . Descending next into the valley , he finishes out the picturesque of the morning , in looking on a scene quite as new and peculiar as the scenery . In the extreme southern angle of the plain , just where the river issues from the gorge of the mountains , he observes a cloud of dust rising , and horsemen rushing wildly through it in all directions . Something brisk is evideutly going on here , and he must needs find what it is . Approaching the spot he discovers an immense herd of cattle brought together from the hills , which the owners and their herdsmen are either sorting by their marks , or which else they are sorting out , in sale of a part , for the market-they are Spanish , native Californians all , and do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are gathering out of the great herd of a thousand or more , to make up another and separate herd a short distance off , and the lasso practice is the power . Riding into the herd and through it , they chase out one , turning him towards the new herd . But he runs by , and back into the herd , or he strikes out into the plain , in some other direction . But the pursuer is after him . Round and round swings the fatal loop or noose above his head as he goes , till he gets within reach , at three or four rods distance , when he lets it fly , and it drops with a kind of astronomic // certainty round the poor animal 's horns . Feeling it fast upon him , the animal now turns upon his persecutor , and it is convenient for him also to fly in his turn-only keeping the cord still fast to the horn of his saddle . Another horseman follows immediately , and another lasso drops and is drawn fast . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strikes off , throwing his whole momentum , if lie can , upon the straight line , at right angles to it , which gives him advantage enough to unhorse both of them , if they let him come to the blow . All three , therefore , now are in a race together , and as soon as this is seen , a third horseman is in pursuit , and throwing his lasso , he picks up a hind leg of the ox as he runs , doing it as easily as a knitter might take up a fallen stitch . This done , while the two others are spreading right and left , he darts off sideways in a prick of the spur , and jerks the refractory beast flat upon the ground ; where he lies bellowing in fright and despair , held fast by three cords , at three angles , as little able to escape as a fly in a spider 's web . Next a huge , fiery bull is seen rushing out of the herd , pursued by a small , sharp looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye , that he will show the green stranger a trick . Bolting into the plain , the mettlesome , tall animal , leads off in a race which puts the horse to his best speed . But as the pursuer comes up with him , he seizes the tail of the renegade , streaming level behind him , winds it by a quick turn round the horn of his saddle , and darting off suddenly by a spring , as if it were done by some concussion of gunpowder , he jerks the bull flat down and rolls him clean over ! Whereupon there is a shout from all  --  but the bull ; who gets up , as it were , in an effort of self-recollection , and walks off meekly where they show him the way . We only add , as regards the scenery in California , that everything is here inverted which we commonly assume in respect to the effects of culture . Culture improves nothing . California was finished as a world of beauty , before civilization appeared . The magnificent valleys opened wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there , and took away the nakedness . Civilization comes , cuts down the oaks for firewood , fences off the plains into squares , covers them // with grain or stubble , scatters wild mustard over them , it may be , and converts them into a weedy looking desolation . The only attractive looking surface ever to be seen in California , is the native original surface ; for there is never to be a lawn , or a neat grassy slope , as with us , because there is no proper turf . Shrubbery itself can never be made ornamental in California , except where there is irrigation to maintain it . Where there is irrigation , a garden or house lot may be covered in with trees and set off with flowers , so as to be really fresh in beauty at all times , but this is not the kind of beauty that makes a landscape . In the mining country , the natural beauty of the scenery is defaced by another process . here a thin but stately growth of evergreens is sprinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a pure crystal stream leaps along down the trough of the hills , over cliffs of rock and pebbly beds . But the miner comes . Finding gold that will " pay " in the soil , he rents a head of water from the Ditch Company , whose ditch , bringing on the water from some level far up in the Sierra , flows it along from hilltop down to hill top , and across from one hill to another , leaping hollows and ravines on wooden tressle work , sometimes even two hundred feet high , till it reaches a point abreast of his placer , and di . rectly above it . Bringing it down the hill in an immense cotton hose , with a *ozzle pipe like that of a fire engine , he plays it into the side of the hill , with a pressure of perhaps one hundred and fifty feet fall ; tears down the hill , acre by acre , and floats it off , rolling the loose stones with it down his wooden trunk or sluice , in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has carried off a large section of the hill side , even a hundred feet deep . His neighbors are doing the same thing right and left . Pits also are sunk downward , and tunnels bored in level into the sides of the hills , and the earth from so many burrows , is piled at their mouths . The trees are cut down for timber and fire wood . The stream of the valley runs thick with creamy richness , and the cliffs and pebbly beds are covered fifty feet deep with stones and mudwashings . The result is a most horrid desolation , of which every line of the natural beauty is gone forever , if some // camp of demons had been pitched here for a year , tearing the earth by their fury , and converting it to the model of their own bad thought , they could hardly make it look worse . The whole mining region is finally to become a desolation in just this manner . There is no possibility of a process more delicate for extracting the gold . Indeed there seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must needs recognize , that gold and desolation go together . What we see then , at the mines , only represents too faithfully what holds good historically in the moral desolations of plunder , fraud , and avarice , instigated by this treasure of the mountains . The only part of California , in short , that will not be damaged in its scenery by the arrival of culture , is the broken country of the coast region , or the region of natural pasturage ; except that possibly the Artesian wells may be carried so far as to irrigate a considerable part of the valley surfaces . Thus , while there is almost no stream running through a valley bottom in the summer , because every issue from the mountains sinks immediately into the gravel beds of the plains , and runs under , it may turn out generally , in the narrow valleys , as in that of San Jose , that Artesian wells , sunk two hundred or three hundred feet , will bring it up , spouting into liberty on the surface . Two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches in diameter , ten or fifteen feet high , discharging water enough to turn a mill and of course to irrigate a large surface . It will doubtless occur to many , that the dry season of the year , which is the summer , must be a season of utter desolation as regards the scenery . What can be more desolate than a universal dry death ? And if the water-runs , or ravines are green , if the chapparal on some of the mountains , and occasionally trees in the plains , that have the faculty to bore deep for their water , show a semblance of life , if the gardens which are irrigated show a patch of luxuriancy here and there , like an oasis in the yellow desert , what after all is the landscape but a desert ? Suppose then it were to be covered with snows two or three feet deep , and every solitary thing stripped of its green , would the scenery be less desolate ? But this is our winter . The wintry , or suspension time of California is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almanac are dressed in , the richest , freshest green . And yet the Californians all speak of beautiful scenery in the summer , and any one who has been there a few months begins to sympathize with them . Trees and chapparal are stronger marks on the landscape than with us , green spots , such as watered fields and gardens , have a fascinating freshness . And even the dry surfaces , in certain lights , make a picture , by aid of the shadows on the hollow surfaces , and the occasional green of trees and chapparal and gardens , that is really beautiful . The little valley just described , for example , puts off its green and takes on a dress of drab , velvety and soft in the glancing strokes of the light , and becomes for all the world a neat Quaker bonnet ; only that the deep blue green of the gorges , and the lively green ribands that dangle down the water courses are a little too dressy and fantastic , and suggest a case of sumptuary discipline . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that while our winter is absolute , unconquerable desolation , the Californian can go into his garden , turn on the water , make an outdoor green-house of it , filled with all richest fruits and singing birds , and there wait patiently till the months of green return . The growths of California are as peculiar and various as their climate . To make this subject intelligible , let it be understood that where there is no irrigation , natural or artificial , nothing grows perennially in California , except trees that have a tap root , and shrubs and grasses that have some peculiar kind of root that enables them to get sufficient moisture , where only a little is given . There is a coarse , perennial grass , for example , that is found , when dug , to grow out of perpendicular rootlets eight or ten inches long , which themselves grow out of large horizontal roots , that serve as water cisterns or sponges for the uses overhead . None of the common upland , or hay grasses , live through the summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The grasses of every season are started in November , from the ripe seeds dropped into the chinks of the ground , in the dry season previous . It results accordingly , // that no crop can be raised in California , which does not ripen before the dry season commences , or by about the first of June . The only exceptions possible to this are made by irrigation , either where water is artificially supplied , or where , as will sometimes be the case , there is a supply from stores , or filterings underneath . It is only under these conditions that a crop of Indian corn , or potatoes , can be raised . Though an early crop of potatoes , ripening in June or in July , can be raised anywhere ; and where the ground is sufficiently moistened from below , two crops a year are frequently grown upon the same soil . Potatoes of the late crop are grown too in some places near the coast , where they get moisture enough from the atmosphere and the fog , to answer their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor figure , unless it is recruited by supplies of water not contained in the natural soil of the place . The dry season is , in fact , the wintering season of vegetation , though it is the summer . Whatever lives , hybernates , rests . The strawberry , for example , ripens its fruit in April , has its growth , ceases , begins to look rusty , and passes into the state of suspension , finally to die . Let on now a flow of water , and it wakes , blossoms again , bears another crop , and passes into a second suspension , and then is ready to be wakened and bear a third crop . And so by alternating in times with different beds , a succession is kept up , and a bountiful supply is obtained from April to November . The principal growths , or products of California , are accordingly the fruits and the cereals . Most of the fruits really want irrigation , though there are many tracts ofj soil in which they will flourish without , and will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olives , pomnegranates , almonds , plums , apricots , pears , peaches and apples . Finer grapes are grown nowhere in the world . The apples are large and fair , and wonderfully precocious in bearing , but there is reason to suspect , from experiments made in the old mission gardens , that they may be short lived . Peaches , plums , and pears bear only too profusely . Indeed , there is a wondrous tendency to fructification in every kind of growth , animal and vegetable . YOL. xvi . 11 // As yet , the fruits sell at enormous prices , because of the shortness of suppiy . In a very few years they will be plenty and cheap . And even now there is no city on the earth , where the fruit shops make as fine a show as in San Francisco . Considering the size , the fairness , the varieties , and all that goes to make a show of richness and profusion , there is probably nothing in the world , to match the displays of fruit in this new city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California are the cereals , wheat , and barley , and oats . These are sown at any time , when it is both wet euongh and dry enough to plow , between November and March ; harvested any time between the ripening of June and the rain-falls of November ; for they will stand uninjured , or lie , as left by the reaper , uninjured and without shelling , all that time ; so that a small force suffices both to raise and to harvest a large crop . And the yield is from twenty to sixty bushels of wheat to the acre , subject to no contingencies but wet and premature drought , which latter only shortens the crop . Even one hundred and forty bushels of barley have been harvested on a single acre . Oats are said to degenerate in the seeding , but we have seen the stalk even twelve feet high . These crops , again , will sow themselves for a second crop the next year , and that will yield more than any crop sown in the Western or Atlantic states . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop of barley . This , in fact , is one of the evils to be encountered by California agriculture , that every crop perpetuates itself as a weed ; so that no good wheat crop , for example , can be raised on a field once sown with barley , till the barley is exterminated ; and one barley-sowing will sometimes yield three or four volunteer crops that are worth harvesting . Even potatoes will perpetuate themselves in the same way . Change of crops , therefore , is difficult . When the problem accordingly is raised , how or by what process exhausted soils are to be restored in California , it is not easy now to answer ; but some process will be doubtless discovered in due time . In many cases this exhaustion will conic to pass slowly ; for the good soil is not unfrequently two , and three , and sometimes eight // feet deep . A piece of ground sown regularly with wheat for sixteen years , has been known to yield forty bushels and more to the acre . A single deep plowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen years . As regards the enormous growths of California , it should be understood that they are not ordinary . The ordinary fruits , for example , are not larger than ours , and where the trees are overloaded are commonly small . The extraordinary growths appear to be easily accounted for . First , there is a soil too deep and rich for any kind of growth to measure it . Next , there is either a natural under-supply of water , or an artificial irrigation . Next , the settings of fruit are limited . And then , as no time is lost in cloudings and rain , and the sun drives on his work unimpeded , month by month , the growth is pushed to its utmost limit . So a pear will occasionally be produced weighing three and a half pounds , or an apple-tree , or a cherry , will grow a stein ten or twelve feet high in a season . The mammoth turnips , onions , beets and cabbages , depend on a like concurrence . But these are freaks , or extravagances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . The Big Trees depend , in part , on these same contingencies , and partly on the remarkable longevity of their species . A tree that is watered without rain , having a deep vegetable mold in which to stand , and not so much as one hour 's umbrella of cloud , to fence off the sun , for the whole warm season , and a capacity to live withal for two thousand years or more , may as well grow three hundred and fifty or four hundred feet high and twenty-five feet in diameter , and show the very centrepoint or pith still sound , at the age of thirteen hundred years , as to make any smaller figure with conditions proportionally restricted . The agricultural capacities of California , it will be seen , are very great as regards the rate and facility of production . The only drawback now experienced is in the want of a reliable and sufficient market . The mines and the cities are now the principal consumers . The result is , that if the product is a little short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply . On the other hand , if it is a little over the // demand , the prices fall as extravagantly . And then , as the producers are flying always towards that which yields the best reward , every kind of product is likely to be overgrown in its turn , and so the prices become even m&amp;re capricious , for the reason that they are capricious . When markets are opened by au outside commerce , as they will be , and when all the whaling ships are fitted and sent out from San Francisco and Puget Sound , the mischief will be repaired . At present , owing to this caprice of the market , agriculture is scarcely less of a ventnre , than mining . Accordingly the attention of land owners is now being turned , more than before , to pasturage . The old Spanish breed of cattle is giving way to the new cultivated breeds most valued here , and large ranges of land are taken up in the hill re*ious , where immense herds of from one to teii thousand head of cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their owners . These herds are kept sometimes wholly without fodder , and generally with very little . They fatten most in the summer , when the feed is dry , and only suffer , when the falling rains have rotted the old growth , and h.ave not yet sufficiently started the new . Hence it is common to burn over a considerable portion of the ranges , just before the rains , that the cattle may be able to get access to the first sprouting of the seeds , at the earliest n'ioinent possible . The air , accordingly , is filled with smoke for many days ; the mountains are flaming round the horizon day and night , as if the last day had come , and horsemen are rushing hither and thither to fight off the fires from the wheat fields and tile pastures of the plains . And then the result is , that the yellow , yellow , ever yellow hills that were , as soon as a good rain has sprouted the seeds , come forth-green out of black-and the body of the high burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without so much as a twig , or a weed-stalk , to mar the color . This great interest of pasturage promises even to exceed the plowing interest in importance . The home market for it is equally reliable , and the salted and dried meats , the hides , the tallow , and wool , are products that can take the world for their market . // The culture of the grape , too , promises much . Whether it can be successfully prosecuted without irrigation is doubtful , though it is well known that old , deep rooted vines will bear a crop without . It is commonly believed that California is hereafter to become the great wine growing country of the Pacific . With so many advantages , it is impossible that California should not become one of the richest countries in the world , on the score of its mere land interest and the products yielded by its soil . It has garnered up also , in the soil itself , treasures that no other country can boast . It will take a thousand years to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is computed also to have , in a single quartz lead , more gold , five times over , than is now owned by the whole world ; and other veins are being opened , almost every month , which are ready to yield great revenues of profit , as soon as they are worked . The quartz mills , once supposed to be a failure , are now so perfected as to yield immense profits , almost without exception . Time waters too of the mountain are a great wealth , and the thirty or forty millions already invested in the ditches , ought to be yielding a great revenue , as much of it already is . Besides , there are mines of quicksilver , such as make all other mines in the world comparatively worthless , deposits of borax , rocks of alum , hills of sulphur , quarries of marble , beds of coal and of iron-in short , there was never a country so underlaid with treasure of every kind . The commercial advantages are not yet developed , and will not be , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the untold riches of their natural resources are brought into the circulations of trade . Even if a railroad were built across the continent , it is not likely that any very great amount of merchandise , or any but the most precious forms of merchandise , would pass that way . Probably there is a greater amount of expectation vested in such an improvement , than the actual experinment will justify . The distance is too great , the grades too heavy , ( as heretofore reported , ) the running expenses too enormous , to allow the freight of any common articles of trade . // And yet California is on the great water highway of the Pacific , and her Gate the certain goal of its travel . For it is remarkable that this Golden Gate is at the southmost limb of the variable trade winds , and that these , blowing in , a little from the south of west , and out , from a little north of east , will drive a ship directly out to China , or directly in from Chinawhichever way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth ; while , immediately south of the Gate , the winds begin to change character , and are much less available for sailing purposes* and continue to be so , even down as far in south latitude as to Yalparaiso . Thus to sail a ship up the western coast of the continent , from Panama to San Francisco , would probably require a whole summer , and even that might not suffice for the passage . No ship can ever approach that shore by sail without falling into a contest with currents , which the light baffling winds and Doldrums make it difficult to maintain with success . To get in is difficult , to get away more difficult . And hence perhaps it is , at least in part , that one may pass down that whole stretch of coast , a distance of 3000 miles , in one of the California steamers , and actually not see , on the passage , so much as a rag of sail of any description . On the other hand , at Puget Sound , the only available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast with such violence , that vessels after pounding there for weeks together , till the crews were quite worn out , have returned to San Francisco to refit for a new trial . Besides in the winter trades , which are from the northeast , a vessel sailing from China for the Sound will have the whole distance to make , with a wind directly against her ; while she might lay her course for San Francisco and straight in , without once shifting her sail . Nature , it will thus be seen , has set her seal on San Francisco , appointing it to be the great commercial centre of that coast and ocean . Here rests the future axis of motion . Indeed it is hardly extravagant to imagine that , in some distant age , when the enterprise and the resources of that Ocean , with its islands and coasts , are fully developed , the Atlantic commerce will be a thing by the way , an affair of the outskirts . // All such expectations , it is obvious , must depend , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California . And here one very great danger happily is already past ; viz , the introduction of human slavery . There is no state in the Union where slavery could be worked to greater advantage than in California . Connected with this fact we have also the concomitant fact , that the office-holders and political operators of the state have very generally been men from the South . To understand , therefore , even after the fact , how it is that slavery is excluded , is what any stranger will accomplish with the greatest difficulty . No inquiries he can make will quite solve the riddle . Some have spoken of the known weight of the laboring and money making classes , being always opposed to slavery , and silently constraining the politicians , who were not , to respect their position . Some have ascribed much to the personal influence of Mr. Fremont . Others have given the credit of the fact mainly to Capt . ilalleck , sometimes called the father of the constitution , a gentleman of great weight and capacity , who is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but has since that time given himself wholly to his profession as a lawyer , and withdrawn himself altogether from the game of political life . Be it as it may , slavery is forever excluded from California , and so from that whole coast ; and that without even so much as a word of debate ; for this article of the constitution was simply read and passed by consent , in absolute silence . What a fact of history , this , to be the child of silence ! California unites in its population great elements of diversity . The 50,000 or 60,000 Chinese simply stay as foreigners . The native Californian or Spanish race , comprises gentlemen of real respectability , wealth , and character ; but the inferior class of herdsmen and retainers that were , are more wild and vicious , and really more hopeless , than before the change of masters . They live on horseback , without contracting any friendship with their horses , which might raise them a little . They are cruel to animals of all kinds , cowardly to superiors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being advanced to anything better hereafter . // A considerable part of the emigration to California , since we took possession , is made up of persons from the extreme west , who crossed over by the plains  --  the class who are called Bordei* Ruffians with us , and which there are called , more or less derisively , Pikes , from Pike county in Missouri . They are , by no means , any such desperate , or ruffian class of people , as they are just now commonly regarded here . They are , for the most part , uncultivated and rough , crude in their notions of religion , and like all such people , coarse in their prejudices ; but they have great honesty and frankness , their impulses are strong , and generally magnanimous . They really contain the staple qualities , or possibilities of a high character . They have true manhood , which is not to be said of every people . Another element of the emigration is from the southern , or southwestern states , comprising many gentlemen , with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manners of the cities , and particularly of San Francisco ; and , with these , a much larger , or at least noisier class of broken down politicians , who have fled , as it were , to California , to farm the voters and offices of a new world , where their stock of capital has not yet been exhausted . The former class comprises men who appear , like Mr. Stanley , to have emigrated rather to get away from political life , and to apply themselves to other pursuits . The latter , trained to public speaking and the management of assemblies , and having this for their trade , have hith* erto been able to obtain almost all the offices df the state , and have distributed the rewards of office to themselves , in a scale of unexampled liberality . Happily there was an end to the credit of the state , and that limit has been finally reached . The bankrupt people too , are beginning to ask questions they had no time to ask before ; competitors also are coming into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been already proved . The dynasty of plunder , therefore , is rapidly coming to an end . Another large class of the emigration is from New England , New York and the Middle and Northwestern states . And these again are in two classes . First the merchants , bankers , lawyers , engineers , surveyors , and many of the head mi*mersmen // who have come to California as to a field of enterprise , and who bend all their energies to the particular personal calling that engages them . Secondly , a class of reprobates in all styles and degrees , who find their way to California , just because they are not wanted anywhere . These are the fugitives from justice , the absconding bigamists , the felons and prison birds who want a new field where they are not known , defalcators , pimps , shoulder strikers and prize fighters , drunkards , sons that could not be endured at home , and vagabond gentlemen whose friends have been willing to escape the burden of their support , by giving them an outfit for some very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a 0 time , in shoals , upon California . But the pistol , the knife , the halter , the bad liquors , and the Vigilance Committees are scattering them rapidly and killing them off . They flourished for a time , as the under-fighters and ballot-box operators pf the politician class just referred to ; assuming the alliance to be one of natural good fellowship , inasmuch as they too use the tools of honor themselves . But their trade is gone , they can not even be drunk in the streets , or draw a kni'fe out of their pocket , without a painfully certain prospect of appearing in the chain gang the next morning . Meantime , the former and better class above named , with many of the better class from the South , are building churches , organizing insti - tutions , looking after charities , and showing more and more distinctly that the great hope of California is in them . They will even consent to serve on juries , and some of them also to be named for public offices of trust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving them the controlling position , as by a kind of necessary process , and even compelling them to assume it . The composition , or the combined elements of the emigration , it will be seen , are not favorable to the immediate coalescence of the new state , in terms of order and public virtue . Besides a good many hostile influences of a more special character , it will be easy to perceive , concur in detaining or holding back the new community , from the kind of civil administration necessary to its good name and social comfort . // Thus , in the mining towns , are gathered large bodies of men , without wives or children , living as cenobites in their dens , and no one needs to be informed that men , living separately from women , are sure to make a large stride towards barbarism . The occupation of mining is also more adventurous in itselS than consists with the best habits of application ; for if the digging is a venture , why should there not be a venture at the gambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the placer mining gives out , and it is known to be always more or less precarious . Hence many of the towns are mere encampments , and are called " camps . " And some that assumed to be more are already given up and nearly forsaken . Hence the miners become more or less migratory themselves , and their towns are too nearly so , many of them , to be much cared for , either in the building , or in the establishment of social and religious institutions . A stranger , too , will see a very distinct and significant character in the names given to places ; such as Yankee Jim , Fiddletown , Jackass ' Gulch , Whisky Bar , and a whole hundred names , of which , these are the choicer specimens . It appears to be the general opinion , that there is a decided moral and social unprovement in the mining population . But one who has attended church for two Sundays , in a mining town of the very first order , finding about forty persons present to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when returning from church , in both cases , full five hundred men , who had rushed together as spectators of a street fight , will hardly think it possible that there should have been a very great moral improvement there . Agriculture , too , has been connected , in California , with unwonted and even wholly peculiar causes of moral deterioration . The titles to land have many of them been so uncertain , or so far unsettled , by frauds and charges of fraud , that there has been a natural reluctance in emigrants to incur the risk of a loss , in purchasing the soil . hence , also , in part , the very peculiar kind of that has come into vogue in California , and probably a full half of the agriculture of the state is either now , or at some former time , has been // carried on , as an operation of sqnatting in this manner , viz , by taking possession of lands gene rally known to be vested in private owners by a title derived from the Mexican government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories , where the laws of Congress authorize the occupation and make it a perfectly legitimate act . An American purchaser , for example , buys one of the old Mission properties , coinprising a tract , seven or eight miles square , of the very best land in California , and everybody knows the title to be perfect , because the land has been held and occupied by the Mission , for more than fifty years . lie expends over $100,000 in fencing it , and the property rises in value so rapidly , that he begins to be rated and to rate himself as being wor th , at least , a million of dollars . But behold , a cloud of squatters suddenly appears pouring in upon his lands , squatting inside of his fences and among his wheat , erecting their tents or hnts , and leaving him to pay the taxes , while they reap the harvests . ile is now the bankrupt purchaser and they are the occupants , till at least six or eight years of litigation , terminated at Washington , have established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in himself . Meantime they have gotten the use or rent for so many years , which is to them a handsome outfit . The old native Californians are treated in the same way . No chapter of wrong and oppression , in which our countrymen have had their part , is more sad or revolting . Even between the old ranchero 's house and well , the squatter has taken his post and set up his lint . Then , assuming also that the cattle are wild , as that the lands are public , the squatter wanting a steak has taken his rifle and killed an ox . And so the poor herdsman has been stripped both of lands and herds , by these remorseless Sabeaus , and that with airs of indignity and low-bred consequence , more difficult to bear than the robberies themselves . The truculent savage spirit gemierated by these land-piracies , will be readily understood . The tragedy of young Suiiole is happily an extreme instance , lie was a gentleman , educated , as we have heard , in Paris , equal , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the educated Americans . // But he ventured to remonstrate very gently with a squatter for cutting down the trees of his father 's exquisite little valley in the mountains , and selling them for wood , giving him liberty at the same time , to cut what he wanted for himself ; but the next time he passed by , on his way over to the ranch , in company with a friend , the savage came out with his rifle , got him in range as he threw himself over on the side of his horse , and drew him dead to the ground . Sheltered and secreted by others like himself , lie could never be found . As the titles are now being settled by the decisions of the courts , the squatters are very gradually yielding to the law and becoming purchasers . All these wrongs will finally be a thing of the past . By the very latest advices , it appears that the squatter combination is just beginning to yield sonic respect to the decisions of law . Heretofore the owners , in establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a i'ight to pay the taxes . Indeed , this third estate of squatterdoni had sufficient power in the legislature , two years ago , to *et a law enacted , requiring owners , when dislodging or ejecting them , to pay for the improvements , according to the apprisal of a committee from the precinct ; a plan by which they expected to get back the value of the land ; for the apprisers would be squatters almost of course . Happily the courts would not execute the law . And but a year since , the venerable patriarch of the Napa valley , who came over from Missouri as a trapper , more than forty years ago , having finally established his old honiestead title , comprising eight or ten thousand acres of the best land in the state , was evidently beginning also to find a much harder question on his hands ; viz , how to move the squatters without periling his life . And yet , among these land-pirates , called squatters , are a great many persons from the East , and even from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our Christian churches ; and some of them appear even now to be seriously minded and conscientious in their life . Because the same word , squatter , is used to designate this known act of . robbery , ( for it is often such and nothing else , ) they really // suppose that they are doing the same lawful and right thing , which is practiced under the acts of Congress , at the West . As the milling and the agriculture of California appear , thus far , to have been connected with unpropitious moral influences , so also it has been , even to a much greater degree , with the trade of politics . Composed of elements so various and repellant , it was not to be expected , for a time , that there would be much confidence in public men or proceedings . And the moral character of the political operators and office holders was generally not of a kind to inspire confidence . They were gamblers , debauchees , drunkards , men who lined their bosoms , not with virtue , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in short , as could never be in confidence , even if they violated no trust . The bullies they had in their employ , as inspectors of the ballot , could not swear to a true count and be believed . Juries were distrusted , because the panel was so easily made up , to include one whom the criminal , on trial , might " hang , " to stand out for him in the verdict . The judges were such characters that they plainly ought to be bribed , if they were not . Administrators and trustees were suspected , as being appointed by the connivance of judges . Legislators and governors were distrusted also . This distrust became , in due time , a torment to the public peace , by its uncertainty ; and none the less a torment that the worst rumors and suspicions were most likely to be true ; till finally , everything bad began to be true ; and the public prints to make a point of heroism , in dealing out their accusations with unsparing boldness . A stranger could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Californa . Nothing too laudatory could be said for it ; meantime , as if a paradisaic whole could be made up of diabolical particulars , the sweeping denunciations of individuals appeared to have no honest man in it . And what was most remarkable in all these accusations , was that every charge made against judges and others of briLery , or of fraud , was given circumstantially ; names , dates , amounts , agents , all stated with exactness . Probably a very considerable share of these charges of bribery , and perjury , and fraud , were true . But the misery was , that no one // could guess which . Society was dissolved and law reduced to an instrument of suspicion . It was a state most bitter and even horrible . Whether their facts were only suspicions and rumors converted into facts by repetition , or real and veritable truths of history ; whether it was the licentiousness of the press or its uncommon fidelity ; or whether , possibly , it was not all the fatality which atteuds every community where confidence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be it as it may , out of this general distrust and demoralization , came the Vigilance Counnittee . It was raised by the torture that exasperates society when confidence is gone . So far not to sympathize with it is impossible , and the more that almost all the better citizens were in it . Even Christian professors left the church and the communion , to be in the outbreak , and bear arms in that vast congregation , gathered as a thnnder-cloud round the jail , on the distant hill side . It is not onr design to discuss the committee . Suffice it to say , that their intent was good , their proceedings honest and carefully deliberate , and their military conduct admirably decisive and efficient . Their great fault was that they did not see their point exactly , and offered reasons for their action , a great deal worse than their action . If they had undertaken , not to administer the laws , or take them back into their own hands , but to restore the laws , by plucking down the usurpers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected only by the perjury of the inspectors , their question would have been greatly simplified . Then , because of the almost impossibility of convicting the peijured inspectors , by any ordinary proceedings of law , they would only have done it by extraordinary ; and it would have been all the better if , to make a due impression of this crime , as the greatest of all crimes , they had sacked the whole tribe , be they many or few , and sunk them in the bottom of the Bay . Doing this , instead of resuming functions , the right of which strikes at the root of all constitutional government , they need only have insisted on some extraordinary means of restoring functions already taken away . The whole experiment was critical , more critical than our eastern communities know ; for there was a time , a teri4ble twelve hours , // just after the release of Judge Terry , when the question of a new Executive Committee , who should be more efficient and bolder , i. e. , more bloody , was pending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passion outside ; which new committee , if it had not been dexterously avoided , would have been like the new committee of Paris , and similar scenes would probably have followed . The escape was narrow , so narrow that if the leading gentlemen concerned had now the question of a new vigilance committee movement oii hand , they would probably hesitate long . And yet it must be granted for the honor of this same questionable , perilous adventure of reform , that San Francisco is probably now the best governed city in the union . The laws are now enforced , the economies are duly attended to , there is no plunder , and every evil doer stands in fear . It is the beginning , apparently , of a great moral reaction , which is felt by the whole state . Whatever may be true , therefore , of this great popular movement , whether it is right or wrong , wise or unwise , it will be impossible ever to turn it as a reproach on the certainly patriotic men who were foremost in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with ilarmodius and Aristogiton and other great leaders of mutiny , that have been deliverers of their country . We state these facts concerning the moral aspects of mining ; the occupation , by force , of lands known to be held by a legal right ; and the usurpations and perj uries and briberies of political intriguers and demagogues , connected with the general destruction of confidence and the necessary throes of violence by which they must inevitably be redressed , not as being , in themselves , any picture of California . We know that they are not . They are only facts , without which any description is rose colored and without sound verity ,  --  such facts as will meet a stranger first , because they are most outstanding and impressive . And for this the reader will make due allowance , even as in reading any history ; for it is not the virtues and the smooth and silent flowings of goodness that make up ever the staple of a history , but the explosive wrongs and outrages rather , by which the evenness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , not with any feeling of despair or discouragement . On the contrary , we perceive a certain sublimity , in the contest here begun and the clearing process going forward , which creates appetite in us . We know the certain victory , we see it corning , and we envy especially those young heroic spirits who have set themselves , in the love of God and their newly adopted state , to such works of duty and *acrifice , as are necessary to the sublime future they have in prospect . Opposite to these facts that we have stated are others , which awaken our respect and inspire our confidence . They have a good and able ministry , for example , such a ministry as will compare favorably , in all the denominations , with any of the older states . They have churches in every denomination , not inferior to churches here . The attendance is good , especially in the cities , and the order , the dress , the music are only too much evened by the manner of the East . The Sabbath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be without a Sabbath , as a day of rest , is more and more distinctly felt to be an oppression . And therefore the traders and shopkeepers , in most of the country villages , are petitioning the Legislature , more earnestly every year , for the establishment of a complete suspension of trade . Education is not forgotten . The towns and cities are allowed by statute to tax themselves for this purpose , and many of them do it most liberally . The public schools of San Francisco are not inferior to those of our Eastern cities-many think them even superior . There is no reason to apprehend any loss of natural vigor and tone from the climate on that shore . Some have taken it as a bad indication that the Digger Indians , ( the aboriginals of California , ) are the most spiritless and abject of all known tribes on the continent , and about the lowest specimens of humanity known upon the earth . But this may be sufficiently accounted for , by the general softness of the climate and the fact that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploits of hunter-life ; having always at hand enough of bugs , and fish , and sugar pine bark to serve their purpose . Sometimes also a degree of discouragement has // been derived from the analogical or symbolical fact , that there is not a stick of smart , hard timber in all California ; nothing out of which an axe handle , or a spoke , or a felley could be made ; every hardest , soundest tree , even the oak , being always brittle to such a degree ( " brash " they say in California , and in New England " spalt " ) that the trunk will commonly break asunder live or six limes when it is felled , and lie as a pile of fragments on the ground , even though it is three feet in diameter . Is this a natural token , some have asked , with a little feeling of supersiition , that the future men of California are to be only a brittle or brash stock and without any real timber of endurance in them ? Why any more a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cedars are a token of prodigiously tall men , a race at least twelve or fifteen feet high ? Why any more than the often naked hills and plains are a token of no men at all ? What other sign do we in fact require that the future stock of Calitbrnia will be a stock of high capacity , tItan that the climate is healthy , the growths bountiful , and that we are capable ourselves of the greatest endurance there , both bodily and mental , and have , in fact , a sense of robustness that we have nowhere else ? At the same time , it requires no gift of prophecy to perceive , in the physical resources and commercial advantages of that country , that an immense wealth is , in due time , to be developed there , such wealth as will give vigor to all institutions and works that require expense , and put everything on a scale of breadth and magnificence . If there is any country in the world where the future men are not to be cramped and whittled by close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ifornians say that they are poor ; they feel poor , because they are now at the dead point of retrocession , where their extravagant expectations are l ) eing shortened in for that second beginning , which every new state and city has to make . And yet there is nothing more wonderful , with all this depression , than the amount of wealth already created on that shore . How many thousand years of day labor has it taken simply to build so many houses , fences , shops , steamers , ditches , towns and cities . Three of these cities , San Francisco , Sacra // mento and Marysville , have so much of city life and character , that we hardly recognize their newness . And yet only nine years have passed , since all this immense wealth began to be created ! - aud that , 5,000 miles away , on the shore , as it were , of another continent . There is good and cultivated society in California , such as there never has been in any other new state in the Union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than was ever found in any other state of twice the same political age . Carpets , good beds , clean tables , bright knives and forks , courtesy , hospitality , public entertainments and pleasures on a footing of civilization-all these indications of comfort and society are widely diffused . One sign or token of this kind we can not forbear to mention , because it signifies much . Passing hither and thither on the little steamers , up to Marysville , to Stockton , to the towns north of the bay , where often the number of passengers did not exceed thirty , we have seen , again and again , a table most neatly set , the silver bright and clean , the meats well prepared and good , without any nonsense of show dishes , the servants tidy , quiet , and respectful-in short , the whole figure of the entertainment more rational and better than we have ever seen , either on the boats of the Mississippi or of the Atlantic coast . Such facts indicate society , more than any most splendid entertainment gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be named , if California is to be well understood ; viz , that with all the violence and the savage wrongs and dark vices that have heretofore abounded there , they seldom do a mean thing . They can perpetrate real atrocities , but they must be generous . A considerable part of their blameable profusion comes of their extreme jealousy of littleness , or meanness . Men really poor will often share their last dollar in helping a sick friend , or even a sick stranger . If a poor minister , whom they have only seen at their funerals , is known to be on short allowance , they will have a ticketed supper , not unlikely , to help him ; which , if it is not the best way of establishing religion , does at least show their generosity . If a preacher asks the privilege of addressing them in a gambling saloon , on Sunday , they // are very likely to accede , to hear him respectfully , pass round a hat and make up a liberal purse for him , then put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people to assume and pay the state debt was an act of pure magnanimity . Here was a debt of $5,000,000 which was expressly forbidden by the constitution of the state . This provision of the constitution was known , discussed , openly understood , and the loan was obtained directly in the face of it . The money too had gone for nothing but to feed the political vampires , for whose plunder it was raised , and the state has not a vestige of property to show for it , but some old benches , that belonged to the state house at Yallejo . If then a people have any right , by constitution , to guard themselves against being plundered by their rulers , the people of California had a right to stand upon the restriction so prudently established in their constitution , and were under no obligations , whether of right or of honor , to pay this debt  --  to refuse was no act of repudiation . But their instincts were too generous , they had too much pride of feeling to insist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from her honest debt , California took a gratuitous obligation to get it on , and to fasten it . There remains a single topic to which , in the conclusion of our article , already too far extended , we must briefly refer ; viz , to the effort now on foot to establish a College or University in California . The heaviest detraction , after all , from the future prospects of California , is in the fact that so many go thither only as adventurers , not meaning to stay , and that so many , often the most prosperous , are continually returning . And they do it , in great part , because they can not educate their families there , as their means allow them to desire . In the first place , many never take out their families for this reason , and , in the next place , when they have done it , and their sons are grown up to the age , at which they begin to want the best advantages , they return with them , and are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance and the moral perils of a separation from parents are so great , that there is no alternative , but a re-emigration . This begets an unsettled // feeling in those who remain , which makes them careless often of the good of the state , and , besides , it carries off a large percentage of the wealth created ; for the families that retnrn are commonly such as have been most successful , and all which they have gained is carried with them . And the probability is , that if the contemplated railroad were built across the Continent , ( which it will not be for a long time to come , ) it would scarcely help them at all , but might rather hasten them in this losing process . What they want therefore at this time , above all things else , is a good College or University . Such an institution would do . more to consolidate and settle their state , and to settle the confidence of their future , than even the railroad itself . There are no five states together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , would want an institution of this kind so much as California . For the supply of this want , some of their best and ablest men are preparing . They have had a charter for three years , organizing the " College of California . " Their Board of Trustees contains a representation of all the Christian denominations , who are united in cordiality and good nuderstanding . They are said to have lately fixed on their site-on the eastern side of the Bay , opposite San Francisco . They have had a preparatory school for three years past , under the tuition of Rev. Henry Dnrant , an accomplished scholar and a Christian , and the design is to organize a Freshman Class the coming autumn . What then is wanted now is the endowment , and for this everything is ready . To obtain this endowment in California , except in part , will now be impossible . Much of the wealth is not in the right bands , and where it is not , where there is every disposition to aid , the possibility is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which many who ought to be rich , are required just now to carry . When money will bring three per cent . a month , year by year , on perfect security , the lending party is not likely to put much of it in a College , and the borrowing party still less . Are there no great rich men in the East , no millionaires or less in computation , who will be induced to look at such an opportunity ? Had we the // fortune of but half a million , in our editorial hands , we are quite sure of this , that whoever might want to assume the endowment of such an institution , would have to be very quick in his action , or he would lose the chance . What an opportunity for the man of fortune , who has no object in life , no family to provide for , or none but such as are already rich enough , and who would be greatly more ennobled by his name and example , as the founder of such an institution , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such too are there who are really meaning , when they die , to accomplish some great work with their money ! Why not do it when they are living , and have the satisfaction of a consciousness enriched and a heart enlarged by their beneficence ? To have one 's name on such an institution as this , connected w I the great history and with all the learning , and all the most forward influences of this new world on the Pacific , is a thought which might quicken the blood even of a man most sluggish and dull . For it is to win a greater honor , by many times , than to be President of our great Republic . That is an honor , which , as the line grows longer , loses more and more hs significance , till finally , it will signif as little to have been one of the Presidents as to have been one of the Doges of Venice . But the other , like the names of Harvard and Yale , will brighten and gather to itself a greater weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . And the satisfaction one may have in this honor is sublimely justified in the fact , that he is not merely to be known , or mentioned in the future ages of the world-that might be a very common ambi *ion , for who is there who does even naturally desire as much ? - bnt is permitted to know that his name is to be a power , and to work for all the coming ages , growing brighter and doing more good even than he himself while living . That is a legitimate and glorious ambition  --  the highest that a mortal can cherish . The Trustees , in the Appeal they published a year ago , placed the subject thus : " Could some rich citizen , who can do it without injury to himself , step forward at this time of our beginning , and set his name upon the institution itself , by the side of a Harvard or // a Yale , by subscribing a large part of the proposed endowment ; giving us an opportunity , assisted by his beginning and example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have named , he would be enriched by the sense of his munificence , as no man ever was or can be by the count of his money . We have no delicacy in respect to the customary honors conferred by universities , when they set the names of their benefactors on the halls , libraries and professorships endowed by their munificence ; or when they drop the dry , impersonal name of their charter for one that represents the public spirit , and the living heart of a living man who could be more than rich , the patron of learning , the benefactor and father of the coming ages . These are monuments that may well provoke a degree of ambition ; not even an Egyptian pyramid raised over a man 's ashes could so far ennoble him , as to have the learning and science of long ages and eternal realms of history superscribed by his name . And yet this better kind of monmuent is itself a power so beneficent , that he ought , even as duty , to desire it , and for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of stone or brass , which simply stand doing nothing ; they are monuments eternally fruitful , showing to men 's eyes and ears what belongs to wealth , and what the founders of the times gone by have set as examples of beneficence.
