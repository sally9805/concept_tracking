Morris , George Pope , 1802-1864 : A SCENE AT SEA . from The deserted bride ( 1853 ) Above our heads the moon and stars Were smiling brightly and serene , Painting the waves with silver bars , And lighting up that ocean-scene : And on our right the lightnings threw Their shafts of fire far and free ; While , like a bird with proud wings , flew Our vessel through that snow-curled sea , And all above , below , around , Was full of grandeur ! Every sound The winds and waters breathed were such As I had never heard before ! Oh , who can tell the heart how much At such an hour it will adore Th ' Inscrutable First Cause which we Behold in everything at sea !
