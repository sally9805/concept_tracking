Jilore Worlds than*One. l2mo. pp. 265 . New York : Robert Carter &amp; Brothers . Tmu* question whether the heavenly bodies are inhabited , is a very ancient one , dating back as far at least as the earliest of the Grecian schools of astronomy , six hundred years before the Christian era . Anaximander , a pupil of Thales , maintained the doctrine of a Plurality of Worlds ; and the same opinion , under different forms , was successively held by Pythagoras , Aristotle , Eudoxus , and numerous other ancient astronomers . Among the early fathers of the Christian church , it was often discussed but generally condemned . After the revival of astronomy , the doctrine gained very general currency , being embraced by Tycho Brahe , Galileo , and Kepler. *As early as 1640 , // Bishop Wilkins , afterwards first President of the Royal Society , wrote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the Earth is a Planet . In the former of these treatises it is earnestly argued , not only that the moon is inhabited , but that , in after times , means would be devised for actually making the journey to the moon , and carrying on commerce with the inhabitants. * In 1686 , only a year before the publication of the Principia of Newton , appeared the celebrated work of Fontenelle on the Plurality of Worlds . Fontenelle was Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences , and was well acquainted with the state of astronomy at that period , and better than most of the popular writers of his day ; still he was more of a poet than an astronomer , and such a theme as the Plurality of Worlds , which gave full scope for his fancy , was exactly suited to his genius , and equally adapted to the taste of the people for whom he wrote . The discussion was conducted in the form of conversations with a celebrated IMiarchioness , whose lively curiosity and keen discernment , embellished by superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and clothed the subject in a most attractive garb . The work accordingly ran through numerous editions in French , was translated into several other languages , and long afterwards continued to he honored not only with the notice , but with the comments of the learned , among whom were the celebrated Lalande and other distinguished astronomers . Indeed , it may be worthy of inquiry whether this work of Fontenelle was not the first attempt that was ever made to dress up the severer truths of science in a style suited to the readers of plays and romances . Astronomical treatises had been for the most part , up to that time , written in Latin , and wore a repulsive aspect to the unlearned reader ; but it was a leading object of Fontenelle to address himself to the taste of the cultivated females of France , and to introduce to them the leading truths of astronomy in a style at once instructive and amusing . A few years afterwards , the question of the habitability of the planets engaged the attention of one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 16*O appeared his ( o8motheoros , in which the author puts forth an elaborate argument in favor of the doctrine of a Plurality of Worlds . From the times of Fontenelle and Huyghens , astronomers have been too much occupied with the labors of obser * This scarce but curious work , written in a very quaint style , shows how crude was the knowledge of nstronomy possessed by the English philosophers at the time of the birth of Sir Isaac Newton , even after the discoveries ot Kepler and Galileo. // vation , and with the investigation of the laws of physical astronomy , to engage much in specudations of this kind , but they have generally fallen in with the popular doctrine , that the stars are suns and centers of planetary systems like ours , and that the heavenly bodies in general , are the abodes of life and intelligence . It ; however , astronomers have regarded the discussion of this question with but little interest , theologians have carried it on with augmented zeal , especially with the view of repelling an ob*jection brought against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth occupies too small a place in the universe to have been the object of such transcendent care , and of such a painful sacrifice , as are implied in that doctrine . Dr. Chalmers ' elaborate and eloquent astronomical discourses were directed mainly towards the refutation of this infidel objection ; and Dr. Dick , in his Celestial Scenery , and his Sidereal Heavens , has given a full and able summary of the argrnnents in favor of the doctrine of a Plurality of Worlds . Thus the matter rested until a new interest has been given to it by the recent appearance of the two works placed at the head of this Article , the first denominated " The Plurality of Worlds ; " the second , " More Worlds than One . " The former was published anonymously , but is ascribed to the prolific and able pen of Dr. Whewell ; the latter , which is expressly intended as a reply to the other , is the production of Sir David Brewster . To the scientific and the religious world it is matter of just felicitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has fallen into the hands of two combatants of such high qualifications , whether we regard them as Christians deeply imimbued with reverence for the Creator , or as philosophers profoundly versed in a knowledge of his works ; unlike , therefore , to the parties by whom this controversy has been sometimes conducted ,  --  a sneering freethinker , on the ofie side , and a superficial pretender to science on the other . This seems , therefore , a favorable time for settling the question respecting a Plurality of Worlds ; or , if it can not be definitely settled , of determining at least the nature and weight of the evidence for and against the doctrine . This question has at difThrent times been discussed under various forms , and with various degrees of extension , under the following different issues : Whether the moon is inhabited ? Whether the planets are inhabited ? Whether the stars are suns and centers of planetary systems , alike the abodes of life and intelligence ? Whether the heavenly bodies are peopled with rational and immortal beings like man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or spirits , inhabit those realms ? We shall contemplate the subject only in its most simple form , since evidence going to show the existence of life and intelligence in situations the most favorable , would strengthen the presumption that they pervade the entire universe ; or if even . in such situations their existence appears improbable , it will be scarcely necessary to discuss the claims of other worlds . There are a few principles of reasoning which it may be well to review , before entering directly upon the main question . Let us bear in mind , then , that probable evidence may exist in various degrees ; that when , from the nature of the case , it is difficult to procure any evidence , on one side or the other , there is a tendency in the human mind to ascribe undue weight to slight analogies ; that the possibility of a thing is very slight evidence of its reality ; that reasoning from analogy is apt to be delusive , and is often abused ; that the argument from authority , in a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instrumental observation and mathematical reasoning , is liable to be overrated ; and that men readily believe when any doctrine is supposed to be favorable to their religious faith , or settled opinions . Let us dwell for a moment on these several considerations . First , probable evidence may exist in various degrees . The meteorologist will regard the presence of a peculiar kind of cloud ( the nimbus ) as affording some probability of rain . If* at the same time , the barometer is falling , the probability will be strengthened . It will be still greater if the wind is in the rainy quarter ; and stronger yet if the dew point is very high , indicating a great amount of moisture in the atmosphere . The concurrence of all these prognostics will render the probability of rain almost a certainty to his mind , although the presence of any one of them , alone , would afford but slight grounds for expecting rain . In fact , the absence of the other signs would , if they remained wanting , overbalance any one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , from the nature of the case , it is very difl*-cult to obtain any evidence at all , there is a tendency in the human mind to give undue weight to the little that is known . In ho subject is this defect of reasoning more a p parent than in astronomy , when we desert the only safe guides , observation and geometry ; and nowhere in the annals of human knowledge , do we find more wild and extravagant speculations , than among astronomers , when they wander away from the strict line of instrumental observation and mathematical reasoning , into the region of conjecture and analogy . The very inventiveness and // originality of some of the greatest astronomers , have allured them into the realms of fancy . Witness the extravagant ideas of Kepler , and the slight analogies from which Sir William Herschel drew many of his conclusions respecting the universe , although he justly merited the encomium passed upon him by Arago , who called him " the great , inspired observer . " Thirdly , the possibility of a thing is skght @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible which are not true , or even in the smallest degree probable ; and it is very little to say in favor of any doctrine that , for aught we know , it may be so . The possibility of a thing , however , is good against the plea of its impossibility . When it is maintained that a thing can not be , it may be sufficient to show a way in which it may take place , although the mode assigned may be far from that by which it is actually brought about . The ancient philosophers held that we can never be certain that the same laws prevail among the heavenly bodies as govern terrestrial phenomena ; that the laws of motion , for example , may be very different among the planets and stars from what they are on the earth ; but while this doctrine prevailed no progress could ever have been made in celestial mechanics . It was , in fact , a natural fruit of the heathen mythology , which assigned different realms in the empire of nature , to different monarchs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton , that the laws of nature are the same throughout the universe , is the natural result of the religion of the Bible . Fou*thly , the argument from analogy is apt to be delusive , and is often abused . This has been peculiarly the case in astronomical speculations . A brief consideration , therefore , of the principles which ought to govern us in the application of analogical reasoning in such questions as that of the Plurality of Worlds , will aid us to form a just estimate of the two works under review . If two things agmee in all the particulars in which we can compare them , we are justified in con*cluding that they also agree in other respects ; and if the number of particulars in which this uniform agreement holds good , is very great , then our inference that they are alike in other points where we have not the means of making the comparison , is proportionally strong . But if on comparing two things with one another , we find them agreeing in some respects and disagreeing in others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparison can not be instituted , is strong in proportion to the number of particulars in which they agree , and weak in proportion to the number of particulars in which they disagree . To illustrate our meaning by a familiar exampie. // Two honey-bees resemble each other in a great number of points , while they differ in scarcely anything . One of them stings us-we infer that the other can do the same , without making the trial . But now let us compare the bee with an eagle ; and to make the case bear more directly on our object , we will suppose that the bee is in our garden , and the eagle high in the sky . The bee we can inspect near at hand ; the eagle only at a great distance . Both live and move in the same element ; both have wings and fly ; and , in short , they are alike in nearly all the particulars in which we can compare them . Yet the points of comparison are very few , and should we infer from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects , we can easily see to what errors such a conclusion would lead us . But suppose the eagle , by means of the telescope , to be brought so near that we can extend the comparison to many other particulars . We now find that the points of disagreement gain upon us : the eagle is covered with feathers ; he has no sting ; he makes no honey ; in short , the points of dissimilarity increase faster than the points of resemblance ; therefore , to make inferences respecting the eagle from our knowledge of the bee , would evidently betray us into manifold errors . It will fall in our way by and by to see how far this case corresponds to the actual relations existing between the earth and any of the planets . Fifthly , the argument from the authority of great names in astronomy , is to be received with some caution . Astronomers are of different classes . They are like different sorts of artists engaged in building a palace or temple , where each sort requires some peculiarity of genius and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edifice may severally be eminent in his own particular department and yet know scarcely anything of the other departments . Some astronomers , like Tycho Brahe , have extraordinary powers for constructing instruments and making observations , while out of this particular field of labor their authority is nothing . The absurdities of the system of Tycho , and his firm belief in judicial astrology , furnish a sad , but not a solitary example , of the amount of weakness which may coexist in the same mind with the highest attributes of genius . Others , like Laplace , have little taste or talent for the labors of practical astronomy , but are great in hunting out the relations of the bodies of the solar system by means of the calculus ; and exalted as are the merits of Laplace , and gieat as is his authority in all matters depending on this wonderful agent in the discovery of truth , yet in subjects of pure speculation , his opinions are far from being entitled to the same deference . Results , // which it required the highest efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , when placed fairly before the mind , common sense alone is required in order to apply them , and logical powers rather than inventive ingenuity are necessary for drawing the proper conclusions to which they lead . In a few instances , the astronomer , like Kepler , has combined the most profound powers of intellect with the highest gifts of imagination , and has brought forth the grandest discoveries of the philosopher , or the wildest ravings of the poet , according as one or the other of these elements happened to preponderate . On the other hand , Galileo and Newton were severally remarkable no less for the greatness of their intellectual powers , than for the harmonious proportion which constitutes the wellbalanced mind ; and accordingly their opinions on all subjects to which they applied their minds , are entitled to peculiar weight . If , then , any question in astronomy is to be settled by the authority of great names , let it be seen what is the amount of the authority on that particular point , remembering that truths which it required the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation or of mathematical analysis , to discover , are no sooner established , than they often fall immediately under the domain of common sense , and require nothing so much as judicious powers of weighing evidence ; and such we think to be precisely the case with the question of the Plurality of Worlds . Finally , men readily believe any doctrine which is supposed to be favorable to their religious faith , or to their settled opiuwns on any other subject , and as readily reject what is subversive of such opinions . When a writer like the author of " More Worlds than One , " pronounces the doctrine he is defending to be " the hope of the Christian and to be embalmed in the warmth of the affections , " we recognize a state of mind unfavorable to sober argmpentation . With the foregoing principles in view , we propose now to enter directly upon the question , Are the planets inhabited ? I. SOME FACTS ARE uNFAVORABLE TO THE DOCTRINE . 1 . The extremes of heat and cold . At different distances from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance is increased , and consequently is seven times greater in Mercury and twenty-seven times less in Jupiter than on the Earth . If we take the mean temperature of the torrid zone at 8O* ( which is not far from the truth ) the heat in the equatorial regions of Mercury is 5600 , a heat above the melting points of several of the metals ; while a place situated even in the // middle latitudes , like New York , ( which has a mean temperature of 540 , ) would have a temperature of 3780 ; and iii the polar regions where on the Earth the heat is only 320 , it would be in Mercury 2240 , or 120 above the boiling point of water . On Jupiter , the extremes of cold would be equally intense . On the equatorial regions the mean temperature , being twentyseven times less than at corresponding places on the Earth , would be only 30 above zero , and in the middle latitudes it would be scarcely above zero . In Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune , the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun 's light , would be equally striking , since light obeys the same law as heat at different distances from the source , and consequently when multiplied seven-fold on Mercury , it would illuminate all objects with an insupportable glare , while on the remoter planets it would fade to a dim twilight , being nine hundred times less intense on Neptune than on the Earth . 3 . The variations of weight in bodies on the different planets would at least require very different adjustments of the niuscu** lar powers of animals from those which exist on the Earth . On the moon a body weighs only one-sixth as much as at the earth , and the position of bodies would be so unstable ( being bound to the surface by so slender a tie ) that slight disturbances of equilibrium would upset them . Standing upright , or walking , would be for man , with so narrow a base , a very delicate operation . On the other hand , on Jupiter a body would weigh ten and a half times as much as on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so fixed and so difficult to . lift or to move , as to require the employment of forces equally extraordinary . Walking would here become excessively tiresome , if not impossible , from the mere weio*ht of the limbs and of the body . But we have not stated the case in its most unfavorable light ; the extremes of weight between the heaviest and the lightest of the planets vary as sixty to one , instead of the small range we have contemplated . 4 . Want of air and water . In respect to the moon it is ascertained by very satisfactory evidence , that it has either no atmosphere at all , or one of so little density that human beings could not live in it ; and it is fully established that there is no water in the moon . Th*e absence of water implies the absence of a vegetable kingdom , and consequently of all animal life , which is sustained , either directly or indirectly , on vegetables . Moreover , the surface of the moon , as seen by the most powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked volcanic lava , of an aspect more // and more dreary as the view becomes more and more distinct . The planets afford some indications of atmospheres , although none of these appear to be perfectly decisive ; and cloudy appearances investing several of the planets , particularly Mars and Jupiter , are confidently adduced by some writers as evidence of the existence of water . But clouds and smoke arise from various sources , and their presence is not of course evidence of bodies of water beneath ; while the cold of Saturn , especially , ( where such cloudy belts are likewise seen , ) forbids the supposition of liquid water . White spots about the poles of Mars were first inferred to be owing to snow , by Sir William Herschel , a man of great genius , but withal of lively imagination and much given to the discovery of analogies ; but the cold of a polar winter in Mars is too severe to produce such accumulations of snow , since warm and humid currents of air are essential in order to supply the material of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too low to dissolve it in the manner supposed by Herschel and his numerous followers . The telescope , it must be acknowledged , has added nothing to the amount of evidence in favor of the doctrine that the planets are inhabited ; it has in fact greatly diminished that amount , since the points of dissimilarity to the Earth , which it has revealed to us , have increased faster than the points of resemblance . II . But THERE ARE SOME THINGS FAVORABLE TO THE DOCTRINE OF A PLURALITY OF WORLDS . 1 . The uniformity of plan observable in all the works of nature , and equally in individual bodies and in systems of . bodies . The chemist is sure of this when , on analyzing a drop* of water , and finding it to consist of two volumes of hydrogen and one of oxygen , lie confidently asserts that this is the composition of water ; meaning that water , wherever found , in every country , in earth or air , or even in the heavenly bodies , if it exists there , consists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , united in precisely these proportions . The anatomist asserts a similar uniformity in the optical structure of the eye ; that in every animal , however the organ may differ in size , in color , or in position , its mechanism is everywhere similarly adapted to the properties of light . This uniformity of plan is equally observable in systems of bodies . The Earth and the Moon compose a system governed by certain fixed and mathematical laws ; Jupiter and his moons form a similar system , larger and more diversified , it is true , but still governed by precisely the same laws , in respect to the forces which impel them , and the forces by which they tend towards their primaries , the spaces described by the radius vector of // each , and the relation between the distance from the primary and the time of their revolution around it . Saturn , again , is but a repetition of the systems of the Earth and Jupiter , and so of all the other subordinate groups consisting of planets and satellites . But each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire solar system , where we see repeated on a grander scale the same mechanism , each planet revolving about the sun by precisely the same laws as those by which the satellites revolve about their primaries . So similar is the mechanism of the lower when compared with the higher system , that a diagram of Jupiter and his moons , accurately plotted according to their distances , is sometimes mistaken by the unlearned for a representation of the solar system itself . In some of the double stars , called the binary stars , we have examples of the revolution of sun around sun ; and here , too , as we might have anticipated , the same mechanism , governed by the same laws , prevails as in all the lower systems ; and all analogy tends to the same conclusion , that in the structure of one of these systems nearest to us , as that of Jupiter and his satellites , we actually see the pattern according to which all the systems in the world , and the Universe itself , are framed . Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose ; and can hardly resist the inference that a series of bodies linked together by one and the same bond , ( the law of gravitation , ) and distributed into families placed under precisely the same regulations , were designed for the same end . Or , to confine ourselves , for the present , to our own solar system , we are almost impelled to the conclusion , that the other families of this realm were designed for the same purpose as the Earth . Nor is it necessary to build this conclnsion on any view we entertain of the wisdom or benevolence of the Creator . The mere naturalist would and does declare his conviction , that Nature , when she links together her productions by mutual bonds , and subjects a certain number composing such a group to the same laws , desigus them for the accomplishment of the same ends . If , then , he can clearly determine the great purpose for which one member of the series thus related to each other was designed , he infers that this also was the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order , then , to learn the great purpose for which the planets were made , we have only to inquire for what purpose the earth was made ; and we think it very evidemit that animal life in general , and M*an in particular , was the great object for which this world was created . To which part soever of the face of the earth we direct our attention , we find it // everywhere stored with life , and all the arrangements of the natural world adapted for the multiplication , support , and happiness of sentient beings . Some walk the earth , some creep in its caverns ; others fill the sea , and others the air . And when we call to our aid the microscope , we are everywhere astonished to see how life abounds where the eye was unable to detect it , peopling every leaf of the forest , swimming in every drop of water , and sparkling in every ocean wave ; to find them floating in the air , swarming in slime and mud , forming the dust of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituting strata of . the earth itself . Nor can it be doubted that the economy of nature , by express adaptations , is regulated with reference to the multiplication and support of all these tribes of the animal creation , a dwelling place and appropriate aliment being provided for all at the very spot where each springs into life . That the geological changes which have taken place on the surface of the earth , res**ltin g in the formation of soils ; the diffusion of water so as to be accessible everywhere ; the diversified and ample stores laid up and constantly replenishing in the vegetable kingdom ; atmospheric air by its elastic properties penetrating every retreat where there are respiratory organs to inhale it ; the sun shedding upon all his light and heat ; that these all and severally are so many express adaptations for the multiplication , sustenance , and happiness of the animal creation , are facts so obvious as scarcely to require any argument . But the meaning which they express is plainly this-that life and happiness constitute the grand leading objects for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contemplating the relation of man to the external world , we finally arrive at the conclusion that the earth was made for Man-that while the happiness of all the other forms of sentient being has been by no means neglected by the beneficent Creator , yet , that man is the grand ultimate object for which all things in the earth , ani - mate and inanimate , were made . Without any view to the bearing which this sentiment might have on the subject now before us , we have in a former number of this journal endeavored to prove that the World was made for lllan. * We predicated this in respect both to the powers and the productions of the natural world . First , we endeavored to prove that the great powers of nature , as heat , light , niagnetism , and electricity , were created especially and pre&amp;minently for man . Heat , when contemplated in its four great relations , namely , to animal life , to combustion , // as a mechanical force , and as an agent in effecting chemical changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , with hardly any reference to the lower animals , except in the first of these relations , that of animal life ; as is rendered strikingly apparent by an actual enumeration of the various uses and applications of heat . By the aid of heat man greatly excels them , also , in the variety and quality of his food ; for while each animal is confined to a single kind of food , or at most to a small variety of articles , man has a choice of the whole vegetable and animal kingdoms , and is alone endowed with the power of greatly exalting their qualities and increasing their varieties by*is own art and skill . The offices which heat performs for the animal tribes terminate in wji*at relates to their mere existence and personal comfort ; but with man they have but just commenced , since all those manifold and important uses which he makes of heat as relates to combustion , to mechanical force , or as the agent in effecting chemical changes in matter-nses upon which his dominion over the external world chiefly depends-all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are exclusively the birthright of man . With respect to the other great powers of nature , namely , attraction , light , magnetism , and electricity , the relation which animals sustain to them is merely passive , while man , l ) esides enjoying the same passive benefits , also employs them in a thousand ways to effect his voluntary purposes . The sun 's light , for the ordihary uses of vision , is no less important to the animal tribes than to the human species ; but over this element they have no control , while man kindles , manages , and regulates it at his pleasure , dispels with it the darkness of night , decomposes and modifies it into an infinite variety of colors ; and it is his sole prerogative , by the aid of the microscope and the telescope , so to exalt his natural vision as to look through all creation . Secondly , the productions , no less than the powers of nature , were created for man . The offices which the several kingdoms of nature perform for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as regard mere existence and personal comfort . The mineral kingdom affords them a footstool , or a shelter , but upon man it confers its subterranean riehes , its quarries , its mines , its gems . He alone can cause the earth to bring forth food , and to teem with fruits and flowers . In the veaetable kingdom man not only , in common with the lower animals , finds means of sustenance , but while they are severally limited to a single , or , at most , a small variety of its productions , its boundless wealth is conferred on man ; some portions he uses // for his food , some for his dwellings , his temples , his ships ; and some for his medicines . Its forests supply him with fuel ; its sugar , wine , and oil , delight his taste ; its drugs and coloring stuffs adorn his arts . The animal kingdom itself , moreover , was made for man . Some yield their bodies for his food ; others supply his clothing ; some toil for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; some , oil for his lamps , and medicines for his diseases . Even fossil tribes entombed in acres past , and transformed into coal , are brought up to feed his *res . We further endeavored to show that the world of leauty and suhlin-tity was made exclusively for man , and that the same was true of the world of art ; that man , in fact , is a co-worker with God in the natural , as in the moral world , many things being left in a state apparently unfinished for man to complete , or develop ; as metals in the state of ores , steam hidden in water , and glass existing only in its elements , sand and alkali ; that it was left for man to establish the relation8 of thin g s , as of heat to fuel and to water , magnetism to iron , and mechanical forces to machinery ; that it was reserved for him to form many useful compound8 , as glass , unknown to nature herself ; and that upon him was conferred the high prerogative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deformities , developing her beauties , and multiplyino ' her varieties . From all these considerations we drew the *nal conclusion , that man sustains a totally different relation to the external world , from that sustained by all the inferior , animals ; and he is not to be regarded as the last number of a series  --  the last link in the chain of development  --  but as a being severed from all other beings of this earth , as well in his position here as in his immortal d estiny. * * In the article alluded to , the argument is summed up in the following paragraph : " However favorable it might be to our argument , we shall not insist here upon the fact that man alone of all the animal races consists of a single species ; nor upon the anatomical and physiological distinctions by which he is separated from the animal tribes , such is the peculiar structure of his brain , his possession of hands , and his erect attitude ; but we shall leave such points to professed writers on the Natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gift of reason , of imagination , or of speech , although these , together with the gift of a hand , may lie at the foundation of the peculiarity of his relations to the external world . But we rest our proposition on the facts which have been adduced to show , that he only has dominion over the great powers of nature , to control them at his will and to employ these energies in his service ; that all the riches of the several kingdoms of nature , are bestowed on him , except so much as is just sufficient to sustain the life or to provide for the continuance of the inferior animals , and that they themselves are sustained and continued chiefly for his benefit ; that to any single species the part of nature which it eaii appropriate to itself is exceedingly // If , then , we arrive *at the conclusion that the planets were made for the same purpose as the earth , and on further inquiry , find that the great object for which the earth was made , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man in particular , we can hardly resist the inference* that these remoter worlds are also the abodes of life and intelligence . We shall arrive at the same result from the consideration , that in nature all thinge have their use . In the progress of knowledge this principle has gained strength . To the earlier anatomists there were parts in the human body for which no use had been discovered ; but it would evidently have been rash to infer that they were therefore useless . The progress of the science has demonstrated that these very parts have important uses , and are indispensable to the well being of the whole structure ; or if , in any case , the use has not as yet been determined , the anatomist modestly infers that it is useless only in appearance , and only in relation to the state of his knowledge . There was a time when electricity was regarded as an omen of the wrath of heaven , fitted only to terrify and destroy ; but a further acquaintance with it has demonstrated , that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most interesting services for man . The truth of this principle is more striking in respect to systems of bodies than to individuals ; as in the structure of the human body , every part has far higher uses in relation to the other parts , and as a member of a system in which all the parts are mutually dependent , than in its individuality . Now it can not be denied that the sun and planets compose such a system , and the inference is *that every part has important functions to perform . The solar system , in fact , bears a strong resemblance to our own happy frame of government , where municipalities are combined to form states , and states to form the federal union . But if the planets are barren wastes where there is no life to animate and no capacity for happiness , the least we can say is , that , in this limited in space and quantity , while the domain of man is boundless as nature herself ; that Providence has profusely scattered over all creation the beautiful and sublime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promotion of his happiness ; that he only has the gift of aiding his native powers by instrument3 of his own invention , by means of which he gains his empire over matter , and not only subdues to his dominion all terrestrial nature , but opens to himself a commerce with other worlds , even to the remotest Nebulae . The high prerogative of carrying out the designs of the Creator in establishing the relations of things , in forming new compounds , and in exalting the qualities of the productions of nature , appears as unlike any gifts bestowed on the inferior animals , as those which connect him with eternity , and prove that he is severed from all the other beings in this world , no less in his position here than ja his immortal destiny . " // respect , they present to us a totally different view of the economy of Providence from that which is everywhere set before us in this world . They would present the anomaly of cities without inhabitants , ships without sailors , warehouses without merchandise . But however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would certainly afford us much satisfaction to be able to point our finger to some contrivance in any of them , undoubtedly designed for sentient beings . A few arrangements of this kind are thought to have been detected among the planets . Thus Jupiter 's moons are so adjusted to each other and to their primary , that , although from circumstances arising from the great size of the planet and the slight inclination of their orbits , they are exceedingly liable to be eclipsed ,  --  they can not all be eclipsed at once , and leave the planet in darkness . Nor is this a casual arrangement , for it depends upon a strictly mathematical adjustment. * Now things are so related to each other in the economy of nature , that the presence of one often implies that of the other . Such is the relation of the eye to light and of the lungs to air ; and thus a specific arrangement on the planet Jupiter to husband the light and turn it upon the planet , implies the presence of eyes to behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of water when we see at a great distance a ship under sail . Laplace , however , has denied that even the moon was made to give light by night , and he would of course deny the validity of our argument respecting the moons of Jupiter . His language is as follows : " Some partisans of final causes ( says he ) have imagined that the moon was given to the earth to afford it light in the absence of the sun . But in this case nature would not have attained the end proposed , since we are often deprived at the same time of the light of both of them . To have accomplished this end , it would have been sufficient to have placed the moon at first in opposition to the sun , and in the plane of the elliptic , at a distance from the earth equal to one hundredth part the distance of the earth from the sun , and to have given to the earth and moon velocities parallel and proportional to their distances from the sun . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would have described round it an ellipse similar to that of the earth , these two bodies would thus have succeeded each other above the horizon , and as at this distance the moon would not be eclipsed , its light would always replace * That the mean longitude of the first satellite increased by twice that of the third , and diminished by three times that of the second , always gives a remainder eqnal to 1800. // that of the sun . " The reason for placing the moon one hundredth part the distance of the earth from the sun , ( or at about a million of miles off , ) is , that it may thus go clear of the earth 's shadow , the length of which is somewhat short of that . Bnt being then four times as far off as at present , her apparent diameter would be diminished to one-fourth , and its surface and light to one-sixteenth their present amount . As the average light of the moon is now half what it would be if constantly full , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position were changed in the manner supposed . It would be still worse for the tides ; for the power of the moon to raise the tides being inver*ely as the cube of the distance , the tides would be sixty-four times less than at present ; and since the average height of the tides for the whole earth is about twenty-six inches , its height would be reduced to about three-eighths of an inch , a quantity too small to answer any of the valuable purposes which the tides fulfill . A still greater injury would be sustained by navigation in losing the lunar method of finding the longitude ; for since the moon would cease to change its apparent position among the stars , the lunar method would no longer be available , and the great practical object of the IMlecanique Celeste of Laplace  --  to perfect the method of finding the longitude at sea-would be lost . We shall still believe , therefore , that the moon was made to rule the night , and shall think it probable at least that the moons of Jupiter were designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are eyes there to behold the light . The same course of reasoning which has led us to think there is a high probability that the planets are the abodes of life and intelligence , conducts us , when followed out , to the still higher and grander conclusions , that the stars are centres of other solar systems which , like ours , are filled with sentient beings . That the light of the stars proceeds from self-luminous bodies , is proved both by its intensity and by direct experiments in polarization ; that these bodies are composed of matter like that of which our sun is composed , is showii by its obeying the same law of gravitation , as is especially proved of the binary stars , which revolve about a common centre of gravity in conformity with that law ; that many of them at least are bodies of immense size , is evinced by the amount of light which , at such a vast distance , they send to the earth ; * and , in short , all things go to prove that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps less , but many much larger than our sun , and that they are bo*1ies entirely analogous to that which supplies light , heat , and attraction to our system of planetary worlds . But we have already remarked that , in the economy of nature , uniformity of plan implies identity of purpose ; and if on this principle we have inferred that the planets are inhabited , and have further traced the same nuiformity of plan to the stellar worlds , we seem bound to predicate of them a similar purpose , namely , that they also are the abodes of life and happiness . For us , indeed , who dwell on " this speck of earth , " this seems a bold and adventurous flight ; but it is no more so than if the animalcule that feeds on a leaf of a tree were suddenly endowed with reason , and should conclude that all the leaves of the tree were peopled like his own ; and then enlarging his sphere of thought , should entertain the grand idea , that the same was true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can rest with confidence in conclusions so accordant with reason , and so consonant to our ideas of the greatness and wisdom of Jehovah , it behooves us in candor to return and see whether those considerations , which at first appeared unfavorable to the doctrine of a Plurality of Worlds , will admit of any explanations which will place them in a less unfavorable light . We must not deny that heat and cold , light and attraction , water and air , have respectively the same properties in other worlds as here ; but it is safe to say that the relations which subsist between them and the animal creation , are susceptible of very great modifications , and that objections arising from the heat of Mercury , or the cold of Jupiter , the want of light in the remotest planets , and of air and water in some or all , overlook this fact . Here our bodies are built with reference to the external circumstances of our planet ; with muscles propoi'tioned to the force of attraction which binds us to the earth , with eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs of hearing and respiration adapted to its atmosphere , and with a digestive system suited to the vegetable , and animals designed for our food . But there is nothing improbable in the idea , no resort to mere possibilities , that the same Almighty Power which has so adapted to the external world the living beings on this planet , may institute corresponding adjustments in respect to the beings of other worlds . One bred on the shores of a lake where there were no fishes or other aquatic animals , and who had seen a man die by drowning , would infer that no animals could live in water ; he could never conceive of those adaptations by which this ele // ment is made the dwelling place of numerous tribes of animals . Indeed , there was a time in the history of the human race , when the inhabitants of the.temperate zone believed that life could not exist in either the equatorial or the polar regions . They did not know what resources Providence has for mitigating the extremes of heat and cold , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did not know how a temperate climate may be reached , even under the equator , by ascending to a certain elevation ; nor how the trade winds , and the land and the sea-breezes , temper the heat of the air ; nor how the warm currents flow off towards the poles , and are replaced by corresponding cool currents beneath ; nor how evaporation is working with increased activity to convert the fierce heat of the sun into latent heat , and thus prevent its accumulation ; nor could they ever have imagined that this torrid region , which they had consigned to perpetual sterility and desolation , was all ' the while teeming with animal life , and sustaining a vegetable kingdom a thousand fold more rich and diversified than their own . In the frozen regions of the poles , the conservative powers of nature are displayed in a manner equally admirable to preserve animal life from destruction . We recognize them in the heat given out by the congelation of water-in the special provision by which the polar seas are bridged with ice , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature much above the freezing point , and well suited to the habits of the numberless aquatic tribes that frequent those seas-in the accumulations of snow that cover the earth in winter with a thick , warm mantle-in the change wrought in the covering of beasts and birds , greatly augmenting its power of resisting the cold  --  and finally , in the dormant state into which certain polar animals pass during the season when they are unable to procure their accustomed food . These examples afford us a glimpse of the power of the Creator , to establish new relations between his creatures and the external world . Nor can we limit his power to adjust material bodies to the medium in which they live , however unlike those circumstances may be to those which here constitute the relations of man and animals to the world without . We see , in fact , examples of this adjustment of the animal system , in the changes which it assumes as external circumstances change . By habitual exposure to a high degree of heat , persons have acquired the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread ; and eyes accustomed to night service , and kept secluded from the light of day , acquire extraordinary powers of vision in feeble lights . We // have examples also of vegetables which live and thrive for a long time without water . Nor are there wanting instances where express organizations are adapted to peculiar conditions of the external medium , as the eyes of cats designed for seeing in the dark , of moles fitted for burrowing in the ground , and of fishes for living in water . In like manner , the feeble light on the planet Saturn , might be compensated and rendered sufficiently intense for all the purposes of vision , either by giving to the eyes of the inhabitants a greater delicacy , or by enlarging their pupils so as to admit a greater amount of light . Although the exact adaptation of the senses and the mechanical powers of man to the external world is such , as generally to render extraordinary adaptations unnecessary , yet we see how easily these are made when new conditions in external circumstances render it necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adaptations and peculiarities of organization , is sufficient to show the resources of Providence , ( or of Nature , if any one prefers that term , ) and warrants the belief that life , both animal and vegetable , may exist on the planets , although the circumstances should require a far greater change of constitution than we can observe , both in organic and inorganic nature . We have thus endeavored to present the evidence for and against the doctrine of a Plurality of Worlds , so far as the evidence or reasoning is purely scientific , without blending it with those moral and religious considerations which have entered of late so much into the discussion . To these we will now more particularly advert . It was perhaps the infidel Thomas Paine who first attempted to turn the doctrine of a Plurality of Worlds to the account of infidelity . While , by the believer , the doctrine had been hailed as one that greatly exalts our conceptions of the power , wisdom , and glory of the Creator , Paine employed it to swell the torrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine of redemption . The passage in his book ( The Aqe of Reason ) relating to this subject , is very characteristic of the author , and so profane and contemptuous that we can not with propriety quote it entire . He avers that the belief that God created a Plurality of Worlds , at least as numerous as the stars , renders the Christian system of faith at once little and ridiculous , and scatters it in the mind like feathers in the air ; and since he gives full credit to the doctrine that the heavenly bodies are inhabited , he of course rejects and contemus the Christian system of faith . Taking the doctrine for true , he profanely denounces the work of redemption as a soli // tary and strange conceit . An able reply to the weak but subtle arguments of Paine was gWen by Andrew Fuller , near the beginning of the present century , in his work entitled " The Gospel its Own Witness . " He remarks that no man can properly be said to believe the doctrine : it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we understand him to mean , that Christians who accept the doctrine at all , do not rest in it , as they do in their belief in the doctrine of redemption , as absolutely true , and therefore as entitled to a place in their system of faith , but only hold it as a probable fact , and as one that does not affect the foundations of their faith , even should the fact be otherwise . But he adds , that he does not wish to avail himself of these considerations , but admitting that the intelligent creation is as extensive as modern philosophy supposes , the credibility of redemption is not thereby weakened , but , on the contrary , in many respects , is strengthened and aggrandized ; that if our world be only a small province of God 's vast empire , there is reason to hope that it is the only part , ( except among the fallen angels , ) where sin has entered ; that there is nothing inconsistent with reason in supposing that sc*me one part of the empire should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform his most glorious works ; that if any one part of God 's creation , rather than another , possessed a superior fitness to become a theatre on which he might display his glory , it should seem to be that part where the greatest efforts had been made to dishonor him ; and that the events brought to pass in this world , little and significant as it may be , are sufficient to fill all and every part of God 's dominions with everlasting and increasing joy . The foiegoing considerations are deemed sufficient by Mr. Fuller to meet the objections urged by the infidel ; but he proceeds to argue , that the Christian doctrine of redemption is strengthened and aggrandized by the supposed magnitude of the creation . In support of this position , he alleges that the Bible represents the work of redemption as an act of astonishing condescension , and the more so the greater the number of inhabited worlds ; that , according to the scriptural account , before the creation was begun , our world was marked out by eternal wisdom as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible , the mediation of Christ is represented as bringing the whole creation into union with the Church or people of God ; that not only is the whole creation represented as augmenting the blessedness of the Church , but the Church as augmenting the blessedness of the whole creation ; that at a future period we are led by the Scriptures to expect that the earth itself , as well as // its redeemed inhabitants , shall be purified and reunited to the holy empire of God ; and that the Bible represents the punishment of the finally impenitent as appointed for an example to the rest of creation . These various passages of the Bible ( which are strikingly arrayed in form by the writer , but which we have not space to insert ) go to establish two important truths ; first , that this earth has in fact been highly exalted by the Creator , in comparison with other worlds , by making it the theatre of the work of redemption ; and , secondly , that this event has not been an insulated one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rejoicing in other worlds . While , therefore , it is not claimed that the Bible expressly assures us of the existence of inhabitants in the planetary or stellar worlds , yet it is evident that none of its representations are inconsistent with the doctrine of a Plurality of Worlds . We have thought the arguments of Fuller the more deserving of notice , becanse they appear to us to contain the germs of many views which are generally snpposed to have been originated by later writers , and especially by Dr. Chalmers . If they go but little way towards establishing the doctrine in question , they at least afford a happy reply to the infidel objection , that the representations of the sacred volume are not in accordance with the discoveries of modern astronomy . The difficulty urged by Paine and other infidels has , however , been found to embarrass and perplex not a few believers ; and it is the special object of the work before us , on the Plurality of Worlds , to relieve minds of this description , rather than to answer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will now more particularly give our attention . The work begins with a concise outline of the discoveries of modern astronomy , embracing the leading facts respecting the extent of the Universe , which he supposes must have been before the mind of Dr. Chalmers when he wrote his Astronomical Discourses ; and the objection which it was the leading object of the Doctor to meet , was , that which we have already seen was first proposed in Paine 's Age of Reason , and answered in Fuller 's Gospel its Own Witness . But he thus announces his purpose : " Perhaps , however , we shall make our reasonings and speculations apply to a wider class of readers , if we consider the view now spoken of , not as an objection urged by an opponent of religion , but rather as a difficulty felt by a friend of religion . It is , I conceive , certain that many of those who are not at all disposed to argue against religion , but who , on the contrary , feel that their whole iuterual comfort and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still troubled and dismayed at the doctrines of the vastness of the Universe , and the multitude of worlds which they suppose to be taught and proved by astronomy . * * * They would willingly think of God // as near to them ; but during the progress of this enumeration He appears at every step removed further and further from them . To discover that the Earth is so large , the number of its inhabitants so great , its form so different from what man at first imagines it , may perhaps have startled them ; but in this view there is nothing which a pious mind does not readily surmount . But if Venus and Mars also have their inhabitants ; if Saturn and Jupiter , globes so much larger than the Earth , have a proportional amount of population , may not man be neglected or overlooked ? " Our author next comments upon Chalmers ' celebrated " Answer from the Microscope . " Chalmers had remarked that just about the time when science gave rise to the suggestion of this difficulty , she also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the time that the inVention of the telescope showed that there are innnmerable worlds , which might have inhabitants requiring the Creator 's care as much as the tribes of this earth do , tie invention of the iliicroscope showed that there were in this world innumerable tribes of animals , which had been all along enjoying the benefits of the Creator 's care , as much as those kinds with which man had been familiar from the beginning . The telescope suggested that there might be dwellers in Jupiter or in Saturn , of giant size and unknown structure , who must share with us the preserving care of God . The microscope showed that there had been , close to us , inhabiting minute crevices and crannies , peopling the leaves of plants , and the bodies of other animals , animalcules of a minuteness hith&amp;rto unguessed , and of a structure hitherto unknown , who had always been sharers with us in God 's preserving care . The telescope brought into view worlds as numerous as drops of water which make up the ocean ; the microscope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Although this course of reasoning , our author admits , is conclusive in showing that the care and Providence of the Creator do in fact extend to regions much beyond what appears to ordinary observation , and that His eye is never weary , but regards the minutest portions of His works with the same beneficent care as though they constituted the only beings in the Universe , and consequently that the vast concerns of us empire furnish no reason why He should not bestow on " these His lowest works " all the care and concern which the Bible represents , yet our author objects that the argument does not cover the whole ground . The revelations of the microscope may and do remove the objection of the infidel , and they strengthen the probability that the planets as well as the earth are filled with living beings . But do they prove that there are in those worlds beings like man , intellectual and moral beingscreatures living under a moral law , responsible for transgression , the subjects of a Providential government ? The nature // of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so much the same , that we can conceive minds to be multiplied indefinitely without fear of confusion , interference , or exhaustion . There may be in Jupiter creatures endowed with an intellect which enables them to discover and demonstrate the relations of space ; and if so , they can not have discovered and demonstrated anything of that kind as true , which is not true for us also ; their Geometry must coincide with ours so far as it goes . The Earth , with its properties , is no more the special basis of geometry than is Jupiter or Saturn , or , so far as we can judge , Sirius or Arcturus . Wherever pure intellect is , we are compelled to conceive that , when employed on the same objects , its results and conclusions are the same . But although the human mind has had the same powers and faculties from the beginning of the existence of the race up to the present time , the results of the exercise of these powers and faculties have been very different in different ages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complex body of knowledge concerning the scheme and relations of the Universe . Should we , therefore , admit that there are in Jupiter minds possessing the same intellectual faculties as ours , it does not follow that fit ey have made the same progress as ourselves . " The condition of man on earth as a condition of intellectual progress , implies such a special guidance and government exercised over the race by the Author of his being as produces progress ; and we have not , so far as we yet perceive , any reason for supposing that He exercises a like guidance and government over any of the other bodies with which the researches of astronomers have made us acquainted . The earth and its inhabitants are under the care of God in a special manner ; and we are utterly destitute of any reason for believing that other planets and other systems are under the care of God in the same manner . If we regarded merely the existence of unprogressive races of animals upon our globe , we might easily suppose that other globes also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creator and Upholder of animal life was active on those globes , in the same manner as upon ours . But when we come to a progressive creature , whose condition implies a beginning , and therefore suggests an end , we form a peculiar judgment with respect to God 's care of that creature , which we have not as yet seen the slightest grounds to extend to other possible fields of existence . So far as we can judge , God is mindful of man , and has launched and guided his course in a certain path which makes his lot and state different from that of all other creatures . " We think the ideas of the author in this part of the book are obscure and difficult of comprehension ; but so far as we can understand them , they do not appear conclusive . The same reasons which would lead us to believe in the existence of intelligent beings like man in other worlds , would lead us to think that they are like man in this respect , also ,  --  in his progressive character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that God has created intelligent inhabitants // for other worlds , guide us onward still further to the conclusion that they are like us , progressive races ? Are we totally without evidence that God has the same regard for the people of other planets as for this ? Granting the existence of such inhabitants , possessed of intellectual powers and capacities , which is the more violent presumption , to suppose that God , after having bestowed upon them high intellectual capacities , has consigned all of them to perpetual barbarism ; ( being distinguished from the brutes that perish merely by the possession of powers which they never use ; ) or to suppose that the leaven of knowledge , operating at first on a portion , finally pervades the entire mass ,  --  for such , we think , is the destiny of the human race . It appears to us no more of a gratuitous assumption to infer that beings in the planets , analogous to man , resemble man in making progress in knowledge and wisdom , than to infer that beings analogous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we attempt to regard the inhabitants of other worlds as living like us under a moral government , we are driven to suppose them to be , in all essential respects , human beings like ourselves . We do not see this to be at all necessary . The Scriptures inform us of other orders of intelligencies entirely different from man ; and that the planetary inhabitants , if such exist , have a totally different relation to the external world from that which we sustain , we endeavored to show in the former part of this article ; and , possibly they are as unlike to man as man to angels . We ought to keep in mind the remark which Chalmers makes to the infidel objector ,  --  a remark which our author approves ,  --  that since we know nothing about the inhabitants of Jupiter , true science requires that we say and suppose nothing about them . " If man had never fallen from the high estate in which he was created , he would have been less a creature of " progress " than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the author , prepare the way for entering more directly on his argument . The first argument is derived from Geology ; and , by way of introduction , we are presented with a sketch of the latest results of this science ,  --  an outline which , independently of its bearing on the question under discussion , we would recommend to such of our readers as desire to learn , in the smallest possible compass , the present state of geological science , as particularly deserving of their study and attention . This chapter has also the merit of conciseness , which we do not think is a prominent excellence of our author 's style . The " argument from Geology " commences in the sixth chapter with the following summary of the previous outline of the science . // I have endeavored to explain that , according to the discoveries of geologists , the masses of which the surface of the earth is composed , exhibit indisputable evidence that , at different successive periods , the land and the waters which occupy it , have been inhabited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in large groups , according to the ascending or descending order of the strata , consist of species different from those above and below them . Many of these groups of species are of forms so different from any living things which now exist , as to give to the life of those ancient periods an aspect strangely diverse from that which life now displays , and to transfer us in thought to a creation more remote in its predominant forms from that among which we live . I have shown also , that the life and successive generations of these groups of species , and the events by which the rocks which contain these remains have been brought into their present situation and condition , must have occupied immense intervals of time ; - intervals so large that they deserve to be compared , in their numerical expression , with the intervals of space which separate the planets and stars from each other . It has been shown , also , that the best geologists and natural historians have not been able to devise any hypothesis to account for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , except the exercise of a series of acts of creation , by which they have been brought into being ; either in groups at once , or in a perpetual succession of one or a few species , which the course of long intervals of time might accumulate into groups of species . It is true that some speculators have held that by the agency of natural causes , such as operate upon organic forms , one species might be transmuted into another ; external conditions of climate , food , and the like , being supposed to conspire with internal impulses and tendencies , so as to produce this effect . This supposition is , however , on a more exact examination of the laws of animal life , found to be destitute of proof ; and the doctrine of the successive creation of species remains firmly established among geologists . That the extinction of species and of groups of species , may be accounted for by natural causes , is a proposition much more plausible and to a certain extent probable ; for we have good reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , some few species have ceased to exist upon the earth . But whether the extinction of such vast groups of species as the ancient strata present to our notice , can be accounted for in this way , at least without assuming the occurrence of great catastrophes , which must for a time have destroyed all forms of life in the district in which they occurred , appears to be more doubtful . The decision of these questions , however , is not essential to our purpose . What is important is , that immense numbers of tribes of animals have tenanted the earth for countless ages , before the present state of things began to be . The present state of things is that to which the existence and the history of MAN belong ; and the remark which I now have to make is , that the existence and the history of Man are facts of an entirely different order from any which existed in any of the previous states of the earth ; and that this history has occupied a series of years which , compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limited . " The author next offers various illustrations to show that man is a being totally severed in his nature , attributes , and destiny from all the other beings on the earth , pursuing a course of ' reasoning somewbat similar to that which we formerly adopted to prove that the " World was made for Man ; " yet it is a fact that Man is of comparatively recent origin , having occupied but a moment on the earth , compared with the ion g ages occupied by the races of animals that preceded him . the author proceeds : " flere , then , we are brought to the view which , it would seem , offers a complete reply to the difficulty , which astronomical discoveries appeared to place // in the way of religion :  --  the difficulty of the opinion that man , occupying this speck of earth , which is but an atom in the Universe , surrounded by millions of other globes , larger and to appearance nobler than that which be inhabits , should be the object of the peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Creator of all , in the way which religion teaches us he is . For we find that man ( the human race from its first origin till now ) has occupied but an atom of time , as he has occupied but an atom of space ; that as he is surrounded by myriads of globes which may like this be the habitations of living things , so he has been preceded on this earth by myriads of generations of living things , not possibly or probably only , but certainly ; and yet that , by comparing his history with theirs , he certainly has been fitted to be the object of the care and guardianship , of the favor and government , of the Master and Governor of All , in a manner entirely different from anything which it is possible to believe with regard to the countless generations of brute creatures which had gone before him . " Our author feels disposed to give this new argument of his an ascendancy over the conclusions of astronomy itself . Geology ( he says ) fills the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions of the Universe with objects . It carries ns backwards by the relation of cause and effect , as astronomy carries us upwards by the relations of geometry . Geology , then , has no need to regard astronomy as her superior ; and least of all , when they apply themselves together to speculations like these , but in truth Geology has been an immeasurable superiority . Let the difficulty be put in any way the objector pleases . Is it that it is unworthy of the greatness and majesty of God to bestow such peculiar care on so small a part of His creation ? But we know from geology that he has bestowed upon this small part of his creation , mankind , this special care ; He has made their period , though only a moment in the ages of animal life , the only period of intelligence , morality , religion . Or is the objection this ; that if we suppose the earth only , to be occupied by inhabitants , all the other globes of the Universe are wasted ? But here again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . All its previous ages , its seas , and its continents , have been wasted upon mere brute life ; often for myriads of years upon the lowest , the least conscious forms of life ; upon shell-fish , corals , sponges . Why then should not the seas and continents of other planets be occupied at present with a life no higher than this , or with no life at all ? Or will the objection be made in this way ; that such a peculiar dignity and intportance given to the earth is contrary to the analogy of creation ? Were we to follow such analogies , we should be led to suppose that all the successive periods of the earth 's history were occupied with life of the same order ; that as the earth , in its present condition , is the seat of an intelligent population , so must it have been in all former conditions . // This argument from geology , which we believe to be entirely original with our author , is evidently a great favorite with him , but like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods are assigned by geology to the successive steps in the creation of the world , described in the first chapter of Genesis , all , we suppose , will allow that the work was finished by the creation of man . But , in the beginning , God made the heaven and the earth ; and God made two great lights , the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser lio'ht to rule the night . He made the stars also . This description is unfavorable to the idea that , as is held by the Nebular Hypothesis , worlds are still in the process of formation . It moreover gives a plain intimation that the heavenly bodies were finished at the same time that the earth was ; and were presented along with the earth to the view of the great Creator , when , at the close of his work , God saw every thing that he had made , and behold it was very good . We think that the author coincides with us in the opinion that all things on the earth were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of creation might have been , ( and one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day , ) still it was for the human race that the foundations of the earth were laid-its bosom was stored with mineral treasures-its rocks were decomposed and blended with animal remains to form soils-its surface was covered with a vegetable kingdom , and finally stored with innumerable tribes of animals ,  --  - some to supply his food , some to perform his labor , and some to furnish his clothing ; but all to be subservient , either directly or indirectly , to his use . The true response , therefore , which geology makes to the present question , seems to us to be this : that all her operations having been conducted with ultimate reference to nian , the probability is , that the other planets , and heavenly bodies , finished at the same time with the earth , were finished for the same exalted purpose ,  --  that of becoming the abode of races totally severed from all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image of God . Had the processes of geology been carried on without reference to such an ultimate purpose , they would apparently have been a " waste " of power inconsistent with the known frugality of nature in the use of means ; but having had throughout a constant reference to this high end ,  --  the existence and happiness of the human race ,  --  no step in the progress of creation was lost . In like manner , if the heavens were made with reference to a similar grand purpose , the process of their formation , however slow , implies , as in the case of geology , no waste of power . // Length of time employed in forming the earth would indeed be a waste , if no useful end were attained : amplitude of space would be a similar waste of power , if without a corresponding result . We have not room to follow our author with the same minuteness through the remaining portions of his work . Beginning with the " outskirts of creation " ( the nebuhe ) and descending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has enlarged upon the circumstances unfavorable to the doctrine that they are inhabited ; * but his reasonings apply to beings constituted as we are . lie does not , we think , allow sufficient latitude for the differences of adaptation of orders of beings to the external world in which they are severally placed , the probability of which adaptations we have discussed in the former part of this Article . As to the nebuke , we can infer little respecting their peculiar constitution , or of the probability that the stars , of which some of them at least are composed , are the centers of planetary worlds inhabited by living and intelligent beings , simply because we know so little about them . Analogies for or against the doctrine are weak , because the points of comparison are few . So long as it is a matter of doubt whether the heavenly bodies nearest to us are inhabited or not , it seems inexpedient to extend the discussion to the nebuhe until this point is settled . In our judgment , the author has greatly undervalued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars are suns , and presented in a form much below its real weight the analogy which suggests that they are centers of planetary systems . In chapter tenth , under the head of " Theory of the Solar System , " we have a summary of the peculiar views of the author respecting the constitution of the Solar System , and the exalted place which the earth occupies in it . We will let the author speak for himself . " The planets exterior to Mars , especially Jupiter and Saturn , as the best known of them , appear to be spheres of water , and of aqueous vapor combined it may be with atmospheric air , in which their cloudy belts float over their deep oceans . Mars seems to have some portion at least of aqueous atmosphere ; the earth , we know , has a considerable atmosphere of air , and of vapor ; but the moon , so near to her mistress , has none . On Venus and Mercury , we see nothing of a gaseous or aqueous atmosphere ; and they and Mars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now does not this look as if the water and vapor which belong to the solar system , were driven off into the outer regions of its vast circuit ; while the solid masses which are nearest to the focus of heat , are all approximately of the same nature ? And if this be so , what is the peculiar physical condition which we are led to ascribe to the Earth ? Plainly this : that she is situated just in that region of the system , where the existence of matter both in a solid , a fluid , and a gaseous condition , is possible . Outside of the Earth 's orbit , or at least outside of Mars and the // Nov. small Planetoids , there is in the planets apparently no solid matter ; or rather if there be , there is a vast preponderance of watery and vaporous matter . Inside the Earth 's orbit , we see in the planets no traces of water , or vapor , or gas , but solid matter about the density of terrestrial matter . The Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life are combined-ground to stand upon-air to breathe-water to nourish vegetables and thus animals-and solid matter to supply the materials for the more solid parts ; and with this a due supply of light and heat , a due energy of the force of weight . All these conditions are , in our conception , requisite for life ; that all these conditions meet elsewhere than in the Earth 's orbit , we see strong reasons to disbelieve . The Earth , then , it would seem , is the abode of life , not because all the globes which revolve round the sun may be assumed to be the abodes of life , but because the Earth is fitted to be so , by a curious and complex combination of properties and relations , which do not at all apply to the others . That the Earth is inhabited is not a reason for believing that the other planets are so , but for believing that they are not . Can we see any physical reason for the fact which appears to us so probable , that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward parts ? It would seem that we can . Water and aque. ous vapor are driven from the Sun to the outer parts of the Solar System , or allowed to be permanent there only , as they are driven off and retained at a distance by any other source of heat ;  --  to use a homely illustration , as they are driven from wet objects placed near the kitchen fire ; as they are driven from the hot sands of Egypt into the upper air ; as they are driven from the tropics to the poles . In this latter case , and generally in all cases in which vapor is thus driven from a hotter region , when it comes into a colder it may be again condensed into water and fall in rain . So the cold , in the air of the temperate zone , condenses the aqueous vapors which flow from the tropics , and so we have our clouds and our showers . And as there is this rainy region indistinctly defined between the torrid and the frigid zones on the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air and water , much more precisely defined , in the Solar System , between the central torrid zone and the external frigid zone which surrounds the sun at a greater distance . " If the author complains of the advocates of the doctrine of a Plurality of Worlds for straining analogies beyond their proper bounds , what shall we say of the analogy between the vapor driven from " wet objects placed near the kitchen lire , " and vapor driven off from the neighborhood of the sun , to the regions of Neptune , 2,800,000,000 miles from the sun ? How will the quantity be supplied , requisite for forming such vast lobes as Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune ? How does the idea of this mode of formation by matter " driven off " from the sun , correspond to the mode prescribed by the Nebular Hypothesis , which the author seems to favor ? And since these places , remote from the sun , are truly represented by the author as regions of extreme cold , how will vapor , driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain and showers , or why not fall before it gets beyond the frozen regions *of Mars ? * In the ingenious speculations of Mr. G. P. Bond upon the nature of Saturn 's Ring , he has rendered it probable that this is composed of liquid matter , ( the cold of Saturn is unfavorable to the supposition that the liquid is water ; ) and Professor Pierce has urged additional reasons , derived from // analytical considerations , which tend to confirm that conclusion ; but independently of these investigations , we are linacquainted with any decisive proofs of the existence of liquids in the planets exterior to the earth , much less of water , or even watery vapor . If the belts of Jupiter and of Saturn consist of clouds of vapor , there is little reason to think that it is watery vapor . In proof that the earth is placed in that region of the Solar System in which the " planet-forming powers are most vigorous and potent , our author adduces the phenomena of meteoric stones and shooting stars ; and he recognizes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Zodiacal Light , and that they are of cosmical and not of terrestrial origin . In these general views , so far as respects shooting stars and the Zodiacal Light , ( which views were first proposed by the Professor of Astronomy in Yale College , ) we are ready to concur ; but he has fallen into a very common error in supposing that meteoric stones and shooting stars are similar bodies . Had the myriads of shooting stars , which fell during the great meteoric shower of 1833 , been dense bodies like a*rolites , we should have had most appalling proof of the fact in their destructive violence . There was no evidence that a single individual of these meteors reached the earth ; a high probability was established that none came nearer than within thirty miles of the earth . Here closes the argument against the doctrine of the Plurality of Worlds , derived from physical considerations . The three concluding chapters are devoted to an ex , planation of the author 's views of the " Argument from Design and the " Unity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Future ? ' When we took up our pen , our purpose was to offer a brief statement of the arguments for and against the doctrine in question , and then to give an account of both the interesting works placd at the head of this Article ; but we have been detained so long over the pages of the former of these essays , as to leave hardly any space for the latter . It may readily be inferred , however , by those who read the latter work , " yore Worlds than One , " ( and we hope all who read the one will read the other , ) that the objections urged against the reasoning and conclusions of the essay on the " Plurality of Worlds , " are similar to some we have urged in the former part of this Article . With all the views of the respected author of " More Worlds than One , " we do not , however , profess to concur . From the high character which the authors of these works justly sustain as men of profound science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of erroneous // statements in point of fact , or principle , met with in each essay . We can ascribe them to nothing else than a careless reliance on the memory , where a long interval has passed since the facts were first committed to it , or possibly to a slight failure of this faculty  --  the first admonition of advancing years . Thus the anthor of the " Plurality of Worlds " tells us , that Mars is nearly a large as the earth ; that some of the inhabitants of the earth came to know , four thou8and yeare ago , that in a right angled triangle , the square on the largest side is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides ; that the rising moon is seen from the observatory in Ireland with the same increase of size and light , as if her solid globe , two thousand miles in diameter , retaining all its illumination , really re8ted on the 8uin*mt of the A128 , to be gazed at by the naked eye ; that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would reach the moon in a month ; and that the ordinary rocks at the Earth 's surface , have a den8ity of three or four . , The scientific reader will perceive that all these statements are more or less erroneous . Mars is a little more than one-half the size of the earth in diameter , and about one-8eventh in bulk . The discovery of the equality between the square described on the hypothenuse and the sum of the squares of the two sides of a right angled triangle , is commonly ascribed to Pythagoras , who lived less than twenty-four hundred years ago . The moon when magnified a thousand times , ( a power much beyond what is . ever actually applied to the whole body of the moon , ) would still leave the moon in effect two hundred and forty miles from us , and her size and light would be very different from the same body viewed on the 8ummit of the A128 . A railroad car , in order to reach the moon in a month , or thirty days , must travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary rocks is not from three to four , but from two to three . The argument in chapter tenth , from which it is inferred that the earth is really the large8t planetary body in the Solar System , appears to us not only unsatisfactory , but absurd . Similar inadvertencies are equally numerous in the work of Sir David Brewster . " With respect to the number of moons or satellites , ( says he , ) the Earth has the lowest number , all the ylanet8 , e*eterior to it , having a larger number . " We think he can not be ignorant that Mars has no satellite . Again he says : " The temperature of our own globe decreases as we rise in the atmosphere and approach the sun , and it increases as we descend into the bowels of the earth , and go farther from the sun . The increase of heat , as we approach the surface of the earth from a great height in a balloon , or from the summit of // a lofty mountain , isprodu ; ced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so formed as to compensate , to a certain extent , the diminution in the direct heat of the sun arising from the great distance of the planet . " It is a new idea that the greater heat of the lower portions of the atmosphere , in comparison with the higher , is produced by the atmosphere itself , and is not derived from the sun . We have supposed it a settled doctrine of Meteorology , that , since radiant heat , like the sun 's rays , passes through a transparent medium without producing much effect upon it , the earth is first heated by the sun , and the atmosphere is heated by circulating over it and coming in contact with the surface of the earth . Of course those portions of the atmosphere are heated most which are nearest the earth , and the upper portions only by the ascent of such volumes as have risen from below in consequence of their diminished specific gravity , on imbibing the heat of the earth . In chapter fifth , the Sun 's diameter is stated at eighty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of our earth . " We should have supposed this to be a misprint for eight hundred and eighty thousand , and that one hundred times the size of the earth meant in diameter and not in volume , had not the same statement recurred in chapter sixth , in a different connection . In the eighth chapter , the author says that no change of place has been observed in single fixed stars , excepting that which is common to them all , and arises from the motion of our own system ; and yet , according to Sir John llerschel , ( Outlines , Art . 852 , ) among stars not double , and no way differing from the rest in anyother obvious particular , s Indi* and j. ' * Cassipeke are to be remarked as having the greatest proper motions of any yet ascertained , amounting respectively to 7 " /T4 , and 3 " .74 of annual displacement . We notice these few inaccuracies in the works before us , without any wish to throw discredit on the authority of the eminent and excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much importance that scientific statements , especially when emanating from such a source , should possess entire accuracy . We trust the proper corrections will be applied in subsequent editions , including several other slight errors which we have not room to notice . We have only a remark or two to make in conclusion . After some reflection on the question of a Plurality of Worlds , ( meaning thereby the question whether the planets are inhabited , and whether the stars are suns and centers of planetary worlds , ) we are inclined to believe in the affirmative , althongh // we do so with a fall conviction that there is much to be said on the other side . We will suppose that a man had never seen but one clock , namely , his own , and that all his ideas of the structure of an ' instrnment for keeping time , were fonnded on this . We will now suppose him to visit a manufactory of clocks , where he sees a great number of them in various stages of manufacture , but all in cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ externally the appearance of being finished . lie at once recognizes in the general form and features of the article such a resemblance to his clock , that he immediately concludes the instrnments before him to be time-pieces . The dial plate marked with the hours of the day , and the pointers , the one a minnte hand and the other an hour hand , are alone sufficient to convince him of this ; nor is he less inclined to believe them to be time-pieces becanse the sizes differ from that of his own clock and from one another , or because the cases are somewhat different , or the color and ornaments unlike those of his own ; for none of these circumstances affect the peculiar principles belonging to a time-piece . On opening the cases , however , and inspecting the varions structures , he finds reason to doubt the correctness of his first impressions . In one he finds no pendulum , which is so essential a feature in his own clock , that if this were wanting , it could not serve the purpose of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external appearance of the instrument led him to believe it was a clock , yet a view of its interior mechanism proves to him the contrary . He would , however , reason erroneously , for clocks can be made to keep time without pendulums , although he had never seen , nor could he conceive of such . Examining further , he finds one of the instruments furnished with a pendulum , but having no weights . Everything seems complete with this exce*ti9n ; but since the vibrations of the pendulum of his clock will not continue long without weights , he either concludes , as before , that the instrument can not be designed for a time-piece ; or , at most , infers that , although possibly designed for such a purpose , it is in an unfinished state ,  --  a state of progress towards completion . But he wonld again reason erroneously , since springs , as well as weights , afford the means of keeping up the vibrations of a pendulum . On examining a third specimen , he finds both pendulums and weights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own clock , and hence infers that it can not be a time-piece , or that there are many wheels to be added before it can become one ; as before , it is , he thinks , only in a state of progress towards such an instrument . But here his conclusions may be wrong , b6canse clocks can be // made with fewer wheels than his own clock may have contained . In his progress , however , he at length comes to specimens so perfectly destitute of all mechanism , as fully to justify the inference that they are wholly unfitted for keeping time . If among the hnndreds or perhaps thonsands of specimens to be seen in the manufactory , a few groups were packed together , or arranged with great exactness , according to a certain order , the presumption would be stronger that these , at least , were all finished time-pieces , than that such were finished , as were promiscuously scattered about the establishment . The case of the man in relation to the different clocks , is like that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies . At the first view of them with l5he telescope , finding them to be as large or larger than the earth , round like that , and turning on their axes to afford the vicissitudes of day and night ; being also like our own planet , lighted and warmed by the same sun , and revolving about the same center , he concludes that they likewise are the abodes of life and intelligence . This conviction is strengthened by the consideration that they are arranged together in a perfect system , in a certain determinate order , like clocks in readiness for market . On a nearer view he finds them destitute of certain provisions , as air and water , which , if wanting to the earth , would render it uninhabitable ; and the aspect of the surface , devoid of a vegetable kingdom , and having the sterile appearance of volcanic lava , still further indicates their unsuitableness for the abodes of animals . Hence he concludes that animals can not exist there . But he would have no right to draw such a conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is neither air , nor water , nor vegetables ; and though all these are essential to the sustenance of man , yet , since the Creator sustains other tribes of animals without them , it is clearly within His power to do this in the case of rational beings ; not indeed constituted like man , but still of a nature adapted to the circumstances in which He has placed them . To infer that rational beings can not exist without water , or vegetables , or air , is as erroneous as to infer that a clock can not go without a pendulum .
