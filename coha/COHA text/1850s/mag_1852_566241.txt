txt ART . YIII. - JAMES L. KINGSLEY . An Address commemorative of Prfessor JAMES L. KINGSLEY , delivered in the Chapel of Yale College , October 29th , 1852 , by THOMAS A. TEACHER , Professor of Latin . I CAN NOT enter upon the duty assigned me on this occasion , without expressing the feeling , that the honor of our deceased friend would have required that his life and character should be set before you by one who was earlier , if not mo*re intimately associated with him , and one possessed of more ability and skill to perform the task worthily . But I have yielded to the request of others and to the propriety of the occasion , and must ask your indulgence , if my words fail to do justice to the man , who // held , and deserved to hold , so high a place among American scholars . It is a consolation that his memory depends not on what may now be said of him ; that his name , which , now that his career is finished , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure of this ancient seminary , has gathered for itself a luster , which we could not easily increase or dim . It is indeed true that his useful years have been spent in the seclusion and retirement of an academic life . But to his retreat thousands have come from a thousand different places , to be trained by him for the public contests of life , and have gone out again to places still more numerous and remote , carrying with them a lively and abiding admiration of his varied learning , his refined taste , his delicate sensibility of mind and heart . These thousands of educated men , now scattered throughout the world , would need no new assurance of the eminent qualities of their departed teacher . Nay , I feel sure , that anything which one could say on such an occasion as the present , would give pleasure to them , only as it served to recall to their minds those characteristics , with which they were already familiar ; and thus aided to restore to their view , for a moment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His memory , therefore ,  --  the memory of his excellences and his usefulness-is secure , whatever may be my inability to do him justice , and his name will henceforth be mentioned with those of Stiles and Dwight , and whoever else shall have given the ripeness of their learning or their wisdom to the interests of this institution . Twenty-one years have passed away since I first saw Professor Kingsley , venerable even then , to my eyes , for age ; and although those years have borne him irresistibly on , to , and over , the limit of his earthly life , I shall yet ever feel grateful to them , that , as they passed ; they were bringing me to the knowledge and familiar acquaintance and friendship of one possessed of so rare excellences . But this friendly intercourse has been abruptly terminated , and I feel as though a light had been suddenly put out , which had been constantly , though I might add unconsciously , shining on me , not only to guide , but to shed a cheerful brightness on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thoughts and feelings ; and not only on me , but on all my colleagues , who , all save one venerable head , have been at sometime in their past life his pupils ; nor on us only , but on all this group of families and this collection of youth who compose the community to which he belonged . As we gather , therefore , on this occasion with members of his afflicted family and other near friends , in this familiar place , to restore him , if possible , more vividly to our view , for a little // time , by recalling the events of his life and enumerating the traits of his character , we find our pleasure mingled with sadness ; for we are at the same time more vividly reminded that , with all his genius , with all the richness and sincerity of his nature , with all his intellectual graces and acquirements and vigor , which made him so much our reliance and ornament for many years , he has ceased from among us . James Luce Kingsley was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 28th day of August , in the year 1778 . He was of English puritan origin , being a lineal descendant in the sixth generation from John Kingsley , one of the seven men who , in 1636 , constituted the first church in Dorchester , Mass . His father , Jonathan Kingsley , was a man distinguished in the community in which he lived , for integrity , good judgment , and benevolence . It is evidence of the estimation in which he was held , that , besides being charged with other public duties of inferior importance , he , in the year 1805 , was chosen representative of the town of Windham to the legislature of the state . In private life , as a member of the family , he was particularly remembered by his children , and is still remembered by his only surviving child , as being disposed to retire for the most part from observation and from intercourse with men , and in modest seclusion to employ in reading the hours of leisure which remained from his agricultural pursuits . An inland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished , as a general thing , but few opportunities for gratifying a literary taste of this kind . But Mr. Kingsley did what he could towards supplying the deficiency . He became a member of an association who sustained a circulating library of valuable books ; and although he was under the necessity of going to the neighboring town of Canterbury , where the library was kept , for every exchange of books , it is believed that the privileges it afforded were enjoyed by him to their full extent . This library held an important place in his life , especially in his later years , when an increasing difficulty of hearing cut him off , even more than he would have desired , from the pleasures of social intercourse . The mother of Professor Kingsley was equally distinguished for her intelligence and good judgment , and was always remembered by her son with the highest respect and affection . It does not appear that she was characterized by that sensitive diffidence which marked her husband , and which was inherited from his father by her son ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as in the liberal plans they designed for the education of their children , the // parents were well agreed . Their family consisted of four children , two sons and two daughters , of whom James Luce was the oldest . Professor Kingsley , in speaking of his father , the evening before he died , seemed to desire to bear testimony to his worth , and to the very great obligation which he felt for certain strong*impressions and fixed habits which he had derived from him . He said that he had often thought that the training which he had received in his childhood , was the best he intimate friends of this family , at an early period , so familiar , indeed , as almost to make a part of it , were two aged persons , who deserve particular mention . These were John Whiting and his wife . There was no tie of consanguinity between the families , but Mr. Whiting had been a relative of Mrs. Kingsley 's first husband . These aged people showed as much interest in the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , as if they had really been their grand parents , as they were habitually called by them . Mr. Whiting graduated at Yale College , a member of the class of 1726 , and died the 28th of August , 1786 , having been for some time preceding his death , the oldest of the living graduates of the College . On the day of his death , the oldest of these " grand-children " completed his eighth year . From Capt . Whiting , as he was called , the lad whose history we are tracing , received undoubtedly much information respecting Yale College , and was perhaps led by the interest thus early awakened to desire to be educated there , a desire which he very early entertained , and for which his father gave up , as it will afterwards appear , a somewhat different plan . But whatever effect the veteran graduate may have had in determining the preferences of the boy , it is at least certain that he first initiated him , when less than eight years old , into the mysterious abbreviations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself alluded to this circumstance not long before his death , and his surviving sister still remembers her wonder at the interest her little brother manifested in so strange a book . In this connection it is interesting to add , that no number of the Triennial Catalogue has been issued for the last fifty years , without Professor Kingsley 's superintendence . The childhood of Professor Kingsley showed the same characteristics as his mature life . He was intelligent and cheerful , but extremely diffident and sensitive , and disposed to withdraw himself from all observation , and bury himself in his book . // When his image recurs to his surviving sister , a book is always brought into the view with it . Books withdrew him from play , and almost made him an uninteresting boy to his more active companions ; and sometimes they interfered with more important occupations . On one occasion , at least , during the busy season of the farm , he was sent home , or taken home from the fields by one of the workmen , who " did not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one hand , and a book in the other . " A lad thus accustomed to find his pleasure in books , rather than in active sports , would naturally excel those of his own age in the school-room ; and that was the case in this instance . His mates despaired of ever being able to excel him , and wished that James Kingsley was not in their school ; while , at the same time , his excellence attracted the attention of the venerable Dr. Jas . Cogswell , who volunteered the advice to his parents , that he should receive a collegiate education . The powers of his memory especially had surprised Dr. Cogswell , who presented him with a book , for repeating , or showing that he could repeat , the whole of the catechism from beginning to end , question and answer . The uncommon knowledge of the Bible which remained with Prof. Kingsley through life , and enabled him to tell what was in the Bible , and where it was with surprising readiness , was doubtless acquired , to a great extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible , as well as in his ready and retentive memory , he resembled his mother . He resembled her also in personal appearance , and I may add here , that his attachment to her was strong , and was characterized by that affection , which a diffident and sensitive boy feels towards one to whom he has given his full confidence . But the hint of their pastor was not needed by his parents , who had from his earliest years determined to train up their son for a collegiate education . He was accordingly at the age of ten years sent away from home to be instructed by a competent teacher at Plainfield , Conn . I do not learn how long he remained at Plainfield , but it appears that he was , at some time after this , instructed by Mr. Elliott , of Windham , from whom he was subsequently transferred to the family of the Rev. Mr. Weld , of Hampton . With the last named clergyman he remained till he was fitted for college . At the age of seventeen , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshman , in the year 1795 . I have not been able to learn what led Mr. Kingsley to overrule the preferences of his son respecting the place of his collegiate education , unless it was the fact that several young men from Windham , and the neighboring towns , were , at that time , pursuing their studies at that newly estab // lished institution . But this reason has more weight with us when we learn that the son , who , from his early childhood , had nearly confined his attention to the contents of books , or to the thoughts of his own mind , suggested by them , knew but little of the world without and around him , and would therefore be unskillful in adapting himself to a change of circumstancs . His health , moreover , was habitually delicate , and his parents may , therefore , very properly have attached more importance to the circumstance alluded to , than would have been reasonable in other cases . But he remained at Williamstown only a year . There is a short chapter of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williamstown , to which Professor Kingsley scarcely ever alluded during his long life . The recollection of it was doubtless painful to his sensitive mind ; but since it is valuable , not only as a portion of his history , but also because it occasioned the transfer of his relations to this college , I have concluded briefly to narrate it . At the close of the vacation which followed his freshman year , his father went with him to Lebanon , and saw him set out in the public vehicle for Hartford , whence he was to go by stages to Williamstown . He reached Hartford in safety , where he spent the night . He was about this time , for a considerable period , in very feeble health . The next morning , by some mrsdirection , he took the wrong conveyance ; and when he reached the end of his long journey , during which his mind was probably more occupied with its own subjects of thought , than with any occurrences about him , he found , that instead of being in Williamstown , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexity , and feeling too unwell to undertake immediately the return journey , he determined to seek out some quiet place , where he might recover his strength by a few days of repose . He accordingly crossed over into the state of New Jersey , and having found lodgings that suited him , he remained there about two weeks , when , his health having been gradually restored , he set out on his way homeward . When he reached home , he was too unwell to explain at once his unexpected return . Indeed , his restoration to his wonted health was very slow , so that he did not leave home again till the next spring . It is said , however , that his father 's consent that he should go to Yale College after his recovery , was one of the most efficient of his remedies . In May , 1797 , he went to New Haven , and was admitted a member of the Sophomore class . It is said that he was examined at the same time , and in the same room with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards intimately associated , and whose career was from that time of deep interest , // and in many respects of profouund gratification to him , to the very end of his life . As a member of college , he was faithful to himself and to the requirements of the institution . He was regular in the performance of his duties , and was an industrious , thorough , inquisitive student . He gave nobody any trouble , unless it was by his questions respecting the subjects of study . But he was always very retiring and unobtrusive . Wit and repartee may have been thrifty in his thoughts , but they did not yet venture to the light . He seemed to be happy to escape observation , and so evident was his delicate sensibility , that , for that reason , and on account of the feebleness of his health , he was treated with marked delicacy by his fellow students . Mr. Kingsley graduated as Bachelor of Arts with his class in 1799 . The next year he spent in Wethersfield , as a teacher of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residence in that place was derived from his acquaintance with Judge Stephen Mix Mitchell , an acquaintance which he always remembered , and often recurred to with pleasure . And he commended himself so far in his station as a teacher , that when , after twelve months , he returned home to spend the next year under the paternal roof , two sons of Judge Mitchell accompanied him as his pupils . On the 10th of September , 1801 , he was appointed tutor in the college , and entered upon the duties of his office , at the beginning of the academic year , which commenced the 21st day of October . As this appointment introduced him to what was to be the permanent business of his life , it may be proper to mention here the few important changes in his external relations , which si*bsequently occurred , and then proceed to give some description of the man , in connection with his history as an officer and teacher in the college . After having discharged the duties of the tutorship with singular success for four years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrew , Greek , and . Latin Languages , and of Ecclesiastical History . It may surprise some that he should have been set over so extensive a province , but it appears less strange when we learn , that up to the time of this appointment , there had never been a professor of any language in the college . All the instruction in that department of learning had been given by the tutors , with some aid from the president . Indeed , it may be added , that up to the time when Mr. Kingsley was appointed an officer of the college , there had been in the whole course of its history , but five professors in all , including President Stiles , who , when president , acted as professor of Ecclesiastical History . // Professor Kingsley held his appointment unchanged till , in 1831 , a separate professorship of Greek was established . He continued till the year 1835 to teach the Hebrew language , to such as chose to study it . Since that time , the instruction in that language has been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With regard to Ecclesiastical History , it was said by Professor Kingsley himself , that the appointment was only a nominal one , having been designed to keep the subject before the eye of the public , but not to impose the business of instruction in that department on the nominal incumbent , who was fully occupied with his other numerous duties . He , nevertheless , during a long period of years , delivered a series of lectures on history to the Senior class . He does not appear however on the annual catalogue as professor of history after the year 1816 . From the year 1831 , he considered the Latin language and literatuje his only proper department ; although he did not cease till a few years later , to instruct in Hebrew and history . From the year last named till his resignation in 1851 , he had no other designation on the annual catalogue . In August , 1851 , just 50 years from the time of his first appointment as an officer , he resigned his place , and asked to be released from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted in a resolution of the Corporation , expressing their sense of the great value of his services to the college , and requesting him to retain the nominal connection of a professor emeritus . He complied with the request , and continued to occupy his study in the college buildings , till two or three weeks before his last sickness . He then , while still in perfect health , removed all his books and papers , and college furniture , to his own house , as if having finished to the very end , his official life . During the half century of his connection with the college , he was never absent for any length of time , except in one instance . In April , 1845 , he volunteered to go to Eu rope at his own expense , for the purchase of books for the library , at which time he was absent about eight months . In more than one instance , steps appear to have been taken , to secure the services of Professor Kingsley for other institutions . In the year 1810 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking about for some one to fill the office , which was afterwards filled with such eminent ability and usefulness by Prof. Stuart . Mr. Stuart was at that time the pastor of the first church in New Haven . One day he came into Mr. Kingsley 's room with a letter in his hand , and said to him that he was requested to inquire of him , whether he would accept the office spoken of , if he were appointed . Mr. Kingsley // said in reply- " No , Mr. Stuart , you are the man for that place , and if you go there , in six months you will make the young men there feel , that a knowledge of Hebrew is as essential to success in the ministry , as air is necessary to animal lire . " The last part of this anecdote has already been published , in connection with the memoir of Prof Stuart . Mr. Kingsley was married September 23d , 1811 , to Miss Lydia Coit , daughter of Daniel Coit , Esq . of Norwich . Of his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great loss . One child , George Theodore Kingsley , a graduate of this college of the class of 1832 , died ten years before him . To return now to the time when he was appointed tutor in this college : -I may say that to this office he brought uncommon qualifications . In the first place , there was a deep and lively interest in the institution . From his earliest years , as we have seen , he had been familiar with it , and had begun to study even the titles of its honors , while yet a mere child . Then the interest , with which the facts he had learned , aided by his imagination , had invested the institution , had been deepened by a residence here as a pupil  --  a foster son of the nourishing mother , who had found him ever dutiful and devoted . Those of us who have been familiar with Prof. Kingsley , and know to what extent he identified himself with the college in after life , can e*asily imagine how strong may have been his attachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he entered on his tutorship here . Nor is this by any means an unimportant element in calculating his value to ( he institution . The heart prompts the head no less than the head the heart . In the second J ) lace , he was familiar with its system , with the plan of instruc tion in detail , and knew the defects , as well as the merits of that system , in its practical workings , and he began his instructions here , with the determination that , so far as he was concerned , the defects which he had observed , should not exist , if he could prevent it . Again , he brought with him a literary taste , a love of thorough substantial learning , united with a habit of great accuracy and exactness in its acquisition , a genuine appetite for the nutrimentum spiritus , which eminently fitted him for an academic life . He brought with him a soul quick with sensibility , which could not , as it did not , fail to take hold of the interests of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him great humanity , as that word is used in a large and better sense . He brought with him uncommon mental endowments-in short , he brought great ability to labor , and great adaptedness to , and love for , his field . And he was destined to accomplish a great work here ,  --  as // great a work , so far as the internal literary advancement of the institution is concerned , as has been accomplished by any other man . Others may have , and doubtless have , done more for its wide-spread reputation ; may have superintended and controlled its affairs with that indispensable wisdom , which so commands our homage , without which his labors would have been profitless ; may have offered to it a greater gift of a fame of their own , already brilliant ; but no man has been more concerned in the internal progress of the college , step by step , from the comparatively low degree at which he found it , to the height at which he left it , than Professor Kingsley . Nor is it strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position here which no other man has ever held . During eleven years he instructed the students in all the branches pursued by them from the beginning of the Freshman year to the end of the Junior year ; and as he , by growing familiarity with the continually recurring series , became increasingly sensible of one defect after another , he was instinctively prompted to suggest successive changes . He was not a man of enterprise , but rather the contrary . No man was more disposed than he , to let well enough alone . ' But no man was more sensitive than he , to feel what was not well enough , and but few , if any , would have been more skillful than he to devise changes for the better in our academic course . The eminent di*ne who then presided over the institution , and made the name of Yale College more illustrious for its connection with the name of Timothy Dwight , the Professor of Natural Philosophy and Mathematics , and the Professor of Chemistry and the Natural Sciences , filled each his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But from the nature of the case , eminent their relation to the detail of college studies , as they were chiefly occupied with lectures delivered to the Senior and Junior classes , was very different from that of Professor Kingsley . I will illustrate what I have said by a few particulars . When Mr. Kingsley became an officer in this college , candidates for admission to the Freshman class were examined in no Greek but that of the four Evangelists . The only Greek required during the college course , was the remaining portion of the Greek Testament . The study of that language in this college was then chiefly fostered by the Berkeley annuity , to receive which , it was necessary to pass a much more extensive examination in classical Greek . The other studies of the Freshman year were Latin and Arithmetic . In the Sophomore year , the study of the Greek Testament was continued , the same attention was paid to Latin as in the Freshman year , while instead // of Arithmetic were substituted Geography , the Elements of Chronology and History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geometry . In the Junior year , the Greek Testament , and Latin as before , with other stUdies , which it is unnecessary to particularize . The requirements for admission to college were , so far as Latin was concerned , quite respectable , if the examiners were able to insist on a thorough study of the books required . Nor do I doubt , but that very respectable attainments were made in the knowledge of that language , in the use of which , within a somewhat limited range of subjects , not a few scholars gained a kind of vernacular facility . But the Greek language was studied very little ; and it was this defect in the course of instruction , which seems to have first attracted the **28;979;TOOLONG . He had been here hut a short time when he proposed to have the Iliad of Homer introduced as a text-book . Dr. Dwight objected , that as Greek was recited Monday morning , it would tempt the students to study Homer on Sunday . Professor Kingsley replied , that it was as wrong to study Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request was finally granted , so far as to allow him to hear any persons recite in the book spoken of , who chose to do so . In 1804 , an edition of the Gr*eca Minora was published in Cambridge , Mass . The next year after it was published , it was introduced as a text-book here , and studied by the first class which was admitted after Mr. Kingsley was appointed professor , that class having been required to pass an examination on the whole of the Greek Testament before admission to college . After this important beginning was made , the change was rapid . Not many years later the first volume of the Gra*ca Majora was made a text-book in the classes ; and this was followed after an interval by the second volume of the same work . These two large octavo volumes , containing copious selections from the best Greek authors , continued to be the text-books in Greek , till after Professor Kingsley resigned his professorship of that language in 1831 . It is believed that this work was first introduced into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and that the first class who used it in this college , were supplied with copies imported from Edinburgh at his order . Before the death of Dr. Dwight , the Gra*ca Minora , and the Greek Testament were required for admission to college ,  - -  twice as much in quantity , and still more in quality , doubtless , than had been required for a degree , sixteen years before . But improvements suggested and carried out by Prof. Kingsley , aided by the wise counsel of his colleagues , were not confined to the department of the Greek language . Similar // changes , though fewer , because fewer were demanded , were made in the Latin studies , both in those required for admission , and those pursued afterwards , His services , however , in this department , aside from the influence of his exact and elegant scholarship , were of great value , especially in preparing editions of Latin authors for the press , for the use of the students . But in this connection the fact already mentioned should be borne in mind , namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the languages above him or before him , whom he might consult , and thus obtain the guidance of another 's experience in those branches of instruction , or the fruit of another 's greater learning . Nor did he enjoy those facilities of intercourse with foreign countries , which are now so common , which bring to our hands with so little delay all the most valuable results of European scholarship . Doubtless there are now thousands of persons in this country who are supplied with more valuable facilities for classical study than he enjoyed during the first twelve years of his labor here . But with this scanty supply of books  --  a want which he deeply felt and repeatedly spoke of ' as a great trial , with almost no society in his studies , and diverted , moreover , by the necessity of giving instruction in whatever other branches of literature or science his class might be pursuing , he yet secured a marked progress in this , as well as in the Greek department of ' classical studies . I have said that Mr. Kingsley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professorship by his duties as a teacher of other subjects , especially of the various branches of mathematics . Although this is true , yet it was not without pleasure to himself , or profit to the institution , that he performed these duties also . He cari'ied into these studies the same wakeful mind , as ready to be interested in the facts and investigations of science and the skillful processes in mathematics , as in the more elegant pursuits of litei'ature . A casual observer might even have thought mathematics a favorite department of study with him . Nor would he have been entirely mistaken ; for he acquired a fondness for them which he never lost . It is not strange , therefore , that he should have given similar evidence of his desire for the advancement of the institution in these severe studies , as we have noticed before , in the languages . He was not alone in this department of instruction , it is true . There was a professor at its head , who , though engaged in in. structing only the Senior and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early period we are speaking of ; prepared the series of books for the instruction of the students , which is still in use // in the college . Nevertheless , some valuable suggestions were made by Professor Kingsley , whose closer connection with the scholars in their daily recitations , brought more constantly to his attentio*i whatever defects might exist , and kept his mind on the alert to discover what substitutes there might be for those parts of the system which needed change . Thus the study of Euclid was introduced at his instance , though not without some opposition from the president who thought the short course of geometry , contained in Ward 's mathematics , sufficient Professor Kingsley was , moreover , the first person who , in this college , ever heard a class recite fluxions , except as that study was pursued as an optional one . His last service to the college as a teacher , was rendered in assisting to examine in algebra some of the candidates for admission to the Freshman class at our last Commencement . In the autumn of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numerous duties which up to that time had been laid upon him , and ceased to take the tutorial care of a class , or to give regular instruction in any other than his own department . He employed the leisure thus gained , partly in preparing a course of lectures on language , and another on history which he delivered to the Senior class . These lectures gave evidence of ingenuity , research , and sound judgment in literary matters , and were highly valued by the classes who heard them . They constituted another addition to ihe literary advantages of the institution . But it is unnecessary to go further into particulars . Enough has been said to show that the scholarship and good judgment of Professor Kingsley , his love for the College , and his interest in the cause of thorough and advancing education were doing a great work here during the earlier years of his official life . It may be doubted whether this institution has ever during any other period of the same length made more substantial progress than during the first sixteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich first-fruits of the plan , adopted during the presidency of Dr. Dwight , of having permanent instructors at the head of the various departments of study , who should be always engaged in giving instruction in the College , and in connection with this , should make proficiency in one department the great business of their lives . And it may be added in this connection , that it has been one of the most valued blessings of this institution , and one of the most delightful to recur to , that the three men who , in pursuance of that plan received in their youth appointments from the Corporation near the beginning // of this century , have remained here in the active performance of their duties , till one by one , having passed the limit of three score years and ten , they have laid down their office , amid the regrets of their associates and their pupils . One of*hem , yielding to the requests of his associates and the Corporation , consented to resume his duties , and yet for a brief space continues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To-day we are called to mourn that death has begun to break up this band of veteran associates . But to return from this digression , I may remark that it was not only by his successful efforts to secure the advancement of Yale College as a place of liberal culture , that Professor Kingsley evinced his great value to the institution . He was one of the main elements of strength in the body of instructors . His learning , united with his ability to use his acquisitions and his powers with effect , made him , as I have already said , a great reliance , a general resource , so to speak , of the institution . He was a master in nearly every department , so that there was no branch of learning pursued in the college , except perhaps chemistry , which he could not , if occasion required , have taken up and carried on with credit . And , even in the new and growing science of chemistry , although it may be doubted whether he could have undertaken with any success the manipulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attending the lectures and watching the experiments , both public and private , of the pioneer in those pursuits . It was no rare thing for him to be called on to supply occasional vacancies . When the lamented Fisher was contemplating his fatal expedition to Europe , Professor Kingsley was looked to for aid in maintaining the department of mathematics . And during the interval which elapsed between the death of Dr. Dwight and the appointment of his successor , he occupied the place of president , so far as the president was concerned in instructing the Senior class . And numerous other instances might be mentioned , in which he was the ready and able help of his associates . I shall have occasion , in another connection , to allude to the services rendered by him to the college by his pen . By his menial character and habits he exerted a great and beneficial influence on the whole collegiate community . He understood the main , object of education , and was quick to see what course was best adapted to secure this object . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that superficial study neither added vigor to the mind , nor increased its stock of reliable knowledge . The idle , careless student , therefore , who only seemed to desire , to study just enough to carry him // 1852 . James L. Kingsley . through his recitation without , the appearance and shame of total ignorance , who studied more to discover how little he mig*It study , than to discover anything else more important , sometimes found him an uncomfortable teacher . He made his pupils feel that one true , steady , finished exercise of the mind , however brief , one intelligent tracing and comprehension of a thought , however simple , one voluntary act of intelligence , was worth ten thousand semi-conceptions , or confused efforts , if efforts they could be called , at intelligence . One fact , one principle in science or in language , truly comprehended , would be as food to strengthen the mental powers . On the other hand , the careless mental processes of those who never cared to see a thing clearly , or steadily , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared to know certainly , were injurious to the faculties of the mind , weakening them , and rendering them more and more unfit for any steady , successful exertion . All this was to Mr. Kingsley as a thing of intuition . He needed no reflection to persuade himself that it was best to study thoroughly . Anything else was out of harmony with his nature . Anything less than knowledge was valueless to him as knowledge . inklings and guesses might be valuable as guides towards truth , but they were nothing to rest in for him . He wanted the kernel , and none enjoyed it with a higher relish than he . The same character which made him contemn the superficial , led him to regard the false with aversion . A false account of pretended facts had no interest for him , because it had not that essential truth , which his mind lived on . Every shade which went beyond the exact truth , or varied the coloring of the truth in any way , was in a high degree distasteful to him ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where truth was the object , could give any other than a very foolish self-deluding gratification . Why should any one professing to entertain him with a narrative of facts imagine that the truth would be improved by a little admixture of the unreal ? To him fiction and truth were entirely distinct ; each might be enjoyed in its place . Bdt to confound them was not only an error to his mind , but a most senseless error , so long as truth was the object . He had no patience with the historian or traveler , who made or colored his facts . A discovery of any such dishonesty in narrative ; of any affectation of sentiment even which did not really exist , was uncongenial to his very soul . He felt that every man was under obligation to say only what he knew to be true , unless he gave notice that he was entering on the field of conjecture . A book was worth but little to him in which he // found in any instance , that he could not rely on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind to know , it was the unprompted desire of his mind to find more knowledge , and the only object of knowledge is truth . This appetency for the reality of things , quickened as it was by the acute sensibility of his nature , so as to be an instinct before it was a principle , and indeed as long as it was a principle , I consider to have been the first characteristic of Mr. Kingsley 's mind . Many avow and really possess the principle , but in how few does it have such a vital existence . I might here add , that the sincerity , if I may so call it , of his intellect pertained no less to his moral nature . He was a true man . He never smiled on what he disapproved . He made no affectation of gladness or of grief , or of any other sentiment . He was sometimes silent when he did not approve , but the observer could easily see that it was not a silence that gave assent . Nor did this characteristic ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fed on . His appetite for truth , unadorned truth , never abated . This was the spring of all his efforts at criticism , and the secret of his powers as a critic . He who through carelessness or design corrupted the truth ; he who colored facts to sustain a theory ; moved his indignation . His soul delighted in correcting such a man 's errors ; and yet , not so much for the man 's sake , as for the truth 's sake . The truth was abused when the world was taught to believe that which had no foundation in reality , and his nature suffered a distress till the error was corrected . He loved to show the world what the truth was , and set it side by side with the error they were in danger of learning , to take the truth out of the charge of blunderers , or out of the false envelopments and leading strings of theorists , so to speak , and let it stand by itself in its own independence . And I might ask , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of cilticism , has not admired the clearness , and steadiness , and singleness with which he addressed himself to his work , and proceeded step by step to the end , and how he with unthinking sincerity placed himself out of the field of view , and let the shafts of truth gain the whole victory . And in this he understood a secret of human nature , that there is no other victory like truth 's . Her victories are final . A man may recover from abuse , and insult , and unfounded satire , and exclamatory denunciation . But he who is shown to be at variance with the truth is for ever defeated . Yet in such a contest for truth , satire and ridicule are not excluded . They are often the most effective , quickmoving , // light arms of truth . But they are utterly valueless to an honest mind , if their essence is not truth . Nay , they lose their power just in proportion as they are discovered to be at any remove from truth . Mr. Kingsley's. disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to show that he was , not to call a man a careless or 5Ul ) erflcial student or observer , but to show that he was so . The severity therefore of his criticism , his satire , his ridicule , his wit , resulted from this element of truth . As another has so happily expressed it , his shafts were effective , not because they were poisoned , but because they hit the mark . rrl*ere is also a criticism which pertains to style . In this his taste was cultivated , but just . An inflated , bombastic style contained no worthy substance . Great words were out of place when they were applied to little things . Indeed great words were always suspicious things to him . He preferred to let the clear thoughts of the mind find their utterance in simple language , language that should attract no attention , but act only as the minister to transfer the thought to the minds of others . The thoughts might be beautiful , imaginative , pdetic , cheerful or playful , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to play a subordinate part . Of course he found a field for his criticism in his place as a teacher , and his usefulness in that field can not easily be estimated . I consider it one of the most important elements of useful influence , which this college has exerted over the minds of its students . His character in this particular was so well known that his influence was ever felt , cutting through shams in style , as well as shams in scholarship . Mr. Kingsley was aware , as I have already implied , that nothing was so satisfactory to the human mind generally as evident truth , and this was the secret of the charm of his conversation . His conversation was full of incident and anecdote . But he was careful to reveal the chain which connected any anecdote he might relate , with persons or things which those who heard him knew to be real existences . He rarely related any anecdote respecting Mr. Somebody . The almost inexhaustible fund of incident which his retentive memory had without any apparent effort accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some character or some event already known , and in most cases , already alluded to , by the person with whom he was engaged in conversation . This habit of uniting incident with what was known to be true , invested the incident also with the charm of a living reality , and if it related to a person instead // of an event , it had the further charm of adding a line to the delineation of a character , of making more complete and thus more attractive the individuality of some fellow of our species , towards whom our sympathies are always quick to move . This Mr. Kingsley always seemed to realize . The attractions of Mr. Kingsley in conversation were uncommon . He did not like many hearers . He shrunk from attracting attention . The group could become so large as to make him feel uneasy . But when he was unrestrained , he needed not to hold you by the button , lest he should lose his hearer . Nobody ever accused him of being tedious . On the contrary , who that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the exhilarating effect of his conversation . His range of to pies was wide , but of persons still wider . He had something of a naturalist 's interest in the human species , only his interest was higher and more worthy , by as much as man is higher and more worthy than the lower animals . Whatever was developed in the history of a human being interested him . But it did not interest him if it was not true , any more than'A3*sop 's stories of the conversations of the beasts and birds would interest the naturalist . Every fact therefore which came to bis knowledge respecting an individual whose existence and character had for any reason impressed itself on his memory , was likely to take its place in its right connection in his mind , and have its effect in making more complete his conception of the individuals whom it concerned . Thus there were multitudes of men to whose history he had given a kind of completeness and individuality by this almost unconscious habit of grouping in their natural connection the scattered facts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So if you should take that strange book of his childhood , the Triennial Catalogue , you would find hundreds , and I might perhaps say , thousands of names , the outlines of whose history , or the striking lines of whose character he could give you , not in dry details , but in most relishable incident . This tendency of Mr. Kingsley gave to the people of his mind a personality which heightened very much his own interest in them , and the effect of his conversation respecting them was at times quite similar to that of an introduction to the living person . But Mr. Kingsley was not merely a man of facts . He was not another Dr. Dry-as-dust . He had a soul as well as a mind . The love of truth was there , but induced upon it was the love of whatever was ornamental and beautiful in the world of intellect . His proper department in the college was literature , as dis // tinguished from science , and , as is well known , the best energies of his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is chiefly as a classical scholar and teacher that he is and will be remembered . Although he was almost entirely his own teacher , yet he carried himself to a very high grade as a finished and elegant scholar in this department . Lie had a just idea of scholarship , combining accuracy and a cultivated taste . One is at a loss to decide whether exactness of scholarship or elegance prevailed . He doubtless insisted more on the former with his pupils , but in himself he quite as much illustrated the latter . So far as his example was concerned , he led his pupils through accuracy to elegance . His translations into English strikingly illustrated both of these qualities , and often awoke the admiration of* the student , to whom they served not only for instruction in Latin , but in the idiomatic use of his own language . He was also an elegant writer of Latin . in this Cicero was his model , and he was certainly a successful imitator of his style ,  --  surprisingly successful when we consider how he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies not from a sense of duty merely , but because he loved them . In those earlier years of his official life , when his duties and labors in the college were so numerous , he earnestly desired and expressed the desire for more leisure for these pursuits . And , when at last he had laid down his armor , and had retired from all nublic employment , new studies in this field claimed a portion of his time . It is hardly necessary to add , that one whose taste was cultivated and refined by such familiarity with the matchless monuments of ancient literature , had a genuine relish for the elegant literature of our own language . He was familiar with the best English writers in prose and verse , enjoying a kind of personal acquaintance with Addison , and Johnson , and Milton , and Sh*akspeare , and many others whose writings he relished the more , from his habit of giving a personal existence to the writers . He took an interest in their history , and when , a few years since , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be peopled almost with the old worthies of his library ; from Johnson with his ghost in Cock Lane , to Milton in St. Giles 's , Cripplegate . One could easily have imagined at times from observing the heartiness of the pleasure he derived from the more elegant writers of past times , both classical and later , that he might even join in Walter Pope 's Wish , and ask for retirement from the world , to live in intellectual converse , " With Horace , and Petrarch and two or three more , Of the best wits that reigned in the ages before . ' // As a writer of English , Professor Kingsley enjoyed a high reputation . His style was like his thoughts , perspicuous and forcible , not attracting attention by any excess or want of ornament . He had something to say , and he said it ,  --  in obedience to a homely rule of rhetoric which he loved to quote . Yet he wrote with great care , bringing the keenness of his own criticism to bear on everything which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the faultlessness of his classical diction or the finish of his periods ; and in some of his productions , written in the style of the best English Essayists , you are reminded of the quiet charm of the pen of Addison . His characteristic love of exact and true statements , and his carefulness in the investigation of facts , already spoken of , united , with a retentive memory , to fit him eminently to be a historian . His mind was a great storehouse of written and unwritten history . There is probably no man living more familiar with the affairs of his native state , from its first beginnings to the present day , not in the more important outlines merely , but in the minute details which fill up and give life to the picture . How many have expressed the wish that he would write that history and save from oblivion the great mass of valuable knowledge which he would have embodied in it . How many mourn that in his death so much minute observation , with its accumulated treasures , has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . He made many contributions to history . He performed a most valuable service by his criticisms of historical works . I speak not merely of his more extended articles , which were furnished to our Quarterlies or Monthlies , but the numerous and more brief notices given to the public , and to the frequent and important aid rendered privately to writers and compilers of such works , in the form of suggestion , correction , or actual contribution . And he seemed to delight in such private labors . He was not niggardly of his knowledge . He was not reserving anything for his own use , but , on the contrary , he seemed to enter warmly into plans of any writer , who had asked or was willing to receive his aid , and , from a natural impulse , to do all that he could do for him short of becoming officious . Nor has his kindness of this sort failed of honorable acknowledgment . Says Dr. Bacon , in the preface to his volume of Historical Discourses : " I must be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these studies , from the learning and kindness of Professor Kingsley . Certainly it was a rare privilege to be able to avail myself continually of hints and counsels , from one so familiar with the written and unwritten history of New England , and especially of Connecticut . " // 651 Some of the most valuable papers which Mr. Kingsley published , were on historical subjects . When the citizens of New Haven desired , in the year 1838 , to celebrate the two hundredth anniversary of the settlement of their town , as might have been expected , they requested him to prepare a discourse for the occasion . That admirable discourse , which with its appendix of notes , forms an octavo volume of more than one hundred pages , will serve in all coming time honorably to connect his name with the history of New Haven , as one of the most reliable authorities respecting it . In the year 1835 , Professor Kingsley wrote for the American Quarterly Register , a compendious history of Yale College . r ? his work contains within the compass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important facts in the history of the college from its foundation to the time the publicacation was made . It is of very great value ; and yet scarcely any friend of the college will take it into his hands without a feeling of deep regret , for he will be reminded how much more on the same subject might have come from the same pen-. much that has now perished . The wish was often expressed to him , that he would expand this work and so write an extended and minute history of the college . Indeed the request Was made in form by the Corporation , a number of years before his death , and was afterwards repeated in a modified form-modified to make it more likely to prevail with him , and secure the object so much desired . But the time for undertaking the task never came . There are , however , other contributions to the history of the college to be found in three articles written by him for the Biblical Repository , in review of President Quincy 's History of Harvard College , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present situation of Yale College , " published in 1817 , and his " Report on the course of Instruction in Yale College , " presented to the Corporation in 1828 . His life of President Stiles , furnished for Sparks 's American Biography , and his beautiful Eulogy on Professor Fisher , may also be considered as belonging to the same class . On many occasions of inferior importance , his pen rendered essential service to the college , when he was called on to represent it to the public . Of Professor Kingsley 's power as a critic , I have already spoken . His publications in this capacity were numerous . Some of them have already been mentioned . He contributed papers to the North American Review , the Christian Spectator , the New Englander , the American Journal of Science , the Biblical Repository , and other periodicals . As a critic , he has been called severe . The old etymologists called that man se // vere who was accustomed to sift out the truth . In this sense , as it has been already implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be doubted but that he enjoyed the process of setting things right . But when he indulged in a severity which , in the view of some , might perhaps have been mitigated , there existed an urgent reason for it-often a combination of urgent reasons , which could not properly be set aside . Among these reasons , however , a wanton disregard of the feelings of those whom he criticised had no place . He may in some instance have been moved by his sense of justice to inflict a castigation ; he may in some other instance have been led by a regard for the reputation of American scholarship to manifest surprise , and to speak out the clear opinions of an intelligent scholar . But he was a man of principle . He acted in obedience to the dictates of duty . And if as a censor in literature , he at any time by an indispensable severity occasioned pain to a worthy person , he felt the pain himself , and remembered it , and was at times inclined to doubt whether he ought not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours before his death he alluded to his feelings on this subject . He spoke particularly of a literary controversy which he had been engaged in with a distinguished man , whom in youth and manhood he had known as a familiar acquaintance . The pain produced by having perhaps occasioned pain , was still alive after so many years , and led him to say that perhaps some things which he had written might better have been omitted . But sensitive as he was on this subject generally , it may be doubted whether any jury of fair- minded , competent scholars , keeping in mind the great object of literary criticism , would judge that his writings which belonged to this class were marked by excessive severity . For it should be remembered , that his was not the of abuse , but of showing the errors of severity his author . His English writings would fill a number of volumes if they were collected , and we doubt not there are many among his pupils and friends , to whom such a collection would be most acceptable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar , interested in the advancement of classical education , and as a writer . He also occupied an important post as a governing officer of the college . He was possessed of great influence over the students , who regarded his opinions of propriety , and were incited to studiousness by his earnestness for sound learning , by his readiness to aid their efforts , and by the shining example of scholarship which they saw in him . He was dignified in all // his official intercourse with them ; but admitted without distance or reserve to a pleasant familiarity , such as sought his acquaintance in private . Nor did he thereby diminish his personal influence . On the contrary , the great respect for his talents and learning , which his public instructions inspired , was sure to be increased by more unrestrained intercourse . There were , and perhaps still are , some who can not forget his censures , however well deserved ; for it is well known that he could bring wit and satire to his aid , in exercising control in the recitation-room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so active as well as delicate , that he sometimes , not without indignation , inflicted a penalty which could not be deemed slight . But this was when the punishment followed close upon the offense ; nor was it a trifle to receive one of those bolts from his lips . It is not strange that it should be remembered , not only by the man who received it , hut by all who saw it fall . It was , therefore , generally thought unsafe to go very far in indulging improprieties of speech or behavior in his presence . Yet , no one who desired to do well had any reason to dread a rebuke from him . In deliberations for the punishment of misdemeanors , he always seemed to bear in mind the impulsiveness of youth , and unless the person accused was guilty of some gross turpitude , he leaned to the side of forbearance . He had a great abhorrence of meanness and baseness . He was more indulgent to occasional faults than to habitual neglect of duty . His approval , especially of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students , and as much desired as that of any other person . The effect of this was to make his refined and severe taste in some measure a standard in the college community . As a colleague , Professor Kingsley was respected and beloved by his associates , who feel that by his death not only one of the main pillars of the institution is taken away , but also that they have lost a personal friend ,  --  a friend , who , without any pretension , and inclined even to make himself of but little importance , - by his daily society-by his conversation , which ever held them delighted-by his quick sympathy , which sought to relieve the tedium of sickness , or , not with the mockery of words , but the deep emotion of his soul , shared in the sorrows of those who mourned ,  --  by his readiness to aid them in their public labors , however slight the urgency-in short , by all that he did and all that he was , made himself one of the chief sources of their happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That friendly harmony , which came down with him and his life-asso // ciates from the beginning of the century , never ceased in the body to which he belonged . He was united with them in one great object  --  the welfare and good progress of the college . They were a part of it to him , and his life was bound up in its prosperity . In the family he was the center of affection and respect . His great and varied learning and intelligence were united with a striking simplicity , which allowed no trace of any consciousness of superior dignity to appear . And yet , although he felt more than the usual interest of a father , in the happiness and daily plans of each member of the domestic circle , he , nevertheless , showed himself singularly and delicately unobtrusive respecting their plans for the future and their present employments . This quality , which also showed itself in his friendships , had its foundation in the delicate sensitiveness of his nature  --  a sensitiveness which also prevented , to a great extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He took great pleasure in communicating knowledge in every form , but as if it were contrary to his very nature , he shrank from opening his heart to any one . Much therefore which pertained most intimately to his habitual life , was known only to himself . With this sensitiveness was joined a high degree of sensibility , which was ever manifest as a trait in his character , or rather as a quality affecting the whole man . It appeared in his countenance , in his eye , in his voice , and indeed in his whole frame , showing the deep emotion of his soul . It existed like a higher degree of life animating his whole being , making him feel all things more keenly than other men . I know of no other man whose eyes so , often filled with unbidden tears as his . Now , however reserved such a man may be towards his family and friends , we can have no doubt of the strength of his affection for them , nor will it fail of being at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon forget the depth of his sorrow for the death of his oldest son ? -  --  a sorrow that never departed from his heart while he lived . For years after the occurrence of that sad event , he could testify , that no day had passed over his head , without bringing the remembrance of that son . He loved the society of his household , and in it he spent his life , deeply interested in every member , more ready to communicate knowledge than advice , and showing the depth of a generous love , less by words than by numerous* acts of kindness . How little can our sympathy , sincere and constant as it may be , compensate to this bereaved household for their perpetual loss ! // The lively sensibility of Mr. Kingsley 's nature showed itself also in his keen sense of justice . He was carefully just in all his dealings with men , and inculcated the same on his children . He was just also in his opinions , lie rejoiced in the prevalence of justice , nor had he any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by reasons of moral or political expediency . He was a man of punctual and careful habits . He was never late at the class-room , or at prayers , or at the meetings for college business . He was sometimes absent , but he was never late . He habitually took great care of whatever pertain-. ed to himself or was committed to his charge . He showed a special carefulness of books . He was very sensitive to their abuse . From his infancy a book had been something more to him than paper and ink . With a great portion of his own books , and indeed with very many in the college library , he enjoyed , as it were , a personal acquaintance . He took them up with an interested , friendly look , and told their age and history almost as if they were his children , and he noted their loss as something more than the loss of property . He was careful in the management of property ; but it was not a carefulness that prevented generosity on his part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary , some of the most generous have scarcely been known . In later life , Providence so increased his means that he was in easy circumstances , and beyond the apprehension of want . Allied to carefulness is caution . This was a prevailing trait , and has perhaps stood in the way of his usefulness and his fame . So severe was the standard by which he judged others , and by which he would judge limself , that he rarely allowed himself to appear before the public , unless called out by some emergency . To this , therefore , must we charge it , that one who possessed so rare qualifications for authorship , even refused urgent and honorable invitations to appear before the public , and confined himself to the works , which , considerable as they are , are themselves evidence that the soil which produced them might have borne more abundant fruits . The picture of Mr. Kingsley would not be complete if I should omit to mention his great simplicity . It might be called a marked peculiarity , for all the peculiarities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was by no means wanting in shrewdness . Indeed , most persons would say , and probably with truth , that he had more shrewdness than simplicity . Each quality had its place . As an observer or a listener , or a learner in any other way , he had all the simplicity , and manifested at // times all the gladness of a child . But when he applied his judgment to what he had learned , he showed uncommon shrewdness . In the year 1845 , as I have already mentioned , Professor Kingsley went to Europe to purchase hooks for the college library . He executed his commission with great judgment and with great satisfaction to those interested in the library . His purchases v*ere made chiefly in London , Paris , Amsterdam , Berlin , and Leipsic . This expedition gave him high enjoy.rnent . In the first place , it gratified his inclination to gain an acquaintance with hooks . He went on his daily errand with a feeling of interest in what was before him , and with the feeling that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rejoicing in at home . in the second place , he enjoyed the visit to foreign lands . He was much exhilarated by the novelty of the scenes which were passing before him . He was interested to see the scenes of great events , and the abodes of men with whose names he had been familiar from his childhood , as the authors of great achievements in the state or in literature . He was interested to observe the different habits and modes of life and modes of thought , which prevailed in diverse nations . These travels , also , gave him an opportunity to see and hear , and become acquainted with some distinguished living men ; to see brilliant pageants , and compare the splendor of royalty with republican simplicity . He enjoyed every thing . it was a continual feast of fat things . Even the inconveniences and distresses of traveling , had their pleasant side . They were human experiences at lea stf and they were his . His eye constantly shone with new delight . So numerous were the new phases of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beautiful city , that again and again , the walk of half a mile consumed the best hours of the morning And after his safe return home , his life seemed to have a new element of gladness in it , in the recollection of his successful travels . His health , moreover , appeared to have been improved by the expedition , and soon after his return , he resumed his duties with new vigor , which did not abate while he remained an officer of the college . Yet , he soon began to look forward to the decline of his powers . When he reached the age of seventy years , he informed me that he intended to resign his office at the end of three years , at which time he should have been fifty years an officer in the college . In reply to objections to his resolution , he said that his mind was made up , and he // desired me to remind him of his promise when the time came round , playfully expressing the apprehension , that by that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the time came there was no decline in his powers-. no diminution of his ability or his willingness to discharge the duties with which half a century 's service had made him lamiliar . And although he persisted in his cherished determination , he still felt unwilling to give up at once the business of his life . Accordingly , he spent a part of the year which followed his resignation , in instructing the Junior class in those writings of Cicero , which discuss the doctrine of the immortality of the soul . On the 24th of last August , he attended the funeral of Dr. . i*neas Monson , who , before his death , was the oldest living graduate of the college . He was unwell when he went out . When he returned to his house , it was for the last time . It was evident to the physician , who was soon called , that he was seriously ill , nor did the remedies used avail anything to check the progress of the disease . He , himself , seemed almost disinclined to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which he should soon be relieved , and declined , as much as he could , the services of others . But the day before his death , which occurred in the morning of the last day of summer , the truth seemed to have taken possession of his mind , and in reply to his wife , who carefully communicated to him the opinion of his physicians , that he was in danger and might not recover , he quietly replied , " I did not know that you were aware of it . " So calmly had he , who had enjoyed the rational pleasures of a useful intellectual life with almost unparalleled zest , and whose keen appetite for these elevated enjoyments , was not yet at all blunted by the approach of age , resigned all , and composed himself to die . When , in the evening of the same day , he was asked if a familiar friend , who was a clergyman , should be called in to pray with him , he said , " I do not know that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolongedI have already gone beyond the usual limit of human lifeand the present may be the best time for my removal . " - " Constans et libertsfatum excepisti I " How like a philosopher ! How closely in keeping with the spirit of that page of the Roman philosopher with which he closed his classical instructions ! - " Nos nero , si quid tale acczdent , ut a deo denuntiatum videatur , ut exeamus e vita , ... eo simus ammo , .. . ut nihil in malis ducarnus quod sit vel a diis *mmortalibus vel a natura , parente omnium , constitutum . " But it was not philosophy which sustained our departed friend in that last conflict . Or rather it was the highest philosophythe // philosophy of the soul which confides in the wisdom and goodness of God . On that bed of death , in a calm conversation with his dearest friend some hours before his departure , he avowed his trust in God through Jesus Christ , and responded to the Christian hope , that all the members of that dear family should finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was this delightful testimony to the sustaining power of the religion of Christ the only evidence of his religious character . In the year 1808 , he made a public profession of religion , and he adorned that profession by an unblemished life . He wrought righteousness . He worshiped God with his household every passing day . And all along the course of that half century , the heart which he instinctively strove to keep from the view of men , was so far revealed that we see that it cherished and was cheered by the truths of religion . In his last conversation with one of his colleagues , he said , that from early childhood , when he enjoyed the instructions of a Christian mother , his mind had been occupied with the subject of religion-that there had been a time , when his mind had been aroused , and a crisis in his life had then seemed to occur . He , at the same time , expressed himself with earnestness , as being under the greatest obligations for the impressions on this subject which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible . He had been accustomed , particularly of late , to spend much time in reading its contents in other languages . In his family there had been observed a growth of religious feeling , especially discoverable in the daily prayers of the household . He acknowledged our dependence on the grace of God , speaktng with peculiar earnestness of our " infinite need of the regenerating influences of the Holy Spirit . " But the delicacy of his nature had generally during his life prevented his giving frequent utterance to his religious feelings . Who can tell how much he may have been troubled with this unwilling reserve , or how carefully he may have considered it in his heart . The phases of the Christian life are as various as are human hearts . His life is ended , and as we contemplate it in its great usefulness , its completeness , and the crowning glory of its purity in obedience to God , which through faith made its close so calm , we feel that all is well .
