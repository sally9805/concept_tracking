txt FOREIGN POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1825-6 . CUBA . IF the principle laid down by Mr. Webster , during the Lobos controversy , that an island removed a few miles distance from the rnain ; land , ought to be considered as by nature detached and separate , as if it were a foreign country , the Island of Cuba should be as foreign to the United States as the peninsula of Ilindostan to the island called England and Scotland . But the fact of being an island , geographically related to a continent , as the Lobos lslands to Peru , or a continent related to an island , as the city of Venice to her adjoining territory ,  --  the mere fact of relation geographically considered , without reference // to the commercial or military necessities of the continent on the one hand , or the island on the other ,  --  this mere geographical relation may be considered rather as a pr*text . The fact of proximity confers no claim to sovereignty ; else the right of England to govern France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geographical proximity is a source of sovereignty , it is a source more or less to be valued in controversy as the proximity is greater . The reduction of distance by steam power , bringing an island and a continent more closely together , should give rise to common sovereignty , and confer upon one or other country , when a certain velocity had been achieved for the wheels of steam-ships , a right of imperial control . But clearly , proximity is not a ground of sovereignty ; else how were it possible to define countries by lines mathematically drawn ? The proximity of Pennsylvania to the State of Delaware is absolute ; but it does not follow that these two sovereignties are by consequence to blend in one . The rule of proximity is plainly a gross fiction ; not of law , but of usurpation . In modern times , at least , it may be rejected in toto . The Island of Cuba can not be laid claim to by the United States , because it is a boundary of the Gulf and of the Caribbean Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution of juestions which involve the destiny of empires . If it is necessary and just that Cuba should become a member of the Union , it will be because the inhabitants of Cuba and of the United States are to be thereby materially benefited . We may fearlessly insist , that the common interest of the two countries shall be the sole and absolute ground of all arguments in the most important controversy of these days , the controversy between those who oppose , and those who favor the integration of Cuba among the sovereignties of the Western Continent . Unfortunately , for the past twenty-seven years , during the agitation of this great question , only two interests , for the most part , have been consulted-namely , those of the United States and of Europe-including England . It will never be brought to a satisfacfory conclusion , until the interests of Cuba herself are first consulted , and by her own people . The right of conquest over Cuba , either by ourselves or by European powers , we do utterly and confidently deny , as contravening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Constitution . Bold attempts have been made by political writers of great eminence and admirable talent , to destroy the system of what is called international law . Its very existence as a // body of principles founded in nature and the practice of nations , has been of late denied . It has been proved that the powers of Europe , and especially Great Britain , contiimally violate the principles of this law . If , however , the fact of its repeated violation is to be made an argument for denying the existence and validity of a code , the Constitution of the United States must lose its validity , and cease to be the guide of legislation . That Constitntion is itself a body of international law , established by the common consent of thirty-two independent Republics . But the governments which it harmonizes and protects , are far more independent of each other than any portion of the British Empire of its centre ; more independent than any European country of its more powerful neighbor . By a system of international law , the States of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful State in that system ,  --  the influence of Russia , for example , over the affairs of a particular State , as of liungary ,  --  is much greater and more direct than that of Pennsylvania or New York over vicinal States less powerful than they . A general system has been adopted for the thirty-two republics of the Northern Continent ; that system is founded upon the interest of all , and touches only what is common and universal . We argue , that it is in the strictest and most logical sense a model " law of nations , " and capable of indefinite extension . Have we not ceased to say what was formerly said , that the safety of the Union is endangered by its growth ? We know that it is not endangered . It has been proved , and continues to be proved , by cumulative argument from day to day . Out internationality , derived not only from the necessities of our situation , but from a philosophical view of the rights of nations , considered as independent powers , must finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations . The Constitution of the Union is a document of non-interrention ; a document which is a pledge and a con-* tract ; a promise and a performance ; a theory sanctioned by a practice conformable to the laws of God and nature . There can be no safer derivation of a foreign policy for the United States , than from the Constitution itself : it is not necessary to consult Yattel or the Code Napoleon ; the admiralty records of Great Britain , or the acts of her parliament . George Washington and his compeers were the founders of our international law , which they derived from the necessities of nature and the rights of the States ; they built it upon non-intervention ; this was the pivot , the first idea of the discussion which // terminated in the adoption of the Constitution . The arguments which they agitated , and the passions which agitated them in turn , arose from considerations of the j*nt rights of independent States to settle , once for all , the international relations of all those contiguous sovereignties : to separate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be exercised by a part . Let us approach this Cuban controversy with clean hands and calm minds : let us beware how we indulge that peculiar erathusiasm which too often vitiates the legislation of Republics ; which , under pretext of establishing the rights of man , violates the rights of States , not less divine and benignant , since by them alone the rights of man are first made good . If Cuba is to become a member of our system , it must be because she her* self has willed it ; if she is to enter into a system of liberty , she must possess liberty to enter therein . It is said by Northern agitators , " Let us apply the doctrines of emancipation to States . Within the immediate circle of our own influence we have applied it to individuals ; now let it be extended from individuals to governments . If the State of New York , or of Ohio , have abrogated slavery within their own boundaries , they have done this in pursuance of a general principle , an abstract right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entire populations ? " One of the first acts of the Republican party , during the late revolution in France , was to propose the emancipation of the West Indian slaves ; it was consistent with the principle of their revolation to do this ; they found it logical ; nor is it less logical to apply this principle , as some have proposed to apply it , and as France has once attempted to apply it , to the liberation of communities as well as of individuals . If we start from the abstract doctrine of emancipation and the rights of man , when we liberate Cuba from Spain , to be logical , in a Red Republican sense , we ought also to liberate the negroes of Cuba from their Creole masters . Why do we pause and shudder at " the frightful doctrines of this new propaganda of liberation , which gives over an entire people to logic and assassination ? We fancy that such is not , however , the manifest destiny which , in the name of God , is to impel us during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his compeers , and such will not be ours . We have not established a propaganda , of which a declaration of universal emancipation is to be the writ . We regard political hypotheses , even when they are advanced // under the holy name of liberty , as equally abhorrent to God and nature with the most detestable fanaticism ; simply for the reason that they are equally destructive to the lives and happiness of men : and when we seek a doctrine to justify ourselves in an apparent usurpation , we shall seek it not in political hypotheses , but in the precedents and practice of our ancestors , and the reason of the common good . The question of the admission of Cuba into our own continental system can not be agitated until it is a settled point , un fait accompli , that she is herself a republic . Jf our attempts , however beneficently made , should result in the rAbellion and disorganization of her slaves , she is lost to us and to the world . The period of annexation would be indefinitely postponed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ br the internal and external growth of the Republic , which administers internal and external affairs with equal justice and moderation , whose foreign policy is as well suited to the growth and genius of the empire as its internal economy , such an administration , whatever obloquy may rise against it among its contemporaries , will receive the commendations of posterity . But the character of the American people , more especially of those who have been trained from infancy to the exercise of republican rights , and in whose thoughts and actions the system of legalized freedom continually perfects itself ,  --  the character of this people , we are constrained to say , is founded more in justice than in ambition ; their enthusiasms are transient , their purposes inflexible : the dreams of sentimental theorists , dreams from which men awaken into bloody realities , are not the sources of Am-nerican inspiration : we are a people who pursue happiness , not in a wilderness of passions , but in the steady pursuits of a well-adjusted and humane intelligence ; pursuits which appear always to be directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrinsic merit and solid foundation in the substantial realities of existence , conduct us continually upward , through the narrow channels of physical freedom to the heights of moral and intellectual liberty . We have dignified our policy with the name of republican , because it is founded in the Res Publica , the common good ; and the taunts of the world shall not tempt us from this moral fortress . If the European powers imagine that the American people are slow and timid in the assertion of their rights or the extension of their empire , and , proceeding upon that error , treat us contemptuously or neglectfully , they will have an // awful fault to retrieve : To say that we are fearless is to say nothing ; we are audacious ; we do not understand the nature of fear . Nor are we less apt to appreciate the benefits of those grand measures of extension , which time is accomplishing for us with a steady and effectual hand ; the boundaries of the Republican Empire grow outward like the rings of the oak , by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their thoughts are larger ; but they need not depart , in the pursuit of glorious ends , from the principles of justice and humanity . If the Island of Cuba is to enter into the system of the Free Republics , she must come in like Texas , as a sovereign State , by the strong desire and expressed will of her citizens . We do not desire to add to our system a ruined and rebellious territory , overrun by a self-emancipated negro population . A more difficult problem than the annexation of Cuba as a Republic , has never presented itself to the minds of American statesmen . To discuss it in all its phases , to disclose all the difficulties that attend the diplomacy of its solution , would require the intellect of a Calhoun , exercised without interest or passion . A more brilliant acquisition than the Island of Cuba will never be made by this Republic . It is recognized by all , as the grand step of Republicanism towards imperial predom* inance . Npthing is more brilliant , nothing more difficult ; - more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless emancipation ; more conducive to good , if managed by the conservative hand , guided by the gravity and wisdoai of the Empire . It is not our intention to set forth in detail , at this moment , the advantages and the perils of this great measure of the future . For the present we ask the attention of the judicious reader , more especially of the Southern , to the opinions of a very celebrated name . The extracts which follow are taken from a speech of Daniel Webster on the general subject of our continental policy , twenty-seven years since ; when the parties and the issues which have lately agitated us , were as yet immature , and ' half developed . During the presidency of John Quincy Adams , the States of Central America , who had recently assumed their freedom , were meditating the conquest of the Island of Cuba , and her conversion into a member of their own system . A Congress of the Spanish American States was appointed to meet at Panama . Mr. Clay , our Secretary of State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South , was willing , // in conjunction with Mr. Adams and Mr. Webster ,  --  those three holding the foremost rank in the Government and councils of the nation ,  --  to send Commissioners to the Congrs*s at Panama , not only to establish friendly relations between the two systems of Republics , but to prevent any ill-considered and hasty invasion of the Island of Cuba . If the reader is offended because we have quoted in a Democratic journal the authority of the three most powerful Whig leaders of twenty-seven years since , we can only regret it . The total annihilation of the Whig party in the late election , has made us quite fearless of any partisan use that might be made of these quotations . The Whigs have yielded us an intellectual triumph , the most brilliant that has been achieved by any party . They have conceded , by their votes , the practical efficacy of our domestic policy , and if , in a spirit of gratitude , not a little tempered it is true by exultation , we take good advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable men will not condemn us . In the following extracts it will be seen that Mr. Webster , twenty-seven years since , supported what is called the Monroe doctrine , even to its extreme consequences . In his old age , especially in regard to Nicaragua and Mexico , he seemed to fall away from it ; but the defection was perhaps a weakness more Than a fault . It is not here our intention to discuss the merits of his admipistration . If anything has been omitted which the honor of the country and its interests demand , the incorning administration will have leisure , and , no doubt , inclination to amend it . Mr. Webster was called up in debate to defend the spirit of the Panama mission in the House of Representatives . His exposition and defence of the Monroe doctrine is one of the most brilliant points of his career . Times have changed . The Cuban question is no longer what it was , a theory of the remote future . A new doctrine has sprung up affecting alt the common issues ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promulgated by Calhoun . This doctrine will be applied , both by the North and South , in all cases where the question is of territorial aggrandizement . Let the reader meditate well the following extracts ; they contain undeveloped principles ; they reach , indeed , only to the crisis of their own age ; we must carry them forward to ours . Sir , I deny there is an acknowledged departure , or any departure at all , from the neutral policy of the country . What do we mean by our neutral policy ? Not , I suppose , a blind and stupid indifference to whatever is passing around us ; not a // total disregard to approaching events , or approaching evils , till they meet us full in the face . Nor do we mean , by our neutral policy , that we intend never to assert our rights by force . No , sir . We mean by our policy of neutrality , that the great objects of national pursuit with us , are connected with pea* . We covet no provinces ; we desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by war . This is our policy . But it does not follow , from this , that we rely less than other nations , on our own power to vindicate our own rights . We know that the last logic of kings is also our last logic ; that our own interests must be defended and maintained by our own arm ; and that peace or war , may not always be of our own choosing . Our neutral policy , therefore , not only justifies , but requires , our anxious attention to the political events which take place in the world ; a skilful perception of their relation to our own concerns ; an early anticipation of their consequences ; and firm and timely as*rtion of what we hold to be our own rights , and our own interests . Our neutrality is not a predetermined abstinence , either from remonstrances , or from force . Our neutral policy is a policy that protects neutrality , that defends neutrality , that takes up arms , if need be , for neutrality . I must , now ask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion , I mean the declaration of the president in 1823 . Not only as a member of the house , but as a citizen of the country , I have an anxious desire that this part of our public history should stand in its proper light . Sir , let us recur to the important political events which led to that declaration , or accompanied it . In the fall of 1822 , the allied sovereigns held their congress at Verona . The great subject of consideration was the condition of Spain , that country then being under the government of the Cortes . The question was , whether Ferdinand should be reinstated in all his authority , by the intervention of foreign force . Russia , Prussia , France , and Austria , were inclined to that measure ; England dissented and protested ; but the course was agreed on , and France , with the consent of these other continental powers , took the conduct of the operation into her own hands . In the spring of 1823 , a French army was sent into Spain . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ferdinand re-established in all his power . This invasion , sir , was determined on , and undertaken , precisely on the doctrines which the allied monarchs had proclaimed the year before , at Laybach ; and that is , that they had a right to interfere in the concerns of another state , and reform its government , in order to prevent the effects of its bad example ; this bad example , be it remembered , always being the example of free government . Now , sir , acting on this principle of supposed dangerous example , and having put down the example of the Cortes in Spain , it was natural to inquire with what eyes they would look on the colonies of Spain , that were following still worse examples . Would kin Ferdinand and his allies be content with what had been done in Spain itself , or would he solicit their aid , and was it likely they would grant it , to subdue his rebellious American provinces . It was in this posture of affairs , on an occasion which has already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the session of December , 1823 , that these allied monarchs might possibly turn their attention to America . The doctrines of Laybach were not limited to any continent ; Spain had colonies in America , and having reformed Spain herself to the true standard , it was not impossible that they might see fit to complete the work by reconciling , in their way , the colonies to the mother country . And , accordingly , as soon as the Spanish king was c0mpletely established , he did invite the co-operation of his allies , in regard to South America . In the same month of December , a formal invitation was addressed by Spain to the courts of St. Petersburg , Vienna , Berlin , and Paris , proposing to establish a conference at Paris , in order that the plenipotentiaries , there assembled , might aid Spain in adjusting the affairs of her revolted provinces . These affairs were proposed to be adjusted in such manner as should retain the sovereignty of Spain over them ; and though the co-operation of the allies , by force of arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at . The king of Spain , in making this request to the members of the holy alliance , quoted their own doctrines of Laybach ; pointed out the pernicious example of // America ; and reminded them that their success , in Spain itself ' ; had paved the way for successful operations against the spirit of liberty , on this side of the Atlantic . The proposed meeting , however , did not take place . Engl*d had already taken a decided course ; for , as early as October , Mr. Canning , in a conference with the French minister in London , informed him distinctly and expressly , that England would consider any foreign interference , by force or by menace , in the dispute between Spain and the colonies , as a motive for recognizing the latter , without delay . It is probable this determination of the English government was known here , at the commencement of the session of congress ; and it was under these circumstances , it was in this crisis , that Air . Afonroes declaration was made . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or would not , take place , to concert with Spain the means of re-establishing her power ; but it was plain enough they would be pressed by Spain to aid her operations ; and it was plain enough also , that they had no particular liking to what was taking place on this side the Atlantic , nor any great disinclination to interfere . Tlii* was the posture of affairs ; and , sir , I concur entirely in the sentiment expressed in the resolution , of a gentleman from Pennsylvania , ( Mi- . Markley , ) that this declaration of Mr. Monroe was wise , seasonable , and patriotic . It has been said , in the course of this debate , to have been a loose and vague declaration . It was , I believe , sufficiently studied . I have understood , from good authority , that it was considered , weighed , and distinctly and decidedly approved by every one of the president 's advisers , at that time . Our government could not adopt , on that occasion , precisely the course which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provinces , if the allies should take part with Spain against them . We had already recognized them . It remained , therefore , only for our government to say how we should consider a combination of the allied powers , to effect objects in America , as affecting ourselves ; and the message was intended to say , that we should regard such combination as dangerous to us . Sir , I agree that the message did mean something ; that it meant much ; and I maintain , that the declaration answered the end designed by it , did great honor to the foresight , and the spirit of the government , and that it can not now be taken back , retracted , or annulled , without dis*race . It met* sir , with the entire concurrence , and the hearty approbation of the country . The tone which it uttered , found a corresponding response in the breasts of the free people of the United States . That people saw , and they rejoiced to see , that , on a fit occasion , our weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without departing from our duty , we had done something useful , and something effectual , for the cause of civil liberty . One general glow of exultation-one universal feeling of the gratified love of liberty-one conscious and proud perception of the consideration which the country possessed , and of the respect and honor which belonged to it-pervaded all bosoms . Possibly the public enthusiasm went too far ; it certainly did go far . I3ut , sir , the sentiment which this declaration inspired , was not confined to ourselves . In that very house of commons , of which the gentleman from South Carolina has spoken with such commendation , how was it there received ? Not only , sir , with approbation , but I may say , with no little enthusiasm . While the leading minister expressed his entire concurrence in the sentiments and opinions of the American president , his distinguished competitor in that popular body , less restrained by official decorum , more at liberty to give utterance to the feeling of the occasion , declared that no event had ever created greater joy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe ; that he felt pride in being connected by blood and language , with the people of the United States ; that the policy disclosed by the message , became a great , a free , and an independent nation ; and that he hoped his own country would be prevented by no mean pride , or paltry jealousy , from following so noble and glorious an example . It is doubtless true , as I took occasion to observe the other day , that this declaration must be considered as founded on our rights , and to spring mainly from a re . gard to their preservation . It did not commit us at all events to take up arms , on any indication of hostile feeling by the powers of Europe towards South America . // If , for example , all the states of Europe had refused to trade with South America , until her states should return to their former allegiance , that would have furnished no cause of interference to us . Or if an armament had been furnished by the allies to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Buenos Ayres , the distance of the scene of action diminishing our appreh*ision of danger , and diminishing also our means of effectual interposition , might . still have left us to content ourselves with remonstrance . But a very different case would have arisen , if an army , equipped and maintained by these powers , had been landed on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico , and commenced the war in our own immediate neighborhood . Such an event might justly be regarded as dangerous to ourselves , and , on that ground , to have called for decided and immediate interference by us . But how should it happen , sir , that there should now be such a new-born fear , on the subject of this declaration ? The crisis is over ; the danger is past . At the time it was made , there was real ground for apprehension : now there is none . It was then possible , perhaps not improbable , that the allied powers might interfere with Americs . There is now no ground for any such fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , were at that time here . They all heard the declaration . Not one of them complained . And , yet , now , when all danger is over , we are vehemently warned against the sentiments of the declaration . To avoid this apparent inconsistency , it is , however , contended , that new force has been recently given to this declaration . But of this , I see no evidence whatever . I see nothing in any instructions or communications from our government , changing the character of that declaration in any degree . I have but a word to say on the subject of the declaration against European colonization in America . The late president seems to have thought the occasion used by him for that jurpose to be a proper one for the open avowal of a principle which had already been acted on . Great and practical inconveniences , it was feared , might be apprehended , from the establishment of new colonies in America , having a European origin , and a European connection . We have a general interest , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , our commerce might find its way , protected by treaties with governments existing on the spot . These views , and others of a similar character , rendered it highly desirable to us , that these new states should settle it , as a part of their policy , not to allow colonization within their respective territories . True , indeed , we did not need their aid to assist us in maintaining such a course for ourselves ; but we had an interest in their assertion and support of the principle as applicable to their own territories . I now proceed , Mr. Chairman , to a few remarks on the subject of Cuba , the most important point of our foreign relations . It has been said , that if Spain chose to transfer this island to any power in Europe , she had a right to do so , and we could not interfere to prevent it . Sir , this is a delicate subject . I hardly feel competent to treat it as it deserves ; and I am not quite willing to state here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , dissent from this opinion . The right of nations , on subjects of this kind , are necessarily very much modified by circumstances . Because England or France could not rightfully complain of the transfer of Florida to us , it by no means follows , that we could not complain of the cession of Cuba to one of them . The plain difference is , that the transfer of Florida to us , was not dangerous to the safety of either of those nations , nor fatal to any of their great and essential interests . Proximity of position , neighborhood , whatever augments the power of injuring and annoying , very properly belong to the consideration of all cases of this kind . The greater or less facility of access itself , is of consideration in such questions , because it brings , or may bring , weighty consequences with it . Again ; it has been asserted , that although we might rightfully prevent another power from taking Cuba from Spain , by force , yet if Spain should choose to make the voluntary transfer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is a distinction without a difference . If we are likely to have contention about Cuba , let us first well consider what our rights are , and not commit ourselves . If we have any right to interfere at all , it applies as well to the case of a peaceable , // as to that of a forcible , transfer . If nations be at war , we are not judges of the question of right , in that war ; we must acknowledge , in both parties , the mutual right of attack , and the mutual right of conquest . It is not for us to set bounds to their belligerent operations , so long as they do not affect ours*ves . Our right to interfere in any such case , is but the exercise of the right of reasoncble and necesse ry self-defence . It is a high and delicate exercise of that right ; one not to be made but on grounds of strong and manifest reason , justice , and necessity . The real question is , whether the possession of Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endanger our own immediate security , or our essential interests . I put the question in the language of some of the best considered state papers of modern times . The general rule of national law , is , unquestionably , against interference , in the transactions of other states . There are , however , acknowledged exceptions , growing out of circumstances , and founded in those aircumstances . These exceptions , it has been properly *aid , can not , without danger , he reduced to previous rule , and incorporated into the ordinary diplomacy of nations . Nevertheless , they do e ist , and must be judged of , when they arise , with a just regard to our own essential interests , but in a spirit of strict justice and delicacy , also , towards foreign states . The ground of these exceptions is , self-preservation . It is not a slight injury to our interest ; it is not even * , rent inconvenience , that makes out a case . There must be danner to our security ; or danger , manifest and imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests . Now , sir , let us look at Cuba . I need hardly refer to its present amount of commercial connection with the United States . Our statistical tables , I presume , would show us , that our commerce with the Havana alone , is more in amount than our whole commercial intercourse with France , and all her dependencies . But this is but one part of the case , and not the most important . Cuba , as is well said in the report of the committee of foreign a is placed in the mouth of the Mississippi . Its occupation by a strong maritime p*w* ' would be felt , in the first moment of hostility , as far up the Mis*issippi and the Missouri , as our population extends . It is the commanding point of the Gulf of Mexico . See , too , how it lies in the very line of our coastwise traffic ; interposed in the very highway between New Yorh and New Orleans . Now , sir , who can estimate the effect of a change , which should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new rules of commercial intercourse , or connect it with objects of a different and still more dangerous nature I feel no disposition to pursue this topic , on the present occasion . My purpose is only to show its importance , and to be gentlemen not to prejudice any rights of the country , by assenting to propositions , which , perhaps , may be necessary to be reviewed . But , it is said , that , in this , as in other cases , we should wait till the event comes , without any previous declaration of our sentiments , upon subjects important to our own rights , or our own interests . Sir , such declarations are often the appropriate means of preventing that , which , if unprevented , it might be difficult to redress . A great object in holding diplomatic intercourse , is frankly to expose the views *nd objects of nations , and to prevent , by candid explanation , collision and war . In this case , the government has said , that we could not assent to the transfer of Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do gentlemen think we can ? If not , then it was entirely proper that this intimation should be frankly and seasonably made . Candor required it ; and it would have been unpardonable , it would have been injustice , as well as folly , to have been silent , while we might suppose the transaction to be contemplated , and then to complain of it afterwards . Pains , sir , have been taken by the honorable member from Virginia , to prove that the measure now in contemplation , and indeed the whole policy of the government , respecting South America , is the unhappy result of the influence of a gentleman formerly filling the chair of this house . He charges him with having become himself affected at an early day , with what he is pleased to call the South American fever ; and with having infused its baneful influence into the whole councils of the country . If , sir , it be true , that that gentleman , prompted by an ardent love of civil liber // ty , felt , earlier than others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America ; or that , acting on the maxim , that revolutions do not go backward , he had the sagacity to foresee , earlier than others , the successful termination of those struggles ; if thus feeling , and thus perceiving , it fell to him to lead the wil1in* or unwilling councils of his country , in her manifestation* of kindness to the new governments , and in her seasonable recognition of their independence ; if it be this , which the honorable member imputes to him ; if it be this course of public conduct , that he has identified his name with the cause of South American liberty , he ought to be esteemed one of the most fortunate men of the age . if all this be , as is now represented , he has acquired fame enough . It is enough for any man , thus to have connected himself with the greatest events of the age in which he lives , and to have been foremost in measures which reflect high honor on his country , in the judgment of mankind . Sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , in my place here , of individuals ; but I could not forbear what I have now said , when 1 hear , in the house of repros intatives , and in this land of free spirits , that it is made matter of imputation , and of reproach , to have been first to reach forth the hand of welcome , and of succor , to new-born nations , struggling to obtain , and to enjoy , the blessings of liberty . We are told that the country is deluded and deceived by cabalistic words ! If we express an emotion of pleasure at the results of this great action of the spirit of political liberty ; if we rejoice at the birth of new republican nations , and express our joy by the common terms of regard and sympathy ; if we feel and signify , high gratification , that , throughout this whole continent , men are now likely to be blessed by free and popular institutions ; and if , in the uttering of these sentiments , we happen to speak of sister republics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political system and forms of government of this hemisphere , then , indeed , it seems , we deal in senseless jargon , or impose on the judgment and feeling of the community by cabalistic words ! Sir , what is meant by this ? Is it intended , that the people of the United States ought to be totally indifferent to the fortunes of those new neighbors ? Sir , I do not wish to over-rate , I do not over-rate , the progress of these new Btates in the great work of establishing a well-secured popular liberty . I know that to be a gi*at attainment , and I know they are but pupils in the school . But , thank God , they are in the school . They are called to meet difficulties , such as neither we nor our fathers encountered . For these , we ought to make large allowances . What have we ever known like the colonial vassalage of the states ? r , *Then did we , or our ancestors , feel , like them , the weight of political despotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would shut up heaven to all but the bigoted ? Sir , we sprung from another stock . We belong to another race . We have known nothing-we have felt nothing of the political despotism of Spain , nor of the heat of her fires of intolerance . No rational man expects that the South can run the same rapid career as the North ; or that an insurgent province of Spain is in the same condition as the English colonies , when they first asserted their independence . There is , doubtless , much more to be done , in the first than in the last case . The work may be more arduous-it is not less noble , because there may be more ignorance to enlighten ; more of bigotry to subdue ; more of prejudice to eradicate . If it be a weakness to feel a strong interest in the success of these great revolutions , I confess myself guilty of that weakness . If it be weak to feel that I am an American , to think that recent events have not only opened new modes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard and sympathy between ourselves and our neighbors ; if it he weak to feel that the South , in her present state , is somewhat more emphatically a part of America , than when she lay obscure , oppressed , and unknown , under the grinding bondage of a foreign power ; if it be weak to rejoice , when , even in any corner of the earth , human beings are able to get up from beneath oppression , to erect themselves , and to enjoy the proper happiness of their intelligent nature ; if this be weak , it is a weakness from which I claim no exemption . A day of solemn retribution now visits the once proud monarchy of Spain . The prediction is fulfilled . The spirit of Montezuma and of the Incas might now well say , // " Art thou , too , fallen , Iberia ? Do we see The robber and the murderer weak as we ? Thou ! that has wasted earth and dared despise Alike the wrath and mercy of the skies , Thy pomp is in the grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made . " Mr. Chairman-I will detain you only with one more reflection on this subject . We can not be so blind-we can not so shut up our senses , and smother our faculties , as not to see , that in the progress and the establishment of South American Isberty , our own example has been asuon the most stimulating causes . That , . reat light  --  a light which can ncver be hid  --  the light of our own glorious revolution , has shone on the path of the South American patriots , from the beginning of their course . In their emergencies , they have looked to our experience ; in their political institutions , they have followed our models ; in their deliberations , they have invoked the presiding spirit of our own liberty . They have looked steadily , in every adversity , to the GREAT NORTHERN LIGHT . In the hour of bloody conflict , they have remembered the fields which have been consecrated by the blood of onr own fathers ; and when they have fallen , they have wished only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted their parts bravely , for the cause of liberty in the western world . Sir , I have done . If it be weakness to feel the sympathy of one 's nature excited for such men , in such a cause , I am guilty of that weakness . If it be prudence to meet their proffered civility , not with reciprocal kindness , but with coldness or with insult , I choose to follow where natural impulse leads , and to give up that false and mistaken prudence , for the voluntary sentiments of my heart .
