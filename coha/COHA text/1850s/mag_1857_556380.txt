txt ART . IV . A Report of the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States , and the Opinions of the fudges thereof , in the Case of Dred Scott versus John F. A. Sanford . December Term , 18*6 . By BENJAMIN C. HOWARD , Counsellor at Law , and Reporter of the Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States . New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co. pp. 389 to 633 . THE decisions of courts are required by law to be promulgated , printed , and published . The reasons of the decision are to be stated , to enable the court to expound the principles of law , and show their bearing on the case ; as also to give assurance of the permanency of the rules of law , and of the wisdom and impartiality of their application , by reference to other decided cases . The court may thus justify its conclusions to the jurisconsult , and secure the confidence of the community , while it settles the rights of litigants . The promulgation and publication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity of judges , and of the impartiality of their judgments . Published opinions become a part of the literature of the day . They are submitted to the // THE DRED SCOTT CASE . criticism of the country . The law , the logic , and the morality , embodied and set forth in these carefully studied productions , are the legitimate subjects of examination and criticism . The greater the authority of the writers , the more dangerous are their errors . And the more important the public interests affected by them , the more imperative is the duty of pointing out their errors , or of vindicating their claim to confidence and respect . Moreover , the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States are in no sense sectional , but national topics . Their validity , their mode of operation , their bearing on the civil status of individuals and classes of men , it is the concern of our whole people to investigate and determine . While , therefore , we have felt it our duty , in a Review intended primarily to represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to avoid subjects of sectional controversy , this very consideration seems to force upon us the cognizance of a decision , or rather of a series of opinions , emanating from a tribunal which constitutes the judicial mind and conscience of the country , taken collectively . The plaintiff brought this action of imprisonment , in the Circuit Court of the United States , to try his right to freedom . That court , after sustaining their own jurisdiction against a plea in abatement , rendered a final judgment against the plaintiff on the merits , and in favor of the defendant . The plaintiff then brought a writ of error to the Supreme Court , to obtain a reversal of that judgment , and the establishment of his right . The judges deliver their opinions seriatim , each in his own language , touching at greater or less length such points as he chooses , and referring with approbation or otherwise to such parts as he pleases of the opinions of any of his brethren . Nevertheless , the argument of the Chief Justice is called the opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of the report . Only one judge expresses his concurrence with the whole of it , and even he manifests a dissatisfaction with a part of it , by rearguing it for himself . Others express assent to different parts of it , or dissent from the whole . No arguments of counsel appear ; but the case is argued by the judges with much zeal , and at great length , and by some of 34 // them with great ability and learning , without any apparent partiality or improper respect to the rights or interests of the parties or either of them , but , on the part of most of them , with a keen and steady view to the political results of the examination . All but two members of the court finally agree to turn the plaintiff out of court , as he came in . On what grounds this is done , they have agreed in no common and authoritative annunciation . With two or three exceptions , each judge may now , or hereafter , with perfect consistency , aver his concurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , except such as he has published in his own name . On what points they agree or disagree must be ascertained , if at all , by analyzing , classifying , and comparing what each one has said , in regard to every point discussed in the case . This we will now attempt to do . The matter which the court first encountered was the plea in abatement , and the first question concerning it was whether it was legally before them for adjudication . This is a question of practice . It must have been before the court , in some form , on the docket of every term since the court was established . Cases are here cited upon it , running through a period of more than half a century . And yet the honorable court do not know what the law is upon this point of practice . The Chief Justice says : " Doubts are entertained by some of the members of the court , whether the plea in abatement is legally before the court upon this writ of error . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original question , and decided by a major vote , if such a vote can be obtained . It is so argued ; and every judge , more or less directly , and more or less at large , expresses his views upon it . We shall see who and how many are the doubters , and who sustain each side of the question . Mr. Chief Justice Taney says : " The plea in abatement is necessarily under consideration ; and it becomes , therefore , our duty to decide whether the facts stated in the plea are or are not sufficient , " &amp;c . Mr. Justice Wayne is of the same opinion , concurring , as he says he does , entirely in the opinion of the Chief Justice , " without any qualification of its reasoning or its conclusions " on this or any other question in the // case . Mr. Justice Daniel says : " The question first in order presented by the record in this cause , is that which arises upon the plea in abatement . " The idea that it " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Justice Curtis says : " When there was a plea to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court , in a case brought here by a writ of error , the first duty of this court is , sua sponte , if not moved to it by either party , to examine the sufficiency of that plea . " Mr. Justice McLean says : " The plea to the jurisdiction is not before us , on this writ of error . " Mr. Justice Catron says : " The proceedings on the plea in abatement are not open to the review of this court by a writ of error . " Mr. Justice Nelson says : " There is some question * about this matter ; but he adds " In the view we have taken of the case , it will not be necessary to pass upon this question , and we shall therefore proceed at once to an examination of the case upon its merits . " He of course is one of the doubters . Mr. Justice Campbell says : " My opinion in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I shall not discuss the questions it suggests . " He therefore does not concur in the opinion , that the plea is necessarily before them , and that it is their duty to decide it . Mr. Justice Grier concurs " in the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Nelson on the questions discussed by him , " of which this is one . He however says : " The record shows a prima facie case of jurisdiction , requiring the court to decide all the questions properly arising in it . " Such is the predicament of the court on this first point of the case . Four judges are of one opinion ; two of the opposite ; two will give no opinion , and one is divided . When Mr. Chief Justice announces , as he does , " We think they - the plea and demurrer , and judgment of the court below upon it - are before us upon this record , " he is sustained by Justices Wayne , Daniel , and Curtis only . There is no majority in favor of anything ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be claimed that Judge Grier is in favor of something , - in which case it would clearly be impossible to prove the contrary from any disclosure he has made of his views on this point in his published opinion . Notwithstanding this position of the first question , the Chief // Justice goes on to state the second , as foil ows : " Whether the facts stated in the plea are or are not sufficient to show that the plaintiff is not entitled to sue as a citizen in a court of the United States ? " The facts stated , as correctly condensed by the Chief Justice , are that the plaintiff is " a negro , whose ancestors were imported into this country , and sold as slaves . " The plaintiff alleges that he is a citizen of Missouri ; the defendant says that this is not true , because he is " a negro , " &amp;c. ; and the question is whether these last allegations are sufficient to show , their truth being admitted , that the plaintiff 's allegation is false ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were imported slaves , can be a citizen . This , the learned Chief Justice says , " is certainly a very serious question , and one that now for the first time has been brought before this court , " - " and it is our duty to meet it and decide it . " Accordingly he labors it through twenty-four pages , and then announces the result as follows : " Upon a full and careful consideration of the subject , the court is of opinion , that , upon the facts stated in the plea in abatement , Dred Scott was not a citizen of Missouri within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States , and not entitled as such to sue in its courts and , consequently , that the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction of the case , and that the judgment on the plea in abatement is erroneous . " Such is the very formal announcement , by Mr. Chief Justice Taney , of what he calls " the opinion of the court " on the second question . Let us now see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Wayne , like another great man , who always said " ditto to Mr. Burke , " concurs unqualifiedly . But notwithstanding this broad adhesion , he still expresses one limitation . He concurs only " in the opinion of the court , as it has been written and read by the Chief Justice , " before the whole court , on the 6th of March last . He may perhaps hereafter be glad to avail himself of this limitation , to escape responsibleness for a good deal of absurdity . But it will not apply to the decision of this second question , or to the twentyfour pages of argument preceding it . He assents to all this , and he expressly admits that the court " has decided that the // Circuit Court had no jurisdiction of the case , " independently of the examination of the merits . Mr. Justice Daniel concurs with the Chief Justice in sustaining the plea in abatement , and reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court which overruled it . Mr. Justice McLean says : " The plea which raises the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly sustained . " Mr. Justice Curtis says : " The plea to the jurisdiction was bad , and the judgment of the Circuit Court overruling it was correct . " Mr. J*istice Nelson does not concur in the opinion that the plea in abatement is sufficient ; for his " conclusion is , that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed , " on the merits , which could not be if the suit was abated on the plea . Mr. Justice Grier concurs with Judge Nelson , and says , " that the record shows a prima facie case of jurisdiction , " ( notwithstanding the plea in abatement , ) " requiring the court to decide all the questions properly arising in it " ( on the trial of the issues to the jury ) . If he intended to have anything understood , by what he says , this must be a part of it . Besides , he thinks that the final judgment of the court below might properly be affirmed , which could not be if he held the plea in abatement good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is not affected by the plea to the jurisdiction " ; of course he holds it good for nothing . And again : " My examination is confined to the evidence upon the issues to the jury . " He does not hold the suit abated , but to be examined on the merits , and that " the judgment should be affirmed , " or at least might be so . Mr. Justice Catron says : " The plea in abatement is not open to the review of this court by a writ of error . " Of course the judgment of the court below , overruling it , stands unreversed , and irreversible , in his opinion ; and there is " nothing in controversy here but the merits . " The result is , that three judges are for reversing the decision of the court below , on the plea in abatement ; and six are against the reversal , - two because that decision is right , one because this court has no authority to examine it , and three without giving any reason . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirm , or waive . The Chief Justice says : " The // opinion of the court is , " and we , the court , " have decided , that the Circuit Court erred in deciding that it had jurisdiction upon the facts admitted by the pleadings . " Six members of the court , each speaking for himself only , say they have done no such thing . Here let us make a rest , as the merchants say , and see how we stand . There is no mistake about this matter ; there can be none . The Chief Justice undertakes to speak for the court , speaks in their name , in their presence , and , as he says , by their authority ; and he speaks officially as the head of the judiciary of the United States , from the seat of justice , to the American people , and to the world . Can his words be anything but verity itself ? He says the court have decided " that the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction of the case , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Wayne says the same . Judge Daniel says that this is in conformity to his opinion . The other six judges do not sustain it . This is the precise position of the Supreme Court of the United States , before the nation and before the world . How was that question decided ? The validity of the whole subsequent proceedings depends upon the answer . If that judgment was decided to be erroneous , then all the court did afterwards was coram non udice , erroneous , and extrajudicial . And if those proceedings were erroneous , then all that this court can build upon them , or any part of them , is just as groundless , illegal , and extrajudicial as they were . If that court had no jurisdiction , this court had none . If that court could not legally look into and try the merits , neither can this c*urt . For the jurisdiction of the latter is only through the former , and they can only do what the court below should have done , or direct them to do what they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this . The Chief Justice himself says , and he speaks for the court in this , if he does in anything : " Passing a judgment upon the merits in favor of either party , " ( and it makes no difference whether it is in favor of or against either or both parties , or whether it is passing a judgment , or taking the evidence , or directing a verdict , ) " in a case which it is not authorized to try , and over which it had no jurisdiction , is as grave an error as a court // can commit . " Mr. Justice Wayne expresses the same idea , where , in stating his concurrence with Mr. Justice Nelson on a single point , he adds , " assuming that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction , " meaning obviously that , inasmuch as they had not jurisdiction , that point was not before them . Mr. Justice Daniel cites with approbation a case in which this court said : " Any proceeding without the limits prescribed " ( that is , without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action a nullity . And whether the want or excess of power is objected by the party , or is apparent to the court , it must surcease its action or proceed extrajudicially . " Again he says : " The questions subsequently raised upon the several pleas in bar might be passed by , as requiring neither examination nor adjudication . " Nevertheless , under the circumstances , he says : " To me it seems proper that they should here be fnlly considered , " &amp;c . Mr. Justice Curtis says : " To examine the merits of the case , " of which " the Circuit Court had not jurisdiction , and . . . . to which the judicial power of the United States does not extend transcends the limits of the authority of the court , as described by its repeated decisions , and , as I understand , acknowledged in this opinion of the majority of the court . " For any court to attempt to decide cases not legally within their jurisdiction , is against law . It is a violation of the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to great national questions , affecting the political or civil rights of the body pf the people , it is in every just sense of the word usurpation , and should be treated as such by the community whose rights are thus outraged . The whole authority of the case hinges on this point . If the judgment of the court below , on the plea in abatement , is reversed , and that plea adjudged sufficient , then that court had no jurisdiction , and all subsequent proceedings on the pleas in bar , in both courts , are extrajudicial and void . If that judgment is affirmed , or allowed to stand in force and not reversed , then that court had jurisdiction , and all legal proceedings on the pleas in bar , in both courts , so far as they were necessary to enable them to determine the rights of the parties , on the merits , are valid . If it can not be determined , from the official report , whether the judgment on the plea in abatement was // reversed or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This point not only affects the authority of the case , but it involves the character of the court , the personal credit of the judges , and the honor of the nation . It is known to the public , that this opinion of the Chief Justice , or certain parts of it , and particularly the long argument and decision on the second question , now under consideration , was read by him from the bench , as the opinion of the court , in the presence of all the judges , on the 6th of March last . On that day and the following , opinions were read by other members of the court , some of which were soon after printed and given to the public . Subsequently all the opinions we now have were given to the official reporter , and more recently , between two and three months after the original promulgation , they are all printed for the use of the public , in the form now before us . That they are not a mere transcript of what took place in court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the information of those who heard them . The Chief Justice 's opinion has sustained material interpolations ; one or more of the others have been reproduced entire , since that time ; and others still have undergone alterations more or less material . But which of their honors have been guilty of beguiling the Chief Justice into the awkward position of promulgating , as the opinion of the court , a decision which only two of them will now back up and sustain ? Did he not previously read the opinion to all the judges in private free consultation ? Did not a majority of them then agree to it and adopt it , and request him to read it publicly as their opinion ? How then will they justify themselves ? Is it anything short of absolute perfidy in them , now to abandon him , and repudiate the decision ? What obligations can he be under to screen them from the consequences of such conduct , by concealing their names ? Or will they say that they never did agree to it , and that he acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If so , there can be no difficulty in asserting that he is placed in a false position , and under an imputation beneath which he ought not to rest . // The dispute must probably lie within a very* narrow compass . Justices McLean and Curtis will certainly not be suspected of having assented to the doctrine , that a negro can not be a citizen , and that the plea in abatement was sufficient . Justice Nelson probably will not , for he is in favor of affirming the judgment below . Nor Justice Catron , for he says the plea is not before them , and they have no right even to consider it . Of course he never could have consented to reverse the judgment on it . Justices Grier and Campbell only remain . What say you , Mr. Chief Justice , did Justices Grier and Campbell , or either of them , authorize you to deliver that opinion for them , and agree to stand by it , and afterwards write and publish opinions of their own repudiating it , leaving you in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justices Grier and Campbell , did Mr. Chief Justice Taney assume to deliver an opinion for you , without your consent , and then accuse you of bad faith , because you repudiated it , and publicly refused to confirm it ? The issue is to the country . But whatever may be the result of this difference , how stands the fact ? Is it as stated by the Chief Justice , that the judgment below on the plea in abatement is actually adjudged erroneous , and reversed ; or is it left in full force , not reversed or vacated ? It would seem that this question is now to be treated as of no manner of consequence . The publication of the opinion having promulgated its doctrines as the doctrines of the court , the truth in regard to the actual decision is of no importance . Accordingly the Chief Justice says , in his interpolated opinion , as now printed by authority : " If that plea is regarded as waived , or out of the case upon any other ground , " - as , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficient , as the court below decided , - " yet the question as to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is presented " by the merits , so it makes no difference . He therefore goes on , with the other judges , to examine and decide the case , on the merits , as they appeared in evidence , and on the verdict given on the trial of the pleas in bar , without regarding whether that trial was illegal and extrajudicial or not . We shall hereafter see with what success . In the mean time let us see what are the principles in // tended to be established , if a vote of the majority had sauctioned the sufficiency of the plea in abatement . The broad question presented by the plea was whether any descendant of imported African slaves , however remote , and however minute the remaining portion of African blood , could be a citizen . The negative was monstrous ; and it was not sustained even in the Circuit Court of Missouri . Yet three judges of the Supreme Court of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its length and breadth ; and more of them probably would , if it had not been thought expedient to evade it , after the exposd ' made by the dissenting opinions , in order to come at ulterior questions . The Chief Justice and Judge Daniel have devoted thirty-five pages of argument to the labor of sustaining it . The argument starts with the identity in constitutional language of the terms " citizens and people , " which " describe the political body who form the sovereignty , hold the power , and conduct the government , " - " the sovereign people * ; * and with the admission that any State , both before and since the adoption of the Constitution , may make whom it may please , even aliens , citizens , so far as the State itself is concerned.t " Every person , and every class and description of persons , who were at that time recognized as citizens in the several * This definition would hardly include women and minors . I Persons made citizens by State laws vote , by virtue of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the general government , and of course hold a part of the sovereignty of the conntry , rightfully and constitutionally , and are directly within the Chief Justice 's definition of citizens . Besides , if they are not general citizens , it would fellow that we may have a President and members of Conbress , legally elected , and the whole government controlled by the authority , legitimate and lawful , of those who are not citizens of the United States . It is repeatedly asserted in the course of these opinions , and not directly denied by any of the judges , that there is a citizenship of the United States independent of , and not arising from , or connected with , a citizenship of any of the States . If this be so , what are the rights and privileges of such citizenship l They certainly do not include a participation in the government of the country ; for the right of suffrage , in regard to officers of the general government , is granted and controlled exclusively by State laws . They do not include any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are conferred by the Constitution only on " the citizens of each State . " And they do not include the right particularly in question in this case , the right to sue in the United States courts ; for this too is conferred only on a citizen of a State . This court have de* cided that an inhabitant of the District of Columbia can not be a party to a suit with an inhabitant of one of the States , in virtue of this clause of the Constitution . // States , became also citizens of this new political body . " But the privileges of citizens in this new sovereignty were limited to " those only who were then members of the several State communities , or who should afterwards , by birthright or otherwise , become members , * according to the provisions of the Constitution , and the principles on which it was founded . Imported slaves and their descendants , though they had become free , " were not acknowledged as a part of the people . " They were considered as an inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white mau was bound to respect . " They were " bought , and sold , and treated as an ordinary article of merchandise and traffic , " among all nations , and nowhere more so than among the English and their American Colonies . " The general words " in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution , though broad enough " to embrace the whole human family , and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day would be so understood , " do not include them . Two clauses only of the Constitution point to them specifically . " One of these clauses reserves to each of the thirteen States the right to import slaves , until the year 1808 . " " By the other , the States pledge theA*elves to maintain the right of property of the master . " " These two provisions show , conclusively , that neither the persons therein referred to , nor their descendants , were embraced in any of the other provisions of the Constitution . " The number of those emancipated was comparatively small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not in the minds of the framers of the Constitution , when they were conferring rights and privileges on citizens of the United States . The power of naturalization is given exclusively to Congress , and restricted to foreigners , and the more dangerous power of raising the degraded class to the rank of citizens never could have been left to the States . What provision does the Constitution of the United States make for persons becoming " members " of " the new political body , " by ' " birthright or otherwise , " ( except by naturalization , which extends only to foreigners , ) unless it be through and by means of a citizenship of a State acquired by descent or otherwise in virtue of State laws If the Constitution of the United States recognizes a general citizenship acquired in the States by birth , otherwise than this , it must extend equally to all the children of the " sovereign people , " which would ill comport with the object of the Chief Jnstice 's argument . // The rights secured by the Constitution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for temporary sojourners only . If a person migrates , he becomes an inhabitant of the State he goes to , and his status there must be fixed by its own laws. * Judge Daniel on some of these points is a little more explicit than the Chief Justice . He says expressly : " The African was not deemed politically a person . He was regarded and owned , in every State , as property merely . " After the adoption of the Constitution , " State power would be incompetent to bestow a character or status created by the Constitution . " From such groundless assumptions , false premises , and sophistical conclusions , it is some relief to turn to the dissenting opinions . Mr. Justice Curtis sustains the decision of the court below , on this point , in an argument , full , thorough , and unanswerable . " A citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of the Constitution , " in constitutional language , means a citizen under the Confederation , and applied to all who were citizens of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , New Jersey , and North Carolina , then recognized as citizens , and admitted to the rights of citizens , including the right of suffrage , all their free inhabitants , without regard to color or descent . They were a part of the people , by whom the Constitution was made , for themselves and their posterity . It recognizes citizenship by birth , - " a natural-born citizen . " The States originally possessed the power of determining what persons should or should not be citizens . This power they have not delegated to the general government , except in the case of aliens . The disabilities of alienage , Congress alone can remove ; but of the native-born inhabitants , such are citizens as their own State laws make so , and no others4 They are the people , consti * So that , although a State can not make any person a citizen of the United States by conferring on him any or all of the rights of a citizenship of the State , which it has a perfect right to do , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , migrates from one State to another , the State to which he goes may degrade him to any status it may please . Thus the Constitution authorizes levelling down , but does not permit any levelling up . t If any of the native-horn inhabitants of the country are aliens in any of the States , their alienage is not such as the people have granted to Congress the power // tute the body politic , and carry on the government . They , and they only , by virtue of State laws , elect the President , Vice-President , and members of Congress , and the general government can not enfranchise or disfranchise a single individual . By virtue of State citizenship , they are made by the Constitution general citizens . Besides all who were originally citizens , their descendants , and others who have been made citizens under State laws , multitudes have been added by treaty , of all shades of color and all mixtures of blood , - Mexicans , Indians , and the free colored inhabitants of Louisiana and Florida . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to any one of these classes , though the descendant of a slave , and in ay consequently have been a citizen . Mr. Justice McLean also speaks out boldly , and says : " A slave is not a mere chattel . He bears the impress of his Maker , and is amenable to the laws of God and man ; and he is destined to an endless existence . " But the majority of the court agreed to nothing positively on this part of the case , and to nothing negatively , except not to sustain the plea . The decision , therefore , is authority for nothing , but a simple negation , or rather want of affirmation , of the broad and monstrous proposition on which the plea was founded . After pronouncing the decision of the court on the plea in abatement , as already quoted , the Chief Justice has inserted in the official report a long episode in reply to the dissenting opinions , as to the right of examining questions subsequently arising on the trial of the merits ; and Mr. Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . There is , however , little that is intelligible , and less that is reasonable , in either . They prove , to be sure , the futility ( to use the language of Mr. Justice Wayne ) of " any attempt to control the court from doing so by the technical , common-law rules of pleading , " or anything else ; and show that , notwithstanding what Mr. Chief Justice Taney has elsew here said , they will , if they please , " write opinions for the newspapers and debating to remove . The only alienage over which Congress has any power is that of foreign birth , to be removed by naturalization laws . The power to remove the disabilities of any other alienage , if such exists , is among the reserved powers of the States . 35 * // clubs . " Mr. Justice Daniel has the whole of it in shorter terms , when he says , " To me it seems proper " so to do , - sic volo . But the common sense of the country is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in abatement is adjudged sufficient , as the Chief Justice says it is , the suit is , ipso facto , abated , and at an end . There is nothing afterwards before the court to be judicially adjudicated or considered . The parties are out of court . What is jurisdiction , but a right to hear and try the case ? And what is the want of jurisdiction but the negative of that , - the right to let it alone ? When this negative is settled , nothing remains but to conform to it . Anything else done afterwards is extrajudicial . It can not affect the parties or their rights , and is of no consequence to any one , unless it be to the newspapers and debating clubs . Here the court proceed to take up the case on the merits . By the pleas in bar , the defendant confessed , and justified the imprisonment complained of , by alleging that the plaintiff and his family were his slaves , and on the truth of this justification issue was joined . The only evidence laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to by the parties , on which , by the direction of the court , they found their verdict for the defendant , affirming the truth of the justification , and on which the court below rendered a judgment in his favor . To reverse that judgment , the plaintiff brought this writ of error . The general question was , whether the jury were rightly directed , or , in other words , whether the agreed facts showed the parties to be slaves . On this question a majority of the court , seven to two , have no difficulty in agreeing at once , that the plaintiff and family are slaves , and have no merits and no rights whatever . This is the first point on which the court have found themselves able to make a majority for or against anything . What does this decision involve ? The first fact on which the plaintiff relies to sustain his freedom is his residence in Illinois . In 1834 he was a slave in Missouri , and was carried by his master to the State of Illinois , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years . He was some time afterwards carried back to Missouri , having remained during the // intermediate time in the same service . The decision , therefore , involves , first , the effect of a residence where slavery is prohibited by law ; and , secondly , the effect of a subsequent return to a place where slavery is sanctioned by law . As to the first point , the effect of residence in a free State , the seven Democratic judges , constituting the majority in this case , are all but entirely silent . It were well that they had been totally so . But Mr. Justice Catron remarks , " Unless the master becomes an inhabitant of that State , " that is , permanently domiciled there , " the slaves he takes there do not acquire their freedom . " And Mr. Justice Nelson , for himself and the rest , threatens , as soon as they can find a case , * to decide that a slaveholder has a right to carry his slaves into any of the free States , for temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contempt of all their laws . This vould seem to be perfectly in character . The Chief Justice does not hesitate to assert , and to repeat , that " the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution . " t And six of them , at least , hold that Congress have no power to establish liberty or restrain slavery in any of the States or Territories of this Union . Nothing , therefore , remains , but to break down the efficacy of State constitutions and laws in favor of liberty , and slavery stalks unrebuked universally over the land . If neither the Constitution of the United States nor the constitutions of the States can protect personal freedom , no man , whether white or black , ( for the Constitution makes no difference , ) has any guaranty of protection by the strong arm of the law , for himself or his posterity , against the superior strength and intelligence of his more powerful neighbor . Verily , it is the opinion of these men , that this free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glorious institution of slavery . The preamble should be altered . * Thus invited , a case is not likely to be long withheld . Indeed , it is understood that one is already in progress . I What can be done for a man capable of such utterances l One , too , who has actually read the Constitution l Judge Daniel expresses a similar sentiment : " The Constitution guarantees to the slaveholder the title to his property , - the only private property which the Constitution has spec*ftcally recognized . " // But the opinions of the other two judges give us a little light upon this subject . Mr. Justice McLean says : " The civil law throughout the Continent of Europe is , that slavery can exist only within the territory where it is established . " " It is of a nature that nothing can be suffered to support it but positive law . " This was the law of England , as promulgated by the Court of King 's Bench in Somersett 's case , before our Revolution , and was , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle was held by this court in Prigg 's case , where it was declared unanimously , " that slavery is limited to the range of the laws under which it is sanctioned . " Mr. Justice Curtis says : " Slavery , being contrary to natural right , is created only by municipal law . This is not only plain in itself , and agreed by all writers on the subject , but is inferable from the Constitution , and has been explicitly declared by this court . The Constitution refers to slaves as persons held to service in one State , under the laws thereof . ' Nothing can more clearly describe a status created by muuicipal law . " The inference from these principles is direct and conclusive , that , at the boundary of the State , where the law ceases , the status created by it ceases also . But though the majority of the court have little to say on this point , they are abundantly clear on the second , to wit , the effect of a return to a slave State . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as free or slave , depended on the laws of Missouri , and not of Illinois " ; " it is now firmly settled , by the highest court in the State , that Scott and his family , upon their return , were not free , but were , by the laws of Missouri , the property of the defendant " ; " and this court had no jurisdiction to revise the judgment of a State court upon its own laws . " In these positions he is sustained by a majority of the court , and by some of them in elaborate arguments . The principal authority , however , in justification of " Firmly settled , " by two judges against one . It would seem to be a useless Labor to attempt to find out what the law of Missouri is , if two men can make it what they please , ex tempers , as they did in this ease , reversing a uniform series of decisions from the foundation of their government , because " times are not as they were when the former decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reports , 682 , Scott vs . Emerson . // 1857.1 THE DRED SCOTT CASE . the result , is the opinion of Lord Stowell in the case of the slave Grace . She had been Carried from Antigua to England , and returned to Antigua , without having claimed her freedom . Lord Stowell held that , when she resumed her domicile , she resumed her status . But in the application of this authority , the obvious distinction between different local laws made and administered by one king and parliament , and the different laws of the independent States of our Union , is not much discussed . These three positions are all denied by the dissenting Justices , McLean and Curtis . Mr. Justice McLean says : " This is far from being a Missouri question . " Mr. Justice Curtis , after admitting that it is competent for any civilized state , if it pleases , by " positive law , " to refuse " to allow such effect to foreign laws as is in accordance with the settled rules of international law , " and denying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunal to refuse such recognition , - says , that on this subject the " law of Missouri is the common law , introduced by statute in 1816 , " and that " the common law adopts , in its full extent , the law of nations , and holds it to be a part of the law of the land " ; that the opinion of the majority of the Missouri court in this case " is in conflict with its previous decisions , with a great weight of judicial authority in other slaveholding States , and with fundamental principles of private international law " ; and that , " sitting here to administer the law between these parties , I do not feel at liberty to surrender my own convictions of what the law requires , to the authority of that decision . " Nevertheless , a majority of the court hold that the plaintiff is a slave . Two years residence in a free State , with the consent of his master , did not make him a free man , on his return to Missouri . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the court hayc now decided it . The plaintiff is not entitled to the freedom he sued for . What more is to be done ? If the suit was abated , as the Chief Justice said it was , it was of no consequence ; they had still a right , as he said , to go on , and decide the merits . rjlhey have now decided the merits . Do they stop here ? or is other work to be done ? Does deciding the merits end the case ? By no means . " There is still much land to be possessed . " // After having resided two years in Illinois , where slavery was prohibited by the Constitution , the plaintiff went with his master to the territory north of Missouri and west of the Mississippi , now Minnesota , where slavery was prohibited by what has been called the Missouri Compromise Act of 1820 , and resided there two years more , under precisely the same circumstances . This act was made for the purpose of introducing Missouri into the Union as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this only , the restricting clause or proviso was repealed in 18*34 . There were political reasons , however , for desiring a judicial condemnation of the restriction as unconstitutional . The pressure upon the judges , as political men , was no doubt severe . There are precedents , unfortunately , for such pressure being found too severe for judicial virtue . How was it sustained in this case ? Was it of any consequence to Dred Scott , or his master , whether the Missouri Compromise was constitutional or unconstitutional ? Not the least . He had resided in a State where the restriction of slavery was certainly constitutional , and on his return finds himself a slave , by the decision of this court . He has now lived in another place , where there is a similar restriction , - valid or invalid . Does it make any difference to him which ? Not at all . If the restriction is valid , on his return he is still a slave . If it is invalid , he is certainly no worse off . But the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? When can it be reached , if not now ? So , though it does not concern the rights of the parties a particle , and has no influence on the merits of the case in any way , yet the occasion must be seized to settle that question ; and , as Mr. Justice Daniel says , " so far *- as it is practicable for this court to accomplish such an end , finally put ( it ) to rest . " * This is expressly admitted by Mr. Justice Daniel , who says : " Conceding to that provision the validity of a legitimate exercise of power , still this concession could by no rational interpretation imply the slightest authority for its operation hcyond the territorial limits . " t This can not be very far , unless their successors , and others , should treat their opinions with more respect than they treat their own , or those of their predecessors , and the practical decisions of the other branches of the government . The Chief Justice himself in this very case , gives as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not decided , that " it was not required by // In meeting this question , the Chief Justice , with whom agree Justices Wayne and Grier , admits that the power to make " all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory and other property belonging to the United States , " where they have the sovereignty as well as the ownership , includes the power of general legislation ; but says that the grant extends only to the territory which belonged to the government at the time the Constitution was adopted . All the power they have to legislate for territories since acquired , is inferred from the power to admit new States . This includes the power to acquire territory for that purpose , and the power to acquire it necessarily includes the power to govern it , and its inhabitants , till they are duly fitted to be made States , and introduced into the Union . Thus a direct grant of adequate power , conferred by plain and apt words , must first be construed away ; and then the same power reclaimed , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and specific purpose , and not intended or supposed to contain a power of acquisition at all , nor so construed till certain exigencies were thought to require its extension to that object , which construction is now sustained in deference to the practice of the government , while such practice is good for nothing in settling the meaning of other parts of the Constitution . Why all this is done , it is difficult to imagine , unless it be to show that the Constitution is a mere nose of wax , and may be made to mean anything or nothing , in the hands of power , precisely as the political exigencies of the day may require . But the plenary right to govern the Territories is conceded to Congress . This agrees with the practice of the government from its origin , and the Supreme Court sanctioned it by a direct adjudication , long ago , pronouncing the " possession of it unquestionable , " - " and in this , " the Chief Justice says , " we entirely concur . " Justices Daniel , Campbell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayne asserts the same principle , when he says : " Nor has any point heen discussed and decided , which was not callcd for by the record , or which was not necessary for the judicial disposition of it . " If this assertion is not justified by the fact , it at least shows his opinion as to what the fact ought to have heen. // Catron , with more or less distinctness , seem to find this power in the direct grant to Congress of power to make " all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory belonging to the United States . " Judge Nelson , having decided the whole case on the other point , very properly abstains from giving any opinion on subsequent questions . Their great difficulty is , to find some limitation or qualification of the admitted general legislative power over the Territories , which will exclude Congress from the power of restricting slavery therein . All agree that " no powers can be exercised which are prohibited by the Constitution , or which are contrary to its spirit . " But which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the clause from iliagna Ghana which says : " No person shall be deprived of his property , without due process of law " ; and he says the Constitution affirms slaves to be property . Mr. Justice Campbell says that anything is property which any of the States choose to consider such , and the federal government is bound to recognize it . Mr. Justice Catron finds the much desired limitation in the third article of the treaty of cession of Louisiana . And Mr. Justice Daniel finds it in an infringement of the equal " rights of purchase , settlement , occupation , " &amp;c. , which he says " every citizen would have , if , " as he very discreetly adds , " any one could claim it . " Indeed this last idea seems to be more or less resorted to by them all . Mr. Justice Curtis answers each of these positions separately and conclusively . As to lllagna Charta , it was a part of the law of England before the settlement of this country , - was brought here " by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - was the law of every State in the Union when it was transferred to the Constitution of the United States , and is now probably , in some form , embodied in the constitutions of all the individual States . Under it the slave-trade has been prohibited in England ; by all or nearly all the original States of this Union ; and by the United States , for fifty years . The violation of these prohibitions involves a forfeiture of the property . If all this does not show that slavery is not protected by llliagna Charta , it will be difficult to ascertain when or how the meaning of any law is ever to be known . As to the Lonisi // ana treaty , the third article , concerning the enjoyment of property , was not adapted or intended to have the effect claimed for it ; if it had been , it could not have controlled the action of Congress . And lastly , whatever effect it could have had , the " stipulation ceased to operate when Louisiana became a member of the Union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ter* ritory was acquired for the benefit of the people collectively , not individually ; and the equality of individuals respecting its settlement , occupation , &amp;c. consists in an equal destitution of all right , except such as may be allowed on the terms and conditions contained and prescribed in duly authorized laws . But though Congress may restrict slavery in the Territories , it by no means follows that they have power to establish it . The general legislative power of Congress over the Territories , though extended to a great variety of subjects which are not embraced in its jurisdiction over the States , is nevertheless limited by the general principles of our government , and the express prohibitions of the Constitution . It will hardly be pretended that they could establish an hereditary monarchy or aristocracy there . As little can they create privileged orders of any sort . If they can appoint one class or order of men to rule and another to serve , one for masters and another for slaves , this power is not necessarily to be limited or confined to any difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They may as well distinguish between the English and the other European races , as between the European and the African ; or between the Carolinian and the New-Yorker , or the Pennsylvanian and the Virginian , as either . If they can make slaves at all , they may as well make white ones as black . If they can deprive one man of his liberty without due process of law , they may so deprive any number , or all , and thereby have an entire colony of slaves . If any part of this can be done , under the principles of our free government , all the prohibitions of our Constitution are not worth a rush . What is the freedom of speech , or of the press , or even a promise of the free exercise of religion , worth , to men who are liable to be deprived of all right to their own bodies , and all care for their own souls ? And what is a Constitution // worth , which affects to secure certain particular rights only , and leaves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if Congress can introduce and establish slavery anywhere , under the authority of our Constitution , they can and ought to regulate , protect , and enforce it ; and the time is not distant when they , or those acting under them , will be called upon to enact a whole code of slavery laws , * which would be as congruous with the spirit and principles of our Constitution , as a code regulating and enforcing the relative rights and duties of hereditary kings , lords , commons , and villains . Three points were intended to be decided in this case : that a negro can not be a citizen ; that a slave , after residing in a free State , with the consent of his master , and returning to a slave State , continues a slave ; and that the Missouri Compromise , or any other restriction of slavery in the Territories , is unconstitutional . By grasping at too much , the court have lost the whole . As a judicial decision , the case can have no legal authority on either point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained by only three judges . Not on the second , because five judges , f a majority of the court , say the suit was abated by the plea to the jurisdiction , and judgment was so ordered , which legally put an end to the cause . Not on the third , for the same reason , and for the additional one that the question did not affect the rights of the parties , and so its decision ' " was not required by the case . " This is the character of the case , considered in a legal point of view , and as a judicial act of the court . But as a political manual or text-book , an authorized registration of the political heresies of the dominant party of the day , it will be all it was intended to be . It will form a rallying-point and ear-mark for political partisans , till some other absurd dogma shall be called for , and created to stand in its place . As to the practical influence of the decision , the case will Has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States I t Mr. Chief Justice Taney , Mr. Justice McLean , Mr. Justice Wayne , Mr. Justice Daniel , and Mr. Justice Curtis . // probably disappoint both parties , those who approve and those who disapprove its principles . A Missouri Compromise restriction of slavery , under the authority of Congress , is little likely to be again enacted , or to be asked or desired by any portion of the people ; and as little before as since this decision . Slaveholders will not be apt to trust their slaves , voluntarily , in the free States , where no law can restrain their departure for an hour , or reclaim them when they depart , from any expectation they may indulge of holding them again in slavery when they get them back . Such States as may choose to invest their free colored inhabitants with any or all of the rights of citizenship , will not be likely to desist therefrom , on account of any of the considerations presented by the court in this case . Thus , but for its effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on very much as it did before . The country will feel the consequences of the decision more deeply and more permanently , in the loss of confidence in the sound judicial integrity and strictly legal character of their tribunals , than in anything beside ; and this perhaps may well be accounted the greatest political calamity which this country , under our forms of government , could sustain .
