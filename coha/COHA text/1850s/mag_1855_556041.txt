Delivered in Philadelphia , by Clergymen of the Protestant Episcopal Church . Philadelphia : E. H. Butler &amp; Co. 1855 . Lecture XI . The Modern Necromancy no Argument against the Gospel . By RT . REV . GEORGE BURGESS , D.D . THE subject which forms the caption of this article is one for the discussion of which we have no appetency ; and we have delayed taking cognizance of it in our pages , in the hope that it might relieve us of the responsibility of so doing by losing its hold on the public interest . But , so far from this , it at the present moment occupies the thought and controls the action of not a few men of undoubtedly high culture , ability , and integrity , and of very many persons of good common sense , respectable education , and unimpeachable honesty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Address " of the " New England Spiritualists ' Association " an overstatement . " It is computed that nearly two millions of people in our nation , with hundreds of thousands in other lands , are already believers in Spiritualism . No less than twelve or fourteen periodicals are devoted to the publication of its phenomena and the dissemination of its principles . Nearly every succeeding week brings through the press some new books treating exclusively upon this subject . Every day , and much more than daily , lectures upon Spiritualism are given in the presence of audiences quite respectable as to both numbers and character . Circles are held , by day and by night , in nearly every city , town , and village throughout our country . " - p. 9 . The modes of communication claimed for departed spirits are too well known to need enumeration . That there has been a large amount of monomania and of imposture connected with these strange phenomena , there can be no doubt . Yet still , in quarters where the suspicion of insanity and of fraud would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of persons whose testimony is valid beyond dispute as to // facts within their own experience , there have occurred , and are still occurring , events as yet unaccounted for by the recognized laws of matter and mind . The time has gone by when a shrug and a sneer can dispose of the alleged evidence . The phenomena of which we speak demand profound investigation at the hands of scientific men . To this fraternity we do not profess to belong ; and in what we are going to write , we shall be at no pains to employ other than popular phraseology . The most that we hope to do is to show that the subject admits of scientific treatment , and to commend it to the research of those who can give it such treatment . If the mere germ of a theory which we propound fails to find lodgement in any other mind , or growth in our own , we shall , nevertheless , have succeeded in our present aim , if we can induce attention to our subject on the part of any competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive approaches alone can eliminate the truth , and a theory that shall prove untenable may open the way for a more thorough induction of facts , and sounder conclusions as to their causes . One word more in explanation of our purpose . We do not propose to embrace in our consideration all alleged phenomena of the class under discussion , but only such as have come under our own knowledge , or rest on proof which seems to us valid and impregnable . If the range of undoubted facts exceeds the range of our own belief , our theory must either be enlarged and modified to embrace that entire range , or must give place to a more comprehensive theory . We would maintain , in the outset , that the least tenable hypothesis of all is that which attributes the phenomena under discussion to the agency of departed spirits . If the souls of men separated from their bodily integuments lead a more subtile and ethereal existence than while in the flesh , how is it that they resort to a mode of intercourse so gross , slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenockings which have given the name to this modern necromancy , and were almost its sole instrumentality in its earlier stages ? Yet , again , in these ( so-called ) spiritual communications , there are often discrepancies and errors , as to matters of fact that must needs have been within the earthly cognizance of // the spirit supposed to be rapping , writing , or speaking . For instance , in a well-authenticated case , in which Benjamin Franklin was believed to utter himself through a young woman as a medium , and the talk was in a highly Franklinian style , he , ( if it were he , ) on being questioned , was unable to recall several of the most prominent facts in his earthly life , knew not whether he had been once married or oftener , and could not even tell where his body was interred . Hardly a less weighty consideration , though not so directly ponderable , is the general failure of these communications to indicate growth of knowledge , of mental ability , or of moral excellence , on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We admit that there is often a strong likeness in style and sentiment between these mysterious deliverances and the utterances and writings in their lifetime of the perSons in whose name they are given forth ; but the difference is generally one of marked defect or inferiority , such as would attach itself to the effort of imitation , whether conscious or unconscious . Thus of the renowned men whose ghosts have been brought upon the stage , the mannerism is retained without the vigor and point ; while those who have received letters bearing the names of their deceased kindred or friends , can generally find in their desks letters from the same persons when living , that display traces of richer fancy , purer taste , sounder thought , nobler sentiment . The frequently mercenary character of this necromancy goes far towards negativing the idea of its spiritual origin . In almost every city in New England are Pythonesses , ( not always persons of fair reputation , ) who , for the price of fifty cents and upwards , will command the presence and responses of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind have been among the lucrative speculations of the omnificent Barnum . What must be that spiritual state which lends its converse , the converse too of its choicest and purest denizens , to feed the cupidity of a common showman ? What kind of an immortality - how dignified , how happy - can that be , which may be disquieted by the incantations of hireling women , and subjected to the impertinent teasing of any idler who has more money than brains ? // Would not many of the spirits professedly evoked prefer annihilation to a spiritual life which should expose them to such humiliating annoyances ? For ourselves , we should deem it no more difficult to believe that the soul dies with the body , than to believe that the souls of the righteous are at the beck and call of mountebanks and their customers . Were we to adopt this hypothesis , we should be compelled to dismiss every happy association we had ever cherished with the life to come , and to deny almost every truth that we have held sacred with regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the separate existence of the soul . Nay , magic and witchcraft would make up the whole of our religion , and we should find it easier to fall back upon some exploded system of polytheism , than to retain our faith in the infinite unity of God . There is much in the phenomena under discussion which favors the belief that they have their origin in some peculiar mode of the medium 's own consciousness , enlarged and modified indeed , in some instances , by the consciousness of members of the surrounding circle . It will be conceded that the communications made seldom contain anything that might not be conceived to have been present to the thought or latent in the memory of the central personage , or of some person immediately concerned in the operation . As to religious belief , while we can hardly suppose that in the world of spirits , and especially among the celestial orders , there are any wide diversities of theological opinion , these alleged communications cover the entire ground , from the most evangelical Christian doctrine down to a low and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they correspond in their tone very closely to the existing state of belief in their respective mediums . We have seen numerous writings from a " spiritual circle " consisting of eminently devout persons , and these writings are gospel hymns , - poor poetry , but emphatically Christian in their sentiments , - exhortations to the study of the Scriptures and the imitation of the Saviour , glowing representations of the power and love of the Redeemer , entreaties to friends to lead lives of prayer and of holiness . On the other hand , the communications through persons of no definite // faith or religious character ignore all that is distinctive in Christianity , treat the Scriptures with supercilious indifference , eliminate all penal sanctions from the Divine law , and ring incessant changes on the single idea of universal and indefinite progress . In matters other than where opinion is involved , there may still be traced this same subjective element . We recently received from a medium of transparent ingenuousness and singleness of character certain metrical productions , which she said were written through her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in English verse , in sentiment highly devout , though misty and dreamy ,  --  in style and rhythm certainly not beyond the capacity of the medium in her normal state , though she said that she was not in the habit of writing verse . The third of the pieces , our correspondent informed us , was in Latin , - to her , literally an unknown tongue ; and she requested a translation . It was inscribed , " A Latin Sonnet . " But it was not a sonnet , and it was not in Latin , nor in any language with which we are conversant . Yet it had throughout a Latin sound , and the terminations were all Latin . Now the father of this medium had for many years received into his family boys fitting for college , and others unfit to remain in college . She had undoubtedly heard in her youth a great deal of Latin read or repeated ; and the ( so-called ) sonnet was evidently composed of sounds and fragments of words , that had lingered thus long in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The following is another mode in which the self-born character of these phenomena betrays itself . Wherever a medium , who is not so for hire , but spontaneously , and with full conviction of the reality of the communion with departed spirits , wherever , we say , such a medium deems himself or herself in communication with several spirits , if there be among them a father , brother , or intimate friend , that person is always represented as exercising a commanding , conti*olling influence over the rest , even though he seem to every other mind a spirit of a much inferior order to his supposed associates . We have known several instances of this kind , some so glaringly incongruous in placing the last first , as to // provoke ludicrous associations , notwithstanding the gravity of the theme . We are confirmed in our belief of the subjective character of these phenomena by conversation with a highly respectable clergyman , who , a few years ago , to his own surprise , found himself a writing medium , and was for many months in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often without knowing what he was inditing , or whose name he was going to sign . He at first fell in with the popular notion , but became gradually convinced , by the incongruity and absurdity of much that he wrote , and by . the dream-like character of the whole , that he had been putting upon paper , not the behests of unseen spirits , but the results of some unexplained mode of his own consciousness . In suggesting a mode of accounting for the abnormal manifestations which constitute our present subject , we would call the attention of our readers to the duplication of most of the organs of the human body . The right and the left half of the body are in more respects counterparts than complements of each other . For many of the vital functions , either half furnishes an entire and full working apparatus . The two hands , the two feet , indeed , give cumulative power , and both discharge offices to which neither alone would be adequate . But a single eye or a single ear might perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that the two work together without confusion , and carry a single and the same report to the mind , is a problem on which physiologists and metaphysicians have labored in vain , and which the Supreme Artificer alone can solve . The same provision extends to the nerves , which branch off in pairs , constituting two symmetrical systems , either of which might act independently of the other . The lungs in like manner present two separate systems , and , though the decay of either lobe is generally fatal , probably because it is a development of constitutional decay , there yet have not been wanting instances in which one of the lobes has been entirely destroyed , and the patient has survived for years in health and activity . The brain , too , is double throughout , and whether both divisions in the healthy subject act together , or alternately so as to relieve each other , it may // be impossible to determine ; but experience has shown that grave injury or extensive disease on one side of the brain does not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for perception and reflection . The phenomena of dreams favors the idea that the two divisions act , or at least may act , alternately ; for not only is there wont to be a change of the mode and the objects of our consciousness when we fall asleep , but we sometimes take up anew in dreams conceptions or trains of thought from previous dreams , which have not meanwhile occupied our waking hours , and we often wholly drop from our dreams subjects that up to the moment of sleep have engrossed all our power of intellect and capacity of emotion. * In health and in the ordinary condition of the body , the double organ acts as one ; the eyes see but one image ; the ears hear but one combination of sounds ; the brain performs but one process . In some cases of disease , however , separate action takes place . The confusion of sounds that is more embarrassing than deafness probably results from separate cognizance taken by the two ears of what in their normal state they hear together . There are conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well acquainted with a person who , unless he keeps one eye covered , always sees two distinct images of the same object . There have also been , in connection with cerebral disease , not very infrequent instances of double or alternating consciousness , which could be * No doubt the final cause of this duplication of the organs , where a single organ would suffice for ordiuary use , is the furnishing , first , of a double chance against the loss of any power or the suspension of any function by incurable accident or disease ; and , secondly , of an opportunity of rest and remedial treatment for one of the pair in case of injury , the other in the interval performing double duty . And it is , for the most part , the exposed organs that are duplicated . The heart , the liver , the stomach , and the intestinal canal , are single , and we can easily see why they must needs have been so . Their ministry is to supply and maintain the fluid circulation of the system ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with safety the shock of opposing life-tides . The danger from the mutual gorging or choking of their ducts , were they double , would be greater than that resulting from their single working . But these single organs are to a great degree out of harm 's way , - packed where they can not be reached by common casualties , and so protected by the bony frame , or by adipose substance , that they can hardly receive fatal injury , except by violence so great as under any circumstances to put life in serious jeopardy . // referred only to the separate action of the right and left hemispheres of the brain . Dr. Wayland , in his " Elements of Intellectual Philosophy , " gives the details of a case of alternating consciousness , described by the patient herself , a Miss Reynolds of Meadvile , Pa. , and attested by her nephew , Rev. John V. Reynolds , a Presbyterian clergyman of high standing and character . Miss Reynolds , at the age of eighteen or twenty , after one of a series of convulsion-fits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even of the forms of letters , the power of words , and the faces of her parents . In this state she commenced learning everything anew . After a few weeks , her old consciousness returned ; but with its return she lost all remembrance of what she had experienced and learned during the interval . A few weeks later , she relapsed into what we may call her second state , and knew nothing except what she had learned when in that state before . For more than twenty years these alternations took place not infrequently . She was completely re-educated in her second state . In each state , she knew only people that she had seen , and remembered only things that she had heard and read in that state . She needed in one state re-introduction even to persons with whom in the other she had become closely intimate . Her handwriting in the second state was as unlike her handwriting in the first , as if they had been in the hands of two different persons . At length , these alternations ceased , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived to the age of sixty-nine ) she remained wholly in the second state , an intelligent , active woman , but with her first twenty years and large portions of the next twenty as utterly a blank in her memory as if she had not been in existence . In this case , we can hardly doubt that there was a separate , alternate action of the two hemispheres of the brain . But if they can act separately and alternately , it is entirely conceivable that they may act separately , yet simultaneously . Where one utters or writes what seems to flow from an inspiration or guidance wholly independent of himself , may not one half of the brain continue its usual processes , while the other pursues a different class of operations , isolated from // all surrounding objects , as is the case in the dreams that accompany sleep ? Were these alleged communications remembrances that remained on the mind after natural sleep , they would indeed seem noteworthy , yet would be regarded as nothing more than remarkable dreams . May they not be virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulated , yet cut off from connection through the organs of sense with the external world , while the other hemisphere remains in its normal state ? This double consciousness is not intrinsically more strange than are the phenomena of ordinary sleep . Neither can in the literal sense of the words be accounted for . In fact , what we call accounting for natural phenomena is simply tracing analogies and making classifications . The agencies to which we refer them are names , not for our knowledge , but for our ignorance , - fencewords set up where the mind can go no further . The utmost that we can do is to bring new and unfamiliar facts into analogy with the well-known and long-experienced ; and beyond this , philosophy can only " point with trembling finger and shaded eye ' * to Him , of whom , and through whom , and to whom are all things . The personality of the medium , in the accesses of the abnormal influence , seems indeed often entirely unlike his or her normal state . But is not our personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , that , if we should utter or act our dreams , our identity would hardly be recognized ? The writing mediums write , as is well known , in a very different hand from their usual handwriting . Here it may be instructive to recur to the case of Miss Reynolds , who in her two modes of consciousness wrote two widely unlike hands . Some months ago , we turned over a large collection of documents purporting to have been written by different spirits through a medium of whose entire guilelessness and honesty there could not be the shadow of a doubt . They were all in a similar hand , and that widely different from her ordinary writing . But on comparing some of them witti the pen-work of the supposed writers during their lifetime , we fonud the discrepancy still greater . No doubt , where wilful charlatanry imitates or accompanies the opera . // tion , a resemblance to the handwriting of the deceased person represented may occur ; but we have yet to learn that such resemblances are wont to take place in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical profession ) " respectable private practice . " Is it asked , What is the cause of this double consciousness ? Our belief is that this state is the consequence of some peculiar condition of animal electricity , or sensitiveness to electromagnetic influences. * What constitutes animal life ? What connects soul and body ? What principle furnishes the communication between the human spirit and the outward world ? Among the answers that might be given to these questions perhaps none presents so strong claims to regard as the theory according to which the element , be it fluid or force , which we term electro-magnetism constitutes the life of the body , - the life of physical consciousness , perception , and sensation . The vertebra* are , as it were , the successive plates of a galvanic battery , of which the skull is the apex , while the spine , culminating in the brain , constitutes , like the acid ifl the artificial battery , a continuous and cumulative creator and channel of the electro-magnetic force . Of this force the nerves of sensation and of voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraphic wires for intercourse with the outward world , the latter conveying , as in successive discharges or shocks , the mandates of the will to the executive organs of the body . The living battery , as ordinarily charged , may suffice to keep but one hemisphere of the brain in action , while an excessive charge may keep both hemispheres in simultaneous action . This theory may account for the rappings , phosphoric lights , table-tippings , and other physical phenomena , reported in connection with the pretended spiritual intercourse . The rappings * We do not pretend here to employ exact , still less the most recent , scientific language . That the " odyle " of Reichenbach is a modification of the same element which in inorganic matter assumes under different conditions the forms of electricity , galvanism , and magnetism , we have no doubt . But we prefer using familiar terms , as our object is merely to designate the direction in which an explanation of the ( socalled ) spiritual phenomena may be sought , not to define their cause with technical precision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an electrical machine . The lights correspond in shape , color , and movement with those which are elicited by experiments with the galvanic battery . The movement of non-conducting substances is at least a possible result from the passage under certain conditions of large masses of the electro-magnetic fluid or force . Nor let it be objected that the human frame is insufficient to generate electricity to such an amount as is implied in these phenomena . Literally speaking , an artificial battery does not generate electricity or galvanism , but simply disturbs the electrical equilibrium of the surrounding atmosphere , bringing into separate action the positive and negative elements . If the human body furnish for the time being a strongly excited and intensely active battery , it is not that body which by its own inherent force produces mysterious knockings , projects strange lights upon the xvall , or sets the furniture in motion ; but the ( listurbed electrical currents of the entire apartment , building , or neighborhood may with much greater probability be regarded as the producing cause of these wonderful sights and sounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents of the ( so-called ) spiritual communications . So far as we know , the solitary writer under this influence is not wont to make startling revelations , or to impart aught which might not be supposed to exist already in his or her own mind . But in the circles where the Pythoness utters verbally responses as from spirits speaking through her voice , or where the mysterious knockings spell out responses letter by letter , there are undoubted instances in which correct answers have been given to questions , and statements of facts have been made , where the answers or the facts could not have been previously known to the medium , yet were known to some consulting member of the circle . It is conceivable that an electro-magnetic communication may be established between the intensely stirnulated brain of the medium and the brains of those composing the circle ; that the vibrations of the latter may be transmitted to the former ; and through these vibrations sensations , remembrances , and ideas may be imparted without speech or gesture . So far as clairvoyance is connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it are fewer and less striking than those connected with mesmerism , and mesmerism does not pretend to evoke the spirits of the dead . We are inclined to believe that the solution of the facts of mesmerism is to be sought in the direction which we have now indicated ; but our present limits will permit us to deal only with what is peculiar to the new form of necromancy . There are connected with it some alleged cases of marvellous foresight , yet by no means so wonderful as those that are credibly reported of the Scotch " second-sight " ; and when we reflect how often the causes of a future event exist for a long time unrecognized , and on the occurrence of the event we marvel that we did not recognize them , it is by no means wonderful that through a highly stimulated brain the mind should so act on existing causes as to deduce from them consequences which no one else foresees . This not infrequently takes place in sleep , and there are on record numerous instances of the foresight in dreams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discerned in the waking hours . The question now may suggest itself , Why is it that these phenomena should abound at one period of the world 's history , while in previous times they have occurred rarely or not at all ? We answer , that there have been similar periods in past ages , - epochs of phenomena by no means unlike the present , though described in different terms and attributed to different agencies . Had we time , we might illustrate this position by numerous examples ; but it will be sufficient to refer to the " Salem witchcraft , " which it is hard to interpret as a series of mere delusions , but which is easily explained if by the opinions of an age which was prepared to expect visitations from infernal rather than from celestial spirits . According to our hypothesis , an abnormal condition of the brain and the nervous systcm - in fine , nervous disease ( for excess no less than defect of functional activity and power is disease ) - is the primary cause of these manifestations , and nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , the mind may equally react upon the brain , and the wide-spread contempiation of , // interest in , and appetency for these marvels that are now rife are sufficient to have multiplied a single sporadic case a hundred or a thousand fold . The epidemic has probably not reached the climax of its power . It will grow till the general mind is sated with its quasi miracles , till curiosity wanes , and excitement ceases , and then it will decline and pass away ; and a century hence it may be looked back upon with the vague scepticism with which most persons regard the diabolical workings recorded in Mather 's " Magnalia , " though our hope is that it will take shape in the memory of posterity as an actual mode of human experience , subject to and explainable by scientific laws . We would now advert briefly to a striking psychological phenomenon which we have observed in connection with this subject . The very persons who accord to the phenomena under consideration the most hospitable hearing and the most ready credence as supernatural facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their scepticism with regard to the miracles of the Old and New Testament . They can/ not believe that the order of nature was reverted and the veil drawn aside from the unseen world for purposes of universal , infinite , and endless moment ; yet they confidently maintain that spirits of exalted dignity and worth can be vexed and tortured to satisfy the curiosity and amuse the idle hours of a lounger about town or an unfledged school-girl . We confess that we have been more than once reminded by these things of a keen saying of St. Paul about those who in his day " received not the love of the truth , " - " For this cause God shall send them strong delusion , that they should believe a lie . " Such instances confirm us in the conviction that the supernatural has an essential place - a niche of its own - in the human soul , that it is almost impossible for man to escape belief in the occurrence of events beyond the cycle of his ordinary experience , and that the denial of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger appetency for the reception of miracles of a different class . We are fully prepared to adopt as an axiom with regard to the supernatural what Horace says about Nature - " Naturam expelles furca , tarnen usque recurret , Et mala perrumpet furtim fastidia victrix. " // The easy faith of the believers in modern miracles helps us also to hurl back the charge of excessive credulity from the adherents to the opponents of revealed religion . In our apprehension , it requires a much keener appetite for the marvel- ' bus to believe in the acknowledged history of Christianity , * and yet deny its miracles , than to admit in full the authen*I ticity of its canonical Scriptures . In fine , we have always been disposed to regard modern infidels as weakly credulous ; and large numbers of them are now justifying our verdict in the matter under discussion . The admirable Lecture of Bishop Burgess , which we have named at the head of our article , and to which we referred in our last number , treats solely of the bearing of the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on no hypothesis ; but by an exhaustive process , taking up successively the several theories of imposture , delusion , the operation of natural laws as yet undeveloped or unknown , demoniacal influence , and the presence of departed spirits , he shows that on neither ground is the evidence or the validity of the Christian revelation impaired . We close with two extracts from the Lecture . " Far more probable than the supposition of simple imposture , or of simple delusion , is that of the operation of natural laws , physical or psychical , but as yet undeveloped or unknown . Mind communicates with mind in modes with which science has but the most indistinct acquaintance . The brain , the nerves , the vital powers , the relations between the body and the soul , the magnetism of the human system , the channels of communication between the inner man and the outer world , the very nature of that world itself as contrasted with spirit ; all this is a sphere of which little is taught us except by experience . If new experience should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not sufficient to justify , by its ignorance of such facts , the rejection of their reality . It may very well be true that these phenomena may proceed from such causes , as well as other phenomena which can no longer be questioned , but which were once almost as wonderful . It may be that the mind , in certain states , may partake the thoughts of others without word or sign . It may be that it can control the movements of a body not its own . It may be that all the alleged disclosures from the world of spirits have been only the kind of reflection of what the mind was in itself or in other minds ; a reflection clothed in fantastic vOL . LXXX. - NO. 167. 45 // forms like those of a revery or a dream . It may even be , that the soul may assume something of the power which it shall wield in its disembodied state , and that the future and the distant may come within its dim perception . We do not know the limits beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall never advance . We can not know , while every other science glories in its discoveries and their application , that the experimental science of the soul may not bring to light its peculiar wonders . It ill becomes us to presume that no motions are ever to be perceived within us of powers which wait to spread their wings , when the worm shall emerge from the chrysalis , and fly upward . When we were children , it seemed quite as probable that a man in a trance might see what was taking place a thousand miles off at that moment , as that it could be told him by a current darting along a wire as swiftly as his thought . It is no settled law of nature that sight , hearing , and toneh shall alone communicate knowledge ; or that the mind can exercise no physical instrumentality but through the bodily organs ; no more a settled law than that mechanical powers are the only force which man can set in motion . Perhaps all which can be proved of the marvels so often asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be developed , or which are involved in no peculiar mystery . " - Pliiladelpkia Lectures , pp. 312 , 313 . " We come to the utmost supposition : What if it were even admitted that departed spirits had made some rude efforts to communicate with the living , and had been permitted so far to prevail as to give a few vague answers to vague questions , in a manner allowed to be difficult and disturbed , and very often delusive ? There surely is no adequate proof or plausible color of anything like this . But what if there were ? What if necromancy , guilty as it is , should be but the more guilty for the reality of its . results ? In the mere fact there is no contradiction to revealed truth , could the fact be established that the dead have spoken . The only questions would be , have they spoken that which is beyond revealed truth ? and have they spoken that to which revealed truth is contradictory ? " To be assured of the truth of any new revelation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we knew that the voices were the voices of the dead . The channel is corrupt and forbidden , and therefore the disclosures may be deceptive . If the dead should even tell us that they are at rest , and describe the state in which they dwell , who could assure us that they were not false , that they might not be betraying us to the same ruin which had overwhelmed them , or that they were not mischievously sporting with our rash curiosity ? how // could we be certified that they were the persons whom they personated ? But it is unnecessary to dwell upon the possibility of such deceit , since the whole mass of what has been pretended to be revealed in mere addition , not in contradiction , to the Word of God , is only such as , were it true , would have but the least conceivable value , would be but as the dust of the balance . " Contradictions , however , to the word of God have been uttcred , as from the world of the dead ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have received through the Prophets and Apostles and the Lord Jesus Christ , on one side , and the disclosures which purport to come from departed spirits , on the other . Thcy affirm what the Scriptures deny . They dispute what the Scriptures declare . Which shall be believed ? Some of the very persons who are represented could claim no confidence while they lived , and death could not have entitled them to be heard in opposition to the voice of Inspiration . Of others we do not know whether they are indeed present , or whether some false spirits have stolen their names and imitated their manner and knowledge . But if they be present , and be they who they may , the Christian believer can have but one answer : Though an angel from heaven preach any other Gospel , let him be accursed ' ; We wrestle not merely against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places . ' Not till the Redeemer shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess authority equal to that which we follow . The mere circumstance that the contradiction to the truth which we have so received is one which comes from the invisible rather than the visible world , should have no more power to persuade us than the temptations to wickedness , which come directly from the Evil One , should have beyond those which assail us through mortals like ourselves . Thus it is with Christians : but for him who is not a Christian in belief , one mighty obstacle to faith should seem to be removed when he is persuaded that the dead are actually living . If lie credit this , and imagine that they are speaking , why should he hesitate to allow at least the probability of a far clearer , fuller , purer , and nobler revelation ? One voice from the spiritual world should overthrow all the infidelity of the Sadducees of every generation who say that there is neither angel nor spirit . " - pp. 317 - 319. // ART .
