THE SLEEPING CAR*** Transcribed from the 1883 James R. Osgood and Company edition by David Price , email ccx074@coventry.ac.uk THE SLEEPING CAR  --  A FARCE by William D. Howells I. SCENE : One side of a sleeping-car on the Boston and Albany Road . The curtains are drawn before most of the berths ; from the hooks and rods hang hats , bonnets , bags , bandboxes , umbrellas , and other travelling gear ; on the floor are boots of both sexes , set out for THE PORTER to black . THE PORTER is making up the beds in the upper and lower berths adjoining the seats on which a young mother , slender and pretty , with a baby asleep on the seat beside her , and a stout old lady , sit confronting each other  --  MRS . AGNES ROBERTS and her aunt MARY . MRS . ROBERTS . Do you always take down your back hair , aunty ? AUNT MARY . No , never , child ; at least not since I had such a fright about it once , coming on from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down your back hair if it is yours ; but if it is n't , your head 's the best place for it . Now , as I buy mine of Madame Pierrot  --  MRS . ROBERTS . Do n't you wish she would n't advertise it as human hair ? It sounds so pokerish  --  like human flesh , you know . AUNT MARY . Why , she could n't call it inhuman hair , my dear . MRS . ROBERTS ( thoughtfully ) . No  --  just hair . AUNT MARY . Then people might think it was for mattresses . But , as I was saying , I took it off that night , and tucked it safely away , as I supposed , in my pocket , and I slept sweetly till about midnight , when I happened to open my eyes , and saw something long and black crawl off my bed and slip under the berth . Such a shriek as I gave , my dear ! " A snake ! a snake ! oh , a snake ! " And everybody began talking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porter came running with the poker to kill it ; and all the while it was that ridiculous switch of mine , that had worked out of my pocket . And glad enough I was to grab it up before anybody saw it , and say I must have been dreaming . MRS . ROBERTS . Why , aunty , how funny ! How could you suppose a serpent could get on board a sleeping-car , of all places in the world ! AUNT MARY . That was the perfect absurdity of it . THE PORTER . Berths ready now , ladies . MRS . ROBERTS ( to THE PORTER , who walks away to the end of the car , and sits down near the door ) . Oh , thank you . Aunty , do you feel nervous the least bit ? AUNT MARY . Nervous ? No . Why ? MRS . ROBERTS . Well , I do n't know . I suppose I 've been worked up a little about meeting Willis , and wondering how he 'll look , and all . We ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand to reason that if he 's been out there for twelve years , ever since I was a child , though we 've corresponded regularly  --  at least I have  --  that he could recognize me ; not at the first glance , you know . He 'll have a full beard ; and then I 've got married , and here 's the baby . Oh , no ! he 'll never guess who it is in the world . Photographs really amount to nothing in such a case . I wish we were at home , and it was all over . I wish he had written some particulars , instead of telegraphing from Ogden , " Be with you on the 7 A.M. , Wednesday . " AUNT MARY . Californians always telegraph , my dear ; they never think of writing . It is n't expensive enough , and it does n't make your blood run cold enough to get a letter , and so they send you one of those miserable yellow despatches whenever they can  --  those printed in a long string , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you get to the end of it . I suppose your brother has fallen into all those ways , and says " reckon " and " ornary " and " which the same , " just like one of Mr. Bret Harte 's characters . MRS . ROBERTS . But it is n't exactly our not knowing each other , aunty , that 's worrying me ; that 's something that could be got over in time . What is simply driving me distracted is Willis and Edward meeting there when I 'm away from home . Oh , how could I be away ! and why could n't Willis have given us fair warning ? I would have hurried from the ends of the earth to meet him . I do n't believe poor Edward ever saw a Californian ; and he 's so quiet and preoccupied , I 'm sure he 'd never get on with Willis . And if Willis is the least loud , he would n't like Edward . Not that I suppose he is loud ; but I do n't believe he knows anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ca n't you , how very anxious I must be ? Do n't you see that I ought to have been there when Willis and Edward met , so as to  --  to  --  well , to break them to each other , do n't you know ? AUNT MARY . Oh , you need n't be troubled about that , Agnes . I dare say they 've got on perfectly well together . Very likely they 're sitting down to the unwholesomest hot supper this instant that the ingenuity of man could invent . MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , do you think they are , aunty ? Oh , if I could only believe they were sitting down to a hot supper together now , I should be so happy ! They 'd be sure to get on if they were . There 's nothing like eating to make men friendly with each other . Do n't you know , at receptions , how they never have anything to say to each other till the escalloped oysters and the chicken salad appear ; and then how sweet they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice ? Oh , thank you , thank you , aunty , for thinking of the hot supper . It 's such a relief to my mind ! You can understand , ca n't you , aunty dear , how anxious I must have been to have my only brother and my only  --  my husband  --  get on nicely together ? My life would be a wreck , simply a wreck , if they did n't . And Willis and I not having seen each other since I was a child makes it all the worse . I do hope they 're sitting down to a hot supper . AN ANGRY VOICE from the next berth but one . I wish people in sleeping- cars  --  A VOICE from the berth beyond that . You 're mistaken in your premises , sir . This is a waking-car . Ladies , go on , and oblige an eager listener . Sensation , and smothered laughter from the other berths . MRS . ROBERTS ( after a space of terrified silence , in a loud whisper to her AUNT . ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . It was too bad to keep talking . I 'd no idea my voice was getting so loud . Which berth will you have , aunty ? I 'd better take the upper one , because  --  AUNT MARY ( whispering ) . No , no ; I must take that , so that you can be with the baby below . MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , how good you are , Aunt Mary ! It 's too bad ; it is really . I ca n't let you . AUNT MARY . Well , then , you must ; that 's all . You know how that child tosses and kicks about in the night . You never can tell where his head 's going to be in the morning , but you 'll probably find it at the foot of the bed . I could n't sleep an instant , my dear , if I thought that boy was in the upper berth ; for I 'd be sure of his tumbling out over you . Here , let me lay him down . She lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in , Agnes  --  do , and leave me to my struggle with the attraction of gravitation . MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , poor aunty , how will you ever manage it ? I must help you up . AUNT MARY . No , my dear ; do n't be foolish . But you may go and call the porter , if you like . I dare say he 's used to it . MRS . ROBERTS goes and speak timidly to THE PORTER , who fails at first to understand , then smiles broadly , accepts a quarter with a duck of his head , and comes forward to AUNT MARY 'S side . MRS . ROBERTS . Had he better give you his hand to rest your foot in , while you spring up as if you were mounting horseback ? AUNT MARY ( with disdain ) . Spring ! My dear , I have n't sprung for a quarter of a century . I shall require every fibre in the man 's body . His hand , indeed ! You get in first , Agnes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but  --  AUNT MARY ( sternly ) . Agnes , do as I say . MRS . ROBERTS crouches down on the lower berth . I do n't choose that any member of my family shall witness my contortions . Do n't you look . MRS . ROBERTS . No , no , aunty . AUNT MARY . Now , porter , are you strong ? PORTER . I used to be porter at a Saratoga hotel , and carried up de ladies ' trunks dere . AUNT MARY . Then you 'll do , I think . Now , then , your knee ; now your back . There ! And very handsomely done . Thanks . MRS . ROBERTS . Are you really in , Aunt Mary ? AUNT MARY ( dryly ) . Yes . Good-night . MRS . ROBERTS . Good-night , aunty . After a pause of some minutes . Aunty ! AUNT MARY . Well , what ? MRS . ROBERTS . Do you think it 's perfectly safe ? She rises in her berth , and looks up over the edge of the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-managed road . They 've got the air- brake , I 've heard , and the Miller platform , and all those horrid things . What makes you introduce such unpleasant subjects ? MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , I do n't mean accidents . But , you know , when you turn , it does creak so awfully . I should n't mind myself ; but the baby  --  AUNT MARY . Why , child , do you think I 'm going to break through ? I could n't . I 'm one of the lightest sleepers in the world . MRS . ROBERTS . Yes , I know you 're a light sleeper ; but  --  but it does n't seem quite the same thing , somehow . AUNT MARY . But it is ; it 's quite the same thing , and you can be perfectly easy in your mind , my dear . I should be quite as loth to break through as you would to have me . Good-night . MRS . ROBERTS . Yes ; good-night , Aunty ! AUNT MARY . Well ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how he 's lying . He 's a perfect log . Could n't you just bend over , and peep down at him a moment ? AUNT MARY . Bend over ! It would be the death of me . Good-night . MRS . ROBERTS . Good-night . Did you put the glass into my bag or yours ? I feel so very thirsty , and I want to go and get some water . I 'm sure I do n't know why I should be thirsty . Are you , Aunt Mary ? Ah ! here it is . Do n't disturb yourself , aunty ; I 've found it . It was in my bag , just where I 'd put it myself . But all this trouble about Willis has made me so fidgety that I do n't know where anything is . And now I do n't know how to manage about the baby while I go after the water . He 's sleeping soundly enough now ; but if he should happen to get into one of his rolling moods , he might tumble out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've thought of something . I 'll just barricade him with these bags and shawls . Now , old fellow , roll as much as you like . If you should happen to hear him stir , aunty , wo n't you  --  aunty ! Oh , dear ! she 's asleep already ; and what shall I do ? While MRS . ROBERTS continues talking , various notes of protest , profane and otherwise , make themselves heard from different berths . I know . I 'll make a bold dash for the water , and be back in an instant , baby . Now , do n't you move , you little rogue . She runs to the water-tank at the end of the car , and then back to her berth . Now , baby , here 's mamma again . Are you all right , mamma 's own ? A shaggy head and bearded face are thrust from the curtains of the next berth . THE STRANGER . Look here , ma'am . I do n't want to be disagreeable about this thing , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is , I 'm half dead for want of sleep , and if you 'll only keep quiet now a little while , I 'll promise not to speak above my breath if ever I find you on a sleeping-car after you 've come straight through from San Francisco , day and night , and not been able to get more than about a quarter of your usual allowance of rest  --  I will indeed . MRS . ROBERTS . I 'm very sorry that I 've disturbed you , and I 'll try to be more quiet . I did n't suppose I was speaking so loud ; but the cars keep up such a rattling that you never can tell how loud you are speaking . Did I understand you to say that you were from California ? THE CALIFORNIAN . Yes , ma'am . MRS . ROBERTS . San Francisco ? THE CALIFORNIAN . Yes , ma'am . MRS . ROBERTS . Thanks . It 's a terribly long journey , is n't it ? I know quite how to feel for you . I 've a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before this . She scans his face as sharply as the lamp- light will allow , and continues , after a brief hesitation . It 's always such a silly question to ask a person , and I suppose San Francisco is a large place , with a great many people always coming and going , so that it would be only one chance in a thousand if you did . THE CALIFORNIAN ( patiently ) . Did what , ma'am ? MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , I was just wondering if it was possible  --  but of course it is n't , and it 's very flat to ask  --  that you 'd ever happened to meet my brother there . His name is Willis Campbell . THE CALIFORNIAN ( with more interest ) . Campbell ? Campbell ? Yes , I know a man of that name . But I disremember his first name . Little low fellow  --  pretty chunky ? MRS . ROBERTS . I do n't know . Do you mean short and stout ? THE CALIFORNIAN . Yes , ma'am . MRS . ROBERTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a great many years since he went out there , and I 've never seen him in all that time . I thought if you did happen to know him  --  He 's a lawyer . THE CALIFORNIAN . It 's quite likely I know him ; and in the morning , ma'am  --  MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , excuse me . I 'm very sorry to have kept you so long awake with my silly questions . THE MAN IN THE UPPER BERTH . Do n't apologize , madam . I 'm not a Californian myself , but I 'm an orphan , and away from home , and I thank you , on behalf of all our fellow-passengers , for the mental refreshment that your conversation has afforded us . I could lie here and listen to it all night ; but there are invalids in some of these berths , and perhaps on their account it will be as well to defer everything till the morning , as our friend suggests . Allow me to wish you pleasant dreams , madam . THE CALIFORNIAN , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berth in dismay , and stammers some inaudible excuse , slowly emerges full length from his berth . THE CALIFORNIAN . Do n't you mind me , ma'am ; I 've got everything but my boots and coat on . Now , then standing beside the berth , and looking in upon the man in the upper tier , you , do you know that this is a lady you 're talking to ? THE UPPER BERTH . By your voice and your shaggy personal appearance I should n't have taken you for a lady  --  no , sir . But the light is very imperfect ; you may be a bearded lady . THE CALIFORNIAN . You never mind about my looks . The question is , Do you want your head rapped up against the side of this car ? THE UPPER BERTH . With all the frankness of your own Pacific slope , no . MRS . ROBERTS ( hastily reappearing ) . Oh , no , no , do n't hurt him . He 's not to blame . I was wrong to keep on talking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to THE UPPER BERTH ) . You hear ? Well , now , do n't you speak another word to that lady tonight . Just go on , ma'am , and free your mind on any little matter you like . I do n't want any sleep . How long has your brother been in California ? MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , do n't let 's talk about it now ; I do n't want to talk about it . I thought  --  I thought  --  Good-night . Oh , dear ! I did n't suppose I was making so much trouble . I did n't mean to disturb anybody . I  --  MRS . ROBERTS gives way to the excess of her confusion and mortification in a little sob , and then hides her grief behind the curtains of her berth . THE CALIFORNIAN slowly emerges again from his couch , and stands beside it , looking in upon the man in the berth above . THE CALIFORNIAN . For half a cent I would rap your head up against that wall . Making the lady cry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now see here , you just apologize . You beg that lady 's pardon , or I 'll have you out of there before you know yourself . Cries of " Good ! " " That 's right ! " and " Make him show himself ! " hail MRS . ROBERTS 'S champion , and heads , more or less dishevelled , are thrust from every berth . MRS . ROBERTS remains invisible and silent , and the loud and somewhat complicated respiration of her AUNT makes itself heard in the general hush of expectancy . A remark to the effect that " The old lady seems to enjoy her rest " achieves a facile applause . THE CALIFORNIAN again addresses the culprit . Come , now , what do you say ? I 'll give you just one-half a minute . MRS . ROBERTS ( from her shelter ) . Oh , please , please do n't make him say anything . It was very trying in me to keep him awake , and I know he did n't mean any offence . Oh , do let him be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet the rest of the time ; and if that lady choses to keep us all awake the whole night , do n't you say a word , or I 'll settle with you in the morning . Loud and continued applause , amidst which THE CALIFORNIAN turns from the man in the berth before him , and restores order by marching along the aisle of the car in his stocking feet . The heads vanish behind the curtains . As the laughter subsides , he returns to his berth , and after a stare up and down the tranquillized car , he is about to retire . A VOICE . Oh , do n't just bow . Speak ! A fresh burst of laughter greets this sally . THE CALIFORNIAN erects himself again with an air of baited wrath , and then suddenly breaks into a helpless laugh . THE CALIFORNIAN . Gentlemen , you 're too many for me . He gets into his berth , and after cries of " Good for California ! " " You 're all right , William Nye ! " and " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different berths gradually relapse into silence , and at last , as the car lunges onward through the darkness , nothing is heard but the rhythmical clank of the machinery , with now and then a burst of audible slumber from MRS . ROBERTS 'S aunt MARY . II . At Worcester , where the train has made the usual stop , THE PORTER , with his lantern on his arm , enters the car , preceding a gentleman somewhat anxiously smiling ; his nervous speech contrasts painfully with the business-like impassiveness of THE PORTER , who refuses , with an air of incredulity , to enter into the confidences which the gentleman seems reluctant to bestow . MR . EDWARD ROBERTS . This is the Governor Marcy , is n't it ? THE PORTER . Yes , sah . MR . ROBERTS . Came on from Albany , and not from New York ? THE PORTER . Yes , sah , it did . MR . ROBERTS . Ah ! it must be all right . I  --  THE PORTER . Was your wife expecting you to come on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exactly . She was expecting me to meet her at Boston . But I  --  struggling to give the situation dignity , but failing , and throwing himself , with self-convicted silliness , upon THE PORTER 'S mercy . The fact is , I thought I would surprise her by joining her here . THE PORTER ( refusing to have any mercy ) . Oh ! How did you expect to find her ? MR . ROBERTS . Well  --  well  --  I do n't know . I did n't consider . He looks down the aisle in despair at the close-drawn curtains of the berths , and up at the dangling hats and bags and bonnets , and down at the chaos of boots of both sexes on the floor . I do n't know how I expected to find her . MR . ROBERTS 'S countenance falls , and he visibly sinks so low in his own esteem and an imaginary public opinion that THE PORTER begins to have a little compassion . THE PORTER . Dey 's so many ladies on board I could n't find her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course not . I did n't expect that . THE PORTER . Do n't like to go routing ' em all up , you know . I would n't be allowed to . MR . ROBERTS . I do n't ask it ; that would be preposterous . THE PORTER . What sort of looking lady was she ? MR . ROBERTS . Well , I do n't know , really . Not very tall , rather slight , blue eyes . I  --  I do n't know what you 'd call her nose . And  --  stop ! Oh yes , she had a child with her , a little boy . Yes ! THE PORTER ( thoughtfully looking down the aisle ) . Dey was three ladies had children . I did n't notice whether dey was boys or girls , or what dey was . Did n't have anybody with her ? MR . ROBERTS . No , no . Only the child . THE PORTER . Well , I do n't know what you are going to do , sah . It wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here comes the conductor . Maybe he 'll know what to do . MR . ROBERTS makes some futile , inarticulate attempts to prevent The PORTER from laying the case before THE CONDUCTOR , and then stands guiltily smiling , overwhelmed with the hopeless absurdity of his position . THE CONDUCTOR ( entering the car , and stopping before THE PORTER , and looking at MR . ROBERTS ) . Gentleman want a berth ? THE PORTER ( grinning ) . Well , no , sah . He 's lookin ' for his wife . THE CONDUCTOR ( with suspicion ) . Is she aboard this car ? MR . ROBERTS ( striving to propitiate THE CONDUCTOR by a dastardly amiability ) . Oh , yes , yes . There 's no mistake about the car  --  the Governor Marcy . She telegraphed the name just before you left Albany , so that I could find her at Boston in the morning . Ah ! THE CONDUCTOR . At Boston . Sternly . Then what are you trying to find her at Worcester in the middle of the night for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  THE PORTER ( taking compassion on MR . ROBERTS 'S inability to continue ) . Says he wanted to surprise her . MR . ROBERTS . Ha  --  yes , exactly . A little caprice , you know . THE CONDUCTOR . Well , that may all be so . MR . ROBERTS continues to smile in agonized helplessness against THE CONDUCTOR 'S injurious tone , which becomes more and more offensively patronizing . But I ca n't do anything for you . Here are all these people asleep in their berths , and I ca n't go round waking them up because you want to surprise your wife . MR . ROBERTS . No , no ; of course not . I never thought  --  THE CONDUCTOR . My advice to you is to have a berth made up , and go to bed till we get to Boston , and surprise your wife by telling her what you tried to do . MR . ROBERTS ( unable to resent the patronage of this suggestion ) . Well , I do n't know but I will . THE CONDUCTOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the berth for you . MR . ROBERTS ( to THE PORTER , who is about to pull down the upper berth over a vacant seat ) . Ah ! Er  --  I  --  I do n't think I 'll trouble you to make it up ; it 's so near morning now . Just bring me a pillow , and I 'll try to get a nap without lying down . He takes the vacant seat . THE PORTER . All right , sah . He goes to the end of the car and returns with a pillow . MR . ROBERTS . Ah  --  porter ! THE PORTER . Yes , sah . MR . ROBERTS . Of course you did n't notice ; but you do n't think you did notice who was in that berth yonder ? He indicates a certain berth . THE PORTER . Dat 's a gen'leman in dat berth , I think , sah . MR . ROBERTS ( astutely ) . There 's a bonnet hanging from the hook at the top . I 'm not sure , but it looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this reasoning , but recovering his firmness ) . Yes , sah . But you ca n't depend upon de ladies to hang deir bonnets on de right hook . Jes ' likely as not dat lady 's took de hook at de foot of her berth instead o ' de head . Sometimes dey takes both . MR . ROBERTS . Ah ! After a pause . Porter ! THE PORTER . Yes , sah . MR . ROBERTS . You would n't feel justified in looking ? THE PORTER . I could n't , sah ; I could n't , indeed . MR . ROBERTS ( reaching his left hand toward THE PORTER 'S , and pressing a half dollar into his instantly responsive palm ) . But there 's nothing to prevent my looking if I feel perfectly sure of the bonnet ? THE PORTER . N-no , sah . MR . ROBERTS . All right . THE PORTER retires to the end of the car , and resumes the work of polishing the passengers ' boots . After an interval of quiet , MR . ROBERTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels to be melodramatic stealth , approaches the suspected berth . He unloops the curtain with a trembling hand , and peers ineffectually in ; he advances his head further and further into the darkened recess , and then suddenly dodges back again , with THE CALIFORNIAN hanging to his neckcloth with one hand . THE CALIFORNIAN ( savagely ) . What do you want ? MR . ROBERTS ( struggling and breathless ) . I  --  I  --  I want my wife . THE CALIFORNIAN . Want your wife ! Have I got your wife ? MR . ROBERTS . No  --  ah  --  that is  --  ah , excuse me  --  I thought you were my wife . THE CALIFORNIAN ( getting out of the berth , but at the same time keeping hold of MR . ROBERTS ) . Thought I was your wife ! Do I look like your wife ? You ca n't play that on me , old man . Porter ! conductor ! MR . ROBERTS ( agonized ) . Oh , I beseech you , my dear sir , do n't  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know it has an ugly look ; but if you will allow me two words  --  only two words  --  MRS . ROBERTS ( suddenly parting the curtain of her berth , and springing out into the aisle , with her hair wildly dishevelled ) . Edward ! MR . ROBERTS . Oh , Agnes , explain to this gentleman ! Imploringly . Do n't you know me ? A VOICE . Make him show you the strawberry mark on his left arm . MRS . ROBERTS . Edward ! Edward ! THE CALIFORNIAN mechanically looses his grip , and they fly into each other 's embrace . Where did you come from ? A VOICE . Centre door , left hand , one back . THE CONDUCTOR ( returning with his lantern ) . Hallo ! What 's the matter here ? A VOICE . Train robbers ! Throw up your hands ! Tell the express-messenger to bring his safe . The passengers emerge from their berths in various deshabille and bewilderment . THE CONDUCTOR ( to MR . ROBERTS ) . Have you been making all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , sir , he has n't . I 've been making this row . This gentleman was peaceably looking for his wife , and I misunderstood him . You want to say anything to me ? THE CONDUCTOR ( silently taking THE CALIFORNIAN 'S measure with his eye , as he stands six fret in his stockings ) . If I did , I 'd get the biggest brakeman I could find to do it for me . I 've got nothing to say except that I think you 'd better all go back to bed again . He goes out , and the passengers disappear one by one , leaving the ROBERTSES and THE CALIFORNIAN alone . THE CALIFORNIAN ( to MR . ROBERTS ) . Stranger , I 'm sorry I got you into this scrape . MR . ROBERTS . Oh , do n't speak of it , my dear sir . I 'm sure we owe you all sorts of apologies , which I shall be most happy to offer you at my house in Boston , with every needful explanation . He takes out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at it , and then looks at MR . ROBERTS curiously . There 's my address , and I 'm sure we shall both be glad to have you call . MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , yes indeed . THE CALIFORNIAN parts the curtains of his berth to re-enter it . Good-night , sir , and I assure you we shall do nothing more to disturb you  --  shall we , Edward ? MR . ROBERTS . No . And now , dear , I think you 'd better go back to your berth . MRS . ROBERTS . I could n't sleep , and I shall not go back . Is this your place ? I will just rest my head on your shoulder ; and we must both be perfectly quiet . You 've no idea what a nuisance I have been making of myself . The whole car was perfectly furious at me one time , I kept talking so loud . I do n't know how I came to do it , but I suppose it was thinking about you and Willis meeting without knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be still . I woke everybody up with my talking , and some of them were quite outrageous in their remarks ; but I did n't blame them the least bit , for I should have been just as bad . That California gentleman was perfectly splendid , though . I can tell you he made them stop . We struck up quite a friendship . I told him I had a brother coming on from California , and he 's going to try to think whether he knows Willis . Groans and inarticulate protests make themselves heard from different berths . I declare , I 've got to talking again ! There , now , I shall stop , and they wo n't hear another squeak from me the rest of the night . She lifts her head from her husband 's shoulder . I wonder if baby will roll out . He does kick so ! And I just sprang up and left him when I heard your voice , without putting anything to keep him in . I must go and have a look at him , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you go , Edward ; you 'll be prying into all the wrong berths in the car , you poor thing ! You stay here , and I 'll be back in half a second . I wonder which is my berth . Ah ! that 's it ; I know the one now . She makes a sudden dash at a berth , and pulling open the curtains is confronted by the bearded visage of THE CALIFORNIAN . Ah ! Ow ! ow ! Edward ! Ah ! I  --  I beg your pardon , sir ; excuse me ; I did n't know it was you . I came for my baby . THE CALIFORNIAN ( solemnly ) . I have n't got any baby , ma'am . MRS . ROBERTS . No  --  no  --  I thought you were my baby . THE CALIFORNIAN . Perhaps I am , ma'am ; I 've lost so much sleep I could cry , anyway . Do I look like your baby ? MRS . ROBERTS . No , no , you do n't . In distress that overcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left him all uncovered , and he 'll take his death of cold , even if he does n't roll out . Oh , Edward , Edward , help me to find baby ! MR . ROBERTS ( bustling aimlessly about ) . Yes , yes ; certainly , my dear . But do n't be alarmed ; we shall find him . THE CALIFORNIAN ( getting out in his stocking feet ) . We shall find him , ma'am , if we have to search every berth in this car . Do n't you take on . That baby 's going to be found if he 's aboard the train , now , you bet ! He looks about and then tears open the curtains of a berth at random . That your baby , ma'am ? MRS . ROBERTS ( flying upon the infant thus exposed ) . Oh , baby , baby , baby ! ! I thought I had lost you . Um ! um ! um ! She clasps him in her arms , and covers his face and neck with kisses . THE CALIFORNIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voce ) . I wish I had been her baby . MRS . ROBERTS ( returning with her husband to his seat , and bringing the baby with her ) . There ! Did you ever see such a sleeper , Edward ? In her ecstasy she abandons all control of her voice , and joyfully exclaims . He has slept all through this excitement , without a wink . A solemn Voice from one of the berths . I envy him . A laugh follows , in which all the passengers join . MRS . ROBERTS ( in a hoarse whisper , breaking a little with laughter ) . Oh , my goodness ! there I went again . But how funny ! I assure you , Edward , that if their remarks had not been about me , I could have really quite enjoyed some of them . I wish there had been somebody here to take them down . And I hope I shall see some of the speakers in the morning before  --  Edward , I 've got an idea ! MR . ROBERTS ( endeavoring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has risen again ) . What  --  what is it , my dear ? MRS . ROBERTS . Why , do n't you see ? How perfectly ridiculous it was of me not to think of it before ! though I did think of it once , and had n't the courage to insist upon it . But of course it is ; and it accounts for his being so polite and kind to me through all , and it 's the only thing that can . Yes , yes , it must be . MR . ROBERTS ( mystified ) . What ? MRS . ROBERTS . Willis . MR . ROBERTS . Who ? MRS . ROBERTS . This Californian . MR . ROBERTS . Oh ! MRS . ROBERTS . No stranger could have been so patient and  --  and  --  attentive ; and I know that he recognized me from the first , and he 's just kept it up for a joke , so as to surprise us and have a good laugh at us when we get to Boston . Of course it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think so , my dear ? MRS . ROBERTS . I know it . Did n't you notice how he looked at your card ? And I want you to go at once and speak to him , and turn the tables on him . MR . ROBERTS . I  --  I 'd rather not , my dear . MRS . ROBERTS . Why , Edward , what can you mean ? MR . ROBERTS . He 's very violent . Suppose it should n't be Willis ? MRS . ROBERTS . Nonsense ! It is Willis . Come , let 's both go and just tax him with it . He ca n't deny it , after all he 's done for me . She pulls her reluctant husband toward THE CALIFORNIAN 'S berth , and they each draw a curtain . Willis ! THE CALIFORNIAN ( with plaintive endurance ) . Well , ma'am ? MRS . ROBERTS ( triumphantly ) . There ! I knew it was you all along . How could you play such a joke on me ? THE CALIFORNIAN . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there must have been , if you say so . Who am I now , ma'am  --  your husband , or your baby , or your husband 's wife , or  --  MRS . ROBERTS . How funny you are ! You know you 're Willis Campbell , my only brother . Now do n't try to keep it up any longer , Willis . Voices from various berths . " Give us a rest , Willis ! " " Joke 's too thin , Willis ! " " You 're played out , Willis ! " " Own up , old fellow  --  own up ! " THE CALIFORNIAN ( issuing from his berth , and walking up and down the aisle , as before , till quiet is restored ) . I have n't got any sister , and my name ai n't Willis , and it ai n't Campbell . I 'm very sorry , because I 'd like to oblige you any way I could . MRS . ROBERTS ( in deep mortification ) . It 's I who ought to apologize , and I do most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when I got to thinking about it , and how kind you had been to me , and how sweet you had been under all my  --  interruptions , I felt perfectly sure that you could n't be a mere stranger , and then the idea struck me that you must be my brother in disguise ; and I was so certain of it that I could n't help just letting you know that we 'd found you out , and  --  MR . ROBERTS ( offering a belated and feeble moral support ) . Yes . MRS . ROBERTS ( promptly turning upon him ) . And you ought to have kept me from making such a simpleton of myself , Edward . THE CALIFORNIAN ( soothingly ) . Well , ma'am , that ai n't always so easy . A man may mean well , and yet not be able to carry out his intentions . But it 's all right . And I reckon we 'd better try to quiet down again , and get what rest we can . MRS . ROBERTS . Why , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will try not to disturb you again . And if there 's anything we can do in reparation after we reach Boston , we shall be so glad to do it ! They bow themselves away , and return to their seat , while THE CALIFORNIAN re-enters his berth . III . The train stops at Framingham , and THE PORTER comes in with a passenger whom he shows to the seat opposite MR. and MRS . ROBERTS . THE PORTER . You can sit here , sah . We 'll be in in about an hour now . Hang up your bag for you , sah ? THE PASSENGER . No , leave it on the seat here . THE PORTER goes out , and the ROBERTSES maintain a dejected silence . The bottom of the bag , thrown carelessly on the seat , is toward the ROBERTSES , who regard it listlessly . MRS . ROBERTS ( suddenly clutching her husband 's arm , and hissing in his ear ) . See ! She points to the white lettering on the bag , where the name " Willis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it ca n't be ; it must be some other Campbell . I ca n't risk it . MR . ROBERTS . But there 's the name . It would be very strange if there were two people from San Francisco of exactly the same name . I will speak . MRS . ROBERTS ( as wildly as one can in whisper ) . No , no , I ca n't let you . We 've made ourselves the laughing-stock of the whole car already with our mistakes , and I ca n't go on . I would rather perish than ask him . You do n't suppose it could be ? No , it could n't . There may be twenty Willis Campbells in San Francisco , and there probably are . Do you think he looks like me ! He has a straight nose ; but you ca n't tell anything about the lower part of his face , the beard covers it so ; and I ca n't make out the color of his eyes by this light . But of course it 's all nonsense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid of us to ride all the way from Framingham to Boston with that name staring one in the eyes . I wish he would turn it away . If it really turned out to be Willis , he would think we were awfully stiff and cold . But I ca n't help it ; I ca n't go attacking every stranger I see , and accusing him of being my brother . No , no , I ca n't , and I wo n't , and that 's all about it . She leans forward and addresses the stranger with sudden sweetness . Excuse me , sir , but I am very much interested by the name on your bag . Not that I think you are even acquainted with him , and there are probably a great many of them there ; but your coming from the same city and all does seem a little queer , and I hope you wo n't think me intrusive in speaking to you , because if you should happen , by the thousandth of a chance , to be the right one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right what , madam ? MRS . ROBERTS . The right Willis Campbell . CAMPBELL . I hope I 'm not the wrong one ; though after a week 's pull on the railroad it 's pretty hard for a man to tell which Willis Campbell he is . May I ask if your Willis Campbell had friends in Boston ? MRS . ROBERTS ( eagerly ) . He had a sister and a brother-in-law and a nephew . CAMPBELL . Name of Roberts ? MRS . ROBERTS . Every one . CAMPBELL . Then you 're  --  MRS . ROBERTS ( ecstatically ) . Agnes ! CAMPBELL . And he 's  --  MRS . ROBERTS . Mr. Roberts ! CAMPBELL . And the baby 's  --  MRS . ROBERTS . Asleep ! CAMPBELL . Then I am the right one . MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , Willis ! Willis ! Willis ! To think of our meeting in this way ! She kisses and embraces him , while MR . ROBERTS shakes one of his hands which he finds disengaged . How in the world did it happen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , and I stopped off with an old friend of mine at Framingham ; I did n't want to disappoint you when you came to meet this train , or get you up last night at midnight . MRS . ROBERTS . And I was in Albany , and I 've been moving heaven and earth to get home before you arrived ; and Edward came aboard at Worcester to surprise me , and  --  Oh , you 've never seen the baby ! I 'll run right and get him this instant , just as he is , and bring him . Edward , you be explaining to Willis  --  Oh , my goodness ! Looking wildly about . I do n't remember the berth , and I shall be sure to wake up that poor California gentleman again . What shall I do ? CAMPBELL . What California gentleman ? MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , somebody we 've been stirring up the whole blessed night . First I took him for baby , and then Edward took him for me , and then I took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . CAMPBELL . Did he look like any of us ? MRS . ROBERTS . Like us ? He 's eight feet tall , if he 's an inch , in his stockings  --  and he 's always in them  --  and he has a long black beard and mustaches , and he 's very lanky , and stoops over a good deal ; but he 's just as lovely as he can be and live , and he 's been as kind and patient as twenty Jobs . CAMPBELL . Speaks in a sort of soft , slow grind ? MRS . ROBERTS . Yes . CAMPBELL . Gentle and deferential to ladies ? MRS . ROBERTS . As pie . CAMPBELL . It 's Tom Goodall . I 'll have him out of there in half a second . I want you to take him home with you , Agnes . He 's the best fellow in the world . Which is his berth ? MRS . ROBERTS . Do n't ask me , Willis . But if you 'd go for baby , you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicating a berth ) . I think that 's the one . CAMPBELL ( plunging at it , and pulling the curtains open ) . You old Tom Goodall ! THE CALIFORNIAN ( appearing ) . I ai n't any Tom Goodall . My name 's Abram Sawyer . CAMPBELL ( falling back ) . Well , sir , you 're right . I 'm awfully sorry to disturb you ; but , from my sister 's description here , I felt certain you must be my old friend Tom Goodall . THE CALIFORNIAN . I ai n't surprised at it . I 'm only surprised I ai n't Tom Goodall . I 've been a baby twice , and I 've been a man 's wife once , and once I 've been a long-lost brother . CAMPBELL ( laughing ) . Oh , they 've found him . I 'm the long-lost brother . THE CALIFORNIAN ( sleepily ) . Has she found the other one ? CAMPBELL . Yes ; all right , I believe . THE CALIFORNIAN . Has he found what he wanted ? CAMPBELL . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a movement to get into bed again . Oh , do n't ! You 'd better make a night of it now . It 's almost morning anyway . We want you to go home with us , and Mrs. Roberts will give you a bed at her house , and let you sleep a week . THE CALIFORNIAN . Well , I reckon you 're right , stranger . I seem to be in the hands of Providence tonight anyhow . He pulls on his boots and coat , and takes his seat beside CAMPBELL . I reckon there ai n't any use in fighting against Providence . MRS . ROBERTS ( briskly , as if she had often tried it and failed ) . Oh , not the least in the world . I 'm sure it was all intended ; and if you had turned out to be Willis at last , I should be certain of it . What surprises me is that you should n't turn out to be anybody , after all . THE CALIFORNIAN . Yes , it is kind of curious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , do n't speak of it . We are the ones who ought to apologize . But if you only had been somebody , it would have been such a good joke ! We could always have had such a laugh over it , do n't you see ? THE CALIFORNIAN . Yes , ma'am , it would have been funny . But I hope you 've enjoyed it as it is . MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , very much , thanks to you . Only I ca n't seem to get reconciled to your not being anybody , after all . You must at least be some one we 've heard about , do n't you think ? It 's so strange that you and Willis never even met . Do n't you think you have some acquaintances in common ? CAMPBELL . Look here , Agnes , do you always shout at the top of your voice in this way when you converse in a sleeping-car ? MRS . ROBERTS . Was I talking loud again ? Well , you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . CAMPBELL . But there must be a lot of them who do n't want to hear you . I wonder that the passengers who are not blood-relations do n't throw things at you  --  boots and hand-bags and language . MRS . ROBERTS . Why , that 's what they 've been doing  --  language , at least  --  and I 'm only surprised they 're not doing it now . THE CALIFORNIAN ( rising ) . They 'd better not , ma'am . He patrols the car from end to end , and quells some rising murmurs , halting at the rebellious berths as he passes . MRS . ROBERTS ( enraptured by his companionship ) . Oh , he must be some connection . She glances through the window . I do believe that was Newton , or Newtonville , or West Newton , or Newton Centre . I must run and wake up baby , and get him dressed . I sha n't want to wait an instant after we get in . Why , we 're slowing up ! Why , I do believe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy being there already ! MR . ROBERTS . Yes , my dear . Only we 're not quite there yet . Had n't we better call your aunt Mary ? MRS . ROBERTS . I 'd forgotten her . CAMPBELL . Is Aunt Mary with you ? MRS . ROBERTS . To be sure she is . Did n't I tell you ? She came on expressly to meet you . CAMPBELL ( starting up impetuously ) . Which berth is she in ? MRS . ROBERTS . Right over baby . CAMPBELL . And which berth is baby in ? MRS . ROBERTS ( distractedly ) . Why , that 's just what I ca n't tell . It was bad enough when they were all filled up , but now since the people have begun to come out of them , and some of them are made into seats I ca n't tell . THE CALIFORNIAN . I 'll look for you , ma'am . I should like to wake up all the wrong passengers on this car . I 'd take a pleasure in it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one , I 'll begin on that . MRS . ROBERTS . I ca n't even be sure of the wrong one . No , no ; you must n't  --  THE CALIFORNIAN moves away , and pauses in front of one of the berths , looking back inquiringly at MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , do n't ask me ! I ca n't tell . To CAMPBELL . Is n't he amusing ? So like all those Californians that one reads of  --  so chivalrous and so humorous ! AUNT MARY ( thrusting her head from the curtains of the berth before which THE CALIFORNIAN is standing ) . Go along with you ! What do you want ? THE CALIFORNIAN . Aunt Mary . AUNT MARY . Go away . Aunt Mary , indeed ! MRS . ROBERTS ( running toward her , followed by CAMPBELL and MR . ROBERTS ) . Why , Aunt Mary , it is you ! And here 's Willis , and here 's Edward . AUNT MARY . Nonsense ! How did they get aboard ? MRS . ROBERTS . Edward came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . AUNT MARY . And a very silly performance . Let them wait till I 'm dressed , and then I 'll talk to them . Send for the porter . She withdraws her head behind the curtain , and then thrusts it out again . And who , pray , may this be ? She indicates THE CALIFORNIAN . MRS . ROBERTS . Oh , a friend of ours from California , who 's been so kind to us all night , and who 's going home with us . AUNT MARY . Another ridiculous surprise , I suppose . But he shall not surprise me . Young man , is n't your name Sawyer ? THE CALIFORNIAN . Yes , ma'am . AUNT MARY . Abram ? THE CALIFORNIAN . Abram Sawyer . You 're right there , ma'am . MRS . ROBERTS . Oh ! oh ! I knew it ! I knew that he must be somebody belonging to us . Oh , thank you , aunty , for thinking  --  AUNT MARY . Do n't be absurd , Agnes . Then you 're my  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Found ! found at last ! THE CALIFORNIAN looks vainly round in an endeavor to identify the speaker , and then turns again to AUNT MARY . AUNT MARY . Were n't your parents from Bath ? THE CALIFORNIAN ( eagerly ) . Both of ' em , ma'am  --  both of ' em . THE VOICE . O my prophetic soul , my uncle ! AUNT MARY . Then you 're my old friend Kate Harris 's daughter ? THE CALIFORNIAN . I might be her son , ma'am ; but my mother 's name was Susan Wakeman . AUNT MARY ( in sharp disgust ) . Call the porter , please . She withdraws her head and pulls her curtains together ; the rest look blankly at one another . CAMPBELL . Another failure , and just when we thought we were sure of you . I do n't know what we shall do about you , Mr. Sawyer . THE VOICE . Adopt him . CAMPBELL . That 's a good idea . We will adopt you . You shall be our adoptive  --  THE VOICE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOICE . Brother . A FOURTH VOICE . Early friend . A FIFTH VOICE . Kate Harris 's daughter . CAMPBELL ( laying his hand on THE CALIFORNIAN 'S shoulder , and breaking into a laugh ) . Do n't mind them . They do n't mean anything . It 's just their way . You come home with my sister , and spend Christmas , and let us devote the rest of our lives to making your declining years happy . VOICES . " Good for you , Willis ! " " We 'll all come ! " " No ceremony ! " " Small and early ! " CAMPBELL ( looking round ) . We appear to have fallen in with a party of dry-goods drummers . It makes a gentleman feel like an intruder . The train stops ; he looks out of the window . We 've arrived . Come , Agnes ; come , Roberts ; come , Mr. Sawyer  --  let 's be going . They gather up their several wraps and bags , and move with great dignity toward the door . AUNT MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must forget your aunt , at least remember your child . MRS . ROBERTS ( running back in an agony of remorse ) . Oh , baby , did I forget you ? CAMPBELL . Oh , aunty , did she forget you ? He runs back , and extends his arms to his aunt . Let me help you down , Aunt Mary . AUNT MARY . Nonsense , Willis . Send the porter . CAMPBELL ( turning round and confronting THE PORTER ) . He was here upon instinct . Shall he fetch a step-ladder ? AUNT MARY . He will know what to do . Go away , Willis ; go away with that child , Agnes . If I should happen to fall on you  --  They retreat ; the curtain drops , and her voice is heard behind it addressing THE PORTER . Give me your hand ; now your back ; now your knee . So ! And very well done . Thanks . ***                    @
