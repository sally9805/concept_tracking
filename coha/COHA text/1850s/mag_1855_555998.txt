Speech delivered by HON. JosIAH QuINcY , Senior , before the Whig Convention , August 16 , 1834 . Boston . 1834. 3 . Considerations respectfully submitted to the Citizens of Boston and C'hariestown , on the proposed Anne . ation of these two C*ities . By JosIAH QUINCY , Senior . Boston . 1834 . MR.WINTHROP ' 5 is a lecture that we should be glad to put into the hands of every young man in the United States . It is written in an easy style , rising naturally with the subject , and presents a noble character with those accessories of greatness in speech and life which are fitted to make more than a transient impression upon the reader . It is well for us to keep green the memory of such men as Algernon Sidney , and to quicken our virtues anew by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social rights and an almost unlimited political freedom , there is danger lest we forget the cost at which our liberties have been purchased , and so begin to undervalue and despise them . " Eternal vigilance* ' is the price which we must still pay for such privileges ; and in a constitutional republic not less than under a monarchy the great maxims and safeguards of free and equal government are to be cherished , applied , and enforced with a jealousy as sensitive as that with which female purity or a man 's personal integrity and honor should be guarded and preserved . // Mr. Winthrop has very happily connected the name of Algernon Sidney with the history of our Revolutionary patriots , and shown how intimately his principles of civil and religious liberty were related to the movement by which our national independence was secured . In reading this graceful memorial of one whose name is better known among us than his life , and whose virtues we are more ready to praise than to imitate , our thoughts have been led off from the topics of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more private and personal character . The lesson taught to statesmen and reformers by the life of Algernon Sidney is indeed a most valuable one . Never was the cause of constitutional liberty in England apparently in a more hopeless condition , than when the highest bench of justice was *lisgraced by the inhuman ribaldry of Jeffreys , who brutally set at defiance every principle of equity and law , as he scoffed at every humane sentiment , and made the selfsacrificing exertions of the patriotic , and the saintly virtues of the devout , alike the objects of his coarse mockery . Yet his descent from that proud elevation of seeming impunity and power was swift as the judgments of Heaven , and that which had appeared to be the permanent triumph of injustice and oppression over liberty served only to rouse a spirit which was speedily to be its most terrible avenger and restorer . The insolence with which the tools of arbitrary power use their moment of victory , the violent measures into which they are whirled while intoxicated with success , and the impatient scorn with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sacred compacts , are indications of that insanity which must lead to their speedy downfall . The whole history of the English people , from the days when the earliest charters of freedom were extorted from the haughty Edward I. , * through Charles I. and James II. , down to the separation of these American colonies from the mother country , goes to show that the greatest gain on the side of popular rights has almost invariably been just at the epoch when those who held the government were rioting most insolently in the exercise and extension of their power . It is well that we on our side of the Atlantic should remember this at the present time , // when the propagandists of a fearful system of oppression have set aside the faith of solemn compromises , and , in the mad intoxication of victory , with jeers at men who would uphold the sacredness of human rights , dare to speak of what they have already done in repealing the Missouri Compromise as only " the basis of a grand movement in this country " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , involving the liberty , social order , and moral well-being of millions , we are not to be discouraged by the momentary ascendency of the wrong . The violence of its threats , the recklessness of its measures , and the extravagance of its claims , are to be regarded as encouraging symptoms of the madness with which the gods first smite those whom they would destroy . These broad considerations , however , relating to our national honor and the public prosperity which is bound up with the moral integrity of a people , are not what we would now dwell upon . Nor would we treat of the influence on public affairs which may be exercised by men like Algernon Sidney in spite of any apparent want of success during their lives . The thought which has been suggested to us , and which we would carry out in some of its particulars , is this . Here is a man of extraordinary powers , devoting the enthusiasm of his youth and manhood to the highest ends , yet apparently failing in whatever he undertook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally dying by the hand of a public executioner . XTet his life does not strike us as unfinished or incomplete , nor his death as premature . What is it , then , that gives the impression of a finished life ? Not length of days , nor immediate success in the particular measures to which their strength has been devoted . The life of Robert Wheaton , short as it was , does not seem to us an unfinished life , though it brought out so many promises which were not fulfilled , and though there were so many ties of duty and affection binding him here , which were rudely broken by his sudden and early death . The life of Dr. Arnold , taken as he was in the fulness of his manhood and in the midst of his most active and useful career , does not strike us as an unfinished life , though we mourn over the loss which learning and // religion , not less than his friends , sustained in his death . But the life of Haydon , the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken aim or by unworthy means , and ending in despair and suicide , though prolonged almost to the limit allotted to man , grates harshly upon us , as an inharmonious and unfinished life . No man in his generation was so distinguished for his military achievements and all the outward elements of success as John , Duke of Marlborough , and he lived more than his threescore and ten years . Yet , notwithstanding the blaze of glory that encircles his name and connects it with the proudest monuments of his country 's military greatness , no one , we think , in reading his memoirs , comes to the close of his career without a sensation of disappointment . The life is incomplete . The last act in the drama pains us , and throughout the whole there is something wanting to the fulness of his fame . His extraordinary abilities , showing themselves on so large a scale , in actions of such dazzling splendor , rewarded as they were with almost boundless wealth and the highest place that could be given to a subject in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities which should be formed on the same large scale to fill out the just proportions of such a character and such a life . On the other hand , in the Duke of Wellington , who may possibly have been inferior to Marlborough in the native endowments of genius , there is , as we approach the close of his life , a sense of completeness . There were no moral obliquities , no one-sided intellectual idiosyncrasies or deficiencies , in short , no unsound portions of character , which his friends were anxious to keep out of sight . He unquestionably had his foibles , and in his long public life must sometimes have been mistaken . Indeed , there are many things in his political views and conduct with which we could not sympathize . But his weaknesses were those of a great man , as his errors were those of an honest man . There was in him a soundness of judgment , a manliness of purpose , a massiveness and integrity of character , which endure like a rock , and which must always give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we feel in looking at some finely propor // tioned , substantial , and finished specimen of architecture . The parts are harmonious . He is not a poet or a philosopher , but he does not pretend to be . What his talents in one direction lead us to expect of him in others , that he is . His wonderful victories do not , like those of the great Frederic of Prussia , make him ridiculous by their contrast with the wretched attempts at verse which he imposed upon his friends . Unlike that king , whose greatness was surpassed only by his vanity , he knew where his strength lay , and was contented with it . When Napoleon said , " He is the greatest general who makes the fewest mistakes , and Wellington has made as few as any one , " he said of him in his military capacity what applies to him equally well in his whole character . Washington is another and almost the only other instance that now occurs to us , of one belonging to the highest rank of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yet fuller degree , this same impression of completeness . The harmony of proportions both in his intellectual and moral powers conceals the grandeur of the scale on which they are formed . The wisdom , in the largest and best sense of that comprehensive word , which ran through his whole life , giving a similar tone and coloring to all its parts , has made his actions seem less brilliant than they were . The consummate skill , which , foreseeing from afar all contingencies , by timely provisions prevented the possibility of those desperate crises when extraordinary victories are to be gained only at the risk of overwhelming defeat , and the magnanimity with which he placed the grandest opportunities of success in the hands of others , have made his military services less dazzling than they might have been . And the unsurpassed prudence with which , by his ascendency over the minds of others , in the most perilous times of his presidential administration , he subdued in their beginnings the powerful factions that were threatening to overthrow our infant government , may , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of its entire success ; and that which is the highest proof of his transcendent ability may serve only to conceal his greatness . But the harmony resulting from all this , as it shows itself in his mind , his character , and every department of a life crowded with noble // and illustrious deeds , serves to create and leave with us the sense of completeness which it is so delightful to carry away in our minds as we close the volume of a great man 's life . It is a matter of some interest to ascertain in what pursuits we are most likely to find men whose protracted lives leave this sense of harmony and completeness . It certainly is not in the department of letters , at least not among poets . Homer and Shakespeare are almost mythical characters , and come before us as endowed in the largest proportions with all the qualities that go to make up a harmonious and happy life . In our ignorance of what they actually were , we transfer to them the inward resources which their works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men living amid such marvellous creations of thought and fancy could not feel the pangs of neglect or the weariness and ennui of advancing years . Though Homer is supposed to have wandered from province to province , a blind old man , getting a precarious support by reciting his poems , we think of him still as an inspired minstrel , the greatest and most gifted of men , carried away by the mighty flow of song , his own soul moved , and kindled , and exalted , as he touched the hearts and roused the enthusiasm of others by the majestic and evervarying harmony that swept the chords of his wonderful lyre . But , setting aside these greatest of poets , of whom we know so little , there are very few of their order who give us the lenpression of finished or happy lives . Milton , in the soarings of a spirit as pure and lofty as his Muse , and the consciousness of employing his vast powers in a great and noble cause , was in no small degree lifted above the troubles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents to us the picture of a true and harmonious life , although " fallen on evil days and evil tongues In darkness and with dangers compassed round , And solitude . " But , with this single exception , if it be an exception , among all the names in Johnson 's Lives of the Poets there is not one which suggests to us the idea of an harmonious or a happy life . In almost every case , the sensibilities which made them poets turned inward and fed upon their own natures . Even Addi // son , the finest character among them all , dying as a Christian should die , does not by his whole history leave on the mind an impression which we altogether love to recall . Dryden and Pope , Prior , Savage , and Young , need only to be named , to bring before us the thought of talents which we admire , but of lives disjointed and unhappy . Cowper and Burns , and the poets of the last generation , Byron and Shelley , Coleridge , Campbell , and Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave us with a feeling of disappointment and sadness , as we follow them through their lives , and close the memoirs which have been prepared even by their most partial friends . Southey 's was , perhaps , a happy life , though the cloud that rested on his latter days leaves something of its gloom behind it . Scott , the most healthful , the most vivacious and fortunate of poets , the fresh breezes of success filling all his sails and bearing him on so prosperously till the lusty summer of his manhood was beginning to give place to the serene autumnal days , down to that period is an example of all that we desire to associate with a favorite author . His home was the centre of as much enjoyment as falls to the lot of man , and its amusements and more serious pursuits were such as become a man of genius and of letters . There was a hospitality as large and generous as his own large and generous nature . Literature for the occupation of his morning hours , rural sports and labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and visitors from abroad to entertain the harmless day , with his affluent mind , his exuberant spirits , and inexhaustible kindliness of nature , present , on the whole , the brightest picture of domestic and social felicity that is to be found in the annals of literary history . But one weakness , - " that last infirmity of noble minds , " - an ambition to have his name and family connected with a place worthy of his fame , laid upon him a task which even his robust frame could not carry through . He struggled long and bravely . But here was the one disproportionate and tyrannical passion which broke up the harmony of his career , and made the closing scenes of a life so brilliant and joyous among the saddest that we have ever known . If that imagination which revelled amid the splendors and magnificence of feudal times // had only confined itself to the creations through which past ages are made to live before us ; if the poet had only been content to be a poet , unrivalled as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never attempted with prosaic stone and mortar to build castles vieing with his poetic dreams ,  --  we might have been spared the tears which we have shed over his painful history , and the sorrowful regrets which haunt us even when we think of his early and his later triumphs . Wordsworth was the only poet of his time whose life seems to have been in harmony with his works , and whose works are little else than the transcript of his daily thought and experience . Rogers , who has united the man of business and the man of letters , and who is to be known hereafter rather as the friend of poets than as himself one of their fraternity , though we would be slow to close the door against him , affords now , we suppose , at the age of more than ninety , one of the finest specimens ever known of a serene and happy old age , rich in all the resources of literary and social culture , the freshness of feeling , the refinement of taste , the quick and generous sympathies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years , and make him the honored and delightful associate of all . William Roscoe , the historian , the poet , and the man of business , was also one , who , notwithstanding severe pecuniary misfortunes , combined in his character and experience , as fully perhaps as any one , the qualities which give dignity , beauty , and honor to the closing years of a useful and protracted life . In regard to literature , as it respects the subject of which we are treating , we should say that it is better as a companion than as a mistress , and that few who make it their sole pursuit have the harmonious development of mind and character which is most favorable to a healthy and happy life . But neither is such a life to be found often among the great orators . As the sensibilities of the poet , so the ardent and powerful emotions by which the orator would move and sway the minds of others , are unfavorable to a nice adjustment of the faculties . In the greatest orators there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demosthenes , the de // voted patriot , the consummate statesman , seeing far and wide into the affairs of nations , moving by his speech vast assemblies of men almost as easily as he moved his own impassioned limbs , lived in evil days , and his light went out in the tempestuous darkness and night that overwhelmed the liberty and extinguished the glory of Athens and of Greece . And Cicero - the very style of his later writings steeped in anxieties and sorrows - shows how deep a hold on his spirit public calamities had taken , and how hopelessly on this account , independently of his private griefs , his last days were spent . All that he sought from his philosophical studies and writings was to forget national misfortunes , while he dwelt for a season amid the bright examples of earlier and better days . The overthrow and fallen glories of cities and empires seemed to lend a meagre and momentary consolation , by showing him that he was not alone in his sorrows . But neither to him nor to his greater compeer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and noble qualities which go to make a harmonious and happy life . We have only to mention by name the most eminent orators belonging to more recent times , - Chatharn , the greatest of them all , unless Mirabean may have rivalled him in the mastery which be exercised over the tempestuous passions 01 his hearers , Burke and Fox , the younger Pitt and Sheridan , James Otis , Patrick Henry , and Fisher Ames , or , in our own day , those three great champions in our national Senate , whose death has taken from that august body so much of its dignity and interest ; or , at the bar , Erskine , the greatest of English forensic orators , and , in this country , Luther Martin , William Pinkney , and Samuel Dexter ; or , in the pulpit , Bossuet and Massillon , George Whitefield and Robert Hall , Chalmers and Irving . We doubt whether any one of these , unless it might be Chalmers , would be selected as furnishing an example of the sort of life that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The haughty and unmanageable pride of Chatham left him when he crossed his threshold to mingle with the members of his own family . Burke and Fisher Ames were the most amiable and entertaining of men among their familiar associates ; but 3* // notwithstanding the quickness of Ames 's parts and the playfulness of his wit , notwithstanding the philosophic imagination which has made Burke the greatest of political writers , the ardor of their natures and their vividness of apprehension , which gave them such power as public speakers , tyrannized over their own minds , and to some extent clouded their last days with unhappy , if not with needless fears . Among statesmen we find more men of well-balanced character and life . The danger with them is , that they should be too ambitious , too severely tasked in labor , too hard driven by the emergencies of state , and that , when they have once tasted the enjoyment of political power , they should cling to it with too tenacious and desperate a grasp . Their minds are also likely to be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broad and enduring principles of expediency and justice . The statesmen formed in the school of our Revolution , in times of imminent peril , when old formulas were thrown to the winds , and they were obliged to seek in the fundamental principles of law and justice a foundation on which to establish their institutions , were so situated as to escape these liabilities , while the necessity of building up a permanent and efficient government saved them from the destructive tendencies to which their revolutionary struggles might have exposed them . The consequence was the training , on a liberal scale of a class of statesmen , who , if less learned than the most accomplished civilians of England , were , by the very magnitude of the work intrusted to them , called upon to exercise those far-reaching faculties by which the statesman is distinguished from the politician , and to frame their laws on the broad principles of national honor , expediency , and justice . Here was an office eminently fitted to call out their best faculties of thought and action . And we accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men whose long and important public services are remembered in connection with lives which it is also a pleasure to remember . Benjamin Franklin and George Washington , John Jay and John Marshall , both eminent as statesmen before they graced the highest judicial office of the nation , are names to which we may turn , not only as calling // before us distinguished public benefactors , but as suggesting some of the best examples of well-finished lives that the world has yet seen . John Adams , Thomas Jefferson , and James Madison may , with some qualifications , be added to the list . And among the less conspicuous lights in that brilliant constellation , among the men associated with them , or formed under their influence and rendering to them important aid , are statesmen who , within their narrower sphere , were hardly less honored and beloved , - John Taylor Gilman and Meshech Weare , of New Hampshire , Timothy Pickering , Caleb Strong , George Cabot , and James Bowdoin , of Massachusetts , William Ellery , of Rhode Island , Roger Sherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George Clinton and Rufus King , Gouverneur Morris and Joseph Reed , Stockton , Bayard , and Tilghman , Laurens and Rutledge , Charles Cotesworth Pinckney , William Smith , and others scarcely less distinguished than these , whose setting sun some of us who are yet in the meridian of life remember with affectionate respect , as that of men whose intelligence , large experience , and ripened virtues made old age attractive and honorable . And are dare to hope , that statesmen of this exalted stamp are not to be thought of as belonging entirely to an extinct race . It has usually been supposed that agriculture , as it is the employment of the greatest portion of the human family , is most favorable to the culture of those qualities which make a happy and useful life . But we incline to think that , though agriculture , like literature , is admirable in its influence on the mind when employed as a healthful recreation and an occasional resource for men who have other occupations , or a furnishing a peaceful retreat to those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best development of our nature where it is made the sole pursuit . At least , here in New England , with our hard soil and harder climate , the labor necessary to support a family from the proceeds of a farm is too continuous and exhausting . It breaks down the natural elasticity of body and mind long before the mellowing influence of time has had its perfect work . We have been pretty extensively acquainted in the rural districts of New England , and , though we have known many old people among laboring farmers , we // Jan. can hardly call to mind more than three or four who could be looked upon as favorable specimens of a green and happy old age . Popular notions on this subject are apt to be borrowed from poetry and romance , from descriptions like Virgil 's of the Corycian old man , who was the first to pluck the rose in spring and the apple in autumn , or like Spenser 's of the aged Melibee , and his encomium on the " happie life Which Shepheards lead , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts will drive away these romantic dreams , and painfully convince us , that the occupation which forces men into the sharpest conflict with nature may be too severe in its exactions to admit of the culture and the enjoyments which would be the natural fruits of a more peaceful communion with the external universe . Of the liberal professions , the medical is that which most severely tasks the body , and which , for one in the routine of his daily practice , does perhaps the least for the enlargement of the mind by literary culture . The social qualities and kindly feelings are called into exercise , and upon the whole the pursuit may be considered favorable to the life and character . Its members are less likely than those of the other liberal professions to have a wide reputation . Their labors as practitioners are circumscribed within comparatively n arrow limits , and their best influence , as well as their most exhausting and anxious labor , is given within the privacy of a sickchamber , where no approving multitudes are admitted to witness their skill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *tatistics at hand , but should guess that fewer members of this profession than of any other attain to old age . There have been , however , remarkable cases of longevity . Dr. Holyoke of Salem lived more than a century , his faculties wearing bright to the last . In villages near Boston we have known of more than one who , apparently in the full possession of their pQwers , have gone beyond their ninetieth year . The late Dr. Thacher of Plymouth , who had been a surgeon in our Revolutionary war , retained to an uncommon degree the freshness of his faculties till he had reached the age of nearly or quite fourscore and ten years . Ezra Green , // 1855. of Dover , New Hampshire , lived with faculties unusually bright eighty-two years after he was graduated at Harvard College . The Memoir of Robert Wheaton gives an account of a physician in Providence , Dr. Levi Wheaton , who , at the age of ninety , kept up his interest in the literature of the day , and never lost the freshness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very rare in the profession . The excessive labors and anxieties which it imposes on one in extensive practice can not be favorable to length of days ; and it is very difficult for an eminent physician to withdraw partially from practice . We have been personally acquainted with no very aged physician , but we need not go beyond this city to see how gracefully the best endowments of mind and heart may be developed and combined in a physician , how pleasantly the fruits of a long and wide experience may he enriched by the kindliest affections , and how modestly they may show themselves in wise and beneficent acts . We have such among the living , and one such , Dr. George Cheyne Shattuck , within a few months has passed from us , at the age of seventy , after a life so filled with useful and generous deeds , with such devotedness to his profession , which he held more and more in honor , and to all the best interests of man and society , that it is a comfort and a privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the clerical profession there have been among us fine specimens of well-finished and protracted lives . Dr. Nathaniel Emmons , of Franklin , Massachusetts , died in 1840 , in the ninety-sixth year of his age . He withdrew from the ministry in his eighty-third year , and to a gentleman who , admiring his green and happy old age , expressed a doubt whether he had not retired from the pulpit too soon , he replied , " I meant to retire while I had sense enough to do it . " He was a theologian of clear and profound thought , as the five compact volumes of his writings prove , He was also a man of kindly feelings , and of a quick and sprightly wit , though not wholly free from the one-sided development caused by a training almost exclusively professional . Having on one occasion been asked what he thought of a certain sermon being published and circulated in the same pamphlet with a review of it , he FINISHED LIVES . // instantly replied , " It is against the law ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an ox and an ass together . " ' On another occasion , when a young man to whom he was rather partial had delivered a discourse with too much pomposity of manner , and in an inflated style , he requested the private criticism of Dr. Emmons . The critic , ninety years old , rose from his chair , protruded his chest , inflated his cheeks , raised his eye-brows , and , after a significant puff , sat down , not saying a word , but smiling at what he had done . To another young minister he said , " Your sermon was too much like Seekonk Plain , long and level . " " When , " says Professor Park , in his entertaining lecture on Dr. Emmons , " he appeared in the streets of a New England city , a few years ago , with his three-cornered hat , his bright buckles on his shoe and knee , his white locks flowing down his shoulders , the boys flocked after him , as after a military general . " But it was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , above all , his genuine spirit of devotion , that made his old age so interesting . His conversation not long before his death reminds one of the best passages of Izaak Walton . " I want to go to heaven , " he said . " The more I think of it , the more delightful it appears . And I want to see who is there ; I want to see brother Sandford , and brother Niles , and brother Spring , and Dr. Hopkins , and Dr. West , and a great many other ministers I want to see , too , the old prophets and the apostles . What a society there will be in heaven ! There we shall see such men as Moses , and Isaiah , and Elijah , and Daniel , and Paul . I want to see Paul more than any other man I can think of . " And so his mind was filled with the anticipations of heaven . At another time he said , " I do not know that I shall be saved . If another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I should have a hope of him . But it is a great thing to be allowed to enter heaven . Perhaps I shall be shut out . But if I am not saved , I shall be disappointed . " Again he said ,  --  and it shows his magnanimity ,  --  " I feel grateful that , if I am not to be saved , others will be . " But when the hour came , his characteristic words were , " I am ready " ; and , like a good soldier as he was , he cheerfully obeyed the call . // We might bring up many instances of this kind in the clerical profession , both from among the living and the dead . We only mention the names of the venerable Bishop White of Philadelphia , and Bishop Griswold of Boston ; Dr. John Pierce of Brookline , whose white locks and hale countenance and form were for years so picturesquely associated with the Commencement exercises at Harvard University ; Dr. Leonard Woods of Andover , whose milder virtues make one almost forget the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kendall of Plymouth , in character as in personal appearance the fitting successor of those who held the office of pastor and teacher to the early Pilgrims . Dr. Abiel Abbot of Peterborough , N. H. , who was born December 14th , 1764 , shows how lightly the weight of years may rest on a mind always devoted to the highest studies , and to whatever may conduce to the best interests of man and of society . In the adjoining town of Jaifrey is Rev. Laban Ainsworth , who must be nearly a hundred years old , and who , if during the last few years the shadows have begun to fall upon him , was till recently resting in the pleasant light of a serene and cheerful old age . In Garland , Maine , we understand , is a clergyman , Rev. John Sawyer , born October 9th , 1755 , who , till he was ninety-six or ninety-seven , continued to preach with great regularity without apparent flagging , and with a readiness to meet every call . Since he entered on his ninety-ninth year he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stated that he is cheerful , and even playful , in his extreme age . " His countenance , " we are told , " lights up , and expresses the emotions he feels . There has ever been a somewhat humorous vein about him , - strokes and flashes of wit , - but there reigns through all the spirit of piety . He is indeed a memorable man ; and we feel , as we look upon him , that he is an eminently godly man . The presence of such an one is impressive ; even his silence is a sermon . " Very similar to his case was that of Rev. Dr. Nott , of Connecticut , who died a few years ago . There is , perhaps , no profession which , taking it all in all , is *o favorable to the qualities of which we have been speaking , as that of the law . Notwithstanding the vulgar prejudice // against lawyers , which has been only too much countenanced by the low cunning and threepenny thrift of a class of pettifoggers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most where a mistaken idea of public economy calls only second and third rate men to the bench , there is no profession which has furnished more numerous or better examples of integrity , intellectual culture , and a high-minded sense of honor . The study of the law by itself does unquestionably expose those who devote themselves exclusively to it to the dangers alluded to by Mr. Burke in his felicitous portraiture of the character of George Grenville . While it strengthens and sharpens the mind , it does not to the same extent enlarge and liberalize its powers . Accustomed as it is in the courts to give to precedents , forms , and legal enactments a final authority , it sometimes forgets to recognize the higher principles of justice and order which lie behind them , and which furnish the only broad and safe rules of political philosophy and practical statesmanship . Lord Mansfield , as compared with Chatham or Burke , and Lord Eldon as compared with Sir Robert Peel , may be taken as instructive illustrations of what we mean . But in this country there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive devotedness to the law . Judge Marshall was trained in the army and the halls of legislation , and was an historian and statesman as well as a lawyer . Judge Story was a man of wide and almost universal culture outside of his profession . John Jay and William Pinkney were distinguished as statesmen and diplomatists , as well as at the bar . Theophilus Parsons and Samuel Dexter were not lawyers alone . Hamilton , though unsurpassed at the bar even by the extraordinary powers of Marshall , was yet more eminent as a statesman , and , by those who knew him best , was thought to be more gifted still in the qualities which go to make a great military commander . Mr. Webster , if he had no rival at the bar , was equally without a peer in the Senate and the council chamber . Hence it is , that no profession in this country has contributed finer specimens of manhood , adorned and enlarged by high qualities of mind , and a rich and varied culture . We // need not go abroad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his stern antagonist , Sir Edward Coke , who at the age of eighty was the uncompromising advocate of popular rights against the royal prerogative , Lord Somers and Lord Hardwicke , the two brothers Stowell and Eldon , Lord Campbell , the able historian of Chancellors and Judges , Lord Jeffrey , better known as a critic than on the bench , or Talfourd , beloved for his estimable private qualities , honored as an upright and learned judge , and known by his writings wherever our language is read . In our own country we have had their peers in lawyers less widely known , perhaps , for their part was enacted on a less conspicuous stage , but with qualities as great , and lives not less useful , when we consider what influence they who establish and expound the laws of a mighty nation in its infancy are yet to have . Chancellor Kent , though judicially limited to a single State , may be looked upon , not only as a lawyer who improved the science of jurisprudence , but as one of the happiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here in New England , we might mention a score of men distinguished on the bench or at the bar , who , by their happy combination of gifts and attainments , were , down to the latest period of life , the delight of their homes and of every circle in which they were found . Of this class were Jeremiah Smith of New Hampshire , and his early competitor at the bar , Jeremiah Mason , of whose great abilities no fitting memorial is left except in the short but impressive eulogy on him by Mr. Webster . John Lowell withdrew so early from the bar that we hardly think of him as a lawyer . Judge John Davis , of the United States District Court , retained the high qualities of a Christian gentleman and scholar till he was nearly ninety years old ; and Judge William . Prescott lived beyond his fourscore years in the full exercise of the clear intelligence , the modest virtues and genial affections , which , attractive as they were to those who knew him , are likely to be outshone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American troops at Bunker Hill , and of the son who has recreated for us from half-forgotten or perishing materials the extraordinary historical characters and events of former days . // W* remember to have met , some years ago , two men who had occupied at the same time a seat on the bench of the Superior Court of New Hampshire , and who , each in turn , lived to hold the place of the oldest graduate on the Catalogue of Harvard University . Paine Wingate was born in May , 1739 , was graduated in 1759 , and died in May , 1838 . He was settled as a minister of the Gospel for some years in Hanipton Falls , N. H. , was afterwards a Senator of the United States , and for many years a judge , though we believe that he was placed upon the bench before he had studied the law . Till he had nearly completed his century of years , he retained his natural vivacity and capacity of enjoyment , but after he was ninety-six or ninety-seven , his hearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , that life at last became burdensome to him . Timothy Farrar was born in July , 1747 , and graduated in 1767 . He was more than forty years a judge , and during more than thirty years after he had retired from the bench , down to the time of his death at the age of nearly one hundred and two years , he retained the use of his faculties to a more remarkable degree than any other person whom we have known . He was modest , well informed , devout , and always a man of remarkable cheerfulness and equanimity . Of living members of the legal profession who serve as striking illustrations of our subject , we might mention one whose venerable form is seen daily in our streets , who occupied for many years a seat on the bench of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts with honor to himself and advantage to the State , and who now , at an age considerably beyond fourscore years , is looked up to by younger members of his own and other professions , who love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his conversation and society . And with Samuel S. Wilde we may mention the name of Charles Jackson , his junior in age , though he withdrew from the bench many years before him , taking into his retirement the qualities of mind and character which are best fitted to make a man 's public services precious and his private life cheerful and respected . There is one other living man , * who is , perhaps more than // any one else whom we have known , a striking illustration of our subject . We hardly know where to place him . A lawyer and a judge , he would seem rightfully enough to belong to the legal profession , were it not that he has been more a statesman than a lawyer . But the brilliancy of his early career as a statesman has been eclipsed by his more important and substantial services as the author and founder , we might say , of municipal regulations in his native State . These labors of his prime are already more than half forgotten by those who have known him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability and success over the oldest literary institution in the United States . And alrea ( ly the sentiments of honor , gratitude , and affection which followed him when he retired from the academic halls are giving place to the deeper admiration and reverence with which they regard one in whom the conservative tendencies of age , and of the long-continued prosperity which so few are able to resist , have done nothing to weaken his confidence in what is right , to soften his indignation at what is wrong , or to chill the ardor of his youthful love of liberty , or his sympathies with the oppressed . It is as if the spirit of the father , whose early death in the cause of freedom has made him always young , had transfused itself into the son , and through every period of his long life had crowned him with the freshness of a perpetual youth . His wisdom has never degenerated into the prudence which outgrows the affections of childhood , and learns to despise the instincts of our common humanity . At the last meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege to hear him , the only survivor of the class of 1790 , vividly contrasting the past with the present , pleading for old age as the best and happiest period of life , if only the rightful preparation is made for it , veiling all the while , under sportive images , the ripened wisdom of long experience and many which prepared the way for our Revolution , died Apr11 26 , 1775 , aged 31 , just as he came within sight of Cape Aun , on his return from London . In his will , as quoted by Mr. Winthrop in his Lecture on Algernon Sidney , he says , " I give to my son , when he shall arrive at the age of fifteen years , Algernon Sidney 's works , John Locke 's works , Lord Bacon 's works , Gordon 's Tacitus , and Cato 's Letters . May the spirit of liberty rest upon him . " That son was then three years old , having been born on the 4th of February , 1772 . The father 's prayer was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which amid laughter and tears fixed itself deeply in our minds , and presented , as we have seldom if ever seen them before , in living combination , the great and manly qualities which go to make up our ideal of a finished and harmonious life . In the diary of the Rev. Joseph Stevens Buckminster , under the date of September , 1805 , is the following entry : " President Nott preached in Brattle Street church ; the fullest audience ever known there except on ordination day . Epigram made on him by Josiah Quincy . Delight and instruction have people , I wot , Who in seeing not see , and in hearing hear not . ' " The author of this clever epigram was the now venerable President Quincy , and the subject of it , as we suppose , was no other than the equally venerable Rev. Eliphalet Nott , now , as he was then , nearly half a century ago , the President of Union College . Recently President Nott has been the most conspicuous personage in a yet more remarkable assemblage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the celebration at the close of the fiftieth year of his presidency . " For many years there had been hints , and then open charges , that Dr. Nott had embezzled the funds of Union College . At length the Legislature of the State of New York appointed a committee of inquiry . The investigation was long and searching , and it disclosed a state of things to which probably no other institution can furnish a parallel . Dr. Nott had managed the funds of the College with such prudence and forecast , that he had added to them the immense sum of one million of dollars . More than half of this was in strict equity his own private property , it having accrued in consequence of individual risks and responsibilities which he had incurred ; and yet he had laid it all down a splendid offering to the College , the child of his affections . When these facts were brought to light , a call was issued to all the graduates of Union to come home to their Alma Mater to testify their respect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the completion of the fiftieth year of his presidency . They came from every quarter of the Union , and gathered around their venerated father . They filled the body of the Presbyterian Church , an immense building , to its utmost capacity . Judge Campbell of New York addressed the Alumni , giving a clear and // brief statement of the history and present affairs of the College , its struggles out of weakness and embarrassment to its present state of palmy prosperity . Dr. Wayland , the early pupil of Dr. Nott , followed , saying that he appeared there at the call of his master , which with him was as imperative as when he listened to it in yonder halls . He then went on at considerable length , and gave a profound and admirable exposition of the subject of the education which the country demands . At the close he turned to Dr. Kott , and with words of deep emotion , that drew tears from strong men , expressed to him the love and veneration of his assembled pupils , praying that he might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the time of parting must come , God might stop gently the beating of his pulses , and softly close his eyes upon earth , that they might open upon the glories of heaven , leaving us only to lament a loss to this world which nothing can repair . " In the afternoon Dr. Nott addressed the crowded assembly for an hour , sketching rapidly the changes of fifty years , and closing with a last farewell to his beloved pupils . ' It was altogether a patriarchal scene . Though crowned with the snows of eighty-one winters , his intellectual clearness and vigor were unabated . The latter part of the address breathed a spirit of childlike faith , that kindled his venerable features with visions of immortality ; and when , after expressing the earnest faith that there we should all meet again , he closed with choking utterance : Till then , beloved pupils , farewell , - a long and last farewell ! ' He seemed within the two worlds , breathing a patriarch 's blessing upon his children here , while catching upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not looked very particularly into the facts of the case , and in a matter of this kind would be careful to speak with all suitable caution and respect . But , while thinking over this branch of our subject , the question has occurred to us , whether the office of president of a college , even though it should be held only for a short tii*e , is not favorable to length of days and the general preservation of the faculties . Besi ( les the two distinguished octogenarians whom we have already mentioned , among men venerable for their years as well as for their talents and virtues we at this monient call to mind Daniel Dana , formerly President of Dartmouth College , Jeremiah Day of New Haven , Bennett Tyler , the successor of Dr. Dana , William Allen , formerly at the head of Bowdoin College , Heman Humphrey , the first President of Amherst , and Joshua Bates , who for a considerable time presided 4* // over the college at Middlebury . With the exception of Dr. Bates , who died during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four have passed beyond their eightieth year , are now living in the fulness of their powers , and taking a hearty interest in whatever belongs to the cause of letters and religion . We , indeed , hardly recognize these dignified heads of colleges under the simple names by which we have designated them ; and it is perhaps worth the while to consider , whether the formidable titles , which , like a numerous body-guard , attend upon each of their names in the college catalogues , do not frighten off the enemies which otherwise , by slow approaches or sudden attacks , might make sad inroads on their physical or mental powers . We refer the subject to the grave and respectful attention of the learned bodies by whom these titles are conferred ; and if the suggestion should be found to be not without weight , it will furnish a reason beyond any that the public now recognize for the continuance and extension of these imposing , and , as some have profanely surmised , invidious or unmeaning honors . At least , the experiment might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed . In one instance , we see that the degree of LL . D. was conferred on a man when he had just completed his hundredth year ; but , like the old Cornaro 's wine , which he resumed the practice of taking at about the same age , it came too late , and the patient continued less than two years after the prescription had been given . It may be a little difficult to ascertain precisely at what stage of mental vigor or weakness the application may be made with the greatest prospect of success . But there are no difficulties which may not be overcome by zeal and perseverance in the cause of learning . And as , in the present instance , the prescription is one seldom objected to by the patient , the boldest experimenter will not be likely to expose himself to the charge of cruelty . The mercantile profession , though usually too absorbing and exciting for the best development of mind or character , has furnished fine examples of the calm intelligence and substantial virtues which give interest and dignity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large scale demands an amount of knowledge , and a breadth and strength of mind , hardly inferior // to what are required for the heads of departments in our national government . Not only is there need of a wide , farseeing sagacity ; but unshaken integrity is equally required in order to secure the general confidence which is so essential to mercantile success . With the acquisition of property , an opportunity is given for the practice of beneficence , and the encouragement of all the liberal arts which conduce to the elegance and refinement of society . Among the eminent merchants of this vicinity whose lives may be studied with profit we would mention William Rotch , senior , of New Bedford , a merchant of great enterprise and success , who lived till he was more than ninety years old , venerable for his age , but more so for his intelligence and virtues ; and his son , William IRotch , junior , whose benignant countenance and patriarchal dignity and simplicity of manners , at the age of ninety , gave indications of a well-spent life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the patriarch Jacob , he did not quite attain unto " the days of the years of the life of his father in the days of his pilgrimage . " At the head of the eminent merchants of Newburyport in the last generation was William Bartlett , the principal founder of the Andover Theological Seminary , a man of strong mind , of unquestioned integrity , of religious principle and high public spirit . It would not be easy to mention the names of all the merchants in Boston whose acts of public and private beneficence , remarkable as they were , have only been such as became the men from whom they proceeded . Samuel Eliot and Samuel Parkman were in their day distinguished alike for their public and private benefactions , and did much to establish it as a part of the public sentiment of the community , that an eminently wealthy man fails in his duty to society unless he contributes liberally to institutions required for the advancement of learning and religion , and for the alleviation of human suffering . Among the worthy successors of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handasyd Perkins . For twenty years before his death Mr. Lawrence devoted the energies of his strong and liberal mind to deeds of benevolence , and probably during that time distributed more than // half a million of dollars . Schools and colleges were endowed . Funds were advanced to young men of small means . Valuable books were published and distributed . Poor children were picked up in the streets , and their condition inquired into and improved . Aged persons , who had known better days , were kindly sought out and rendered comfortable . Innumerable packages of clothing were made up and sent to those in want . His daily rides were seldom taken without his carrying with him something that might contribute to the comfort and happiness of those who had been less favored by fortune than himself . And there was no class of suffering persons or public objects which was wholly shut out from his sympathies . Mr. Appleton , though he devoted himself less exclusively to such acts , was a man of equal kindliness of nature , and pr*bably gave away during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men love to accumulate , so he loved to give to whatever he believed to be a good and useful object . Having no children of his own , he extended his fatherly care to a wide and numerous circle of relatives . If , as with Mr. Lawrence and so many other eminent philanthropists , there was a slight tincture of good-humored vanity in his composition , it entered as a most harmless ingredient into his large an ( l generous nature , and delighted most of all in making every one around him happy . Once , at the exhibition of a menagerie , the attention of the kind-hearted old man was attracted by a crowd of boys trying to catch a glimpse of the animals through the seams of the tent . " How much , " he asked of the door-keeper , " will you take to let them all in ? ** A bargain was immediately made , and by this wholesale operation the happiness of a hundred or more penniless boys was secured for the afternoon . With the bluff heartiness that marked his deportment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes a peculiar delicacy of conduct , which showed that his nature was marked by the liner shades of sentiment . By his will he had left a large amount of property to a favorite nephew . The nephew died , and it was represented to Mr. Appleton by his legal adviser , that , if he left his will as it was , that part of his estate would go to perSons // who were not at all related to him , and in whom he could not be supposed to have any particular interest . Mr. Appleton , after maturely considering the matter , replied , that he had concluded not to alter his will ; that he believed his friends in another world knew what he was doing here ; and he should be sorry to have his nephew see that his first act relating to him after his death was to divert from his nearest relatives the legacy intended for him . These little incidents , taken from a life of fourscore and eight years , are given here to show the quality of the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no regrets to cloud the serenity of his mind when the physical infirmities of age came upon him , and at length , without severe illness or pain , or any other feeling than a gentle desire to depart , the silver cord was loosed , and he peacefully passed away . We do not know that we could select from among all those whom we have mentioned any who at the close of life have left on our mind a sense of satisfaction and repose more complete than Samuel Appleton and Amos Lawrence , both men of rare native sagacity , living up to a high standard of mercantile and personal integrity , and delighting to use their large means so as to advance the best interests of society . Colonel Perkins lived to the age of ninety , and , as was said by a prominent merchant at the time of his death , was for fifty years at the head of the Boston merchants . There were few great enterprises of public utility or private benevolence started here after the commencement of the present century which did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Boston Athena*um will always bear witness to his munificence . The Bunker Hill Monument , as long as its history is known , will testify to his patriotism , which was not content to spend itself in words . Of the Asylum for the Blind he was the founder , and its principal benefactor . We have heard an anecdote which illustrates his character in a different relation , though we can not vouch for the exactness of the details . In a rural village in France the guests had come together to a wedding festival . There were sounds of mirth , and all the festivities with which the light-hearted peasantry of France are accustomed to celebrate // such an event . But suddenly the scene was changed into one of violent and piercing grief . It was in the days of Napoleon . The bridegroom had been seized as a conscript for the army , and it was well known how slight a chance was left for his return from those fatal wars . The suni required for his liberation was altogether beyond his means or those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be spending the night in the village , on hearing the circumstances , became deeply interested in the fate of the young people , and advanced the funds ( quite a considerable sum ) which were needed for their relief . The festival was again resumed , and , amid the wild outbursts of nierriment , there was probably no one who enjoyed the occasion more heartily than the generous Boston merchant who had so denly changed their sadness into mirth . Colonel Perkins was the patriarch of a large family of descendants , reaching down to the third and fourth generations . His faculties were unclouded , and his last days such as it is pleasant to associate with the remembrance of such a life . Of the business men belonging to a former generation in this vicinity , there was no one who united the qualities of a statesman and a man of general intelligence with those of a merchant in larger proportions than George Cabot . The ablest men of his day were in the habit of consulting him as an oracle of wisdom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were entitled to greater consideration and respect . We hesitate a little about mentioning the name of Nathaniel Bowditch as a man of affairs . We think of him rather as a mathematician and a man of science . But there are few who have done so much for the community in some of the most intricate branches of business , particularly in those relating to navigation and insurance , or who have given so much thought and attention to business , as this able an ( l accomplished man . Through whatever he did his large and genial nature shone out with peculiar grace and attractiveness . To those who knew him as a public-spirited citizen , as a neighbor and friend , or in his more intimate social and domestic qualities , his *vell-ordered mind , and his profound // attainments in science , held only a subordinate place in their regard ; and it would not be very easy to find in any occupation one who lived a more finished and harmonious life . We close the memoir of what he did and was , feeling , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the expression , that " he had lived long enough for nature , long enough for glory . " It was well that just before he died he should ask for the word ( euthanasia ) by which the most euphonious and expressive language ever spoken among men would describe the peaceful close of a useful and honored life . With this word and this example of good omen to our cause , we would take our leave of this branch of our subject . It is said , that when an English monarch , George III . we believe , made inquiries of the oldest persons in his kingdom respecting their habits of living , he found that the only practice common to them all was early rising . This would indicate fairly enough the folly of laying down specific rules for all sorts of men . But besides the moral and religious precepts which apply here with a peculiar force , there are a few suggestions which may be adopted with a good degree of assurance by those who would look forward not so much to length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When their active powers begin to abate , they may be excused from the sharp competitions and contests of life ; but they must be careful never to withdraw their sympathies from the world , or to admit that their days of usefulness or their time for personal improvement has gone by . They may employ themselves in the less exciting branches of their business , or seek some other occupation more congenial to their present feelings . They nmay indulge their tastes in rural and literary pursuits , and spend some portion of their time in those sedative amusements which comport with their quiet habits and l ) re ( lilections . They may dwell much in the memories of the past , if only they will let the light and air of the present mingle freely with those memories , that new acquisitions of knowledge may enlarge their boundaries , and fresh emotions and affections temper the feelings with which they would otherwise cling to them . The minds of some 01 ( 1 persons are like sepulchres , which , though they sometimes allow momentary visits from // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the dead . The minute elements of learning must be retained , former acquisitions preserved , and new treasures gained by keeping the intellectual powers in brisk and constant exercise . We remember to have heard the late Jeremiah Mason once say , that , " unless a man occasionally tasked his faculties to the utmost , they would soon begin to fail . " It was probably by observing this rule that he was able to retain , unabated to the last , the keenness and strength of his quick and powerful mind , together with a variety , exactness , and extent of knowledge which impressed those who conversed with him in the latter years of his life hardly less than the growing kindliness of feeling which was interfused through his conversation and pervaded his whole manner . The elder President Adams , after he was ninety years old , said to Mr. Quincy , who found him reading Cicero de Senectute , " It is with an old man as with an old horse ; if you wish to get any work out of him , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , constant exercise of the mind , and occasionally tasking its powers to the utmost , will be found , so far as the intellect is concerned , to contain the secret of a green and vigorous old age . When we add to them the moral discipline and the affections which ripen into virtuous principles and friendships , and crown them with the faith which lends its solemn sanctions to virtue and its undying hopes to friendship , we have indicated the sources of usefulness , improvement , and enjoyment which can hardly fail to result in a finished and harmonious life . And then it matters little whether it end , like that of Sir Philip Sidney , in youth , on the field of battle , or , like that of his greater kinsman , in maturer years , on the scaffold ; whether it pass away unnoticed in the obscurity of some private home , or whether , as with Washington and Wellington , whole nations honor its departure by their tears and by solemn acts of public commemoration . Perfected in itself , it needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's praise , but even in dishonor and reproach , if such should be its portion , nay , even amid abounding profligacy and venality , if these should prevail , it may find comfort and assurance in words like those with which the patriot martyr , Algernon Sidney , met an ignominious and bloody death . // 49 1855 . " I believe the people of God in England have , in these late years , generally grown faint . Some , through fear , have deflected from the integrity of their principles . Some have too deeply plunged themselves in worldly cares , and , so as they might enjoy their trades and wealth , have less regarded the treasure that is laid up in heaven . But I think there are very many who have kept their garments unspotted ; and hope that God will deliver them and the nation for their sakes . God will not suffer this land , where the Gospel hath of late flourished more than in any part of the world , to become a slave of the world ; he will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he will stir up witnesses of the truth , and , in his own time , spirit his people to stand up for his cause , and deliver them . I lived in this belief , and am now about to die in it . I know my Redeemer lives ; and as he hath in a great measure upheld me in the day of my calamity , I hope that he will still uphold me by his Spirit in this last moment , and , giving me grace to glorify him in my death , receive me into the glory prepared for those that fear him , when my body is dissolved . " Words like these , supported by the example of such a life , can not be lost . " This day , " ( says Niebuhr , in 1794 , and we are still copying from Mr. Winthrop 's admirable lecture , ) " this day is the anniversary of Algernon Sidney 's death , one hundred and eleven years ago , and hence it is in my eyes a consecrated day , especially as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May God preserve me from a death like his ; yet even with such a death , the virtue and holiness of his life would not be dearly purchased . "
