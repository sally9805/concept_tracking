AMERICAN WHI* REVIEW . No . XCV . NOVEMBER , 1852. - 4- O- 4 - -  -  FRANKLIN PIERCE : qwq quence , in opposition to the new system . remarks . vor*. xvl. - No. v. 25 // We do not intend to touch here on the motives which induced the investment of the Presidential office with the veto power . Fortunately , the history of the Convention , and the expositions of contemporaneous statesmen , ( many of them participants in the counsels of that body , ) do not leave us in doubt . But we observe that the framers of the Constitution obviously intended to confer on the Executive only a qualified veto ; - they did not dream that the power could or would become absolute in practice , and yet it has become so in fact . It was supposed that a bill which might be returned by the President , " with his objections , to that house in which it originated , " would be taken up and dispassionately considcred , and that a majority of two thirds would be found , at least in some instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the objections of the Executive to the contrary notwithstanding . On no other hypothesis can we account for the carefully arranged and apparently well considered provisions or cLuses introduced to qualify the veto . If the Convention could have foreseen that the power was to become practically absolute , would so much ingenuity have been displayed , and so much ability exerted , to render " the one-man power " subordinate , to some extent , to the will of the people ? All the restrictions and qualifications , however , thrown around this power , have proved vain and idle . No instance is recollected where a majority of " two thirds of that House in which a bill originated " have , after it had been returned with objections , " npproved " or sustained it , and certainly there is none where two thirds of both Houses have done so . The President then can , by the exercise of his despotic will , defeat any measure , or arrest any course of policy , for his entire term-no matter how imperatively demanded by the interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the people . Even though two thirds , or more than that proportion of their immediate representatives , stand by the measure , yet it is in the power of a minority of but one over a third of the other branch to make the veto effectual . But we have had added in modern times , by what we have ever deemed an e ormous usurpation , a new species of veto ; it has . been appropriately denominated the pocket veto . The Constitution provides that " if any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days ( Sundays excepted ) after it shall be presented to him , the same shall be a law in like manner as if he had signed it , unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return , in which case it shall not be a law . " Now we insist that the expiration of a Congress is not an " adjournment " within this clause . The Constitution evidently contemplates a voluntary act to be performed by Congress ; that body was to prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , " in which case it is declared that such bill should not be a law . But how can Congress be said to have prevented such a return when there is in the case nothing but an expiration of their powers by constitutional limitation l Is it not obvious that it was intended that Congress should have an opportunity to pass by a two-thirds vote any and every bill objected to by the Preident l And yet on the construction here resisted , the President is invested with the absolute power to defeat a large portion of the legislation of the country . It is well known that such is the exuberance of oratory displayed in the two Houses of Congress , that little or no business can be consummated until within the last ten days of each session . It will be found , on examination of the acts of Congress and the journals of the two Houses , that more than nine tenths of such acts have been for a long time " presented to the President " for his approval within the period mentioned ; at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the last within ten days of the expiration of the Congiess . And yet Democratic precedent and practice affirm that all the bills coming within the latter category may be pocketed by the President . And this has been repeatedly done . We will point to only one example . At the second session of the Twenty-ninth Congress , the House of Representatives passed a bill of appropriations for river and harbor improvements , and sent it to the Senate ; it ultimately received the sanction of that body , but , as has been usual with Congress , at least for many years , it was not consummated so as to be presented to the President until the last day of the session , when Mr. Polk ( then President ) put it in his pocket , and thus defeated the measure . At the succeeding ses // 387 sion he by an act of supererogation sent a long message of " objections " to the House of Representatives , when he knew well that it was not in the power even of two thirds of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers to consider the vastness of this power , exercised sometimes by abuse and sometimes by usurpation  --  the power to defeat measures of urgent necessity , and to render null great principles of public policyand to ponder well on the consequences . Has not a substantial revolution by these means been effected in the structure of the government ? It has been well said that the abuses here reprobated have rendered what was intended to be only " the medicine of the Constitution , its daily food . " But we must hasten to the consideration of the second cause , which has had some share in augmenting the power of the Executive , and is worthy of serious attention . In the administration of Mr. Polk , we have proof conclusive that a President can by rashness or folly involve the country in a foreign war at any moment . We do not propose to consider at this time the subject of the Oregon controversy , nor the brave assumption of 540 401 as the indisputable American right , only to retreat ignominiously to 490 ; an assumption which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries ( parties to that controversy ) into all the horrors of an issue of blood . But we will dwell for a few moments on the incipient measures of war adopted by Mr. Polk against Mexico , and which were calculated to produce , and did in fact produce , a collision between the two Republics . On the 30th of January , 1846 , Mr. Polk issued an order to General Taylor , then lying at Corpus Christi , within the acknowledged limits of Texas , to advance with his army to the Rio Grande , and to take possession of all that part of the State of Tamaulipas which was situated on the left bank of that river . This territory had never been for a moment subject to the authority or jurisdiction of Texas , and had been at all times in the sole possession of our sister Republic . The Department of War had , as early as July 8th , 1845 , distinctly recognized the fact that Mexico had " some military establishments on the east side of the Rio Grande ; " and General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must " be careful to avoid any acts of aggression un less an actual war should exist ; " that is to say , unless war should be authorized by Congress or declared by Mexico . Notwithstanding these facts , Mr. Polk , by the agency of his *ecretary of War , gave the order already adverted to , and it is manifest on its face that be and his Cabinet regarded it as a semi-belligerent measure , as will appear by the following extract : " It is not designed in our present relations with Mexico that you should treat her as an enemy , but should she assume that character by a declaration of war or any open act of hostility towards us , you will not act merely on the defensive , if your relative means enable yon to do otherwise . " This measure was preeminently adapted to provoke " a declaration of war by Mexico , or some " open act of hostility " on her part . May a President do this on his sole authority ? If so , then in vain has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . And what aggravates the case essentially is the fact that Congress was at the date of the order in session , but Mr. Polk did not deign to take the advice of that body . What aggravates it still more is the conviction which all candid men must entertain that if Congress had been consulted it never would have concurred in the measure . We will not speak with confidence of the House of Representatives , but refer most emphatically to the Senate as containing several distinguished members of the Democratic party , who were conservative in all matters appertaining to our foreign relations , and who would have been sure to veto this deplorable movement . We would be understood to indicate Mr. Calhoun and Colonel Benton as belonging to this class , who resisted strenuously Mr. Polk 's Oregon policy , and who did perhaps more than nay body else * preserve to the United States and Great Britain the inestimable blessings of peace . We do not hesitate to pronounce this act of Mr. Polk a stupendous usurpation , and it enables us to reiterate our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) holds in his hand the issues of peace or war . But it is not necessary for a President to transcend his legitimate authority to involve the country in a war . The right of negotiation and the powers of diplomacy belong to him exclusively , and it is easy to see he may pursue such an irritating , not to say hectoring course toward // a foreign power , as to render war inevitable . The people of this country are martial in their instincts ; they are fond of arms , and brave to a proverb . Any Chief Magistrate , by exciting the prejudices and arousing the passions of the nation , may have war ad libitum . It is fearful to think of the control which a bad man in the Presidency may under this head of administration exercise over the destinies of the country . And here is the proper place for adverting to the many advantages which have in this connection resulted to the Republic by the elevation of Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore successively to the Presidency . Their administrations have been eminently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation and upheld the honor of our flag , they have preserved the peace of the country ; they have preserved it both externally and internally , and this alone is sufficient to cause the memory of the one to be revered , and the name of the other to be honored , now and at all times . And what would have been the event if Gen. Lewis Cass , the great war-hawk of the Senate , had been called to the Presidency in 1848 ? Have we any assurance that our national peace would have been maintained for a single year ? Would the obligation of treaties have been asserted , and our neutrality laws enforced ; would the many turbulent spirits ( mostly foreign adventurers ) to be found within our borders have been held in check ; and would aggressions on the territory of a nation with which we are at peace have been sternly repressed l How would he have treated flibustiering in Cuba , and what would have been our condition if ten thousand men had been thrown on that island from the Gulf coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such lawless proceedings , or even the belief that they would be winked at , might have kindled the flame of war between the United States and several of the leading powers of Europe . Even a slight examination of the senatorial and diplomatic career of Gen. Cass must convince every one that his policy would have been belligerent , and hence it is impossible to over-estimate the importance and value of the results in 1848 . And here we would reprobate an idea in which even Whigs have sometimes indulged , that those results have been productive of little benefit to the country because we have not been able to control to its fullest extent the action of the two Houses of Congress . But even in the halls of legislation that memorable victory has not been without some fruit . Have we not carried through the two Houses , at the late session , a highly important River and Harbor Bill ; and is it not manifest that the measure was extorted from the Democracy by fears which the last canvam inspired l Moreover , the popular arbitrament had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty too well to veto the will of the Legislature on the subject of rivers and harbors . In short , we have obtained , in the form of legislation , nearly all that we desired except a modification of the tariff of 1840 , and even that we may extort ( should the two Houses remain in the hands of the opposition ) by results this year not less brilliant than those of 1848 . But it is in the Executive department mainly we find the advantages to which every Whig can refer with pride and satisfaction . The reins of government have been held with a firm and steady hand , and we have had in succession Chief Magistrates who have been faithful to the Constitution , to the laws , to the cause of " peace on earth and good-will among men , " to our glorious Union , and to the confidence reposed in them by a great and generous people . But we have digressed , and will return at once to the line of discussion originally proposed , by considering the third cause which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here we advert to the subject of patronage . It is well known that during the first ten Presidential terms , viz. , two of Washington , one of Adams ( the elder ) , two of Jefferson , two of Madison , two of Monroe , and one *f Adams ( the younger ) , covering a period of no less than forty years , the practice of dismissing the employees of the government for opinion 's sake was totally unknown , unless a few removals made by Mr. Jefferson constitute an exception . The whole number of removals from the commencement of Washington 's administration to the close of that of J. Q. Adams was only 114 , and over one half of these were made by Mr. Jefferson soon after his accession to the Presidency . J. Q. Adams made only four removals , and these were strictly for cause . But at length the period antici // 389 pated by Patrick Henry arrived , when the head of the nation became the chief of a mere party . On the fourth of March , 1829 , Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidential office , when , prompted by his resentments and circumvented by the wiles of a political magician , he was induced to transplant the spoils system from Albany to the unaccustomed soil of Washington . Here it struck its roots deep into the earth , threw abroad its branches , and soon overshadowed the whole government with its luxuriance . It has been by means of this system that other elements of mischief have been strengthened and reinforced ; that the veto has been made so effectual and destructive ; that large bodies of men , and even States , have been induced to abandon their opinions on great questions of public policy-in one instance suspending for years appropriations indispensable to our navigating interests , and in another overthrowing the encouragement of our domestic industry , regarded as an object of the first importance in the earlier and better days of the Republic . Where were the Democracy of Pennsylvania before the spoils system was introduced on the subject of protection , and where are they now ? And what but the allurements of office , and the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most distinguished sons to betray , in 1844 , her vital interests by the imposture of " Polk , Dallas , Texas , and the tariff of 42 ? " What but this system has produced the loquacity of the two Iiouse* of Congress , and rendered them utterly powerless for purposes of good ? What else has occasioned scenes of disorder , and sometimes even of violence , in our halls of legislation , adapted to suffuse the cheeks of every true-hearted American with a blush ? Why is it that , so soon as one Presidential election is over , a multitude of aspirants rush into the arena , and commence struggling for positions from which they hope to vault into the Presidency ; why , we ask finally , have we occasion to witness su*ch a surprising degener acyof manners and morals , and why such an utter loss of that dignity and elevation of character which uniformly marked the course of public men during the earlier Presidential terms ? Indeed , we regard the subject of patronage as the Pandora 's box from which have emanated nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not the least of these , we repeat , is the enhancement of Ex .. ecutive power , particularly when the government is in the hands of a bad man ; a consideration of the very first importance , which should be incessantly present to the mind of every citizen when called to the duty of voting for a Chief Magistrate of our country . And here we will step aside for a moment to repel the reproach of inconsistency frequently cast on the Whig party , in respect to the matter now adverted to . We believe that the sentiments here avowed are universally entertained by the leading statesmen and well-informed men of the great conservative party with which it is our pride and pleasure to act . If you regard ( exclaim our opponents ) the " spoils system " with so much disapprobation , why do you conform to its behests , on accession to power ? Why did you make such extensive removals in 1841 , and then again in 1849 ? AhI do these interrogators suppose they are to be indulged in a monopoly of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they to take all the places because they are for the system , and when we and our friends carry one , are they to retain them all because we are opposed to it ? As well might a man be forbid the use of a deadly weapon in self-defense , because he entertained and inculcated sentiments of opposition to deeds of bloodshed and violence . But an adequate remedy is at hand . Let the authors and originators of ths detestable system abandon it ; let them return to the rule of moderation , and listen to the accents of justice ; let them recognize merit wherever it exists , and whatever may be its political aspect ; and let them say to the Whig in office who has proved himself " honest , capable , and faithful to the Constitution , " " Well done , good and faithful servant ; " and we will guaranty a response of like generosity and liberal appreciation from those who not only profess , but practise , sound republicanism . In short , we insist that the so-called Democracy are responsible not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evil ; and all imputations on the Whig party in this connection are alike unfounded and impudent . But if we could reduce the power of the Executive within its original limits , and if we had no occasion to apprehend a repetition of abuses , such as we have depicted , still we should have , in the vast expansion // of our territory , in the rapid growth of our population , and in the enormous increase of the resources of the country , and of the rev- enues and expenditures of the government , all calling for the performance of corresponding duties , and imposing corresponding ohligations and responsibilities , ample reasons for magnifying the Presidential office . Washington ruled over three millions of people : the next President of the United States must rule over twenty-five millions at least . Washington presided only over the cis-montane portion of the United States ; a strip of territory comparatively narrow , and lying with . in the St. Croix on the north , and the St. Mary 's on the south : the next President must extend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grande , and from the Atlantic to the Pacific . And Washington , by the influence of his great name and character , held only thirteen States within their proper spheres ; but our next Chief Magistrate must keep no less than thirty-one States true to their position and faithful to the attractions of our glorious Union . We have indulged in this train of remark in order to prepare our readers for a proper estimate of the great crisis before us . Within a brief space of time , the American people are to decide how the Executive department of our government shall be filled and constituted for the period of four years from the fourth of March next . They are to say whether lofty intelligence , unquestionable abilities , unspotted integrity , unalloyed patriotism , generous impulses , a just appreciation of the true interests of the country , and a lively sense of its proper destinies , are to rule the hour , or whether the mediocrity of a mere provincial reputation , and the contractedness of a character whose aims have been directed no higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a free people ; or , in other words , whether WINFIELD SCOTT or FRANKMx PIERCE shall be the next President of the United States . Fortunately , we are relieved from the necessity of entering into any expositions to establish the claims of the former to the respect , the confidence , and the affections of his countrymen . Fortunately , his name , his character , and his public services are as familiar to the millions who throng our territory as " household words . " Fortunately , there is not a bright page of American history ( appertaining to the last forty years ) which does not contain a record of his actions and of his life ; there is not a page from which his great and good name does not flash out in all the effulgence of heroic daring and of consummate statesmanshipa name which is the pride of every true American , and the admiration of the world . We unhesitatingly leave Winfield Scott and his pretensions to the arbitrament of n enlightened public sentiment . We refer his great services , both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderation , sense of justice , firmness , clear discernment , and never-fading sagacity which he has displayed in some of the most difficult positions of civil life , and the vigor , enterprise , skill , fortitude , and unflinching bravery which have ever marked his course in the field  --  to the judgment of a just and generous people . He is before them in all the admirable proportions of a character such as the country has seldom seen , and he and his friends may fearlessly abide the result . But we are constrained to turn to a very different picture ; one which must be viewed by every competent judge with other emotions than those of satisfaction ; one got up and presented to the country by the artists of Democracy iu the earlier days of June ; and the question is whether it is fit to adorn.the walls of the White House . There perhaps never was a political assemblage the results of which were more entirely committed to chance , than the late Democratic National Convention . There was nev6i ' such a complete political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have occupied the first po*tions in the government-between ex-heads of departments , ex-foreign ambassadors , ex-senators , and senators de facto et de lege , and some with all these characters united-all at once , in the twinkling of an eye , Franklin Pierce turned up with the Presidential card in his hands , and then the exclamation instantly burst from thousands of lips , TV/to is Frankun Pierce 9 And well was that question put ; appropriate and just was the astonishment of the nation . We reiterate it-Who is Franklin Pierce ? Where are the evidences of his statesmanship , and where the records of his public services ? We learn , indeed , that lie was several years a member of Congress , first of the House of Representatives , and // afterwards of the Senate ; but what beneficent or useful measure did he propose , advocate , or carry through ? Was there either originality , dibuity , or ability in his course ? Did he display any expansion or liberality of views ? Were his aims high and his purposes noble ? Did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate properly the responsible duties of an American legislator ? On the contrary , we do not hesitate to declare , that there is no where to be found a more barren or even repulsive record than that which exhibits the Congressional career of General Pierce . No where else is there to be found so thoroughly developed all the indications and expressions of low partisanship . He is incessantly found on the mean side of every question ; and if any one will examine ( as we have ) the journals of the two Houses , he will be deeply impressed with this truth . But those records not only reveal great illiberality and contractedness of disposition , but highly perverted views of public affairs . They prove that he belongs to the anti-progressive school of politicians . His is the stand-still , the do-nothing policy . He apparently holds that government is constituted only to take money out of the pockets of the people , and to hand it over to the cormorants of office . The moment any thing beneficent is proposed , any thing adapted to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbles , not to say , faints . There is a lion in the way : the Constitution forbids it , yea , the Constitution ! which , according to a certain class of public men , ever admits what they desire , and is opposed to what they dislike . Can it be possible that such a man is about to be called to the Chief Magistracy of this great country ? Can it be possible that the American people will elect as their President one who was so prejudiced as to vote against granting to the American Colonization Society the privileges of the Hall of the House of Representatives ; who , from a similar feeling , would not concede to citizens of the District of Columbia corporate powers for " benevolent purposes ; " who would not admit the just claims of Mrs. Harrison , widow of the excellent William Henry Harrison , to some consideration at the hands of Congress , and who endeavored to return her penniless to her desolate home ; who would not make the slightest concession to the merchants of the city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not recognize the obligations of the country to those citizens " who were engaged in wars with the Indians subsequent to the Revolution , " nor of " the organized militiamen , mounted militiamen , and rangers , who defended the frontiers during the late war with Great Britain ; " who would not admit the propriety of favoring the hardy pioneers of the West , in the matter of pre*mptive rights , and of a reduction of the price of the public lands ; who has opposed himself strenuously to the policy of fostering the industry of the country ; and who has manifested , on every occasion , an uncompromising hostility to appropriations for harbors and rivers , and to every form of internal improvements ? That he regards with great disfavor any attempt to augment the national wealth , and to make us truly independent , by so arranging duties on imports as to place the loom and the anvil in proximity with the plough and the barrow , appears from a resolution ( the emanation of his own pen ) submitted to the Democratic State Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11th of June , 1846 . Should he therefore be called to the Presidency , we can not for a moment indulge the hope of any modification of the chimerical tariff now in force ; a tariff of universal ad valore ? n duties ; a tariff of constant evasion and incessant fraud , such as was never before found on the pages of the statute-book , and involving a policy every where else repudiated by the civilized world . This act fraught with such incalculable evils , has been recently denounced by Colonel Benton in appropriate terms . Is it fit and proper that one of its avowed advocates , now put forward by the votaries of ( so called ) free trade , should be elevated to the Chief Magistracy , only that we may dismiss every hope of a modification during the next Presidential term ? That he is equally hostile to every form of national improvement , we find evidenced by the journals of the two Houses while he was in Congress , almost page by page . To no purpose does the storm-tossed mariner appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of the rock-bound coast and inaccessible harbors , nor of the perils of our lakes , of our rivers , and of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts  --  to all he turns a deaf earl The wild cries of men , women an 1 // children , about to be enguiphed in the mighty deep , strike on his insensible ear , and appeal to his adamantine heart , in vain . The behests of party can only reach him , and he gives the public safety and the public welfare to the winds ; to the same element to which he consigns life , property , and every thing dear to man But it is not enough that the storm rages , and the waters lash the heavens , so that those who " go down to the sea in ships , " and " do business in great waters , " have " their souls melted " for the want of places of refuge ; hut , according to his sense of duty , the mariner is to be deprived of those beacon lights which have often enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven of safety . Who could expect to acquire , or even to maintain for an instant , a character for generous , lofty and enlightened statesmanship , by votes of opposition to the establishment or maintenance of lights on our coasts l and yet this is exactly what Franklin Pierce did in 1834 , and then again in *837 . Ought not the example of Washington , and of every other great name which has adorned American history , the devoted friends of this indispensable policy , and ought not the uniform practice of the government , and the crying necessities of commerce , to have had some weight with him ? And shall a man so lost to every sense of duty , and so insensible to every dictate of humanity , have the countenance of a free people to light him on the way to the White House ? But though his measures are naught , and his votes mean or detestable , perhaps we may find some redeeming quality in his legislative appeals . Perhaps he was accustomed to rise and address an admiring Senate with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and compactness of a Calhoun , and with all the breadth , solidity , profoundness , and force of a Webster . Perhaps a modern Cicero , or Demosthenes has enchained the attention of a rapt and delighted audience . Surely we must find some where attributes and qualities as the basis of pretensions now urged . But , alas ! the records of Congress speak out the melancholy fact . We defy the world to produce such an example of inanity as is exhibited by the speeches of Franklin Pierce . His topics were e*er of the most inconsiderable character ; his views illiberal , restricted , and unsubstantial ; his illustrations and developments poor and spiritless , and his conclusions often false and illogical . But we wish to do him justice . He was for several sessions profoundly silent , acting upon the sacred injunction , " Let your communications be yea , yea , and nay , nay , for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil . " Whether , if he had made this the general rule , any thing would have been lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example might not have had an influence to economize the public time , and to expedite the pubic business , are questions which we must refer to the judgment of our readers . We do not desire to say one word touching the military career of General Pierce . We are not aware that any one pretends that his qualifications for the Presidency were thereby enhanced , or that he established , while in the field , any peculiar claim to the gratitude of his countrymen . That he was led to embrace , pro tempore , the profession of arms from patriotic impulses , and that he possesses ( attributes common with our people ) courage and firmness , need not be disputed . But if the mere presence of such qualities fits a man for the first executive office in the country , then we have many hundred thousand citizens prepared to enter upon the Chief Magistracy at once . We can find them every where , in every village and hamle* from one of the great seas to the other , from the Canadian to the Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the head of armies , display vast administrative abilities , and evince his qualifications for the highest walks of civil life . This was true of George Washington , and it is equally true of Winfield Scott . But it is only those who have the chief direction in the field that get that sort of training which qualifies men for responsible and difficult civil employments . Those in subordinate situations acquire only military habits , which are to he deprecated rather than otherwise , though we admit that the experience of General Pierce was too brief and too inconsiderable to do him any particular harm . The military pretensions then of our friend are of no more significance than would have been those of any other New-Hampshire lawyer , of fair standing , who had turned soldier without knowing any thing about the soldier 's profession , and then turned lawyer again after an inter- // 393 val so short that he could resume his legal studies at the very point of interrul ) tion . Indeed , we regard the employment of General Pierce in Mexico only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his arrival at Concord he could recur to his briefs and to his authorities ( doubled down in dogs ' ears ) as readily as he would have done after an excursion to the White Mountains or a visit to Saratoga . Nevertheless , it must be admitted that there are authorities which take a more favorable view of the career of General Pierce in Mexico : we have one of them now before us , entitled " Sketches of the Lives of J*anklin Pierce and William R. Kino " published , if we mistake not , by the National Democratic Executive Committee at Washington , and extensively circulated over the country , from which we take the following extract : " In this battle , ( Molino del Rey , ) J. II . Warland , an officer of the army , writes , ( 1847 , ) that the New-England regiment was ordered to take off the dead and wounded and cover the withdrawal of the troops from the field . The duty assigned was an honorable one , and was worthily perfoi'ined . General Pierce led a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy 's cannon , with a degree of courage and daring which has been spoken of with admiration . He narrowly escaped with his life ; several times the six-pounders ranging within a few inches of him , and ploughing the ground by the side of his horse . He continued waving his sword and encouraging his troops till the duty assigned was performed . The cry wasCome on , brave New-England boys ! ' " The same gentleman wrote the lines contain . ing notices of the New-England officers in the army . Of General Pierce he writes : " Break New-England 's lion spirit ! No-not while Pierce can plunge his steed Amid the blazing cannon near it , Wave his bright sword and onward lead . " Shades of Alexander , Hannibal , Scipio , C*sar , Frederick , ( the Great , ) Bonaparte and Washington , hide your diminished heads in presence of the mighty paladin of New-England ! Heavens ! how he mounted to the " imminently deadly breach ; " how he swept over the plains of Mexico ! Surely the world has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Montezumas , and not Scott , Riley , Worth , ilarney , and a few other " small lights " of the old army . But there is a matter in connection with the Mexican war for which we are disposed to hold General Pierce to a serious respon sibility . By accepting a commission at the hands of Mr. Polk , he made himself a party to the unparalleled abuse which the latter committed , flagrante beilo , when he converted appointments to the army into mere spoilr , and conferred commissions of every gi-ade on partisans and political favorites only , to the great prejudice of the accomplished and gallant officers of the old army , and to the infinite detriment of the public service . He conferred on William 0 . Butler and Robert Patterton commissions as MajorsGeneral , and on Thomas Marshall , Joseph Lane , and James Shields , as Brigadiers , to command the volunteer force , neither of whom had been educated to the profession of arms ; but all of them were Democrats , and the appointments were obviously political . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these important situations some of the accomplished and highly educated soldiers of the old army , but are not disposed to make any particular complaint , as the volunteers were in the nature of militia , and perhaps civilians suddenly garnished with epaulettes and swords would do well enough in commanding them . We can not , however , reprehend the conduct of Mr. Polk too much , in proscribing as he did , in this connection at least , one half of the country . Is it to be assumed that there is no patriotism , no bravery , and no devotion to the honor of our flag in the Whig party ? Fortunately , Congress enabled some of our friends to prove directly the reverse . Fortunately , the volunteers were , by law , authoriz*ed to designate their own field and company officers , and thus a considerable number of Whigs obtained access to the field of battle . As Colonels , and in other subordinate situations , they acquitted themselves creditably , and won a higher reputation than Mr. Polk 's Majors-General and Brigadiers . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tennessee , now worthily filling the Gubernatorial office of that State , and to Major Gaines , of Kentucky , also holding a like situation in Oregon , as comparing most favorably with any of Mr. Polk 's partisans and favorites . But though the course of Mr. Polk in this respect may be entitled to some indulgence in consideration of the character of the force , yet what are we to think of his conduct on the occasion of the increase of the regular army by the addition of ten new regiments ? // Is it not obvious that ho was bound by every rule of justice and every dictate of propriety to recognize.the claims of men who had consecrated their whole lives to their country ; of men who had been thoroughly trained to arms , and who had been present on every battle-field , from the opening of the last war with Great Britain down to that of Mexico ? But we are safe , at any rate , in insisting that he should have paid some attention to those who were then in the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palina , and at Monterey . They were , however , all of them remorselessly set aside and passed over , He appointed Pillow and Quitman Majors-General , and Pierce , Cadwallader , Gushing , and Price , Brigadiers ; and thus enabled the two former to command every officer in the regular army except Majors-General Scott , Gaines , Jesup , and Taylor , and the four latter all of those gallant officers who had obtained imperishable renown in conflicts with the enemy , from 1811 to 1847 . Among some of those superseded by these political Brigadiers were Colonels Bankhead , Totten , Riley , Harney , Churchill , Garland , Childs , Belknap , Paine , and Clark , veterans of great merit , whose scarred front bore incessant testimony to their heroism , and have been from that day to this remonstrating against the indignity offered them by Mr. Polk . And , what is a little curious , these men , so suddenly and so unaccountably elevated above such exalted worth , were all lawyers , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why could not Mr. Polk discover some fitness in other walks of civil life ? He should have recollected that Warren , who fell on Bunker Hill , and Mercer at Trenton , were both physicians . One would suppose that there might have been found among the millions who handle the plough or the hammer at least one individual cj*ite equal to his democratic lawyers ; or did he suppose that chopping logic in court-houses alone fitted a man for chopping off , secundeim arten* , heads , arms , &amp;c. , on battle-fields ? But how did the lawyer-Generals manage on their arrival in Mexico ? It has been said " there is no royal road to geometry ; " so we say there is no democratic highway by which small politicians can ascend to a knowledge of strategy , and other branches of the art of war . Of this truth Majors-General Pillow and Quitman , and Brigadiers Pierce , Cadwallader , Gushing , and Price , seemed to have had a lively sense , for they immediately called around them some of the most accomplished officers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point , who thus in effect became tire Majors-General and Brigadiers , though the words of authority emanated from democratic lips . The merest dunce could do pretty well under such circumstances , though , when the nominal superior took the responsibility unaided , he would uniformly make a legitimate display of himself-cs witness the ditch on the wrong side I But We must accord to General Pierce one merit : having discovered his unfitness for the situation in which he had been so unadvisedly placed , he threw up his commission before the war was over , and returned to New-Hampshire to resume once more the practice of the law . We should not do our duty as faithful journalists , and as watchful guardians of the public interests , if we did not reprobate this conduct in Mr. Polk , and hold it up to the country as a prostitution alike unprecedented and indefensible . Mr. Pierce was a party to that prostitution ; he was a party to the enormous injustice done to the g*allant officers of the old army , and to the no less enormous outrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our armies and the honor of our flag . What was the response of General Scott , when it was proposed by Mr. Polk and his administration , after the deeds of Palo Alto , Resaca de la Palma , and Monterey , to send him to Northern Mexico to take the chief command of our forces there out of the hands of General Taylor ? He replied , it was contrary to military etiquette to supersede a successful General in the field without sending with the superior officer large reinforcements . Besides , he a*4ded , the proposed measure would do great injustice to General Taylor . He therefore declined the proffered honor . Had General Pierce possessed a similar delicacy and sense of propriety , he would have remained at home , occupied with his briefs and his law-books . But an attempt is now made to promo* him in civil life ( as in case of the Mexican war ) over merit infinitely superior to his own . Has he considered now , as he should have done then , whether he is really qualified for the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , may we not anticipate another resignation , and another return to law business at Concord ? However , we can make no such supposition , for the American people will not do as Mr. Polk did ; - they will not place inferiority , inexperience , and comparative obscurity above all that is great , noble and brilliant in American history . Besides , we shrewdly suspect they will be quite **nWilling to become parties to the many impostures which the elevation of Franklin Pierce to the Presidency would sanction and involve . They will be unwilling to become parties to the imposture of the Democratic platform , of which it has been truly said thai it is made up wholly of " unmeaning generalities , obvious truisms , doubtful phrases , cant terms , fake premises , illogical conclusions , impudent pretensions , by-gone controversies , uniform evasions of all the living matters of dispute between the two great parties , and a succession of cold , forbidding negations on the exercise of such powers and the adoption of such measures as are indispensable to our country 's welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the imposture of acceptance of such a platform by General Pierce , " because the principles it embraced commanded the approbation of his judgment , and with them there had been no word or act of his life in conflict , " when a half dozen Philadelphia lawyers , with all their shrewdness and sagacity , could not discern the meaning either of the platform or General Pierce ; - they will not make themselves parties to the imposture of the anti-republican two-thirds rule adopted by the Democratic Convention , which enabled a small faction of disunionists and secessionists in that body to force the nomination of Pierce and King , and then to go before the country and exclaim , boastingly , " We shall not be easily driven from the ticket of our creation and choice ; " - they will not become parties to the imposture long attempted to be practised by the New-Hampshire Democracy , of who*m Franklin Pierce is the Head and Front , in holding themselves up at Washington as entertaining broad , liberal , and truly national views , while at Concord they have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inculcated doctrines incompatible with the plain import of the Constitution , the peace of the country , and the maintenance of the Union for a single day ; - they will not make themselves parties to the imposture exhibited by a coalition of every variety of character " black spirits and white , red spirits and grey " - of men entertaining views and purposes , and cherishing principles , totally irreconcilable , who have sacrificed their consistency and their self-respect for place and power , and are banded together by the " cohesive attraction of the public plunder ; " - they will not make themselves parties to the imposture involved in the torrent of detraction and abuse poured out by the sham Democracy on the devoted head of Winfleld Scott , who has committed no other offense than permitting his name to be used by his grateful countrymen for the Presidential office ; - nor will they be willing to become parties to an imposture more monstrous than any other , that of seeking to elevate such a man as Franklin Pierce to the Chief Magistracy of this great Republic , setting aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own party , and casting into oblivion , if not contempt , the services of his great competitor , whose name will be revered to the end of time . Far be it from us to indulge an anticipation which would reflect dishonor on the American people . On the contrary , we are permitted to turn to realities apparently just before us , which must cheer and animate every patriot 's heart . We are permitted to believe that the time has not arrived when a great public benefactor shall have served his country in vain ' . It is obvious that an enlightened public sentiment is thoroughly aroused , and hosts of freemen are every xvhere gathering , resolutely determined to assert the dignity of our government , and to vindicate the honor of free institutions . Already the patriotic and devoted columns of the " Empire State " and the " Keystone State " are in line , and the equally patriotic and devoted column of the " Buckeye . State " is advancing , with rapid strides , to their support ; every where , North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty are in dense array , and prepared to rush forth " conquerin* and to conquer . " Soon one universal acclaim from millions of freemen will call Winfleld Scott to the head of the government , a position which he has richly earned , and then , in all the impressiveness of his noble person , and in all the dignity of his lofty character , he will move on to the White House as he did to the Plaza of Mexico , bearing for a commission the generous confidence of a great and free people .
