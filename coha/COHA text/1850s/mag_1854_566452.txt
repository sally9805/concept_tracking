ART . VIJ. - PREACIIING THE GOSPEL , THE INSTRUMENT OF THE WORLD 'S CONVERSION . " Preaching the Gospel , the Divine Instrumentality for the Conversion of the World . " A Special Report , submitted by the Prudential Committee of the A. B. C. F. IMI . to the Board , at their late meeting at Hartford , Conn . WE are pleased with this Report . It touches the right point , strikes the right chord . We are glad the attention both of the ministry and churches has been called , at the present juncture , to the subject of which it treats . The fact that preaching is the great instrumentality , divinely appointed , for disseminating and impressing evangelical truth , we are apprehensive , needs reaffirming , if not in the reason , at least in the affections of God 's people . The tendency of the times is to depreciate its value , to bring it down to a level with agencies of human devising . We think the Report , therefore , extremely opportune , and rejoice in its presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earnest discussion it evoked , and in its final harmonious adoption . May its seed be dispersed afar , and produce an abundant harvest . It is temperate in expression , sober and candid in argument , catholic in spirit , and well fitted to impress a thoughtful mind . While it represents preaching as the prime Scriptural agency for the world 's conversion , it does not exclude other agencies which times and circumstances may call into action . While it admits that " art , commerce , science , literature , education , the printed page , and wholesdme laws , are by no means to be undervalued or neglected , " yet it very truthfully affirms , that these sustain relations to the divinely appointed instrumentality , " wholly subordinate and subsidiary , " and that preaching , oral instruction , is the grand engine which , under God , is destined to move forward the train , carrying the good news of salvation around the world . This was the main instrumentality of the early founders of Christianity . Christ , the great leader and exemplar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paul , all the Apostles , preached . These latter were the first missionaries to Gentile nations ; and when they entered an unevangelized country , they did not publish manifestos , send forth circular letters , establish schools , foment political reforms ; they simply preached . They preached the Gospel , not civil law , nor science , // nor philosophy , nor mere morality , but the free offer of pardon to the guilty , and justification by faith in the Redeemer 's merits . Their simple aim was the salvation of the soul ; the union of men " dead in sin " to Christ " our life ; " and they proclaimed those truths which alone are fitted , in the economy of grace , to effect their desired end . The precepts of the second table of the law , dissevered , or not represented as drawing their life from the first , never convert men . Says Dr. Ball , an excellent missionary recently returned from China , " the Chinese well understand relative or moral duties ; all the commands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by parents and teachers to children , are variously inculcated in after life , and enforced by the most appalling threatenings of future woe . " And yet that whole nation , though highly refined and cultivated in the elegaicies of life , are sunk in the lowest depths of idolatry . " I therefore , " he adds , " in agreement with a favorite maxim of theirs , Strike at the root , ' insist little in my preaching on the duties of man to man , but hold up mainly the holy character of God , our obligations to love and serve him , our lost condition , and salvation by the blood of Christ . " This , we are persuaded , must also be the special theme of all successful missionaries of the cross . They must direct the attention of their hearers to God , " God , who is in Christ reconciling the world unto himself . " Then the moral virtues will spring up spontaneously , covering the desert with verdure and fruit . If it be thought , however , that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will not debate the point ; we only affirm that their claims must be inculcated through our obligations to God , and obedienc* to them enforced through a sanctified heart Besides , as exhibitions of the moral dut*s alone are entirely inefficacious in the conversion of men , so the unfolding of God 's character and claims , dissevered from Christ , the great Mediator , is equally unproductive of gracious affections . Thus God in Christ , and the truths revolving around this radiant centre , the missionary must unweariedly proclaim . While he neglects riot other instrumentalities , preaching , preaching the Gospel , salvation by the blood of Immanuel , attended by the Spirit 's power , must be his chief reliance . The more nearly he follows the Apostolic model , conformed to times and emergencies , the greater the success he may justly anticipate . But preaching the Gospel , oral inculcation of evangelical truth , is the prime instrumentality in turning men from sin to holiness , as well at home as abroad . It is that alone which can claim the distinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every field of Christian enterprise , take precedence of all other agencies . It is with special reference to the home department of ministerial labor we now propose to discuss the subj*ct of the Report . We believe the truth it contains fundamental in administering the Gospel , and one that can not fail to diffuse a more genial and healthful atmosphere wherever received . We would therefore take advantage of the interest awakened in the subject , by its recent discussion at Hartford , to consider the question , how the efficacy of the ministry in our own borders can be best developed . It is greatly feared that the ministry is not such an engine of power in our churches as formerly ; or that , as other instrumentalities have been brought into more active operation , this has not retained its own commanding position-its relative elevation in the estimation of God 's people . Certain are we that it is far from being as effective as it is capable of becoming . Unquestionably it has elements of power which have seldom , perhaps never , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , in the providence of God , destined to demolish the thrones and overthrow the institutions of iniquity throughout the world . Now , how can these capabilities of the Christian ministry be best developed ? How can it be made most effecti*re in the conversion of sinners , in the moral and social amelioration of men ? No questions of more vital interest can , at the present period , be brought to the consideration of the American churches ; for nothing is more manifest than that the resources of the pulpit are not only not now fully drawn out or applied , but that in the present state of opinion , and in the present condition of the churches , its success is greatly hindered . It is a proposition not far from self-evident , that an earnest , spiritual church will ensure an earnest , spiritual ministry . Her own fire of love and zeal will soon communicate itself to the pastor ; he will either kindle up with the same flame , or flee as from an uncongenial element . To draw out , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry in our churches , is mainly the work of the churches themselves ; a task which may easily be accomplished , will they but acknowledge , and cheerfully act upon , a few plain Scriptural principles . The point to which we would first direct attention is this ; the power of the Christian ministry is not a single energy , but a combination of influences . Nor is it developed by any one circumstance or efficient cause , but by several distinct , and yet coadjutant agents , as the capacity of a field to produce a plentiful harvest lies not alone in the fertility of the soil , but in // a variety of natural causes aiding and working with it . The richness of the ground may be great , and yet , without suitable proportions of sunlight and warmth , air and rain , the best cultivation will produce little ; so , though the heat and moisture may be abundant , while the soil contains not the legitimate properties , the laborer toils in vain . All the different agents must unite their energies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itselS nor is it unfolded by a selfdetermined force . It is chiefly brought out by its divinely appointed adjuncts . The ministry may be able , learned , eloquent , accomplished , even piously devoted to its solemn work , and still feeble to effect its great object  --  the sanctification and final salvation of the soul . The church and people are , in a sense , the depositaries of the pulpit 's power . In other words , it is , in a degree , latent till brought out by their spirituality , prayers , and activity , attended by the Spirit 's influences , as the potency of powder sleeps in itself till awakened by the kindling spark ; then , and only then , it hurls the ball or rives the rock . Many excellent treatises have recently been written on the efficacy of the Gospel ministry ; muchhas been said both to arouse the public to the importance of training able , well educated , and eloquent heralds of salvation , and to kindle the zeal and deepen the piety of the latter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , and success has , in a measure , attended these efforts . But while good may have been done , evil , it is feared , has accompanied the good . Certainly , people have become of late rather fastidious critics of sermons , than teachable or devout hearers of the Word . Light may have been shed , but through this increased light have individual conversions become more frequent , revivals more thorough , or the churches more holy ? We believe not ; and may not the hindrances , still unremoved , lie partly in the fact , that the power , at least of the stated ministry , has not been shown with sufficient clearness , nor felt by the churches with sufficient intensity , to be dependent for its full development on causes which , while lying out itself , are , nevertheless , indiq*ensable coagencies ; that , in or er to its highest success , not only must its own individual capacity be exerted , but the individual capacities of its divinely assigned assistants must work with it . This is a thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration . Their present condition and the future prosperity of Christ 's kingdom alike demand it . May it find its way to the consciences , and burn in the hearts of all . Another principle which must be acknowledged and acted upon , is the divine authority and spiritual character of the // Christian ministry . Every body of men needs an authorized head ; ignorance needs enlightening , depravity restraining , zeal regulating . This is as true of the church as of other organizations . Hence Christ appointed an order of men to preside over , instruct , and admonish his churches , and to proclaim salvation to a perishing world . For this purpose he chose twelve as his peculiar companions while on earth , taught and qualified them for their work , and when he went up to the mediatorial throne , installed them in their office , bequeathing its blessings as a perpetual legacy to his churches , saying , " Go ye , and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you always , even unto the end of the world . " Paul also alludes to the same fact : - " When he ascended up on high  --  and gave gifts unto men-He gave some apostles , and some prophets , and some evano'elists , and some pastors and teachers , for the perfecting of the saints , for the work of the ministry , for the edifying of the body of Christ . " The Gospel ministry is thus well denominated an " Ascension Gift . " They who fill the office are authorized to oversee and instruct the churches in Christ 's place ; so that they can say , " We are ambassadors for Christ , as though God did beseech you by us , we pray you in Christ 's stead , be ye reconciled to God . " Soon after our Lord 's departure , Peter , with the eleven , commenced the work , heralding forth the Gospel , and gathering the churches , while God most signally set his seal to his own institutions . The ministry , as a distinct order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a variety of passages demonstrating that it is of Divine appointment . We find the Apostles ordaining overseers , bishops , elders , or pastors , in the churches they organized . " When they " ( Paul and Barnabas ) " had ordained them elders in every church , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord . " Paul says to the elders of Ephesus , " Take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made , *Os ' *-* appointed , constituted , you overseers , to feed the church of God . " The same Apostle also affirms : - " And all things are of God , who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ , and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation . " " And say to Archippus , Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord , that thou fulfill it . " These are enough to show that the Christian ministry , overseeing and instructing the churches , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's appointmen.t . The final cause of this appointment is also as explicitly stated Paul at one time affirming it to be " the perfecting of the // saints , " - " the edifying of the body of Christ ; till we all come in the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ . " The end or design of Paul 's commission as a preacher is substantially the end or design of every minister . Christ says to him , " I have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee ; delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles , unto whom now I send thee , to open their eyes , and to turn them from darkness to light , and from the power of Satan unto God , that they may receive forgiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by faith that is in me . " Thus the final cause of the appointment of the ministerial order is the conversion of men , the illumination of the world through the light of the Cross . The truth that the Christian ministry is an institution of God , and is the grand instrumentality by which he has designed to convert the world , to enlarge , confirm , and purify the churches , is the basis of all successful efforts to increase its efficacy . It is the corner-stone on which all arguments instituted for this end , must be erected . For very much in proportion as it is attempted to secularize the ministerial office , strip it of its sacred character , and divert it from its spiritual end , its hold on the conscience is weakened . The remark too often made , and with no good intent , " ministers are but men , " has done , and is doing , in certain quarters , immense injury . Besides it is not the whole truth . Ministers are , officially , more than men ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecrated to the solemn work of proclaiming his Gospel ; and should be esteemed as such . This is therefore a truth which the community need thoroughly to understand , and deeply feel . It should be kept distinctly in mind , both in setting apart men to the responsible trust , and in hearing the word of life from their lips . It should constitute the central star in that constellation of truths to be inscribed on the banner of the church , as she goes forth to achieve her glorious victories . very little can be done towards increasing or eliciting the power of the ministry , without giving it its true position . Its value and authority must be justly estimated . It must form the rallying point of all who would enlist in legitimate efforts to ameliorate the condition of man . The religious Pre8s-religious books , periodicals , tracts , and colporteurs-cannot take the place ofthis holy office . These have their more retired , though honored sphere ; and there they // should be left to work out their silent and life-giving influence . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulpit , however pure his intentions , will but retard the progress of the Redeemer 's kingdom . It would be changing the order of things ; like endeavoring to make some small wheel in a machine perform the work of that to which the main power is applied . This agrees with the sentiment of the Report , " For the preaching of the Gospel , in the judgment of the Committee , there is , there can be no substitute . The proclamation of mercy , through atoning blood , is the heaven-appointed agency which has no equal , no compeer , no partner in the throne . " The intelligent , living voice , giving utterance to sentiments and feelings working in one human breast , is an organ to awaken thoughts and affections in the breast of another , peculiarly efficacious . There is something in its very tones , aroused by thought and warmed with emotion , aside from the truth conveyed , which vibrates on the inmost fibres of the soul ; and when burdened with God 's own message , either of denunciation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the will . But what ensures the superior and perpetuated power of the voice , in advancing the case of human improvement and evangelization , is the fact that it is the grand instrument designated by Christ to quicken the " dead in sin " to a life of holiness . When Christ chose and sent forth his disciples , their commission was , " Go and preach , " x*g*irsL2-e , cry as a herald , or proclaim as a herald , " the kingdom of heaven is at hand . " When giving them his last words of instruction just before he ascended , he said , " Go ye into all the world , and " x*g*c*s , herald forth " theGospelto every creature . " Paul , in his charge to Timothy , says , " Preach , " *c*p*gov " the word . " In relation to his own peculiar work , he always says , " Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach , " *cty*sXi*so*i , to announce as a messenger , " the Gospel . " " For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them that perish , foolishness . " Hence , in speaking of the . success of the Gospel , he says , " It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching , xu*p*m* ,  --  by the simple means of proclaiming as a herald , " to save them that believe . " - This is enough to show that the chief design of the Christian Ministry is the preaching , heralding forth the truths of the Gospel , and this position is sustained by the Report . " There are three words used by the inspired penman in relation to this subject . They are , as is well known , * *c*p6a*r&amp;. * , xi*ur*-all of one root . The first signifies a herald , a public crier , one who makes proclamation of the decree or message // untrusted to him ; the second , to act the herald , to make public , oral proclamation ; the third means the thing uttered , the announcement made , whatever it may be . The classic use of these words accords with that of the scriptures . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a clear reference to a public , oral proclamation . When the word x*ig*&amp;* has relation to Christ , John the Baptist , the Apostles , Prophets , or any duly authorized teachers of religion , the translators of the English Bible have rendered it by the word to preach . ' In the sense of the New Testament , then , to preach the Gospel , ' is to make oral and public proclamation of it . No other sense of the word or phrase is known to the Christian Scriptures . The commission , therefore , is this ; Go ye into all the world , and make oral proclamation of the glad tidings to every creature . ' In so doing , Lo , I am with you always . ' " Thus the mandates of Sinai , and the tragic story of Calvary , must ring forth in the musical yet stirring tones of the human voice , thrilling on the ear , winning and awakening attention , touching some of the strongest principles of human nature ,  - -  those tendencies of mind , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men almost universally acknowledge must be addressed , in order to facilitate success . In such emergencies the cry always is , " The ear  --  the ear must be gained . " Hence , at the present day , when so much is attempted by popular movements , mass meetings and public lectures are thought indispensable . In political or social reforms , no organ of influence conveying truth , awakening thought , moving the heart , and calling forth action , is deemed more powerful than the human voice . Consequently , if it be said there is less need of preaching the word at this day , when religious books and periodicals are flooding the land , than formerly , when there were fewer books and fewer readers , we find in this felt necessity and corresponding practice a sufficient refutation . For if the community are informed on any subject , it is on the subject of general politics , and those matters of social improvement and common concernment , which the press daily pours forth , constituting the chief intellectual food of the million ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made effective , the trumpet tones of the human voice are thought indispensable . In fact , the information gained by reading is just the preparative needed to render public addresses most entertaining and useful . Ignorance among the masses has been one of the great obstacles to the preaching of the Gospel in ages past ; they being unqualified to understand the discussion of a subject in its principles and // logical bearings ; and as the truth but feebly grasped the intellect , it but slightly moved the heart . Besides , Gospel preaching , like the reading of the Scriptures , is to the rightly disposed always something fresh , something instructive and edifying ; even though the subject discussed in the desk has been the theme of private perusal just before entering the sanctuary . So that the reading of religious books and periodicals only qualifies for greater profiting by the preaching of the Gospel ; and by no means supersedes it . The Press is not antagonistic to the Pulpit ; only the latter ipust take the lead , and the former assume the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is , however , the Minister 's duty not only to proclaim the Gospel to the great congregation , but to gain the private ear ; not only to startle with the passionate tones of popular eloquence , but to convince and win in social converse . His mind is to wrestle with individual mind , He is to address men in the calm seclusion of home , where truth can be pressed as with the point of a diamond on the individual conscience and heart . As in ancient warfare , so destructive to life , he must engage in personal conflict with sword and shield , haul to hand . Especially is it his duty to come into personal communion with the sick , the bereaved , the disappointed , as well as with those in circumstances of peculiar joy and thanksgiving ,  --  when the mind is most susceptible to impression . Thus God has placed the Christian Ministry in the very point where meet the strongest muscles and most susceptible nerves of humanity-in that point , which , when moved , moves the whole . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart - which is to send the life-blood in healthful flow to the extremities . It is then of the greatest moment that the Christian Ministry be sustained , encouraged , helped forward in its life-giving and life-diffusing work ; as important as the end for #hich the Church was organized  --  the glory of Christ in the progress of the redemption scheme ; as important as the soul is valuable ; as heaven is glorious . On the other hand , to cripple its energies , or retard its movements , is most hurtful to man 's highest interest both here and hereafter . It is blocking the wheel which moves the whole moral machinery of our world ; it is laying the palsying hand on the heart , and curdling its lifecurrent ; it is striking the envenomed tooth into the very vitals . To aid it is to save souls  --  to suffuse the bloom of health over the face of the Church . To hinder it is to send through every vein the chills of spiritual death . It is most unhallowed work ; // which some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles predominate , dare to do ; they even exult in their success ; but let them remember it will be fearful work , and fearful success to review at the judgment . Another point which deserves consideration is this ; that in the economy of means which God has instituted for carrying on the kingdom of Christ , he has given the Ministry a specific place , appointed for it a . *peciflc work ; and it must be leftto move freely in that place and to do that work . Its influence can be augmented only by codperating in God 's plan respecting it , - by assisting it in its own sphere , and removing obstructions . Some , we know , would throw it from its lofty pedestal , and elevate something less divine in its room . But we should remember that God 's method of working is always the wisest and most effective . We , in our pride , may call its wisdom in question ; in an unholy zeal we may demand more rapid progress ; but the Christian heart , with the simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Teacher 's directions , and leave results with him . Now he has given to his Church its peculiar organization ; he has fixed every spring and wheelall its associated agencies moving in conjunction . It is perfect in its kind ; the best that could be devised to accomplish the end designed ,  --  the world 's purification and restoration to the Paradisaical state , under that glorious Prince who is to stand at the latter day on the earth . To carry forward this stu p endous enterprise , no new organization nor re-construction of the old one is needed or admissible . To attempt to modify or improve it will but cause friction or stoppage of some of its parts , and must be exceedingly offensive to God . It would be the sin of Uzzah , for which he was struck dead before the Lord . In this organiz*ition , devised by Infinite Wisdom , and so perfect in all its parts , the Ministry is placed , as we have seen , at the seat of life ; and that position we must be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its power be unfolded . Our assertion is not mere theory . This beautiful system of moral means embodied in the Gospel , with the Ministry at the centre , was first set in motion on theday of Pentecost , and we all know its glorious results-three thousand souls were converted to Christ . This manifestation may properly be called the efficacy of the Ministry , because this is the constituted organ through which the efficacy of the Church chiefly manifests itself , i. e. the spirituality , activity , and zeal of the Church is chiefly felt in or through the Ministry . It was so on the above occasion , and it ever will be so when the Church moves forward in her might . The power of the Ministry always rises or // falls with the devotedness of God 's people . Indeed we consider the Pentecostal scene mainly designed as a specimen of the efficacy of the Ministry of reconciliation , when attended by all its associated aids and adjuncts . We can not believe it was designed as the greatest result which the Christian Ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the disciples and all succeeding generations , that when occupying its central position , attended by all its essential adjuncts , it has a mighty potency to demolish the strongholds of sin ; and thereby to give us entire confidence in its capacities of accomplishing the end designed , however difficult to human view ; provided they who are chosen to be co-workers with Christ and consequently with his heralds are but faithful . This is the essential thing . And let it never be forgotten among the lessons taught us in the remarkable scene of the Pentecost , that this is by no means the least ; the success of the Ministry depends mainly on this conjunctive influence . To preserve life and health in the animal economy , the veins and arteries must do their part as well as the heart ; if there is any disseverment or disarrangement here , health is gone , and life is soon extinct . In seeking any chemical result , all the necessary ingredients must be present and properly combined ; otherwise there will be a failure . So all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . A single word at this point on the character of the Ministry the Churches are called upon to sustain and aid . The Pastor must be a holy man of God , like David modeled after the Divine mind . As he is an ambassador for Christ , he should possess his spirit , be impressed with a sense of the solemnity , almost awfulness of his position as Christ 's representative on earth , to unfold the glory of God and the holiness of his law , to show sinners their ruin and point them to his atoning blood . He must enter the Ministry actuated purely by love to Christ and the souls of perishing men ; not from a desire of wealth , a love of domestic ease , or with the view of obtaining a more respectable rank in society or more extensive honors ; on the contrary , he should be of a lowly disposition , possessed of a willingness to suffer reproach , and if need be , poverty in the cause of his Master . He must have a spirit to sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing not his own , but the things that are Jesus Christ 's ; loving his kingdom more than father or mother , wife or children , brethren or sisters , yea , than his own life also . There must be this entire divestment of self . Christ demands it of all his disciples ; and surely his Ministers are not exempted from the general claim . They must // be imbued with the Apostolic spirit-with the boldness and self-sacrifice of Peter on the day of Pentecost-of Stephen when surrounded by his mnrderers ; - actuated by the devotedness , and calm deliberate purpose of Paul , when he said to the elders of Ephesus , " The Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions abide me . But none of these things move me , neither count I my life dear unto myself , so thatli might finish my course with joy , and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus . " Ambassadors for Christ must be willing to be baptized with the baptism He was baptized with , if circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry ; and do the Churches in our age need any other ? No . Nor does Christ , as he remembers his own unutterable sorrows , desire other than those imbued with his own spirit to be coadjutors with himself in saving a world of sinners . Such a faithful , godly , self-renouncing Ministry , however contrary to the dictates of the depraved ear , and however uncomfortable to the cold , worldly Christian , is such a Ministry as the Churches and Parishes need ; and such as they are called upon to stand by , heartily to coöperate with , and support . But to return . The great question then before us , how can the full power of the Christian Ministry be drawn out , and its highest success secured , may be answered in a single word ; by cooperation . Cordial , earnest , and persevering cooperation on the part of the Church and Parish will draw forth , so far as human agency is concerned , the full power of the sacred office . Just this , and nothing more , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything is depending on this . Pastors and people must stand shoulder to shoulder ; they must keep exact stroke on the anvil ; they must pull like toiling sailors , at the beat of the same tune , so that no strength will be wasted . The importance of cooperation , both in the social and religious world , is , however , to some extent understood . If intemperance , sabbath violation , licentiousness , international war , oppression , gambling , or profanity , is to be put down or suppressed , there must be , it is thought , a combination of forces . All the different branches of the Church are earnestly besought to lay aside their minor differences , and unite their efforts in eradicating idolatry , superstition , and crime from the earth ; in overthrowing every institution blighting to human ' weal and fraught with human woe . The order of the day is to move forward in solid squares . That " union is strength " is both soundly philosophical and scriptural . But there is one consideration demanding , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The // economy of nature and Providence is to work from the centre outward . The greatest developments in the physical world are from small points . The vegetable kingdom , which sways its sceptre over the summer fields , spreading them with beauty , springs from minute seeds or germs . The crystal always forms itself around a central point . If the heart of the tree is sound and replete with vital energy , wounds on the exterior rind will soon be repaired or overgrown , and the whole assume an aspect of life ; but if the heart be rotten , no vigor in the external part can restore it . There is no law in nature that works from the without to the within . The centre is never the last part formed . It is so iu the operations of grace . It is first the heart and then the life . This law of working from centres outwardfrom principles to practice-runs through the economy of Providence . Now , carrying this principle into the religious world , we affirm that there is no bond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church ; for this will form a bond of union between the individual members . The separate churches* are the little points of light from which the radiance constituting the glory of the whole visible Church , is emitted . The union of the different denominations must be an outflow from the covenant love of the single churches . It is a contradiction to profess to love the members of other Churches , while those whom we have solemnly covenanted to love are hated or regarded with indifference ; and be it remembered , that the Pastor is bound by covenant to love his flock , and they are bound by covenant to love him . Hence the glorious enterprise of the union of different denominations , which many have so much at heart , must be formed , like a mighty crystal which is to flash its light over the world , around this nucleus . This consideration , amid all the demands for union between the different sects , is not felt as it should be . This is the previous question to be discussed ; the prior " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of Christians depends entirely on the life and spirit of the individual Churches . A denomination , however extensively active , however desirous of cooperating with others in the great work of Christian reform , which cherishes not eternal peace , which is deficient in a spiritual life , a holy love uniting Pastor and people in the great work of the Gospel ministry , is consuming with inward disease ; it stands like an oak , with wide-spread branches covered with beautiful foliage , while its heart is hollow , and decay is at work , the ravages of which no external union with foreign bodies will ever repair . The fact is that the Churches of Christ at the present mo // ment are suffering for want of concord in their own borders ; of more codperation between the under shepherds and their flocks . We have no reason to expect the ushering in of the latter day glory , so long as there is so much division among Christians united in the same covenant bonds ; so long as there is so much fault-finding and quarreling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of Zion , the cry of reform , of united moral aggression , soun ho low like the voice that comes ringing up from the mouth of the sepulchre , declaring , that not the living , but the dead are there . Would one then see the light of salvation going forth , dissipating the darkness of cruel habitations ; would one dry up the bloody and fiery streams of intemperance , of war , of oppression ; smother the fires of superstition ; grind to dust the gods of idolatry , and crush her altars ; let him , after setting his own heart right , codperate earnestly and cordially with the man of God whom the Holy G host has made his overseer . The Church may , with reason , rest in the assurance that she can not be the burning and shining light illuminating the nations , while this ulcer is preying on her vitals . Every stream will be polluted with its source . War and peace are antagonistic ; a spirit of Christian unity can not go forth from the individual warring churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . iNot that by these remarks we would hush the cry so generally heard for harmony and codperation between the different sects of Christians ; by no means ; let it rise higher and higher ; but let us demand more earnestly first union at the heart , the centre ; between Pastors and their flocks , welding those golden bonds of covenant obligation , often too recklessly broken . Then , with more consistency , may we demand union and codperation between the various evangelical denominations . Thus , each division in God 's host being at peace with itself , and in harmony with the whole , all may move forward in one solid phalanx , invading the empire of sin . But to expect efficiently to unite the different evangelical churches together for the conquest of the world to Christ , without attending to this interior harmony , is to expect that an army will be m.ighty to conquer under some distinguished commandant , when each individual company is at war with its captain ; yea , soldier at war with soldier . We may , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his high places , to bring about that period when the wolf and the lamb shall feed together , and the love of Christ shall spread its dove-like wing over all the earth , that he will begin by kindling this spirit in the central radiating points ; // that a new splendor will first flash up here , suffusing the surrounding region like the orange glow in the east preceding the sun . We may expect that the members of separate churches will first be found eo*5perating with one another , in the great cause of their common salvation , and with their Pastors ; then with neighboring churches and neighboring Pastors , till all are united in one . This ( allowing for some degree of play for reflex action from without ) must be substantially the process . For he who dislikes his brother , whom he has solemnly covenauted , with the Father , Son , and Holy Ghost , to love , or his Pastor , whom he is required to love for his work 's sake , can not be supposed to have Christian affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdity . But he who loves his Christian Pastor and the brethren of the church with whom he is in covenant with the affection kindled by the Holy Ghost , may encircle all who love our Lord Jesus Christ in the arms of the same affection . The embryo contention can never grow , by any development , into the full stature of peace . Thus we think it may be proved by demonstration , that no co*3peration in the religious world is so important as that between the Pastor and his flock ; for by no other means can spiritual life be preserved and augmented in the individual church es . Open opposition to a faithful minister , cr a refusal to be his fellow-helper in the work of bringing men to repentance , and edifying the body of Christ , is almost inevitably blighting to earnest piety . We believe this a point to which all , who fear God and desire the spread of his kingdom , must turn their attention . It is a giant obstacle in the way of salvation . We can not expect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ministry is virtually the power of the Church , and the power of the ministry depends , under God , on her steadfast , and wakeful , and affectionate cooperation . Would that every one might realize this truth , that his permanent influence on the salvation of man will be very much in proportion to his cooperation with his faithful Pastor and teacher . Now in order to an intelligent coöperation , there must be an understanding of its appropriate Gospel grounds , and in what it practically consists . The members of our churches should make this topic a matter of conscientious study ; endeavor accurately to ascertain their precise relations and obligations to him who has been divinely set apart as their public religious teacher . We apprehend that this subject is not understood as it should be . True , there are certain traditional ideas floating in the community in rela // tion to the treatment which a minister should receive from his people ; but we doubt whether the present generation have ever examined this subject for themselves . Hence , having no clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codperation is based , they have very generally begun to regard itas urere prejudice ; and one , therefore , which a free , independent mind may reject at pleasure . Now , if there are certain Gospel principles on this subject , they need to be ascertained , especially when there is so much commotion of opinion and excitement of passion . At the present day there is no respect for traditional ideas , as such , on any subject . The fact that our fathers acted or believed thus and so , is no law for their descendants . It is rather a reason for contrary opinions and a contrary course . Men disdain now to pay deference to the conscientious convictions and views of those who nursed their infancy and guided their youth . Consequently , not having examined this subject for themselves , and believing that all these notions demanding kind and respectful treatment of a minister are traditional rather than spiritual , people feel at liberty to use him as passion or prejudice dictates ; a prolific source of evil in our churches . Hence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of well defined ideas of the principles of the Gospel on this subject . 2here are probably two causes which have prevented an investigation of this topic , equally earnest and thorough as that with which other subjects have been scrutinized . 1 . n consequence of its being a subject so intimately relating to themselves , ministers have felt a delicacy in pressing it upon the attention of their hearers . And a Gospel truth neglected in the pulpit , is usually forgotten in the churches . But there should be no more delicacy in presenting this subject modestly and unassumingly , than in presenting any other scriptural topic ; for it is equally a part of the counsel of God . Hence , if ministers do not receive all that kindness , sympathy , and respect , which is so justly their due , it may be in a measure the fruit of their own neglect of duty . 2 . It may not be uncharitable to fear that some have neglected the investigation of this subject , because they have not desired to understand it . They may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to press it at whatever venture ; not wishing to trample knowingly on their minister 's rights , lest their consciences should upbraid them , or their neighbors reproach , they have neither wished to understand these rights themselves , nor encouraged others in the investigations , lest the knowledge of them in the community should excite a prejudice against their course , threatening their defeat . But // we would fain hope that the number of such has been small . We have , however , ventured to speak thus ; for , from the present state of our churches , and the mode of treatment which ministers too frequently receive , one of two things is undeniably certain ; either there is great ignorance respecting their rights and privileges , or there is the most reckless , cold-hearted disregard of them by a portion of professing Christians . Hence , we believe it is a duty which the members of our churches owe to God , to the community , to their own souls and the souls of others , to rise above these selfish views and petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pastor a matter of thorough and prayerful study . It is indeed a duty of immense importance ; and if one is reluctant to engage in its examination , he ought , before God , solemnly to ask himself why he is so . Certainly , every one should be willing to know his own place in the church , and cheerfully occupy it ; also to know his minister 's rights and immunities , and gladly concede them . Ignorance on these subjects can not be excusable ; perversity is highly criminal and soul-destroying . But what are the appropriate Gospel grounds of this parochial cooperation ? Though there are apparently two parties , the minister and his people , the divinely appointed teacher and the taught , the shepherd and his flock , yet they sustain reciprocal relations so intimate and endearing ; though each enjoys independent rights , yet out of these arise respective duties , so imperatively binding on each , that the clear apprehension and faithful performance of them constitute , if not a strict identity , yet a virtual unity . We should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space remaining only for the brief consideration of a ' single one of them . This , however , is fundamental , a strict regard to which will guarantee a regard to all the others . It may be formall*y stated thus : - The relation 6et*een a pastor and his church *s one of identity of end and interest . This mutual end and interest is the glory of God in the salvation of the soul . This is the central object of the Gospel minister ; if he have any other it is but an eradiation from this . His mission is purely spiritual , referring to the soul and to immortality . It is of the utmost importance that both ministers and churches have clear and decided views on this point . " Pastors , " says Paul , " watch for souls as they that must give account . " This shows that the minister 's work , distinctively considered , relates entirely to the spiritual interests of menthat he is to labor for the soul , with the judgment and eternity in view ; not the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which is to come are the appropriate , the special , matters of his concern . The question before him is , How will my work be regarded at the last tribunal ? how shall I and my people be received there ? Paul also declares his purpose of preac in " I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified . " The Great Sacrifice for sin , the Cross , he would hold up ; he would endeavor to produce , by Gospel means , the same effects on the soul that the blood of Christ , applied by the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost , is designed to produce . He had before him ultimately the same end that Christ had in coming from heaven and dying on the cross . This , viewed in its central point , was expressed by John the Baptist in describing , by a single stroke , the character and work of him whose coming he proclaimed . " Behold the iLamb of God , which taketh away the sin of the world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where alone it exists . Christ 's object then , in one word , was the purification of the soul , its reconciliation to God , its salvation from woe , and exaltation to heaven . The specific object of the minister must be the same ; it is to bring men into a state of reconciliation to God . Repentance , rectification of heart , was the primary and governing theme of Christ 's preaching ; so of his great forerunner ; so of the Apostles . All their instruction was aimed at the central , ruling principle in man , that from which all voluntary conduct proceeds . They never inculcated practical duties except as resulting from repentance , as flowing from love to God , from a renewed heart . The heart and conscience were their field of action , knowing that in a voluntary being everything is dependent on this . It was around this tap-rqot of the tree of righteousness they mainly wrought . There they dug , and enriched , and watered , just as every cultivator of trees or grain gives his chief care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nutritious earth , the body and branches will grow of course , the golden ear will be sure to shoot forth . In imitation of Christ and his Apostles , the chief object of every Gospel-minister is to plant the germ of holiness in the soul and cultivate it , confidant that it will bear fruit as sure as the tongue and hand obey the mandates of the will . Here , then , is the great theatre of the minister 's labors , the heart and conscience  --  to quicken these , and to stimulate to Christian action through them . It is to make the heart holy , and thereby the life holy . It is to make men like Jesus Christ in affection , that they may be like him in moral conduct , and finally fit for joint beirship with him to the glorious inheritance at his Father 's right hand . It is to make men the holy worshipers of // God ; particularly to render those committed to his charge an assembly breathing forth , from Sabbath to Sabbath , the true praises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout forth the rapturous ilosannas of the heavenly temple . Again ; the mission of the Gospel ministry Christ himself declares to be virtually the same as his own . He said to his disciples , " As my Father hath sent me , even so send I you . " They were to go forth into the same world of sin to complete what he had begun , or had prepared the way for doing . As lie came to destroy sin , they were to labor for sin 's destruction . They were to adopt his principles and method of acting . As he attacked sin primarily in the heart , they must attack it primarily there . As he endeavored first of all to kindle the flame of holiness at the seat of life , they must make it their first object to kindle there the same flame . When , therefore , we have ascertained the distinctive mission of Christ to our earth , we have ascertained the distinctive end and aim of the Christian ministry ; the grand design of the former describing the orbit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declares , that " God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself . " This evinces the ultimate end of Christ 's mission . It was the reconciliation of men to God . The same must be the ultimate end of the Christian ministry ; hence it is called " the ministry of reconciliation . " It is to beseech men to submit to their rightful Sovereign . It is to change from a state of rebellion to obedience , from a course of sin to holiness . Christ did not come to inculcate directly external morality , nor to promote immediately any worldly advantage , to encourage agriculture , manufactures , or commerce , nor to establish schools for secular education , nor to found civil institutions , nor to devise and carry forward any political measures for the melioration of society . He never meddled with such things , always studiously avoiding them ; saying to one who desired his assistance in dividing the inheritance with his brother , " Who made me a judge and a divider over you ? " And when another adroitly endeavored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Render unto C*esar the things that are C*nsar 's , and unto God the things that are God 's . " True , these secular objects are all encouraged and promoted by the indirect influences of the Gospel , for the Gospel has such vital energy that it inevitably breathes the breath of life into whatever it touches , like the bones of Elisha , even making the dead to revive ; but these secular objects were not its primary aim . That was to save the soul of the guilty , to wash out the stain of sin , to correct the individual life , and reform the world // through the rectification of the personal conscience and will . Hence , as imitators of Christ , the salvation of the soul , the spiritual interest of the world , the fitting men by personal holiness for the bosom of God , is the peculiar , appropriate mission of the Gospel-minister , " commending himself to every man 's conscience in the sight of God . " The same in spirit is the design of the Church as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in Christ united in covenant for mutual edification and combination of influence  --  to carry out the design of Christ 's death in their . own souls and the souls of others . The design of the Church must be identical with that of Christ , as she is represented as a p art of Christ , as members of the body of which he is the head ; as being one with him ; he is the foundation , " the chief corner-stone-in whom all the building fitly framed together , *roweth into a holy temple in the Lord ; in whom " the Church is " builded together , for a habitation of God through the Spirit . " The Church is likewise called the ground and pillar of the truth , of which Christ is the sum and essence . Christians are also so designated , because they are followers of Christ ; and to be the follower of one in philosophy or religion , is to adopt his principles , purposes , measures , designs . Hence , the object of the Church is purely spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and salvation from woe ; it has reference to God , to the judgment , and to the retributions of eternity . This must be the aim and spirit of every act and measure of the Church as such . It is to imbibe the spirit of Christ and diffuse it  --  to become holy and promote holiness ; her sphere is the soul . Says Christ , " My kingdom is not of this world . " The Church is not a combination for mutual aid in prosecuting the objects of wealth , or honor , or the securing of domestic peace , nor for educational or political purposes . All she asks of civil government is sufferance and protection . She is a kingdom within a kingdom . The empire where she holds sway is the conscience and will , there diffusing her heaven , which is destined to spread and work till the world shall feel her regenerating power . That the work and object of the Church are purely spiritual is also evident from the fact that the Holy Ghost is peculiarly promised to guide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciples merely as ministers , but as Christ 's followers . The Holy Ghost is also said to dwell in God 's people , giving wisdom and strength , working with , and by them . But the principal office of the Third Person in the Trinity is to apply atoning blood to the soul ; to spread the kingdom of // Christ over the world , through the moral faculties of the individual man . Besides , the spirit , in new-moulding man , can work nowhere else than on the heart ; his office being to implant holiness , and holiness can be implanted only in the heart . Now if these things are so , and if the Holy Ghost works with God 's people , directing and energizing them in their mission , and he works only on the heart , that must be the sphere of their distinctive work , and their mission in our world must be spiritual . The character and object of the Ministry also proves the same thing . The Church could consistently have no other object in choosing a leader than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was specifically organized . It could not be to aid her in effecting political schemes or promoting purposes of worldly interest or aggrandizement , the Church not being organized for these objects . We have other organizations for such purposes , and men to administer them . The Pastor 's vocation , as has been said , is to fit men for heaven through the sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth . This , therefore , must be the leading object of the Church ; otherwise , there will be diversity or opposition between a body and her p residing officer voluntarily chosen . The character of the Ministry then determines the character of the Church ; if the end of the former is spiritual , the end of the latter is also spiritual . Hence , by the way , the motive of a Church in choosing a Pastor , as every right-minded man will decide , must be entirely spiritual . The desire should be to secure a man who will help them , their children , their neighbors , on to heaven ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be such as to promote vital piety ; to show his hearers their hearts , their sins , their entire moral helplessness ; to lead them to Christ as the only Saviour , to his blood as the only ground of justification . Worldly , selfish motives in this solemn act are little less than sacrilege . Indeed , it would be worse than lifting a tool upon the stones of the altar ; it would be laying them with hands dripping with the corruption of the depraved heart . And could incense from such an altar be accepted by the Father of light and purity ? No ; spiritual motives alone accord with the character of the Minister and with the character of the choosing Church ; a common-sense sentiment floating in every scripturally enlightened community , corroborating the evidence of the high , unworldly aim of both . Thus it may be proved that there is a perfect identity of object and interest between the Pastor and his flock ; both are // professedly striving for the same object , speeding to the same goal . Both are co-working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ designed to accomplish by his sacrifice and death . The Christian seeks purification from sin , and perfection in holiness . The Pastor is appointed to assist him in attaining these highest ends of his being . The Christian desires to break off his sins by repentance . The Pastor 's office is to urge him to this work . The Christian desires to be conformed to Christ , and non - conformed to the world . The Pastor 's work is to incite his sluggish powers to seek more earnestly this greatest good . The Christian desires the conversion of sinners , the reformation of the vicious . The Minister labors and spends his strength for the same . Thus there is a perfect identity of aim and object , just as between the patient and physician ; the one desiring health , and the other administering the healing potion . Besides , as both the Church and her Ministers are one in affection and design with Christ , their glorious Head , they must be one in affection and design with each other . Christ in them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a unity which death can not sunder , nor eternity 's years dissolve . The assertion , therefore , that Pastor and people constitute two parties , is not strictly true . They are really one , one in principle , one in purpose , one in interest . They are not two organizations , but parts of one organization ; like two wheels in one machine made to interlock and work harmoniously together , to secure a common result . This identity of object lies at the basis of all cooperation between Pastor and people . This must be the starting point . They must revolve around the cross . They must live in the circle of its attraction , of its light and heat . There they must grow up together . They must be men of one idea , salvation by the blood of Christ . They must be absorbed in their great work , the conversion of souls . Here their energies must be centtalized . This theme , with which all Christians can sympathize , must harmonize them . Filled with the purpose of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co. *iperate is sin ; the grossest inconsistency . Oh what inexpressible inconsistency ! It is designedly to render abortive the labors of each other ; it is the consummate folly of defeating each his own end . It is like one 's conveying food to his mouth with the one hand to preserve life , and wit u the other , poison to destroy it . It is hiring one to do you service , and then cutting off his hands to render service impossible ; or to cultivate one 's fields with care , then turning in herds to waste the crop ; it is arraying the members of the body against each other . // Such being the basis of this parochial cooperation , is it not scriptural ? Are there not the strongest reasons for it ? Let Pastor and people then fix their eyes on the Lamb of God as " the sight that charms them mQst . " Let them severally resolve , " My absorbing aim shall be the cleansing of this polluted world through the blood of atonement ; I will be satisffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the purification of the soul . " Let this exalted purpose become mutually the central , governing thought of lit* , animating their zeal , and guiding their actions , binding them to this course with talismanic power , and the Churches can but exert a precious influence ; an influence falling like the dew on withering herbage , and planting trees of righteousness over this moral desert . Thus the Church of Christ , the covenanted band of his followers , pledged to be entirely consecrated to Father , Son , and Holy Ghost , co*5perating with her Pastors , and working at the seat of moral action , is a silent , unobtrusive , yet tremendous engine of power to destroy the fruits of sin . Christ , who knew what was in man , knew how to construct it , and where to place it ; and he laid it on the main-spring of human nature-the heart , so that by moving that , it moves the mass . It is the leaven hid in three measures of meal , which will leaven the whole ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is as sure to affect its object as are the ordinances of heaven . It is like the explosive substance placed in the centre of the rock to rive it . It is a power fomenting beneath the mountains of sin which disfigure our world , and will eventually splinter.them into fragments , and spread over the places wher*e they frown the beauties of Paradise .
